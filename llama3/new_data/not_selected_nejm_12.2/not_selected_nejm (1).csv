NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,29,nejm-case-2019-29,A 14-Month-Old Boy with Vomiting,"Dr. Batul Kaj: A 14-month-old boy was evaluated in the pediatric gastroenterology clinic of this hospital because of vomiting. The patient was born at another hospital to a 35-year-old mother by cesarean section because of arrest of the second stage of labor after an uncomplicated gestation of 39 weeks 6 days. At delivery, meconium was present. The 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores were both 9, and the birth weight was 2.9 kg (23rd percentile) (Fig. 1). Breast-feeding was initiated. The results of newborn blood-spot screening tests (a panel of tests for multiple congenital diseases, primarily inborn errors of metabolism) and screening tests for hearing ability and critical congenital heart disease were normal, and the patient was discharged home on the fourth day of life. At a routine pediatric examination when the patient was 14 days of age, the patient’s mother reported that she had been breast-feeding him for 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours and that he was having yellow, seedy stools after each feeding. The weight was 2.7 kg. The patient’s mother was advised to begin pumping breast milk and fortifying it with a cow’s milk–based infant formula to achieve a caloric content of 0.74 kcal per milliliter. Eight days later, the weight was 2.8 kg, and fortification to 0.81 kcal per milliliter was recommended. At 26 days of age, the patient vomited a small amount of clotted blood, and his parents took him to the emergency department at another hospital. They reported that the baby had begun having frequent nonprojectile, nonbloody, nonbilious “spit ups” after the initiation of formula-fortified expressed breast milk. The physical examination was normal. A test of the stool was positive for occult blood. The patient was monitored overnight; he had no recurrent hematemesis and was discharged home the next day. At a follow-up visit with the pediatrician 9 days later, the weight was 2.8 kg, and the patient was referred to a pediatric gastroen-terologist at this hospital. The patient was seen in the pediatric gastro-enterology clinic when he was 37 days of age. His mother reported that he had been consuming 60 ml of formula-fortified expressed breast milk every 2.5 hours. He had continued to have occasional small-volume emesis after feedings, but no additional episodes of hematemesis had occurred. Bowel movements had occurred after each feeding, and the stools were brown-green without visible blood or mucus. On examination, the infant was active and had a strong cry. The weight was 2.8 kg (<1st percentile), and the height was 55 cm (31st percentile). The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, with normal bowel sounds. Rectal examination revealed guaiac-positive, brown stool; the remainder of the examination was normal. A clinical diagnosis of allergy to cow’s milk protein was made, and a hypoallergenic formula with a caloric content of 0.81 kcal per milliliter was recommended. At a follow-up visit at the pediatric gastroen-terology clinic 3 weeks later, when the patient was 58 days of age, the patient’s mother reported that the frequency of emesis had decreased and that stools had occasionally contained mucus but no blood. She reported that the baby had had nasal congestion and that she could hear a “gurgling” sound during bottle-feeding. On examination, the weight was 3.6 kg. Rectal examination revealed soft, guaiac-positive stool with mucus; the remainder of the examination was normal. Transition to an amino acid–based formula (also known as an elemental formula) with a caloric content of 0.81 kcal per milliliter was recommended. Eight weeks later, when the patient was 16 weeks of age, he was brought back to the pediatric gastroenterology clinic because, during the preceding week, he had had several episodes of small-volume emesis with the vomitus containing dark-brown material that his parents thought resembled blood. The weight was 4.6 kg; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. Omeprazole was prescribed for the treatment of possible gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and preparation of the elemental formula to a caloric content of 0.88 kcal per milliliter was recommended. At a follow-up visit at the pediatric gastroen-terology clinic 2 months later, when the patient was 6 months of age, his parents reported that he had seemed uncomfortable during feedings and had appeared to be increasingly hungry. The frequency of emesis had increased; he had been vomiting formula after approximately 75% of feedings. The weight was 6.2 kg; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. The dose of omeprazole was adjusted for the patient’s current weight, and the introduction of age-appropriate, dairy-free solid foods into his diet was recommended. One month later, when the patient was 7 months of age, his parents reported that he had continued to gain weight and that he had had no complications when they introduced soft foods, including cooked carrots, avocados, and bananas, into his diet. There had been no visible blood in the vomitus, and stools had appeared normal in color. Cow’s milk protein was slowly reintroduced into his diet; he had no negative consequences, and treatment with omeprazole was discontinued. Six months later, when the patient was 13 months of age, his mother called the pediatric gastroenterologist and reported that the frequency of vomiting had increased. Omeprazole was prescribed. At a follow-up visit in the pediatric gastroenterology clinic 5 weeks later, the patient’s mother reported that she had stopped administering omeprazole to the patient after 2 weeks because it seemed not to have any effect. Immediately after eating each meal, the patient had appeared uncomfortable, retched, and then vomited; at times, he had inserted his fingers into his mouth and appeared to induce vomiting. The vomitus often contained nearly everything the patient had just eaten, typically resembling his undigested food, without blood or bile. Emesis had occurred usually after consumption of pureed and solid foods and less frequently after consumption of milk. Shortly after vomiting, the patient usually requested more milk or food. Review of recent dietary records showed that the patient ate nearly every 30 minutes throughout the day, with typical meals including whole milk, a spoonful of oatmeal or banana, and rice puffs. Bowel movements occurred regularly twice per day; stools remained soft and did not contain visible blood or mucus. The patient had met normal developmental milestones, and immunizations were up to date. At the 1-year health supervision visit with his pediatrician, the blood levels of hemoglobin and lead were normal. The patient had been receiving a vitamin D supplement and had no known medication allergies. He lived with his parents in an urban area of New England. His mother had anemia, and his father and younger sister were healthy. A maternal aunt had hyperthyroidism, his maternal grandmother had pancreatitis, and his maternal grandfather had hypertension. On examination, the patient was active and appeared well. The weight was 6.9 kg. The abdomen was soft, with normal bowel sounds and without distention or tenderness. Rectal examination revealed guaiac-negative stool. The remainder of the examination was normal. The complete blood count and differential count were normal, as was the blood level of IgE antibodies to cow’s milk. Diagnostic studies were performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2009,29,nejm-case-2009-29,"An 81-Year-Old Man with Weight Loss, Odynophagia, and Failure to Thrive","Dr. Jenica N. Upshaw (Medicine): An 81-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of cough, weight loss, odynophagia, and failure to thrive. The patient had been in his usual state of health, with diabetes mellitus, until approximately 15 months earlier, when intermittent cough developed and he gradually began to lose weight. Seven months before admission, he lost his job, after which his oral intake decreased and his family noted that he appeared depressed and slept most of each day. During the next 2 months, his cough increased and was productive of dark-yellow sputum. Five months before the current admission, he was admitted to this hospital because of episodes of dizziness and falling associated with hypoglycemia and dehydration. At that time, the patient reported weight loss of approximately 23 kg during the previous year. He had had type 2 diabetes mellitus for more than 20 years and had been admitted to this hospital for the first time 9 months earlier for an episode of hypoglycemia, which responded to the administration of intravenous glucose and adjustment of his insulin dose. He had hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hyper-lipidemia, and thyroid nodules. He had been given a diagnosis of pulmonary asbes-tosis and had a history of exposure to asbestos from his work in a shipyard during his teens, characterized by pleural plaques and pulmonary fibrosis, which had been asymptomatic. He had no known allergies to medications. Medications on admission included insulin, aspirin, valsartan, atorvastatin, metoprolol, and a multivitamin. He was born and raised in an urban area in Massachusetts, lived with his wife, and had worked in sales. He had smoked heavily until the diagnosis of diabetes; he did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. A son had died from lymphoma at 51 years of age. On examination 5 months before the current admission, the patient was thin, with temporal wasting, and appeared tired. The weight was 58.4 kg, the temperature 35.9°C, the blood pressure 113/56 mm Hg, the pulse 61 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 91% while he was breathing 2 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula. The mucous membranes were dry, the tongue had a white coating, and jugular venous pulsations measured 1 cm of water. A grade 2/6 systolic murmur was heard throughout the pre-cordium, and there were dry crackles at the bases of the lungs, with no dullness, wheezes, or rhon-chi. The fingernails and toenails were long and soiled; the remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph revealed pleural calcifications and plaques and diffuse, bilateral peripheral reticular opacities, more prominent in the lower lobes. These features were thought to be consistent with asbestosis and pulmonary fibrosis and were unchanged from previous examinations. Electrocardiographic findings were normal. Intravenous fluids and glucose, subcutaneous heparin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin were administered, and the dose of insulin was adjusted. Valsartan was stopped, and the other medications were continued. On the third day, hypoxemia and hypotension developed. Arterial blood gas analysis while the patient was breathing 100% oxygen showed a pH of 7.38; the partial pressure of carbon dioxide was 35 mm Hg, and the partial pressure of oxygen 72 mm Hg. A chest radiograph showed new bilateral pulmonary opacities, which were thought to represent multifocal pneumonia or edema. Computed tomographic (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis after the administration of contrast material showed multiple patchy ground-glass opacities and consolidation in gravity-dependent areas of the lungs and mild pulmonary edema. The CT scans also showed chronic lung and pleural changes that were consistent with asbes-tosis, thyroid nodules, and mediastinal lymphade-nopathy, all of which had been present on previous examinations. Treatment with broad-spectrum antibacterial agents and continuous positive airway pressure was given and led to improvement. Despite an extensive evaluation, no pathogen was identified. During this hospitalization, intermittent episodes of hypoxemia occurred that were self-limiting. Combined positron-emission tomography and CT, with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed pleural plaques, calcifications, and other changes consistent with asbestosis but no evidence of abnormal FDG uptake. He was discharged to a rehabilitation facility after 17 days. Approximately 2 months before this admission, he was discharged to his home from the rehabilitation facility. While at home, the patient did not resume his previous activities. His family noted a progressive decline in his appetite and increasing weakness and brought him to the emergency department. He stated that his weight had been approximately 84 kg before this illness. He reported anorexia and difficulty swallowing solids but not liquids or soft foods, with frequent regurgitation and episodes of food sticking in his throat; he pointed to a site of obstruction in his throat. On examination, he appeared cachectic. The weight was 49.6 kg, the temperature 36.6°C, the blood pressure 87/45 mm Hg, the pulse 69 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The mucous membranes were dry, white plaques were present on the oral mucosa, skin turgor was decreased, and there were crackles at both lung bases. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph was unchanged. Intravenous fluids were administered. Oral nystatin was begun, and he was admitted. A barium-swallow examination showed a normal swallowing mechanism; an abnormal mu-cosal pattern of the esophagus, with multiple reticulations and a cobblestone appearance; and longitudinal muscular hypertrophy. Later that day, upper gastrointestinal endoscopic examination was attempted but was obscured by barium. On the fourth day, CT of the neck and thorax after the administration of contrast material revealed a hypodensity in the right thyroid gland, a mildly patulous oropharynx and hypopharynx, thickening and irregularity of the esophagus, right hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy up to 2.1 cm in diameter, multiple small and low-attenuation lesions in the liver, perihepatic ascites, and circumferential thickening of the gallbladder wall. The next day, the temperature rose to 38.0°C. Specimens of blood, urine, and sputum were cultured. On the sixth day, esophagogastroduo-denoscopy revealed diffuse white esophageal plaques. The administration of fluconazole was begun. The following day, the temperature rose to 38.4°C and the weight was 52.6 kg. Ultrasonog-raphy of the thyroid revealed a multinodular gland. On the ninth hospital day, CT of the abdomen revealed the pleural findings seen previously, at least four solid hepatic lesions (up to 2.9 cm in diameter), and hypodensities in segment 8 that were thought to represent thrombosed intrahe-",{},Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and advanced AIDS. ,,Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and advanced AIDS. ,0
NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2017,37,nejm-case-2017-37,A 36-Year-Old Man with Unintentional Opioid Overdose,"Dr. Alister M. Martin (Emergency Medicine): A 36-year-old man with opioid-use disorder was seen in the emergency department of this hospital during the winter because of opioid overdose. Approximately 4 years before this evaluation, the patient had undergone an unspecified hand surgery. Immediately after the procedure, hydromorphone was administered. After the patient was discharged home, he initially sought out more prescription opioids and then switched to intravenous heroin because he found it to be less expensive and more easily obtained. During the next 3 years, he injected 1 to 2 g of heroin each day. One year before this evaluation, after the patient lost his job, he attempted to quit using heroin. He began to take methadone, which helped to reduce withdrawal symptoms and cravings, but he stopped taking it after 10 days because he was concerned that weaning off methadone after a period of maintenance treatment would be associated with unacceptable adverse effects. He then resumed heroin use. Six months before this evaluation, the patient again stopped using heroin and was admitted to an inpatient, medically supervised detoxification program for management of withdrawal symptoms. After 2 weeks, he was discharged home. Approximately 2 months before this evaluation, the patient was released from jail and was admitted to a structured residential rehabilitation program, in which he participated in work therapy, attended regular Narcotics Anonymous meetings, and underwent random, intermittent urine toxicology screenings. He continued in this program and abstained from opioid use until 3 days before this evaluation, when he resumed intravenous heroin use. He obtained the drug, which he believed to be mixed with fentanyl, from a single dealer and began to inject 0.5 g at a time using clean needles and cotton filters. On the day of this evaluation, the patient injected 0.5 g at 10 a.m., followed by another 0.5 g at approximately 1:30 p.m.; he remembered subsequently walking around a park and placing a phone call to a friend to arrange a meeting. At 2:44 p.m. on the day of this evaluation, emergency medical services personnel were dispatched to the park, where the patient was found lying on the ground in a puddle of slush. He was unresponsive. The patient’s friend was present and reported that when he had found the patient, he had administered intranasal naloxone and then called for emergency medical assistance. First responders from the fire department had administered a second dose of intranasal naloxone before emergency medical services personnel arrived. On examination, the patient appeared cyanotic, and he had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3 (on a scale ranging from 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating lower levels of consciousness). The temperature was 35.6°C, the pulse 88 beats per minute, the blood pressure 122/76 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 4 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 80% while he was breathing ambient air. He had pinpoint pupils and shallow breathing. An oropharyngeal airway was placed, and positive-pressure ventilation was initiated with the use of a bag–valve–mask device. The blood glucose level, obtained by fingerstick testing, was 164 mg per deciliter (9.1 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). Several minutes later, the patient woke up, removed the oropharyngeal airway, and was noted to be alert and oriented, with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. Oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute, and the patient was transported by ambulance to the emergency department of this hospital. In the emergency department, the patient reported that the overdose was unintentional, that he had never had an overdose before, that this incident was a “wake-up call,” and that he wanted help with managing his opioid addiction. He had been feeling sad after the recent deaths of his mother and grandmother, and he thought that his relapse in opioid use might have been related to these stressors. He had no history of other medical conditions, took no medications, and had no known allergies. He was a high-school graduate and had worked as an electrician before he became unemployed. He was single and had no children. He had smoked a half-pack of cigarettes daily for the past 4 years and had smoked marijuana when he was younger. He did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs other than heroin. There was no fam-ily history of depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, dementia, or suicide. On examination, the patient was alert and fully oriented. His clothes were wet. The temperature was 35.9°C, the pulse 84 beats per minute, the blood pressure 115/69 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while he was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. There were scattered focal crackles in the lungs, and the remainder of the examination was normal. The hemoglobin level, hematocrit, white-cell count, differential count, platelet count, and red-cell indexes were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, the anion gap, and results of renal-function tests. The blood glucose level was 165 mg per deciliter (9.2 mmol per liter). Venous blood gas measurements, which were obtained while the patient was breathing oxygen through a nasal can-nula at a rate of 6 liters per minute, included a pH of 7.29 (reference range, 7.30 to 7.40), a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 68 mm Hg (reference range, 38 to 50), a partial pressure of oxygen of less than 28 mm Hg (reference range, 35 to 50), a bicarbonate level of 32 mmol per liter (reference range, 24 to 30), and a base excess of 2.6 mmol per liter (reference range, 0 to 3.0). An electrocardiogram showed nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities and was otherwise normal. Dr. Efrén J. Flores: A portable anteroposterior radiograph of the chest (Fig. 1) revealed cephali-zation of the pulmonary vasculature and fluid in the minor fissure, findings consistent with interstitial pulmonary edema. There were also bilateral nodular and patchy airspace opacities, findings that suggested superimposed aspiration. Dr. Martin: A diagnosis and management decisions were made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2008,04,nejm-case-2008-04,A 33-Year-Old Pregnant Woman with Swelling of the Left Breast and Shortness of Breath,"A 33-year-old pregnant woman was admitted to the hospital at 30.7 weeks’ gestation because of swelling of the left breast, shortness of breath, and tachycardia. The patient had received prenatal care at this hospital since 9.7 weeks’ gestation. The blood type was O Rh-positive and the woman was immune to rubella. Test results for hepatitis B surface antigen, chlamydia and gonorrhea infection, rapid plasma reagin, cystic fibrosis–carrier status, and fetal aneuploidy were negative, and quadruple-marker screening confirmed low risks for fetal aneuploidy and neural-tube defects. At 18.6 weeks’ gestation, ultrasonographic examination revealed normal fetal anatomy and growth. Other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Four weeks before admission, at 26.1 weeks’ gestation, the patient noted swelling of the left breast. Examination by a certified nurse practitioner revealed an approximately 2-cm area of thickening in the upper outer quadrant. Follow-up with the patient’s obstetrician was scheduled. Two weeks later, 18 days before admission, the patient returned to the prenatal clinic because of marked increase in swelling of the breast during the preceding 2 to 3 days, associated with moderate pain. She did not have fever, discharge from the nipple, or respiratory symptoms. An area of fullness, 6 cm by 8 cm, was palpated in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. Ultrasonography of the breast performed the next day revealed edema with mild skin thickening; increased blood flow was seen on color Doppler imaging. Mammography showed enlargement of the left breast in comparison with the right, diffusely increased tissue density and heterogeneity, and no suspicious microcalcifications, masses, or architectural distortions. The patient was referred to a breast surgeon later that day. She described pain and heaviness of the left breast, for which she wore a brassiere 24 hours a day. On examination by the surgeon, there was no supraclavicular or axillary lymphade-nopathy; the left breast was larger than the right, with slight erythema in the dependent portion, but no discrete mass. Cephalexin and oxycodone were prescribed. Three days later, at a prenatal clinic follow-up, the patient reported that the pain and swelling were the same or were reduced slightly. The left breast was unchanged in size. Laboratory tests were performed, and results are shown in Table 1. A specimen of blood was sent for laboratory culture, and the results were negative. The patient was referred to the breast clinic the same day; however, she left without being seen. One week before admission, she returned for follow-up in the prenatal clinic. She was anxious and expressed concern about a possible diagnosis of cancer. On examination, the fetus was active; there was an ecchymosis overlying the swelling in the left breast. The patient was counseled regarding the importance of a tissue diagnosis. Three days later, a core biopsy of the left breast was performed under ultrasonographic guidance. Over the course of the next 4 days, a nonproductive cough, shortness of breath with exertion, orthopnea, and swelling and tenderness of the right breast developed. The patient attributed the respiratory symptoms to allergies and self-administered loratadine; the symptoms did not improve, and she returned to the prenatal clinic. She had not had fever, chills, dysuria, hema-turia, or hematochezia, and fetal movements had been normal. On physical examination at this visit the blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg, the pulse 156 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was admitted to the hospital. This was the patient’s second pregnancy. She had delivered her firstborn at full term by cesarean section because of breech presentation, without complications. Papanicolaou smears of the cervix had shown atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, without evidence of human papillomavirus, on two occasions in the past year. She had anemia and sciatica with this pregnancy. She was allergic to penicillin. Medications included iron supplements, multiple vitamins with folate, and oxycodone. The patient was married and lived with her husband and child. She did not smoke or drink alcohol. Her father had coronary atherosclerosis and hypertension, two cousins had cystic fibrosis, and her mother, sibling, and child were healthy. There was no family history of cancer. On examination, the patient appeared anxious. The temperature was 37.9°C, the pulse 157 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 137/80 mm Hg; the respirations were 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation was 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. There was an anterior cervical lymph node 5 mm in diameter and no other signs of lymphadenopathy. The left jugular vein was distended nearly to the angle of the jaw. Both breasts were mildly tender, markedly enlarged, and firm, the left more so than the right. Ecchymoses were present in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast; there was no increased warmth, stippling, or retraction of the skin. The uterus was of appropriate size for gestational date, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Results of laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia. A contrast-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) angiogram of the chest performed to evaluate for pulmonary emboli showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus. A large anterior mediastinal mass, 5.1 cm by 13.7 cm, extended from the superior mediastinum along the right heart border to the level of the diaphragm. It encased and compressed adjacent vasculature, without obstruction. There was a right paracardiac lymph node, 2.0 cm by 2.5 cm, and a left axillary lymph node 1.6 cm in diameter. The breasts were asymmetric, the left larger than the right. There were no pulmonary nodules or consolidation, and the visualized portions of the upper abdomen were normal. A test result was received.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,33,nejm-case-2010-33,A 22-Year-Old Woman with Blurred Vision and Renal Failure,"Dr. Meghan E. Sise (Medicine): A 22-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of blurred vision and renal failure. The patient had been well until 1 week before admission, when she noted blurred vision in her right eye. The next day, she met with her primary care physician, who referred her to an ophthalmologist at another facility. She was told she had “retinal inflammation” and was referred to a retina specialist, whom she saw the next day, 5 days before admission. She reported severe throbbing pain behind the right eye and redness of the eye; examination revealed conjunctival injection and posterior uveitis. Valacyclovir, leucovorin, prednisone, sulfadiazine, and pyrimeth-amine were prescribed for oral administration, and prednisolone and homatropine ophthalmic solution were prescribed for topical administration; she began all but pyrimethamine (not available at the pharmacy) that day. Laboratory studies were obtained the next day; a complete blood count was normal, and a rapid plasma reagin test was nonreactive. Other test results were pending. During the next several days, she noted that the color of her urine darkened. One day before admission, she returned to the retina specialist. The results of tests performed 3 days earlier included a normal serum level of angiotensin-converting enzyme and normal serum protein electrophoresis; tests for antinuclear antibody, antibodies to double-stranded DNA, lupus anticoagulant, and antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi were negative. She was referred to the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, and her appointment was scheduled for the next day; that afternoon, she began taking pyrimethamine, which had become available. On the morning of admission, the patient awoke with nausea, vomited several times, and was unable to take her oral medications. Colicky pain developed in the left lower quadrant and flank, which resolved spontaneously but was followed by pain in the right lower quadrant that radiated to the groin. She noted decreased urine output. On evaluation later that day at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, the patient reported pain in the right eye, rated at 3 on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. Two weeks earlier, she had had an influenza-like illness for 2 days, with sweats, chills, headache, and myalgias, which resolved, and no fever, sore throat, cough, diarrhea, headache, rash, photosensitivity, or float-ers. She had a history of oxycodone addiction, for which she took methadone. She initially reported no illicit intravenous drug use; however, when she was questioned when family members were not in the room, she reported that she had used heroin on one occasion 1 month before admission. During the preceding 5 months, she had lost 15.9 kg (35 lb) intentionally. Her last menstrual period was 2 months earlier. She had no known allergies. She was single and owned a cat. There was no history of foreign travel. There was a family history of diabetes. On examination, visual acuity in the patient’s right eye was restricted to her counting fingers held at a distance of 0.3 m (1 ft); it did not improve with pinhole testing. The intraocular pressure was 11 mm Hg. The eyelids were normal. There was trace subconjunctival hemorrhage nasally. The cornea was normal; the anterior chamber had trace cells but no hypopyon (i.e., layer of white cells). The iris and lens were normal. On funduscopic examination, there were vitreous opacities obscuring the posterior pole of the eye. The view of the disk was poor. Yellow-white changes were present in the retina. There was subretinal fluid inferiorly and in the macular area. The examination of the left eye and extra-ocular movements of both eyes were normal. Vitrectomy was scheduled; when results of laboratory tests became available later that day (Table 1), the patient was called and instructed to go to the emergency department at this hospital. On examination in the emergency department, the patient was alert and in no acute distress. The temperature was 37.1°C, the blood pressure 140/81 mm Hg, the pulse 111 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. There was no rash. Examination of the lungs and heart was normal. The abdomen was soft, with mild tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant, without guarding or rebound. There was mild tenderness at the costovertebral angle. Pelvic examination was normal, with no pain on cervical motion or on palpation of the adnexa. Serum levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, lipase, and amylase were normal, as were tests of liver function. A urine pregnancy test and cervical tests for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis were negative; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Specimens of blood and urine were cultured. Renal ultra-sonography revealed that the right kidney was 11.2 cm in length and the left kidney 11.1 cm, with normal parenchyma and no hydronephrosis or masses. Transthoracic echocardiography was normal, with no valvular vegetations. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and diagnostic procedures were performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2011,08,nejm-case-2011-08,A 32-Year-Old Woman with Seizures and Cognitive Decline,"A 32-year-old woman was seen in the neurogenetics clinic at this hospital because of seizures and cognitive decline. Absence seizures (staring spells) had reportedly begun when the patient was approximately 5 years of age, and atonic seizures (sudden loss of muscle tone resulting in dropping of the head and falling to the floor) had begun during adolescence. She briefly received an unknown medication for atonic seizures in childhood. When she was in her mid-20s, she began to have frequent episodic tremors at rest that worsened with action, occasional ballistic (sudden and jerking) movement of the arms, slowed speech, progressive difficulties with memory, and diminished reading comprehension, concentration, and sequence recall. At the age of 28 years, generalized tonic–clonic seizures lasting 1 to 15 minutes developed and increased in frequency, occasionally requiring hospitalization. Anticonvulsants were administered. When the patient was 29 years of age, after the onset of generalized seizures, 24-hour video electroencephalography (EEG) was performed at another institution. The results showed normal background and generalized high-voltage bursts of spike-wave and polyspike discharges at a rate of 3 per second. These discharges were more prominent with hyperventilation and photic stimulation, with a frequency of 1 to 2 per second. Her responses to a personality assessment inventory at that time were thought to indicate a high level of psychological distress and suggested an attempt to portray herself in a negative light; however, scores on scales that were sensitive to psychotic and paranoid thinking were more elevated than those on scales that were sensitive to depression, as is typically seen in a “cry for help” profile. When she was 31 years of age, neuropsychological testing showed weaknesses in the domains of language, attention, executive functioning, and memory. No tests of mood or personality were administered. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed elsewhere 8 months before this evaluation and was reportedly normal. On the initial visit to the neurogenetics clinic, the patient was accompanied by a family member who assisted with the history. The patient had had increasing myoclonic seizures during the preceding weeks. She had normal early development and average academic performance, and she attended college but did not graduate. She reported that she had a history of migraine headaches, occasional shortness of breath, nausea, weight fluctuations, depression for which she had been hospitalized, and a remote history of alcohol abuse. She lived with her partner of many years. She had taught art classes intermittently but was currently receiving disability payments. Psychoactive medications had included fluoxetine, risperidone, olanzapine, and donepezil. Current medications included levetiracetam, lorazepam, fluoxetine, zonisamide, phenobarbital, and olan-zapine, with zolpidem at night. She reported that she had smoked cigarettes heavily for 15 years, drank alcohol rarely, and did not use illicit drugs. Her father had seizures that began at 30 years of age, was hospitalized in a vegetative state for many years, and died at 48 years of age. Four of his siblings had intractable epilepsy, dementia, and early death. On examination, the patient was alert and oriented, with a flushed face. The blood pressure and pulse were normal. There were no dysmor-phic features, and the general physical examination was normal, with no cutaneous pigmented lesions, hepatosplenomegaly, or bone abnormalities. On neurologic examination, she followed all commands; she had slow, hesitant speech with occasional paraphasic errors, decreased attention and concentration, and deficits in short-term memory. Her ability to copy intersecting pentagons was mildly impaired. She reported pain with eye movements; and horizontal movements were full, ocular pursuit movements were smooth, and refixation was normal. Vertical eye movements were not full, and no retinal abnormalities were noted. Visual acuity was normal. Motor movements were initiated slowly. Tone was normal, without dystonia. There was no focal motor weakness, major sensory deficit, dysmetria, or ataxia. There was no tremor; there were occasional myoclonic jerks but no atonic postural loss. No overt seizures were noted. Three months later, a skin biopsy was performed; the pathological examination revealed no evidence of lysosomal storage disease. The results of selected genetic and metabolic tests were normal. During the next 18 months, the patient was followed by a neurologist near her home, and she returned to the neurogenetics clinic at regular intervals. She had headaches of increasing frequency and progressive cognitive decline, with slower mentation and increasing difficulties with short- and long-term memory. Despite the cognitive decline and extremely slow expressive language and processing, she continued to have a sense of humor. She had increasing seizure activity, with generalized tonic–clonic and atonic seizures, myoclonus and ataxia, and episodes of tremor. Her gait became shuffling, and decreasing mobility and balance made her wheelchair-dependent. She was hospitalized on several occasions because of frequent and intractable myoclonic seizures. Anticonvulsant medications during that period included lamotrigine, pyridox-ine, zonisamide, lorazepam, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, topiramate, donepezil hydrochloride, phenytoin, clobazam, and diazepam rectal gel. Smoking-cessation counseling was offered, but the patient declined. Eighteen months after her initial evaluation, cranial MRI revealed mild cerebral and cerebellar atrophy and mild periventricular hyperin-tensities on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, with normal magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance perfusion. Neuroophthalmologic examination showed no abnormalities. Neurologic examination showed stuttering speech, marked cogwheel rigidity, decreased rapid alternating movements, and mild dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing; no myoclo-nus was noted. An EEG was abnormal, showing generalized background slowing during brief wakefulness, as well as bifrontal spikes during sleep, without associated clinical symptoms. There were no electrographic seizures. One month later, while the patient was alone and smoking, her shirt caught fire, and she sustained second- and third-degree burns to her face, neck, chest, and shoulders, with an estimated 15% of the total body involved. She was taken to another hospital, where intravenous fluids and tetanus toxoid were administered, the trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was initiated. She was transferred to this hospital, where sedatives, anticonvulsants, glucocorticoids, magnesium, potassium, calcium, albumin, folate, thiamine, dalteparin, enteral nutrition, and inhaled ipratropium were administered. Topical wound care was provided, and skin grafting was per-formed. Pneumonia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus developed. On the 10th day, in consultation with the family and her partner, and in accordance with the previously expressed wishes of the patient, comfort measures only were instituted. Mechanical ventilation was discontinued, and the trachea was extubated. The patient died shortly thereafter. An autopsy was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,25,nejm-case-2010-25,A 24-Year-Old Woman with Abdominal Pain and Shock,"Dr. Franklin W. Huang (Medicine): A 24-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of abdominal pain, vomiting, ascites, and shock. The patient had been well until 9 days before admission, when fatigue, fevers, headache, and diffuse body aches developed, followed by a productive cough and vague pain in the abdomen and lower back. Three days before admission, nausea and vomiting developed, and oral intake decreased. Late in the evening of the next day, she was admitted to another hospital. On evaluation, she appeared tired and restless; the blood pressure was 98/58 mm Hg, the pulse 122 beats per minute, the temperature 36.7°C, and the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute. The abdomen was distended and diffusely tender, with normal bowel sounds; the remainder of the examination was normal. A rapid test for influenza was negative; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Intravenous crystalloid fluids were administered. During the next 3 hours, her abdominal pain increased (she rated it as 8 on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is the most severe), with increased abdominal distention and tenderness; ketorolac tromethamine was administered. A nasogastric tube was inserted, after which the hypotension worsened. She was admitted to the intensive care unit at the other hospital. Specimens of blood were sent for culture, and a central venous catheter was inserted; intravenous fluids and ertapenem were administered. Results on transthoracic echocardiography were normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis after the administration of intravenous contrast material showed a large amount of ascites, no bowel dilatation, and concentric wall thickening of a long segment of the distal small bowel. Numerous slightly enlarged, avidly enhancing lymph nodes were present at the root of the small-bowel mesentery and in the retroperitoneum. Exploratory laparotomy revealed ascites (3 liters), which was drained; nodular, hemorrhagic lesions in the mesentery; and two areas of necrotic small bowel. Biopsy specimens were obtained from the mesenteric lesions, and the necrotic bowel and appendix were resected. Gram-positive rods, thought to be contaminants, grew after less than 15 hours of incubation from two of two blood-culture bottles containing blood obtained on admission. Cultures of the ascites remained sterile. On the second day, hypotension and tachycardia persisted; hydroxyethyl starch was administered, and pressors were begun. The patient was transferred to this hospital. The patient reported feeling tired and short of breath and having abdominal pain. Six months earlier, while working on an organic farm, an edematous nodule had developed on her left posterior calf, which she attributed to an insect bite. The lesion was raised, warm, and tender and reached 4 cm in diameter despite a 10-day course of amoxicillin–clavulanate. Incision and drainage produced a large amount of seropurulent fluid. Gram’s staining revealed no organisms, and cultures were sterile. Ciprofloxacin was administered. The lesion reportedly drained gray fluid for several weeks; at follow-up 2 months before admission, it had resolved. The patient was taking an oral contraceptive. She had no allergies. She lived with her family, worked with children, and was active outdoors. She followed a vegan diet, drank alcohol infrequently, and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. She was not currently sexually active and reported no new foods, exposures, or travel beyond New England. There was a maternal family history of hypercoagulable disorders. On examination, the patient was alert and appeared uncomfortable. The blood pressure was 129/70 mm Hg (while she was on pressors), the pulse 147 beats per minute, the body temperature 37.3°C, the respiratory rate 35 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while she was breathing supplemental oxygen. On auscultation of the lungs, breath sounds were diminished in intensity. The abdomen was distended and diffusely tender, with a clean midline surgical excision. There was 2+ peripheral edema and a scar (1.5 cm in diameter) on the left calf. The remainder of the examination was normal. Testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed 2+ blood and trace protein, 20 to 50 red cells and 0 to 2 white cells per high-power field, and 20 to 100 hyaline casts per low-power field. A chest radiograph showed low lung volumes and layering of pleural effusions, and an abdominal radiograph showed no bowel obstruction or free air. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm at 156 beats per minute. She was admitted to the intensive care unit. During the first day, pressors, intravenous fluids, ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, vancomycin, doxycycline, and peramivir were administered. Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy developed (Table 1), requiring transfusions of red cells, fresh-frozen plasma, platelets, and cryoglobulin. A chest radiograph obtained 8 hours after arrival showed large, layering effusions. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a normal ejection fraction, no valvular vegetations, and findings consistent with right atrial volume overload and right ventricular systolic hypertension. Approximately 11 hours after the patient’s arrival, the trachea was intubated because of worsening respiratory distress and abdominal distention. Refractory hypotension developed, requiring maximum vasopressor support. Paracentesis with removal of bloody ascites (3 liters) was performed, with lessening of the abdominal distention. Analysis of the orange, turbid fluid revealed 1425 white cells per cubic millimeter (65% neutrophils, 24% lymphocytes, and 11% monocytes), 1.3 g of protein per deciliter, 0.8 g of albumin per deciliter, 0.3 mg of biliru-bin per deciliter (5.1 μmol per liter), 42 mg of triglycerides per deciliter (0.5 mmol per liter), 43 U of amylase per liter, and 396 U of lactate dehy-drogenase per liter. Cytologic examination showed inflammatory cells, Gram’s staining showed no organisms, and cultures grew few enterococcus colonies. Testing for lupus anticoagulant was negative, and levels of protein S, protein C, and antithrombin III were lower than normal. CT scans of the chest after the intravenous administration of contrast material showed multi-focal consolidation in the middle lobe of the right lung and bilateral collapse of the complete lower lobe and partial upper lobe, with bilateral layering of pleural effusions. CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis after the intravenous administration of contrast material showed large amounts of hemorrhagic ascites, persistent thickening of segments of the distal small-bowel wall, and unchanged lymphadenopathy. The liver and spleen showed evidence of hypoperfusion. Cultures of blood and urine were sterile. Testing of nasal and tracheal aspirates for influenza A (seasonal and pandemic) and B viruses, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3 was negative. Other test results are shown in Table 1. On the second day, additional ascitic fluid was removed, and oliguric renal failure developed; a urine sediment revealed muddy brown casts. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration was begun. During the next week, the patient required multiple pressors, mechanical ventilation, and frequent transfusions; broad-spectrum antimicro-bial therapy was changed to vancomycin, metro-nidazole, ceftriaxone, peramivir, and micafungin and after 6 days to linezolid and meropenem. Stress doses of hydrocortisone were administered. The level of C-reactive protein was 28.2 mg per liter (reference range, <8.0 for inflammation); a test for antinuclear antibodies was positive (titer, 1:40 dilution), in a speckled pattern, and other tests for autoantibodies were negative; and there was no factor V Leiden or G20210A prothrombin gene mutation. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Pathological examination of the specimens from the other hospital showed transmural necrosis and acute inflammation of the bowel, a helminth in the bowel lumen, and a mesenteric lymph node with hemorrhage and acute inflammation, features consistent with acute hemorrhagic lymphadenitis. On the sixth day, hypoten-sion worsened. On the seventh day, laparotomy revealed as-cites, blood clots in the pelvis, and a large infra-mesocolic retroperitoneal hematoma that extended to the bifurcation of the great vessels and involved the origins of the renal arteries. The bowel anastomoses were intact, with no evidence of ischemic viscera (Fig. 1). Two liters of ascites and the pelvic clots were removed, and the abdomen was left open for later closure. After the procedure, oxygenation and hypotension improved; the patient was weaned from pressors. A diagnostic test result was received.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,18,nejm-case-2012-18,"A 35-Year-Old Man with Neck Pain, Hoarseness, and Dysphagia","Dr. Jasmeer P. Chhatwal (Neurology): A 35-year-old man was seen in the emergency department at this hospital because of right-sided neck pain, hoarseness, and dysphagia. The patient had been well until 7 days earlier when, while he was performing manual labor outdoors, pain developed suddenly in his right mandible and teeth, radiating to the ear. Minutes later, bilateral blurred vision and unsteadiness developed, resolving after 10 to 15 minutes. The jaw pain resolved spontaneously during 3 hours. Several hours later, pain in the right posterior neck and right-sided headache developed, which he rated at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain), without nausea, vomiting, or photophobia. He took nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications; the headache gradually improved, but neck pain persisted. Two days later, he saw his physician. On examination, the systolic blood pressure was 150 to 159 mm Hg. Computed tomography (CT) of the head was reportedly normal. A combination of acetaminophen and oxycodone was prescribed for pain, and atenolol (25 mg daily) for hypertension. During the next 2 days, his voice became hoarse and swelling and weakness of the tongue (including difficulty moving the tongue to the right) developed, as did dysphagia with solid foods. He saw his dentist, who did not identify a dental cause for the pain, and he returned to his physician. The acetaminophen with oxycodone was stopped, and methylpred-nisolone (5-day tapering dose) and amoxicillin were administered. One day before this evaluation, the patient went to the emergency department at another hospital. CT scans of the neck, obtained after the administration of contrast material, were reportedly normal. Diazepam was prescribed. On the day of presentation, his physician referred him to the emergency department at this hospital. The headache had resolved, but the neck pain and hoarseness were unchanged. The patient did not have visual changes, vertigo, sensory loss, weakness (other than of the tongue), or constitutional symptoms. He reported no neck trauma. He was right-handed. He had borderline hypertension and had had 35 fractures in the past attributed to osteogenesis imperfecta. He took no medications other than those recently prescribed. He had allergic reactions to codeine (pruritus) and statins (myalgias). He worked in construction, which involved frequent heavy lifting. He was married and lived with his wife and son, who were well. He drank alcohol in moderation and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. His father had hypertension and hyperlipidemia and had had numerous fractures, his mother was healthy, and his grandmother and great-aunt also had had fractures. On examination, the blood pressure was 161/101 mm Hg, the pulse 71 beats per minute, the temperature 36.3°C, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The right side of the face was dry as compared with the left side. The right lower eyelid was slightly elevated as compared with the left lower eyelid; the right pupil was 2.5 mm in diameter, the left pupil 3 mm in diameter (constricting to 2 mm to light), both pupils were round, and the optic disks were sharp. The voice was mildly hoarse. The palate elevated slightly more on the left side than on the right side; the uvula deviated slightly to the left.‎ The gag reflex was slightly decreased on the right side. The tongue deviated to the right of the midline on protrusion, and weakness was evident when the patient was instructed to push the tongue to the right. The right side of the tongue appeared swollen, with decreased furrows. The right side of the neck was tender to palpation. There was no carotid bruit. The remainder of the neurologic and general physical examination was normal. A complete blood count and results of renal- and liver-function tests were normal, as were plasma levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus. An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm and a rate of 66 beats per minute, with an incomplete right-bundle-branch block. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2008,12,nejm-case-2008-12,A Newborn Infant with Intermittent Apnea and Seizures,"A 1-day-old female infant was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of this hospital because of intermittent apnea and cyanosis. The day before admission, the patient was born at another hospital at 41 weeks 4 days’ gestation to a 33-year-old primigravid mother. After 44 hours of labor, during which the amniotic membranes were artificially ruptured (17 hours before delivery) and the mother’s temperature rose to 38.0°C, with a white-cell count of 26,700 per cubic millimeter, a cesarean section was performed because of failure of labor to progress. The infant weighed 4176 g (90th percentile) at birth, and the Apgar scores were 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes. At the other hospital, the infant was admitted to the newborn nursery, where she received care, including ophthalmic erythromycin. At the parents’ request, vitamin K was not given. Results of laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Approximately 24 hours after birth, several episodes of apnea occurred, associated with cyanosis of the skin, lips, and mucosal membranes, and the oxygen saturation fell to 70%. Stimulation and blow-by oxygen were administered, and the infant was transferred to the special care nursery. During the next 2 hours, three additional episodes of apnea and cyanosis were observed, associated with oxygen desaturation (50 to 60% saturation) and bradycardia (60 to 70 beats per minute). Neither lip-smacking nor abnormal movements were seen. The trachea was intubated. A chest radiograph showed the endotracheal tube above the carina and clear lung fields. A specimen of blood was sent for culture, and ampicillin and genta-micin were administered intravenously. Morphine sulfate (0.1 ml per kilogram of body weight) was administered intravenously, and the infant was bag-ventilated by hand, with 21% inspired oxygen and minimal pressures, at a rate of 30 breaths per minute. She was transferred to this hospital by ambulance and admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. The mother had received routine prenatal care. The maternal blood type was O, Rh-positive; results of screening tests for hepatitis B surface antigen, syphilis, group B streptococcus, and rubella were negative. There was a family history of pulmonary embolus, but there were no neurode-velopmental disorders, clotting disorders, or unexplained infant deaths. On examination, the infant appeared well. The weight was 4070 g, and the head circumference 34.8 cm. The temperature was 37.3°C, the pulse 125 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 35 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing 21% oxygen with conventional mechanical ventilation set at 25 breaths per minute; the peak inspi-ratory pressure was 16 cm of water, and the end-expiratory pressure was 5 cm of water. There were no dysmorphic features. Mild edema was present over the left side of the temporoparietal scalp. The anterior fontanel was open and full, and the suture lines were normal. The eyes opened spontaneously, tracked to the examiner’s face, and closed to penlight stimulation. All limbs moved spontaneously; there was bilateral hypertonia with no clonus. Deep-tendon reflexes were brisk. The Moro reflex was present, the snout sign was negative, and the Babinski reflex was present in both feet. The remainder of the examination was normal. Results of laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph was normal. Intravenous fluid (10% glucose and water) was administered. During initial bedside electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring that lasted an hour, with the patient in wakeful, active, and quiet sleep states, no apneic events occurred. The left hemisphere showed slightly excessive theta activity; there was no evidence of seizure. Computed tomographic (CT) scanning of the brain without the administration of contrast material revealed relative hypodensity of the anterior left temporal lobe, involving the superior temporal gyrus and extending into the middle temporal gyrus. There was no intracra-nial hemorrhage or hydrocephalus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain con-firmed a subtle increase in T2-weighted signal, with loss of differentiation between gray and white matter in the left temporal lobe that involved the superior and middle temporal gyrus, a finding that was consistent with gyral edema, with a corresponding wedge-shaped region of decreased diffusion. Collectively, these findings were believed to be consistent with acute arterial ischemic injury of the left temporal lobe in the distribution of the left middle cerebral artery. During the first night in this hospital, a 10-second episode of leftward nystagmus occurred that was accompanied by a fall in the respiratory rate to 28 breaths per minute, without tonic– clonic movements or oxygen desaturation. Several additional self-limited episodes of brady-pnea occurred that lasted less than 30 seconds. On the second hospital day, continuous EEG monitoring showed frequent sharp waves in the left temporal lobe, where there was also seizure activity, both with and without accompanying apnea; there was no clinical evidence of seizures. An episode of bradypnea occurred, with oxygen saturation of 81% and cyanosis; the bradypnea resolved spontaneously, and phenobarbital (loading dose, 20 mg per kilogram) was administered. The blood cultures obtained at the other hospital were reported to be negative, and antibiotics were discontinued. On the second and third hospital days, the oxygen saturation fell to 81 to 86% intermittently, with no corresponding change in the respiratory rate. Seizure activity continued to appear on the EEG tracing; additional phenobarbital (10 mg per kilogram) was given, followed by the administration of fosphenytoin, and encephalographic seizure activity ceased. Results of laboratory tests from day 2 are shown in Table 1. Vitamin K was administered subcutaneously. An echocardiogram on the third hospital day showed thickening of the tricuspid leaflets, with a thin, mobile, linear echodensity that prolapsed into the right atrium, findings that were consistent with a vegetation or thrombus on the valve, as well as a patent foramen ovale with right-to-left shunting. Fosphenytoin was discontinued on the fourth day; continuous EEG monitoring was stopped, and the trachea was extubated. Anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin was begun. An EEG obtained on the fifth day showed no seizure activity. A diagnostic test was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2018,12,nejm-case-2018-12,A 30-Year-Old Woman with Cardiac Arrest,"Dr. Emily C. Cleveland (Emergency Medicine): A 30-year-old woman was brought to the emergency department of this hospital because of cardiac arrest. On the morning of this presentation, the patient was found unresponsive in her bedroom. Her mother called emergency medical services (EMS) at 8:45 a.m. and initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), which was continued by first responders from the fire department on their arrival. The cardiac rhythm was assessed with an automated external defibrillator, and a shock was delivered. EMS personnel who could provide advanced life support arrived at 8:54 a.m. and found the patient to be pulseless. CPR was continued, and intraosseous access was established. Electrocardiography performed with an external monitor and defibrillator reportedly revealed wide-complex bradycardia. CPR was continued, the trachea was intubated, and sodium bicarbonate, epinephrine, and calcium chloride were administered intraosseously. Spontaneous circulation returned. While the patient was being transported from her home to the ambulance, pulselessness recurred. CPR was resumed, and epinephrine was administered; a pulse was restored. At 9:16 a.m., the pulse was 94 beats per minute, the blood pressure 66/30 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 7 breaths per minute. A peripheral intravenous catheter was inserted, and a bolus of normal saline was administered; thereafter, the blood pressure was 54/24 mm Hg. A continuous infusion of dopamine was begun, and the patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital, arriving at 9:38 a.m. On the patient’s arrival in the emergency department, the available history was limited. The patient’s mother reported that the patient drank alcohol in a binge pattern and had appeared to be intoxicated the previous evening but had seemed well at 7:45 a.m., before she went into her bedroom. The patient also smoked cigarettes and had a history of depression, anxiety, substance use disorder (including the use of alcohol, opioids, and cocaine), and skin abscesses due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Current medications were unknown; a review of the electronic medical record revealed an allergy to amoxicillin–clavulanic acid. The patient lived in an urban area of New England with her mother, daughter, and cousin. She was unemployed. On examination, the patient was obtunded and did not respond to noxious stimulation. The temperature was 35.9°C, the pulse 97 beats per minute, the blood pressure 60/24 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 25 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while she was receiving full mechanical ventilatory support (fraction of inspired oxygen, 1.00). The pupils were 6 mm in diameter and nonreactive to light. Corneal, oculo-cephalic, cough, and gag reflexes were absent. There were no spontaneous breaths over the ventilated breaths; breath sounds were equal in both lungs. Electrocardiography was performed. Dr. David M. Dudzinski: The electrocardiogram (Fig. 1) was notable for an irregular, wide-complex rhythm, with a QRS width of up to 220 msec. The differential diagnosis for a QRS complex of this width includes direct ventricular activation (ventricular tachycardia and pre-excitation), aberrant ventricular conduction, intramyocardial de-lay, severe cardiomyopathy, hypothermia, electrolyte abnormalities (including hyperkalemia), and toxic effects of drugs. The QRS complex had a broad positive R wave in lead V1, which is a morphologic feature resembling a right bundle-branch block. Other notable features of this QRS complex included a far rightward (“northwest”) frontal-plane axis, as well as a positive R wave in lead aVR, an abnormal finding that may indicate ventricular tachycardia, lead misplacement, dextro-cardia, or certain toxidromes. The electrocardiogram also showed substantial prolongation of the corrected QT (QTc) interval, even after accounting for the effect of the wide QRS complex. Dr. Cleveland: Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Additional history was obtained, and a diagnosis and management decisions were made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2011,24,nejm-case-2011-24,"A 36-Year-Old Man with Headache, Memory Loss, and Confusion","Dr. M. BrandonWestover (Neurology): A 36-year-old right-handed man was seen in the neurology clinic of this hospital because of headaches, confusion, and memory loss. The patient had been well until 1 month earlier, when nausea, fevers, chills, diarrhea, malaise, and myalgias developed and lasted 2 days. During the next 3 days, he had a constant headache centered between his eyes, with a sensation of squeezing. The headache resolved, but 5 days later his wife noted that he seemed apathetic and confused on awakening, with loss of short-term memory. He was admitted to another hospital. On examination, the patient, who appeared to be unconcerned, had decreased concentration and was unable to remember three items when questioned 3 minutes later; the examination was otherwise normal. Results of routine laboratory tests were normal; a test for Lyme disease was negative. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reportedly showed lesions with restricted diffusion in the periventricular and subcortical white matter and the corpus callosum. A scan of the head and neck obtained with magnetic resonance angiography was reportedly normal. A lumbar puncture was performed; the results of ce-rebrospinal fluid analysis are shown in Table 1. Treatment with acyclovir was begun. Electroencephalography (EEG) reportedly revealed episodes of generalized irregular high-voltage delta activity throughout, but more prominent anteriorly and enhancing on hyperventilation. There were also intermittent, brief episodes of sharp theta activity and transient sharp waves with phase reversals over the left midtemporal region. Treatment with levetiracetam was begun. A repeat EEG revealed occasional left frontotemporal sharp waves with phase reversals at T3, with intermittent generalized slowing, slightly more severe on the left and a diffusely slow background, with no spike or polyspike activity. MRI performed after the administration of gadolinium reportedly showed new hyperintense, nonenhancing lesions in the corpus callosum and left cerebellum. The patient was discharged on the sixth day in improved condition, with prescriptions for levetiracetam and butalbital–acetaminophen–caffeine and instructions to follow up with a neurologist. He returned to work but was unable to concentrate. Two weeks later, he was seen in the neurology clinic of this hospital. The patient had a history of allergic rhinitis and reported having had one episode of sinusitis. He was born and lived in New England with his wife and child, worked in a professional occupation, and owned a dog. He drank alcohol in moderation; he did not smoke or use illicit drugs. His father had coronary artery disease and a myocardial infarction at 40 years of age; his mother had a history of poorly defined cognitive symptoms that started when she was 60 years of age, congestive heart failure, and alcohol abuse; and his maternal grandmother had dementia in late adulthood. His brother was well. On examination, the patient appeared well, with normal social behavior and articulate speech, and he was fully oriented to person, place, and time. He recalled 2 items out of 5 viewed 5 minutes earlier, and after cues recalled 4 items out of 5 viewed 10 minutes earlier. He named 14 animals in 1 minute; the result of the forward digit-span test was 7, and that of the reverse digit-span test was 5. The tone in his limbs was slightly above normal, more on the right than on the left; all reflexes were brisk, and the plantar responses were flexor; the remainder of the neurologic examination was normal. Levetiracetam was discontinued. During the next 3 months, intermittent tremulousness of his left hand developed; his fatigue and mental endurance gradually improved, and he returned to work part-time. Four weeks after evaluation, an EEG showed no epileptiform activity. MRI of the brain showed multiple hyperin-tense lesions in the periventricular, infratentorial, and subcortical white matter and the corpus cal-losum on T2-weighted images. Repeat MRI of the brain 2 months later showed a decrease in the size and number of the white-matter lesions; MRI of the spine was normal. Approximately 3 months after the patient’s initial presentation, insomnia and increasing fatigue developed. One month later, frontal headache, somnolence, and memory loss recurred, and he came to the emergency department. On examination, the blood pressure was 148/76 mm Hg; other vital signs were normal. On neurologic examination, he was fully oriented, recalled one out of three items presented 5 minutes earlier, was unable to spell “world” backward, and exhibited per-severation. The remainder of the examination was normal. A complete blood count and differential count, electrolyte levels, glucose levels, and tests of renal function were normal. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the brain was normal. T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images obtained with MRI showed new bilateral, hyperintense lesions in the right frontal subcortical and deep white matter, with enhancing lesions in the right cingulate and superior frontal gyri, the left caudate body, and cerebellum. The images also revealed persistent lesions in the corpus callosum and in areas of mildly restricted diffusion in the right cingulate gyrus and left parietal lobe. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Evaluations for hypercoagulability, rheumato-logic and autoimmune diseases, and infectious agents were negative. Cytologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid showed no evidence of cancer; flow cytometry showed no abnormal cells; the results of other analyses are shown in Table 1. CT angiography of the head and cerebrum was normal. Transthoracic echocardiogra-phy was normal, and a skin test for tuberculosis was negative. A biopsy of the right frontal lobe and meninges was performed; pathological examination of tissue specimens revealed small vessels with changes suggestive of a microangi-opathy. Methylprednisolone (a daily intravenous dose of 1000 mg for 3 days) and cefazolin were administered. The patient was discharged on the seventh day with a prescription for 80 mg of oral prednisone to be taken daily for 4 weeks and then tapered. Two weeks later, increased confusion developed, and the patient awoke with a black spot in the superior visual field of the left eye, which resolved spontaneously after 12 hours. He came to the emergency room, where he reported light-headedness, a mild headache, and fluctuating hearing loss. An MRI scan revealed a new punc-tate focus of restricted diffusion in the left sple-nium of the corpus callosum and unchanged foci of hyperintensity on T2-weighted FLAIR images in the white matter of both hemispheres. He was readmitted. Findings on examination were unchanged. The results of CT angiography were normal. Although the patient reported no diplopia or visual loss, ophthalmologic examination revealed nonspecific visual-field constriction in both eyes, vascular narrowing in both retinas, with sheath-ing, and vascular beading in the left eye, with no papillitis. Results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis are shown in Table 1. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,09,nejm-case-2010-09,A 37-Year-Old Woman with Paresthesias and Ataxia,"Dr. Mikael L. Rinne (Neurology): A 37-year-old right-handed woman was admitted to this hospital because of intermittent paresthesias, slurred speech, ataxia, and abnormalities on brain imaging. The patient had been well until 7 months earlier, when numbness and tingling developed while she was lying in bed — first in the right foot and leg, and then in the face and right arm — and resolved completely within 20 minutes. She went to another hospital. She reported having had a tick bite on her right hand 1 month earlier, without associated symptoms. Results of routine laboratory tests were normal, and testing for Lyme disease was negative. One month later, an episode of nausea, left-sided numbness, and slurred speech occurred, followed 2 hours later by right-sided numbness and aphasia. The episode resolved within 1 hour but was followed by a diffuse headache (rated 8 on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is the most severe), nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. The patient was admitted to a second hospital. Computed tomography (CT) of the head without the administration of contrast material and CT angiography (CTA) of the head and neck were reportedly normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without contrast material showed T2-weighted hyperintense lesions in the left centrum semiovale and in the subcortical white matter of the left frontoparietal region, with increased signal on diffusion-weighted images but no evidence of a mass effect, intracranial hemorrhage, or restricted water diffusion. She was discharged and referred to a neurologist. Neurologic examination and electroencephalography (EEG) 2 weeks later were normal. Prednisone was administered for 14 days, and topiramate and eletriptan were begun; topiramate was stopped because the patient reported grogginess. Daily headaches and episodes of numbness and tingling continued. Five months before this evaluation, MRI of the brain after the administration of a gadolinium-based contrast agent showed evolution of the lesions in the supratentorial white matter and two new, small, linear regions of T2-weighted hyperintensity with restricted water diffusion and heterogeneous enhancement in the left cerebellar hemisphere. A lumbar puncture was performed; results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph and transesophageal echocardiogram were reportedly normal. During the next 5 months, the patient had episodes of dizziness, loss of balance, nausea, vomiting, and facial droop. Relatives noted cognitive problems, with confusion and inappropriate dressing. Four months before this evaluation, she saw another neurologist. The level of vanilmandelic acid in the urine was normal. Verapamil was begun, and prednisone was resumed, with no improvement. Three months before this evaluation, MRI of the brain showed new, widespread, patchy T2-weighted hyperintensity in the supratentorial white matter, without associated enhancement. The previously seen T2-weighted hyperintense lesions in the left cerebellar hemisphere had increased in size. A cerebral angiogram reportedly showed mild focal narrowing of the left anterior cerebral artery but was otherwise normal. Azathio-prine (50 mg daily) was begun. Three weeks before admission, gait imbalance, unsteadiness, and visual hallucinations developed. An EEG reportedly showed asymmetric slowing. The patient was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for 1 week, with a diagnosis of depression; citalo-pram and outpatient psychiatric treatment were begun. Four days before admission, slurred speech, numbness of the right hand, aphasia, a choking sensation, ataxia, and joint pain developed, and a rash appeared on her legs. The patient was admitted to another hospital. She did not have fever, double vision, abnormalities of smell or taste, loss of consciousness, seizure, bowel or bladder symptoms, night sweats, weight loss, joint swelling, or a history of head injury; she also had no heart, lung, or kidney problems. On examination by a neurologist, she was anxious, with a depressed affect. The vital signs were normal. There was a slightly raised, red rash above both ankles. Her speech was dysarthric. Deep-tendon reflexes were 3+ and brisk throughout, and plantar responses were flexor. There was a tremor on finger-to-nose testing, a wide-based gait, and weakness in the right arm and leg. The remainder of the examination was normal. A screening test for toxins in the urine was positive for cocaine. An electrocardiogram was reportedly normal; an EEG showed mild relative slowness in the left temporoparietal region. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the head and neck reportedly showed subtle focal narrowing in the left anterior cerebral artery. MRI of the brain showed new enhancement in the previously seen white-matter lesions. The left cerebellar lesions extended to the cerebellar cortex. Multiple new lesions, many of which enhanced, were present in both cerebellar hemispheres. The patient was discharged on the fifth day and referred to the neurology clinic of this hospital. She had been healthy before this illness. She was married, lived with her husband and children, and worked with children. She owned a parrot, had used cocaine as a teenager, and did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her father had had depression and was deceased, her mother had had cervical cancer, two aunts had breast cancer, a brother was well, and her two children were healthy. There was a family history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, asthma, and lung cancer and no history of multiple sclerosis or clotting disorders. She had no allergies. Medications included azathioprine, prednisone, verap-amil, citalopram, diazepam, acetaminophen, and aspirin. On examination, the patient was in a wheelchair. The vital signs were normal. There were multiple ecchymoses on the skin, which she attributed to falling, and scaly plaques on the medial aspects of both lower legs. She was oriented and aware of current events but responded slowly. Tests of attention, concentration, and recent and remote memory were normal. There was a left afferent pupillary defect (less constriction of the pupils when a light was shone in the left eye than in the right eye). Disk margins were pale, more so on the left than on the right, and peripheral and central vision in the left eye was diminished. There was normal saccadic pursuit, with no Horner’s syndrome or ptosis. Speech was dysarthric. There was increased tone in all limbs, with normal strength. The reflexes were 3+ in the arms and legs, and plantar responses were flexor bilaterally. A tremor was present during finger-to-nose testing in both arms, and heel-to-shin testing showed dysmetria; rapid alternating movements were impaired. The gait was slightly wide-based; the patient was unable to walk with a tandem gait. The remainder of the general and neurologic examinations was normal. She was admitted to this hospital. The level of alkaline phosphatase was 277 U per liter (reference range, 30 to 100), aspartate aminotransferase 245 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 32), and alanine aminotransferase 327 U per liter (reference range, 7 to 30). Results were normal for the erythrocyte sedimentation rate; levels of serum electrolytes, glucose, bilirubin, angio-tensin-converting enzyme, lipoprotein A, vitamin B12, folic acid, C-reactive protein, immunoglobulins, and thyrotropin; tests of renal function and coagulation; hypercoagulability screening; serum protein electrophoresis; and urinalysis. Testing was negative for Lyme disease; syphilis; antimitochon-drial antibodies; antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies; antinuclear antibodies; antibodies against double-stranded DNA, Ro antigen, La antigen, and Sm antigen; rheumatoid factor; the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); hepatitis A, B, and C viruses; and hepatitis B e antigen, as was nucleic-acid testing for hepatitis B, C, and D viruses. Toxicology screening of the blood revealed the presence of diazepam, nordazepam, verapamil, and norverapamil and was otherwise negative. Azathioprine and prednisone were stopped, and citalopram, verapamil, enoxaparin, diazepam, and aspirin were given. On the second day, a lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was 6 cm of water; needle manipulation caused the spinal fluid to become blood-tinged. Results of the cerebro-spinal fluid analysis are shown in Table 1. CTA of the brain and neck revealed a hypodensity in the left cerebellar hemisphere and associated tissue loss; the vessels appeared normal. MRI of the brain showed extensive T2-weighted hyperintense lesions in the supratentorial and infratentorial white matter, many of which showed enhancement and no mass effect. There was no decreased diffusion to suggest recent infarction, although there were findings suggesting chronic infarcts in the left cerebellar hemisphere, where leptomeningeal enhancement was also present. MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine showed degenerative disk disease, with no intrinsic spinal cord lesions. CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed right-sided sac-roiliitis and no evidence of intraabdominal mass lesions or lymphadenopathy. Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed fatty changes of the liver. On the fifth day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,34,nejm-case-2012-34,"A 27-Year-Old Woman in Ethiopia with Severe Pain, Bleeding, and Shock during Labor","Dr. Drucilla J. Roberts: A 27-year-old pregnant woman, gravida 3, para 2, was admitted to a hospital in Ethiopia because of severe abdominal pain during labor, with cessation of contractions. The patient had been in good health. She had received routine prenatal care (four visits) at a health center near her home during this pregnancy, beginning at 20 weeks of gestation. She had had two previous vaginal deliveries at home without a birth attendant — 5 years ago she had delivered a neonate who weighed 2800 g at birth and was well, and 3 years ago she had had a stillbirth; no autopsy had been performed, and neither the birth weight nor the cause of death was known. Ultrasonography had not been performed during the current gestation. All pregnancies had the same paternity. The patient had no history of illnesses or surgical procedures. She had not been circumcised. She lived in a remote rural area of northern Ethiopia with her husband and child. Several days before admission, at full term, spontaneous labor began, and the patient was assisted at home by a traditional birth attendant. Approximately 24 hours before admission, she began active pushing. Approximately 3 hours before admission, sudden and severe sharp pain and vaginal bleeding developed, followed by progressive cessation of contractions. The decision was made to take the patient to a hospital, and a driver with a small, three-wheeled utility vehicle (with open sides and three seats) was hired. Two hours later, accompanied only by her husband, the patient arrived at the Ayder Referral Hospital, a teaching hospital for the College of Health Sciences at Mekelle University in Mekelle, Ethiopia. On examination, the patient was conscious, pale, and weak. The blood pressure was 60/30 mm Hg, and the pulse was 112 beats per minute and weak. The mucous membranes were dry, and the conjunctivae were white. The abdomen was irregularly distended. In the abdomen, fetal parts were palpable, fetal heart sounds were not audible, there was shifting dullness, and an abdominal thrill was present. The he-matocrit, obtained urgently, was 12%. Intravenous fluids were infused at a rapid rate. Within 30 minutes after the patient’s arrival, a procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,13,nejm-case-2019-13,A 54-Year-Old Man with Alcohol Withdrawal and Altered Mental Status,"Dr. Christopher M. Kearney (Medicine): A 54-year-old man was evaluated for acute altered mental status after being hospitalized for alcohol withdrawal. The patient was homeless but had recently been enrolled in an addiction treatment program in a residential clinical stabilization service. He reportedly left the program 4 days before admission to this hospital and then “blacked out” daily in tandem with drinking 0.5 to 1 gallon of vodka throughout the day. On the evening before admission, he decided to stop drinking alcohol. Approximately 10 hours later, he awoke on the ground without recollection of lying down; he had had vivid dreams and tremulousness and was worried that he may have had a seizure. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital. The patient reported diffuse headache, nausea, nonbloody and nonbilious emesis, restlessness, auditory hallucinations, and a sensation of insects crawling on the skin. A review of systems was notable for heartburn and was negative for confusion, ataxia, dizziness, focal weakness and numbness, tongue laceration, incontinence, visual hallucinations, fever, chills, dyspnea, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and dysuria. His medical history was notable for seizure disorder in childhood, hypertension, and glaucoma, and he had undergone umbilical hernia repair. He reported that he was taking gabapentin and hydroxyzine and had no adverse drug reactions. The patient had a lengthy history of alcohol use, with associated delirium tremens and withdrawal seizures, although he had abstained from alcohol use over a 7-year period, which coincided with incarceration and ended 8 years before admission. He smoked cigarettes and had smoked 0.5 to 1 pack daily since he was 18 years of age. He had previously used marijuana, hash oil, and lysergic acid diethylamide. His family history was notable for alcohol use disorder in his parents and two brothers. On examination, the temperature was 36.7°C, the heart rate 108 beats per minute, the blood pressure 161/96 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 55.4 kg, the height 142 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 27.5. The patient was described as restless, anxious, and flushed. Tongue fasciculations and mild arm tremors were present. There was no tenderness on the head, face, or spine. Auscultation revealed a tachycardic rhythm and scattered wheezes. There were reducible ventral and umbilical hernias, with a well-healed umbilical scar. The remainder of the examination was normal. Levels of globulin and thyrotropin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed slightly cloudy urine with trace ketones but was otherwise normal. Samples of the blood and urine were obtained for culture. An electrocardiogram was notable for sinus tachycardia and borderline left atrial enlargement. A chest radiograph was normal, and a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the head, obtained without the administration of contrast material, showed no intracranial hemorrhage, mass, or stroke. Folate, multivitamins, intravenous normal saline, thiamine, and lorazepam were administered during the next 10 hours. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis was normal. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Phenobarbital was administered at a gradually tapering dose for management of alcohol withdrawal. The patient was evaluated by the addiction consultation service; he reported ongoing alcohol cravings, for which topiramate was recommended. Tremors, hallucinosis, and tachycardia all abated with phenobarbital treatment, but cravings persisted. He awaited transfer to an alcohol detoxification facility. On hospital day 5, the patient reported feeling anxious. That evening, a nurse found him to be acutely delirious, lethargic, and minimally responsive, even to sternal rub, just 1 hour after he had been awake and conversing; he had not left his room. A fingerstick glucose measurement was 151 mg per deciliter (8.4 mmol per liter). Examination revealed tachycardia with a heart rate of 107 beats per minute (as compared with 78 beats per minute 6 hours previously), tachy-pnea with a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, an oxygen saturation of 95% while he was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute, and new abdominal distention without tenderness; he had no tremors, seizure, incontinence, or tongue trauma. Naloxone was administered but had no effect. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Results of repeat laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis was again normal. A chest radiograph was normal, as was a CT scan of the head that was obtained without the administration of contrast material. The neurology service evaluated the patient. The next morning, the patient was more awake, alert to person and place, and responsive to commands. An electroencephalogram showed gen-eralized theta slowing, without epileptiform abnormalities. Later in the day, he was lethargic. He reported heartburn and nausea and vomited dark-brown material. Examination revealed abdominal distention and guaiac-positive, black stool. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed trace ketones but was otherwise normal. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Amirkasra Mojtahed: A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (Fig. 1), obtained after the administration of oral and intravenous contrast material, showed multiple dilated small-bowel loops, with an associated segment of small-bowel wall thickening, but no changes consistent with bowel obstruction. Dr. Kearney: The surgery service evaluated the patient. A nasogastric tube was placed, with immediate return of 400 ml of dark-brown and “coffee grounds” material. Intravenous normal saline, vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole were administered. Additional diagnostic test results were received.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2009,13,nejm-case-2009-13,A 54-Year-Old Woman with Respiratory Failure and a Cavitary Lesion in the Lung,"A 54-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of respiratory failure, hypotension, and a cavitary lesion in the lung. She had rheumatoid arthritis but had otherwise been well until approximately 1 week before admission, when upper respiratory symptoms, cough, and shortness of breath developed. On the day of admission, shortness of breath worsened. She called her physician, who advised her to go to a hospital for evaluation. While she was preparing to leave her home, her symptoms increased in severity; she collapsed, and emergency medical services (EMS) were called. When they arrived, the patient was unconscious and showing minimal respiratory effort; the pulse was not palpable. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated with chest compressions and ventilation by means of a mask attached to a handheld bag-valve system, and she was taken to the emergency department of another hospital. On arrival at the other hospital, the patient was being manually ventilated; the blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg, the pulse barely palpable at 110 beats per minute, and the temperature 38.9°C. The pupils were 3 mm in diameter and minimally reactive to light, the oral mucosa was dry, the breath sounds were diminished over the right lung fields, and the extremities were cold and cyanotic. An electrocardiogram showed a sinus rate of 120 beats per minute, with evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy and repolarization abnormalities. The results of analysis of arterial blood gases are shown in Table 1. Naloxone was administered, and the trachea was intubated with the use of etomidate and succinylcholine. After the intubation procedure, a large amount of bright-red blood was suctioned from the endotracheal tube. Mechanical ventilation was begun. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph showed an endotracheal tube in place, with its tip 4.5 cm above the carina; diffuse air-space opacity was seen throughout the right lung, with dense consolidation surrounding a central cavity, 6 cm in diameter, in the right upper lobe and patchy air-space opacity in the left lower lobe. A right pleural effusion was layered posteriorly; there was no pneumothorax. The osseous thorax appeared intact. A central intravenous catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein. The blood pressure suddenly decreased to 70/44 mm Hg with pulseless electrical activity. Phenyl-ephrine, normal saline, sodium bicarbonate, potassium chloride, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and azithromycin were administered intravenously. Chest radiography repeated 24 minutes after the first study revealed a large right-sided tension pneumothorax, displacement of the mediastinal structures to the left, and complete collapse of the right lung. Air-space opacity in the left lower lobe was unchanged. All tubes and catheters appeared to be in appropriate positions. An angio-catheter was introduced into the inferior right lateral hemithorax, and there was immediate release of air under pressure. A thoracic surgeon inserted a chest tube in the second right inter-costal space; the tube was connected to a chest-drainage system that included a water-seal chamber, and a marked air leak was noted. A follow-up chest radiograph showed partial reexpansion of the right upper lobe. The mediastinum was shifted to the left; there was a poorly defined opacity in the left lung and no pleural effusion. The en-dotracheal tube terminated in the upper thoracic trachea, and the central venous catheter in the superior vena cava. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was transferred to this hospital. The patient had had arthritis for 10 years, characterized predominantly by asymmetric swelling of the joints of the hands and feet; she had a negative test for rheumatoid factor and variably positive antinuclear-antibody titers (1:40 to 1:80 in ribosomal or nucleolar patterns). She was treated sequentially with nonsteroidal antiin-flammatory drugs (NSAIDs), sulfasalazine, and methotrexate, with partial relief. Two and a half years before admission, while taking methotrex-ate, a flare occurred, with swelling of the joints of the hands and feet, carpal tunnel syndrome, and morning stiffness; the dose of methotrexate was increased, but she then had hair loss, and abnormal results of liver-function tests were reported. Two years before admission, methotrexate was discontinued, and adalimumab was begun, with prompt and complete relief of symptoms. Three months before admission, at routine followup with her rheumatologist, she felt well, with no joint pain or stiffness, and the physical examination was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 13 mm per hour, and the serum level of antibody to cyclic citrullinated peptide was 145 U per milliliter (normal, <20). A diagnosis of Graves’ disease had been made 11 years earlier; the disease was treated with radioactive iodine. She had hy-percholesterolemia and allergic rhinitis and had undergone hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy 2 years earlier because of leiomyo-mas. Both her parents had had hypertension; her mother had rheumatoid arthritis and had had a myocardial infarction when she was in her 40s. The patient was divorced, worked in an office, and had grown children. She did not smoke or drink alcohol and had no known drug allergies. Medications included ezetimibe, simvastatin, levo-thyroxine, and adalimumab (40 mg weekly, subcutaneously). On examination, she was intubated and unconscious, with central and peripheral cyanosis and no spontaneous movements. There were bounding femoral and carotid pulses; radial pulses were absent. The blood pressure was 105/70 mm Hg, the pulse 115 beats per minute, and the temperature 38.1°C; respirations were by mechanical ventilation, and the oxygen saturation could not be measured. The pupils were 4 mm and constrictive to 3 mm on exposure to light; the neck was supple, and the breath sounds were coarse. The extremities were cold, and the skin was mottled. The remainder of the examination was normal. Air was escaping through the chest tube, with a volume loss of 300 to 400 ml for every 500-to-600-ml breath. Analysis of the urine revealed 3+ albumin and blood, 5 to 10 red cells and 3 to 5 white cells per high-power field, and moderate numbers of bacteria; a toxicology screen was positive for benzodiazepines. Other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Specimens of blood and urine were cultured. Vecuronium (10 mg) was administered intravenously immediately on arrival, the administration of normal saline and phenylephrine was continued, and norepinephrine was administered at a dose that would result in a systolic blood pressure greater than 90 to 100 mm Hg; calcium carbonate, bicarbonate, vaso-pressin, vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and clindamy-cin were also administered. A chest radiograph revealed a pneumothorax with collapse of the right middle and lower lobes and multifocal patchy opacities in the remaining lungs, a chest tube in the right middle lung field, the endotracheal tube at the level of the thoracic inlet, and the internal jugular catheter in the superior vena cava. A central arterial catheter was inserted. A sur-gical consultant placed a second chest tube in the right lateral chest, and the first tube was clamped; however, the air leak persisted. The anesthesia service was consulted, and the endo-tracheal tube was advanced down the left main-stem bronchus, with resolution of the leak from the chest tube on the right; however, repeated assessments of the levels of arterial blood gases (Table 1) showed insufficient oxygenation, so the endotracheal tube was withdrawn to above the level of the carina. Bronchoscopic examination with alveolar lavage of the right lung, performed at the bedside by thoracic surgeons, revealed edema and inflammation and no endobronchial lesions. During the procedure, hypotension with pulseless electrical activity developed; cardiopulmonary resuscitation was instituted, with restoration of a pulse. The patient was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit 5.5 hours after her arrival in the emergency department. Contact precautions were instituted. Metabolic and respiratory acidosis persisted, despite the administration of pressors and bicarbonate. Levels of amylase and lipase were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Additional episodes of pulseless electric activity occurred, and resuscitation efforts failed. The patient was pronounced dead 8 hours after arrival in the emergency department. An autopsy was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2009,05,nejm-case-2009-05,A 47-Year-Old Woman with a Rash and Numbness and Pain in the Legs,"Dr. John H. Stone: A 47-year-old woman was seen in the Rheumatology Clinic of this hospital because of numbness and pain in the legs and a rash. The patient had been well until approximately 2 years earlier, when numbness developed, first on the lateral aspect of the left leg, ankle, and foot, and then in an identical distribution on the right. Approximately 3 months later, pain developed on the medial aspect of the left foot, followed by pain in the same distribution on the right foot. During the next 9 months, the pain spread to involve both lower legs diffusely. One year before presentation, acute swelling of the distal left leg developed after an airplane trip. Ultrasonography of the legs, performed at another hospital, showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. The swelling subsided spontaneously during a 2-week period. Six to 8 months before this evaluation, mottled discoloration of the skin developed on the feet, ankles, and lower legs, with isolated, tender nodules up to 1.5 cm in diameter that blanched partially with pressure. Intermittent swelling of the legs and ankles occurred. Results of laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Approximately 8 weeks before presentation, the patient saw a physician at another facility. Levels of serum electrolytes, albumin, globulin, thyrotropin, ferritin, folate, and vitamin B12 and results of renal- and liver-function tests were normal. Results of other laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. The next day, a dermatologist performed a biopsy of the skin of the left temple. Pathological examination of the specimen reportedly showed perivascular and perifollicular inflammation with tel-angiectasias, which was thought to be consistent with rosacea-like dermatitis. One week later, pathological examination of a biopsy specimen of a cutaneous nodule on the left ankle reportedly revealed a focal lymphohistiocytic infiltrate around a small muscular artery in the subcutis, with no evidence of vasculitis or erythema nodosum. Three weeks before presentation, the patient saw a rheumatologist at another facility. The patient reported a history of dry eyes (for which she used cyclosporine eye drops) and numbness, tingling, and color changes in her fingers in conditions of extreme cold, without digital pallor. The blood pressure was 126/80 mm Hg, the weight 57.8 kg, and the height 163.2 cm. There was mild crepitus on flexion and extension of the knees, without effusions. There were scattered erythematous lesions on the face and anterior portion of the chest that blanched to gentle pressure. There were irregular areas of erythema over the feet and lower legs, which blanched partially with pressure. No nodules were observed. The remainder of the examination was normal. Results of serum and urine protein electrophoresis and immunofixation were normal. Results of other laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. One week later, she returned to the rheumatologist because of 3 to 4 days of increased pain and swelling in the left ankle. Slight warmth and mild tenderness to touch were present around the left lateral malleolus, with a rounded, 1-cm area of erythema. The range of motion in both ankles was normal, and there was no evidence of enthesopathy at the insertion of the Achilles’ tendon. The plantar fasciae were not tender. There was no sensation to pinprick over either medial malleolus. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was normal. Two weeks later, she saw a rheumatologist at this hospital. She did not have xerostomia, pain or swelling of the joints, weakness, alopecia, ma-lar rash, oral or tongue ulcers, lymphadenopa-thy, shortness of breath, chest pain, fevers, night sweats, or a change in weight. She had had vari-cella in childhood, mild hypertension for 10 years, and a ruptured appendix with peritonitis 15 years earlier. She worked as a consultant, drank alcohol socially, and did not smoke. Her mother had Sjögren’s syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis, and interstitial lung disease and had died of interstitial lung disease. Her father had a neuropathy when he was elderly. An older sister had been reported within the previous year to have “vasculi-tis,” which did not appear to be a primary form of either cutaneous or systemic vasculitis. A maternal relative had a history of Sjögren’s syndrome, but no details were known. The patient’s medications included vitamins, oral contraceptives, and cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion. She was allergic to sulfa medications. On examination, the vital signs were normal. Examination of the skin (Fig. 1) disclosed mottled discoloration from the midcalf distally, which was suggestive of livedo reticularis. A tender, ery-thematous nodule, 3 cm in diameter, was present just below the left lateral malleolus; two smaller, less tender lesions were present in the same area. There were small porcelain-colored areas on both lower legs, which the patient said corresponded to the locations of previous nodules. There was decreased sensation to light touch over the medial aspects of both feet. There was no capillary dilatation in the nail beds, Raynaud’s phenomenon, or joint swelling or deformity. The remainder of the examination was normal. Computed tomographic (CT) scanning of the chest and abdomen showed no lymphadenopathy or pulmonary infiltrates. The white-cell count was 3000 per cubic millimeter, with a normal differential count, hematocrit, hemoglobin level, and platelet count; review of a peripheral-blood smear revealed no abnormalities in the white cells, red cells, or platelets. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,05,nejm-case-2019-05,A 48-Year-Old Woman with Delusional Thinking and Paresthesia of the Right Hand,"Dr. Cary S. Crall (Psychiatry): A 48-year-old woman presented to the emergency department of this hospital with tingling of the right hand. One hour before presentation, the patient felt an acute “prickling and tingling” sensation diffusely on the right palm while she was reaching for a can of soda out of a vending machine. The sensation did not radiate to other areas of the hand or the arm, and it was not associated with decreased range of motion, tenderness, or joint pain. Although she presented to the emergency department 1 hour after the onset of symptoms, the tingling resolved before the examination, which took place approximately 80 minutes after presentation. The patient stated that she had recently traveled to Boston from New York City to visit museums, and she requested “accommodations” from medical personnel because she did not have a place to stay. On examination, the temperature was 36.9°C, the blood pressure 141/89 mm Hg, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 70.9 kg, the height 160 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 27.7. The patient was described as having a labile affect, with rapid and tangential speech. The results of the remainder of the physical examination, including tests of neurologic function and examination of the muscles in the right hand and arm, were normal. The patient was discharged from the emergency department with a list of local shelters and hotels. Five hours after discharge, the patient felt recurrent tingling on the right palm, primarily along the radial-nerve distribution, and she again presented to the emergency department of this hospital. She reported that she had been unable to find a shelter and that she feared hotel staff would perform “unwanted sleep studies” or “gas” her. The results of the physical examination had not changed from several hours earlier. The patient was described as disheveled, unkempt, malodorous, and oriented to person and time. Examination revealed inconsistent thought processes and delusions of persecution. Urine toxicology screening was negative for amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, opiates, and phencyclidine, and serum toxicology screening was negative for salicylates, acetaminophen, ethanol, and tricyclic antidepressants. A urine test for human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Brent P. Little: A radiograph of the right hand and wrist (Fig. 1) showed no acute fracture, dislocation, or soft-tissue abnormality; the joint spaces were preserved, and there were no joint erosions. Computed tomography (CT) of the head (Fig. 2), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass, or acute territorial infarct. Dr. Crall: On evaluation by a psychiatrist, the patient incorrectly named the city and state as “Massatution” and “Boston,” respectively. Mental-status examination was notable for attentiveness to the interviewer, recall of two of five objects after 5 minutes, and the inability to subtract serial sevens and to repeat phrases. The patient’s score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment was 21 (reference range, 26 to 30) on a scale of 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating greater cognitive impairment. She maintained eye contact and had no abnormal movements. Her speech was characterized by malapropisms and mispronunciations and was pressured. Her mood was described as happy, with a congruent affect. Her thought processes were described as tangential and disorganized. The results of the neurologic examination, including tests of cranial-nerve function, strength, and sensation to light touch, were normal. The patient reported no history of medical problems. She said that she had previously been a “volunteer client” at a psychiatric hospital in New York City but had not undergone psychiatric treatments or hospitalizations. A review of systems was negative for physical trauma, anorexia, weight loss, loss of energy, weakness, bleeding (menstrual cycles had stopped during the past year), headache, ataxia, dizziness, seizure, syncope, pain, depression, anhedonia, expansive mood, distractibility, anxiety, memory difficulties, sleep disturbance, auditory and visual hallucinations, suicidal ideation, and homicidal idea-tion. She took no medications and had no known allergies to medications. The patient reported the following information. She was born in the southeastern United States and grew up in an orphanage. She had skipped grades in elementary and high school because of high intelligence and then had obtained doctoral degrees in psychology from “Northwestern International University in Denmark” and “Panworld University in China.” Six years earlier, she had moved to New York City, where she lived in a downtown hotel. She was employed as a scientist to perform online research and volunteered for New York City hospitals and the U.S. Navy. She was unmarried and had no children, and she had no family or friends who could provide collateral information. She did not use alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs. Her family psychiatric and medical history was unknown, since she was adopted. She had no history of legal problems. Because of concern about the patient’s inability to protect herself in a new environment, given her impaired judgment and disorganized thinking, an order that authorized temporary involuntary hospitalization was implemented.1 The patient was admitted to the inpatient psychiatry unit. Results of urinalysis and the venous blood pH were normal; laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Little: A chest radiograph showed clear lungs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Fig. 2), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed mild mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinus without acute intracranial abnormality. There was no evidence of infarct, such as intracranial mass, cerebral edema, or restricted diffusion, and there was no evidence of white-matter disease or volume loss. Dr. Crall: Laboratory test results that were obtained on the third hospital day are shown in Table 1. Results of additional diagnostic tests were received.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2008,28,nejm-case-2008-28,"An 8-Day-Old Infant with Congenital Deafness, Lethargy, and Hypothermia","Dr. Sarah M. Barnett (Neurology): An 8-day-old boy was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of this hospital because of weakness and lethargy. The patient was born after a full-term gestation to a 26-year-old primigravida at a birthing center. The mother had received prenatal care with normal screening laboratory tests, including a positive test result for antibody to rubella and negative test results for group B streptococcus, rapid plasma reagin, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus. The prenatal course was uncomplicated; the mother had no fever or other symptoms of infection, and there was no change in fetal movement in the days before delivery. The birth weight was 3 kg, the length 49.5 cm, and the head circumference 33 cm. The Apgar scores were 6 at 1 minute and 7 at 5 minutes. Immediately after birth, there were signs of respiratory distress, including grunting and flaring, and the infant was admitted to another hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.8°C, the pulse 128 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 44 breaths per minute with grunting, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. A systolic ejection murmur (grade 2 out of 6) was heard; hypospadias and a hydrocele in the right scrotum were noted, and ecchy-mosis was present on the left thumb. The remainder of the examination was normal. Newborn screening for metabolic abnormalities was normal; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm. The respiratory distress resolved. Brain-stem auditory evoked responses were abnormal bilaterally. An appointment was made for additional audiology testing, and the patient was discharged home on the fourth hospital day with follow-up later that day with his pediatrician. During the next 5 days, he breast-fed well and was appropriately interactive. Two days before admission, additional outpatient auditory testing confirmed the presence of bilateral congenital sensorineural deafness. On the day before admission, the patient was seen by his pediatrician at noon and appeared well. In the midafternoon, he became disinterested in breast-feeding and was lethargic, with intermittent grunting. The rectal temperature was 34.4°C. He was taken to the emergency department of the other hospital. On examination, he was listless and hypo-tonic and cried with painful stimuli. The pulse and blood pressure were normal; the temperature was 34.7°C, and the oxygen saturation was more than 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Specimens of blood and urine were sent for culture; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Chest radiographs and an electrocardiogram were normal. A lumbar puncture was performed; the cerebrospinal fluid was bloody and did not clear. Ampicillin, gentamicin, and fluids were administered intravenously. The temperature rose to 36.1°C with external warming. Early the next morning, he was transferred by ambulance to this hospital and was admitted. Additional history was obtained; during the admission immediately after his birth, he had been placed on an adult bed and had fallen to the floor unobserved, where he was found crying, with no evidence of bruising. There were no allergies to medications and no family history of congenital deafness, coagulopathy, or bleeding diathesis. His parents were unrelated and of European descent and in good health. His mother’s blood type was O Rh-positive. On examination, the infant had no dysmorphic features. The temperature was 36.3°C, with an external heating source, the pulse 154 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 100/65 mm Hg. The respiratory rate was 33 breaths per minute, with intermittent grunting and stridor; the oxygen saturation was 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 2.925 kg, and the head circumference 35.5 cm. The skin was pink, with no lesions. His eyes were closed, a rooting reflex was present, and there was minimal spontaneous movement. The frontal fontanelle was tense, and the posterior fontanelle full but not bulging; the sutures were well approximated. The findings on laboratory testing of coagulation measures, serum electrolytes, bilirubin, and renal function were normal; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain showed ventriculomegaly with intra-ventricular hemorrhage, along with hemorrhage and edema involving the cerebral and cerebellar white matter bilaterally, the deep gray nuclei, and the pons. Culture of the urine for cytomegalovirus was negative. Ampicillin and gentamicin were continued; acyclovir was added intravenously, and one dose of hydralazine was administered. Flexible laryngoscopy revealed normal vocal-cord motion for most but not all breaths. There was no evidence of laryngomalacia. Approximately 8 hours after arrival, examination by a neurologist revealed marked bulging of the anterior fontanelle, although there was no resistance to flexion of the neck. Breathing was irregular and labored. The eyes were tightly closed; there was no conjunctival injection or discharge. The left pupil was 3 mm in diameter, and the right 1.5 mm. The eyes were deviated leftward and did not move beyond the midline with oculocephalic maneuvers. The arms and legs had increased extensor tone, which increased with body stimulation. The toes were upgoing bilaterally. Midazolam and morphine were administered; the trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was begun for respiratory distress and increased work of breathing. A right transfontanelle ventricular tap was performed at the bedside, with aspiration of 5 ml of bloody cerebrospinal fluid, which did not appear to be under increased pressure. After the procedure, the fontanelles became soft, the eyes were divergent, and the tone in the limbs decreased, with resolution of extensor posturing. Results of laboratory analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid are shown in Table 2. Phenobarbital was begun. Fifteen hours after admission, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealed symmetrical, bilateral low signal on T2-weighted images in all deep gray nuclei and the centrum semiovale, consistent with recent hemorrhage, intraventricular extension, and ventriculomegaly. Petechial hemorrhage was present in the pons and dentate nuclei. Increased T2-weighted signal was present throughout the supratentorial and infratentorial white matter, indicating diffuse edema. The findings on MRA were normal, and no dural venous sinus thrombosis was present. Ophthalmologic examination disclosed mild bilateral subconjunctival and intraretinal hemorrhages, with no retinitis or vitri-tis. Analysis of arterial blood gases was normal. On the second hospital day, ventriculostomy was performed in the operating room, and a catheter was placed in the right occipital ventricle with a subcutaneous reservoir for ventricular subgal-eal shunting. Routine analysis of the urine was normal; other laboratory-test results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Intravenous thiamine (at a dose of 5 mg daily) was begun. Spontaneous activity, even with lightened sedation, was minimal, with poor respiratory effort. The following day, ultrasonog-raphy of the brain revealed extensive white-matter edema and hemorrhage, ventriculomegaly, intra-ventricular hemorrhage, and edema and ischemic changes in the deep gray nuclei. On the fourth hospital day, repeated MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) revealed evolution of the severe diffuse injury with additional volume loss. An electroencephalogram, obtained while the patient was receiving phenobarbital, revealed generalized delta waves and some theta slowing, with no evidence of seizures. Noxious stimulation produced no reaction. On the fifth hospital day, at the request of the parents, mechanical ventilation was stopped, and comfort measures were administered. The patient died several hours later. An autopsy was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2018,28,nejm-case-2018-28,"A 39-Year-Old Man with Epistaxis, Pain and Erythema of the Forearm, and Pancytopenia","Dr. Ingabire G. Balinda (Medicine): A 39-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of epistaxis, pain and erythema of the right forearm, and pancytopenia. The patient had been in his usual state of good health until 6 months before admission, when episodes of spontaneous, prolonged epistaxis developed. Two months before admission, the patient noticed spontaneous bruising of the arms and legs. Four days before admission, pain, swelling, and erythema of the dorsal aspect of the distal right forearm developed, without any preceding trauma; the pain was worse with extension of the fourth and fifth fingers. The same day, fevers, chills, and night sweats developed, along with nausea and frontal headache. The patient took naproxen and acetaminophen, and he had relief of symptoms except for the pain, swelling, and erythema of the right forearm. The patient presented to an urgent care center for evaluation. The temperature was 36.8°C, the blood pressure 140/88 mm Hg, the pulse 76 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. There was pain in the dorsal aspect of the distal right forearm, with resistance to extension of the wrist and fourth and fifth fingers. There was a resolving ecchymosis on the left medial proximal calf. Laboratory testing reportedly revealed pancytopenia. Ceftriaxone was administered, and the patient was asked to present to an emergency department for further evaluation. In the emergency department of this hospital, the patient reported no vision changes, diplopia, dysarthria, numbness, tingling, weakness, cough, dyspnea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, or dysuria. There was no fatigue, weight loss, rhinorrhea, pharyngitis, joint stiffness, joint swelling, or myalgias. There was no history of hemarthrosis. Review of previous records revealed that he had had a normal complete blood count approximately 10 years before admission. Six months before admission, the patient had donated blood successfully. The patient consumed alcohol three times per week; he did not use tobacco or illicit drugs. He lived outside Boston with his wife and two children, all of whom were in good health. He worked for a lighting company and did his own yard work; there was no history of a recent tick bite. He was sexually active with his wife, who worked as a nurse and had sustained a needlestick injury 2 years earlier. He had traveled to Mexico 15 years before admission, Puerto Rico 7 months before admission, Missouri 6 months before admission, Ohio 4 months before admission, and New York 1 month before admission. The patient’s father had coronary artery disease, and his paternal grandmother had lung cancer. On examination, the weight was 95.3 kg, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 30. The patient appeared to be well but was pale. No lymphadenopathy or hepatospleno-megaly was detected. The right forearm was ery-thematous and mildly swollen, without indura-tion or crepitus; wrist extension was limited by pain in the forearm. There were ecchymoses in the left antecubital fossa. There were no purpura, but scattered petechiae were noted on the palate. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, folate, vitamin B12, methylmalonic acid, uric acid, creatine kinase, and thyrotropin were normal, as were results of tests of kidney and liver function. A direct antiglobu-lin test was negative. Urinalysis was normal. An assay for antinuclear antibodies was positive at a titer of 1:40 with a speckled pattern, and an assay for rheumatoid factor antibodies was negative. Screening tests were negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen and HIV type 1 and type 2 antibodies, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, hepatitis B virus core IgM antibodies, and hepatitis C virus antibodies. Cyto-megalovirus DNA viral load was not detected. Tests for histoplasma antigen in urine and for heterophile antibodies were negative, as was an interferon-gamma release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. F. Joseph Simeone: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of oral and intravenous contrast material, revealed enlarged subcarinal, right hi-lar, and diaphragmatic pericaval lymph nodes (Fig. 1A). The spleen measured 18.3 cm in the maximum dimension (normal value, ≤12 cm), and there was evidence of retroperitoneal lymphade-nopathy, including a portacaval lymph node measuring 3.2 cm in diameter, an aortocaval lymph node measuring 1.2 cm in diameter, and a superior pancreatic lymph node measuring 2.9 cm in diameter (Fig. 1B). CT of the right humerus and forearm, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a rim-enhancing fluid collection, measuring 3.1 cm in the maximum dimension, in the extensor compartment of the mid-forearm (Fig. 1C), with overlying skin thickening and subcutaneous edema along the dorsal forearm and without evidence of acute fracture or dislocation. Dr. Balinda: The patient was admitted to the hospital, and ceftriaxone was continued. Dr. Simeone: On the day after admission, the fluid collection in the right forearm was aspirated with the use of ultrasonographic guidance (Fig. 1D). The fluid was sent to the microbiology laboratory for evaluation. Dr. Balinda: The hematology service was consulted. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed evidence of anisocytosis, hypochromia, and a few large platelets and no evidence of blasts or hemolysis. Blood cultures showed no growth. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2020,41,nejm-case-2020-41,A 62-Year-Old Man with Memory Loss and Odd Behavior,"Dr. David L. Perez: A 62-year-old, left-handed man was seen in the memory disorders clinic of this hospital because of memory loss, personality changes, and odd behavior. Approximately 5 years before this evaluation, the patient’s wife noticed that the patient was becoming more forgetful and napped frequently during the day. She also noticed that he lacked initiative in his professional work; for example, he was not charging or collecting payments for services. The patient’s coworkers observed that he was having difficulty focusing and frequently required redirection when interacting with clients. The patient had no concerns other than intermittent mild headaches. During the next few years, the patient’s wife noticed that he became distant with family, was less talkative, and lacked interest in activities that he had previously enjoyed. He made numerous costly errors at work and also had odd behaviors. For example, he entered the kitchen of a local restaurant without permission; on another occasion, he inadvertently borrowed a vehicle from a colleague without first notifying that person. In another instance, while the patient’s vehicle was stopped for a routine traffic infraction, he became irritable and briefly evaded police, incurring several legal violations. One year before this evaluation, the patient was seen in the neurology and psychiatry clinics of another hospital at his wife’s request. He had no concerns about his neurocognitive state. He noted that he was sleeping as little as 2 to 3 hours per night but had a good energy level. He reported intermittent mild headaches. He had no sinus pain, numbness, tingling, or constitutional symptoms. On examination, the patient was alert and oriented, with some inattention and confabulation. The remainder of the neurologic examination was normal. A complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of tests of kidney, liver, and thyroid function. Tests for antinuclear antibodies and for Lyme disease were negative. The patient received diagnoses of attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder, adjustment disorder, and avoidant personality traits. Psychotherapy was initiated, and mela-tonin and dextroamphetamine–amphetamine were prescribed. The patient had ongoing personality changes and difficulties with organization and daily functioning, and he was evaluated in the memory disorders clinic of this hospital at his wife’s request. She reported that dextroamphetamine– amphetamine had not improved his overall organizational abilities. Although he was physically capable of conducting activities of daily living, he required prompting to perform tasks to maintain basic hygiene, such as bathing. He no longer participated in the management of family finances; he was unable to maintain employment and was receiving disability payments. He had new odd behaviors, such as urinating in public on a few occasions and frequently and unexpectedly visiting family members’ workplaces and neighbors’ homes at late hours. He also had obsessive behaviors, such as calling his children multiple times to confirm details before a scheduled gathering. The patient was unaware of his inappropriate and unusual behaviors. He did not report having anxiety, depression, or perceptual disturbances. Approximately 10 years before the current evaluation, the patient had received a diagnosis of Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia. Because he was asymptomatic, treatment was deferred. Two years before the current evaluation, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed for disease surveillance. There were multiple enlarged hilar and retrocrural lymph nodes, measuring up to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension, with no evidence of or-ganomegaly or focal osseous lesions. The patient attended routine oncology appointments for disease monitoring. Two months before the current evaluation, a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel were normal. The blood IgM level was 2850 mg per deciliter (reference range, 40 to 230), and the β2-microglobulin level 2.8 mg liter (reference range, 0 to 2.7); these values had been stable since the diagnosis of Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia was established. Other medical history included mitral regurgitation, nephrolithiasis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, bilateral knee osteoarthritis, and spinal stenosis. There was no history of head trauma, stroke, or seizure. Medications included a multivitamin and fish oil; there were no known allergies to medications. The patient did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. He lived with his wife, and his daughters and grandchildren lived nearby. He had graduated from high school and trade school before serving in the navy for 2 years; he did not serve in a combat role or have known exposure to toxins. Both of his parents had heart disease, a sister had depression, and a maternal uncle had throat cancer. There was no family history of dementia, neurologic disorders, or psychiatric disorders. On examination, the patient was well groomed, pleasant, and cooperative. Physical appearance was normal. His Mini–Mental State Examination score was 23 on a scale ranging from 0 to 30 (with higher scores indicating better cognitive function), and his Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score was 15 on a scale ranging from 0 to 30 (with higher scores indicating better cognitive function). Orientation was intact except for an error in recalling the date. On testing of attention, the patient had difficulty with serial sevens calculations and with the digit-span test, in which a sequence of numbers is read by the examiner and repeated by the patient; he repeated only four digits of the forward span correctly. On testing of memory, he repeated five out of five words after two trials and did not spontaneously recall any of the words after 5 minutes; he recalled three of the words when selecting from a written list of word choices. Spontaneous speech production was diminished. On testing of confrontation naming, he identified a camel when shown a picture of a giraffe. On testing of semantic and phonemic fluency, he spontaneously generated six animal names over a 1-minute period, as well as one word that begins with the letter “F” over a 1-minute period. The clock-drawing test showed good organization. The letter–number sequencing test (also known as the alternating trail-making test) revealed impaired set shifting, and Luria’s three-step test revealed impaired motor sequencing. On testing of verbal abstraction, when the patient was asked to describe how a train and a bicycle are similar, he stated, “A train is bigger than a bicycle and would crush the bicycle.” Judgment and insight were markedly impaired. An evaluation of cranial nerve function, sensation, power, bulk, tone, coordination, and gait was normal. Deep-tendon reflexes were normal, and the toes were downgoing bilaterally. Bilateral grasp reflexes and palmomental reflexes were present. Testing for syphilis was negative. The blood folate level was 8.2 ng per milliliter (19 nmol per liter; reference range, >4.7 ng per milliliter [11 nmol per liter]), and the vitamin B12 level 258 pg per milliliter (190 pmol per liter; reference range, >231 pg per milliliter [170 pmol per liter]). On neuropsychological assessment, social engagement was limited, with a few moments of giggling that was incongruent with the context. Spontaneous speech was fluent but impoverished. There was frequent use of the word “thing” to replace lower-frequency words and periodic use of phonemic paraphasias such as “a fenco type of thing.” Thoughts were coherent but impoverished, tangential, and perseverative. Attention and executive functioning were markedly impaired during assessments of verbal fluency, divided attention, abstract reasoning, and inhibitory control. Visual memory was relatively intact, but verbal memory was impaired in terms of encoding and retrieval. When the patient was asked to describe an image, written language was severely impaired but oral language was relatively intact. A diagnostic test was reviewed, and a diagnosis was made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2011,32,nejm-case-2011-32,A 19-Year-Old Man with Recurrent Pancreatitis,"Dr. Christopher J. Moran (Pediatric Gastroenterology): A 19-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of recurrent pancreatitis. The patient had been well until approximately 6 months earlier, when lethargy and epigastric pain developed, associated with a dry throat, subjective fever, and frontal headache, which were relieved by acetaminophen. He went to a clinic for evaluation. He reported that 3 days earlier he had consumed six alcoholic beverages in one sitting (0.7 to 1.0 liters of vodka and two beers). On examination, the blood pressure was reportedly 140/100 mm Hg. A rapid screening test for streptococcus was positive. Penicillin and an antacid were prescribed, without improvement in the pain. Two days after the onset of pain, the patient saw his pediatrician. On examination, the blood pressure was 142/100 to 152/100 mm Hg. A monospot test was negative. The epigastric pain decreased slightly, and pain in the flanks and back developed. He returned to his pediatrician; laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen reportedly showed fat stranding and inflammation of the pancreas, features consistent with pancreatitis, with a normal gallbladder and no evidence of dilatation or obstruction of the biliary tree. He was transferred to this hospital. The patient reported constant epigastric pain, which he rated at 7 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The pain intermittently increased in intensity and changed location with positioning. The patient had had constipation, difficulty sleeping because of the pain, decreased appetite, and during the previous week, weight loss of approximately 4.5 kg, without nausea, vomiting, or hematuria. His symptoms were not relieved by the administration of antacids, acetaminophen, lansoprazole, psyllium fiber supplement, polyethylene glycol, or defecation. The temperature was 38.1°C, the blood pressure 139 to 162 mm Hg systolic and 77 to 90 mm Hg diastolic, and the pulse 96 beats per minute; the respiratory rate was normal, and the oxygen saturation was 95% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 142.2 kg, the height 188 cm, and the body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 40 (>97th percentile). The posterior oropharynx was erythematous, with moist mucous membranes; there was white plaque on the tongue. The abdomen was soft, with decreased bowel sounds, tenderness to deep palpation in the epigastrium, and slight guarding; there was no distention or rebound. There was tenderness in the midback and no tenderness at the costovertebral angle. The skin was diffusely flushed on the cheeks, extremities, and trunk. The red-cell indexes and platelet count were normal, as were tests of renal function and measurements of electrolytes, glucose, phosphorus, calcium, protein, albumin, total and direct biliru-bin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotrans-ferase, cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed 1+ ketones and bili-rubin and trace urobilinogen. The patient was admitted to this hospital. Intravenous fluids, narcotic analgesia, and omepra-zole were administered, with improvement. Initial restriction of oral intake was followed by a gradually increasing diet. He was discharged on the fifth day on a low-fat diet and referred to the Division of Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine for primary care, blood-pressure monitoring, a weight-loss program, and a discussion about high-risk behaviors, including binge drinking. At follow-up, results of thyroid-function tests were normal and testing for hepatitis B and C viruses was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. The patient abstained from alcohol for 3 months and then began to drink socially again. Two weeks later, severe abdominal pain recurred, with radiation to the back and decreased appetite. On the fifth day of symptoms, he was readmitted to this hospital. On examination, the blood pressure was 142/98 mm Hg; other vital signs were normal. There were abdominal striae, decreased bowel sounds, a palpable liver edge, and mild tenderness to deep palpation in the epigastrium; the remainder of the examination was normal. The prothrombin time was 14.4 seconds (reference range, 10.3 to 13.2); other tests of coagulation and renal function were normal, as were measurements of electrolytes, glucose, protein, albumin, globulin, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and as-partate aminotransferase. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Results of an abdominal ultrasound examination were normal. Intravenous fluids and morphine were administered, with improvement. The patient was discharged on the fourth day. At follow-up visits in the Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine Division during the next 6 weeks, the patient felt well and the blood pressure was normal; test results are shown in Table 1. During the next 5 weeks, he consumed one or two alcoholic beverages approximately twice a week. Three days before this admission, abdominal pain (rated at up to 9 on a scale of 0 to 10) recurred that was associated with nausea, decreased appetite, clamminess, and light-headedness. He was readmitted to this hospital. The patient had received all routine immunizations and had been well. He was a college student and lived in an apartment with other students when not living with his parents and sibling. He smoked one or two cigarettes weekly and reported no use of illicit drugs. His girlfriend had recently had infectious mononucleosis. His father had high cholesterol, his maternal grandfather had coronary artery disease, his maternal grandmother had throat cancer, and other maternal relatives had type 1 diabetes mellitus and gallstones; paternal and maternal family members reportedly had alcoholism. On examination, the blood pressure was 160/93 mm Hg and the weight 133.5 kg; other vital signs and the oxygen saturation were normal. There were decreased bowel sounds, pain in the upper quadrants that radiated to the back and occurred at rest and with palpation, and no distention or rebound. The remainder of the examination was normal. Urinalysis revealed clear, amber urine with 1+ bilirubin, 2+ ketones, and trace albumin and urobilinogen; it was otherwise normal. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed mild splenomegaly (14 cm). Intravenous fluids, raniti-dine, and narcotic analgesics were administered, with symptomatic improvement. On the second day, tests for heterophile antibody and antibodies to Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) were negative; T-lymphocyte subsets were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen after the administration of gadolinium and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) revealed a normal pancreas and pancreatic duct. The common bile duct was normal, with no calculi. A diagnostic test was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,22,nejm-case-2012-22,A 34-Year-Old Man with Intractable Vomiting after Ingestion of an Unknown Substance,"Dr. Areej El-Jawahri (Internal Medicine): A 34-year-old man was seen in the emergency department at this hospital because of vomiting and abdominal pain. The patient had been well until the morning of admission. He had spent the night out with friends drinking alcohol, and when he returned home in the morning intoxicated, his wife reportedly gave him lemonade into which she had mixed a packet of powder that she had been told would induce vomiting and cause him to stop drinking alcohol. Approximately 15 minutes later, abdominal pain developed, followed by nausea and more than 50 episodes of vomiting, as well as diarrhea. Eight hours later, he came to the emergency department at this hospital. On arrival, the temperature was 36.4°C, the blood pressure 91/63 mm Hg, the pulse 104 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation was 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He vomited intermittently while in the screening area, and normal saline and ondansetron were administered intravenously. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. On reevaluation, the patient reported persistent nausea, with intermittent vomiting and abdominal cramping, and no fevers, chills, night sweats, rectal bleeding, or hematemesis. He reported that he had been drinking tequila early that morning. He was born in Central America, lived with his wife and their children, and worked outdoors as a laborer. He took no regular medications and reported no allergies. He smoked tobacco, drank alcohol (12 beers per weekend), and reported no use of illicit drugs. His wife reported that the powder was called tártaro emético and came from Central America. On examination, the patient was awake and vomiting intermittently. The blood pressure was 122/75 mm Hg, the pulse was 72 beats per minute, and other vital signs were unchanged; the weight was 63.3 kg. The abdomen was soft, with hypoactive bowel sounds and without distention, tenderness, or masses. The skin was warm and dry. The remainder of the examination was normal. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm at 81 beats per minute and early repolarization and was otherwise normal. Toxicologic screening of the blood was negative; screening of the urine revealed the presence of cocaine. Other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. The urine was clear and yellow, with a pH of 6.0, 1+ bilirubin, 3+ blood, 3+ protein, and trace ketones; microscopical analysis revealed 3 to 5 red cells, 10 to 20 white cells, very few renal tubular cells, and a few squamous cells per high-power field, as well as the presence of mucin and more than 100 hyaline casts, 20 to 100 granular casts, and 20 to 100 cellular casts per low-power field. After further questioning and being warned that her husband could die if we were unable to identify the substance, the patient’s wife produced a package of the powder, which was labeled tártaro emético but did not contain a list of ingredients. An Internet search suggested that it contained antimony potassium tartrate. This information was reported to the Regional Center for Poison Control and Prevention; the staff recommended cardiac monitoring and continued intravenous fluids while further research on the toxicity of the ingested powder could be accomplished. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexa-late) was administered. One hour later, the poison control center telephoned with additional recommendations: continuous cardiac monitoring and serial ECGs, serial measurement of potassium levels, the administration of activated charcoal, and chelation therapy with dimercaprol (previously known as British antilewisite, or BAL), 3 mg per kilogram of body weight, administered intramuscularly every 4 to 6 hours. Activated charcoal was administered, and the patient was admitted to the medical service. Chelation therapy with dimer-caprol was initiated. The first dose was followed by transient flushing and pruritus, and diphen-hydramine was given before the second and third doses. After the third dose, crushing sub-sternal chest pain and difficulty breathing developed. An ECG showed ST-segment coving and biphasic T-waves in leads V2, V3, and V4. Diltia-zem, acetylsalicylic acid, and simvastatin were administered, and dimercaprol was stopped. Approximately 23 hours after the patient’s arrival, the administration of 2,3-dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA, also known as succimer) was begun. The level of troponin T was normal, tests for antibodies to hepatitis B virus surface antigen and total antibodies to hepatitis A virus were positive, and tests for hepatitis A IgM anti-bodies and antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen and hepatitis C virus were negative; additional test results are shown in Table 1. The patient remained alert and oriented, without jaundice. On the evening of the first hospital day, the temperature rose to 38.3°C, and other vital signs were stable; the liver was palpated 2 cm below the costal margin. A chest radio-graph was normal. The chest pain became intermittent. The poison control center was consulted again; DMSA was stopped, and vitamin K, N-acetylcysteine, potassium, and phosphorus were administered. Additional diagnostic tests were performed, and management decisions were made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2020,16,nejm-case-2020-16,A 47-Year-Old Woman with Recurrent Melanoma and Pulmonary Nodules,"Dr. Justine V. Cohen: A 47-year-old woman with malignant melanoma was seen in the pulmonary clinic of this hospital because of new abnormal findings on chest imaging. The patient had observed routine quarterly surveillance imaging after resection of right axillary melanoma, radiation therapy, and initiation of pembrolizumab therapy 3 years earlier. The most recent imaging was performed 6 days before this evaluation. Dr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a patchy consolidation in the left upper lobe, bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and numerous bilateral scattered solid pulmonary nodules with associated ground-glass halos (Fig. 1A through 1D). These findings were new relative to the most recent imaging performed 3 months earlier. Other pulmonary nodules, measuring 2 to 4 mm in greatest dimension, in the right upper lobe that had been noted on imaging studies obtained during the previous 3 years were stable. Changes in the right upper lobe that had resulted from radiation therapy were also stable relative to previous imaging studies. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a hemangioma in the right hepatic lobe that measured 9 mm in greatest dimension and a cyst in the left hepatic lobe that measured 15 mm in diameter; both were unchanged from previous imaging studies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was normal. Dr. Cohen: The patient was referred by her oncologist for urgent evaluation in the pulmonary clinic of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient reported no symptoms, specifically no fever, weight loss, night sweats, fatigue, malaise, headache, ","{'Problem Representation': [], 'Assessing Probabilities of Diagnoses': []}",Histoplasmosis. ,Pulmonary histoplasmosis. ,Pulmonary histoplasmosis. ,0
NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2018,08,nejm-case-2018-08,A 55-Year-Old Woman with Shock and Labile Blood Pressure,"Dr. Nathalie Roy: A 55-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital for evaluation and treatment of cardiogenic shock. Approximately 4 months before presentation, the patient was admitted to a hospital in her home state for “pounding” in her chest, nausea, and diaphoresis that persisted for 40 minutes after a routine jog. The heart rate was 65 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 138/72 mm Hg; the remainder of the examination was normal. Four serial electrocardiograms were reportedly normal, but the tro-ponin I level was elevated, at 0.055 ng per milliliter, and 11 hours later, it had risen to 0.415 ng per milliliter (normal range, 0 to 0.045). Transthoracic echocar-diography revealed normal biventricular function. Coronary angiography revealed no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease; the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 5 mm Hg. After discharge (4 days after admission), cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed normal biventricular function and size, with no evidence of myocardial edema or fibrosis. Aspirin and a beta blocker were prescribed for presumed exercise-related supraventricular tachycardia. The symptoms did not recur, and the patient returned to jogging and stopped taking the beta blocker. On the day before her transfer to this hospital, she was on a downhill-skiing trip in Vermont. In the morning, she felt fatigued. In the afternoon, palpitations, dyspnea, and weakness developed while she was at the top of a mountain; the ski patrol took her down the mountain, and the symptoms abated. In the evening, while she was at dinner, she had acute nausea and emesis followed by chest pain and dyspnea. She was taken to a local emergency department. The heart rate was 111 beats per minute, the blood pressure 115/81 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 84% while she was breathing ambient air. Auscultation revealed diffuse crackles in the lungs. The troponin I level was 11.000 ng per milliliter (normal range, 0 to 0.045), the N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level 15,159 pg per milli-liter (normal range, 0 to 125), the lactate level 4.6 mmol per liter (41.0 mg per deciliter; normal range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [4.5 to 18.0 mg per deciliter]), the venous blood pH 7.22 (normal range, 7.38 to 7.46), and the white-cell count 36,100 per cubic millimeter (normal range, 4500 to 11,000). Bedside cardiac ultrasonography revealed severe left ventricular dysfunction with apical ballooning. Intravenous infusions of heparin and furosemide were administered, and the patient was transferred by helicopter to a nearby tertiary care center for treatment of suspected cardiogenic shock. On the patient’s arrival at the tertiary care center, the temperature was 37.2°C, the heart rate 143 beats per minute, the blood pressure 96/72 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 84% while she was breathing ambient air and 88 to 94% while she was receiving oxygen through a non-rebreather face mask. On physical examination, she appeared fatigued and had jugular venous distention, diffuse crackles in the lungs, and cold arms and legs. The troponin I level was 4.790 ng per milliliter (normal range, <0.034), the white-cell count 30,240 per cubic millimeter (normal range, 4500 to 11,000), the arterial blood pH 7.08 (normal range, 7.35 to 7.45), the lactate level 5.9 mmol per liter (53 mg per deciliter; normal range, <2.0 mmol per liter [<18 mg per deciliter]), the NT-proBNP level 24,900 pg per milliliter (normal range, <300), and the creati-nine level 1.41 mg per deciliter (125 μmol per liter; normal range for women, 0.52 to 1.04 mg per deciliter [46 to 92 μmol per liter]). Chest radiography revealed diffuse pulmonary edema. Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia and T-wave inversions in leads V4 through V6. The trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was initiated for respiratory failure. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 15% and left ventricular apical akinesis, as well as severe right ventricular apical dysfunction. Infusions of norepinephrine, dobutamine, epinephrine, amio-darone, propofol, midazolam, fentanyl, and sodium bicarbonate were administered. Empirical methylprednisolone was administered for presumed myocarditis. Coronary angiography revealed normal coronary arteries; the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 38 mm Hg. A percutaneous transaortic left ventricular assist device was placed. After the institution of mechanical circulatory support, the intravenous doses of norepinephrine, dobutamine, and epinephrine were tapered and eventually stopped. Hematuria developed, and the urine output declined. The blood pressure was labile, ranging from 60/40 to 140/110 mm Hg, and an infusion of sodium nitroprusside was administered for control of elevated blood pressure. The patient was transferred by helicopter to this hospital. On the patient’s arrival at this hospital, additional history was obtained from her husband. She had a history of thyroid cancer (unknown pathologic subtype) that had been treated with thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine ablation. Medications included levothyroxine and a calcium supplement. The use of cefadroxil had caused the Stevens–Johnson syndrome. She did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She was employed in health care, was married, and had one healthy daughter. Her maternal grandfather had died from myocardial infarction at 60 years of age, her father had had an aortic-valve replacement, and her mother had had lung cancer. On examination, the temperature was 36.9°C, the heart rate 132 beats per minute, the blood pressure 105/72 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator (positive end-expiratory pressure, 12; tidal volume, 400 ml; fraction of inspired oxygen, 1.0; respiratory rate, 16 breaths per minute). The pupils were reactive to light in a symmetric but slightly sluggish manner. The patient was able to follow simple commands. She had no masses in the neck or exophthalmos. The jugular veins appeared distended. Auscultation of the chest revealed the hum of the ventricular assist device, distant tachycardic heart sounds, and scattered crackles in the lungs. The ventricular assist device had been secured in place by way of the left groin. She had 1+ pedal edema bilaterally and no rash or lymphadenopathy. A small amount of reddish brown urine was noted. Levels of thyrotropin, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed 3+ blood. Tests of a nasopharyngeal swab for nucleic acids of influenza A and B and respiratory syn-cytial virus and for metapneumovirus antigens were negative, as was combination testing for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 and p24 antigen. Dr. Ravi V. Shah: Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia, poor R-wave progression, T-wave inversions in leads V3  through V6  and in inferior leads, low QRS voltage, and a prolonged corrected QT (QTc) interval (Fig. 1). Chest radiography revealed diffuse interstitial infiltrates, small bilateral pleural effusions, and the tip of the ventricular assist device projecting over the left ventricle. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, with an estimated ejection fraction of 20% and severe mid-to-apical hypokinesis, as well as right ventricular free-wall and apical dysfunction, no clinically significant valvular disease, and a small pericardial effusion (see Video 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). On echocardiography, the tip of the ventricular assist device was in the appropriate position in the left ventricle. Dr. Roy: Shortly after the patient’s arrival at this hospital, hypotension again developed, and infusions of milrinone, epinephrine, and norepi-nephrine were administered. Femoral venoarte-rial extracorporeal life support was initiated to facilitate sufficient cardiac output, since the percutaneous ventricular assist device had provided insufficient support and caused increasing hemolysis.1 Continuous venovenous hemofiltration was initiated for anuria, fluid overload, and acidosis in the context of acute kidney injury. Methyl-prednisolone was administered intravenously. During the first 3 hospital days, the blood pressure remained labile, with the systolic blood pressure ranging from 65 to 205 mm Hg, despite stable levels of sedation and extracorporeal life support. The patient intermittently received an infusion of nitroprusside for hypertension and received infusions of norepinephrine and vaso-pressin during episodes of hypotension. On the third hospital day, transesophageal echocardiography revealed slight improvement in global ventricular function. Extracorporeal life support was discontinued, and milrinone therapy was continued. While the patient was in the operating room for decannulation of extracorpo-real life support and removal of the ventricular assist device, a left ventricular endomyocardial biopsy was performed. Dr. James R. Stone: The biopsy specimen was evaluated with the use of routine, special, and immunohistochemical stains.2 Examination of the specimen revealed acute and healing myocardial injury (Fig. 2). There were focal necrotic myocytes, which were C4d+ on immunohisto-",{'Pheochromocytoma': []},Takotsubo cardiomyopathy due to pheochromo-cytoma.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,25,nejm-case-2019-25,A 41-Year-Old Pregnant Woman with Abdominal Pain,"Dr. Madhukar S. Patel (Surgery): A 41-year-old pregnant woman was seen in the emergency department of this hospital at 36 weeks 3 days of gestation because of abdominal pain. Six and a half months before this evaluation, when the patient was at her initial routine prenatal visit, transvaginal ultrasonography revealed a normal intrauterine gestational sac and embryo. The date of the last menstrual period was unknown, and ultrasonographic measurements were used to determine the estimated due date. Thereafter, prenatal follow-up was uneventful. Fifteen hours before the current evaluation, abdominal pain developed suddenly after the patient had eaten breakfast. The pain was in the right lower quadrant and was described as sharp and constant. She rated the pain at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain; she noted that the pain was more severe than it had been during her two previous vaginal deliveries, which had occurred without epidural anesthesia. She had no fever, chills, diarrhea, dysuria, hematuria, vaginal bleeding, or contractions, and fetal movement was normal. The patient took oral docusate, which did not relieve the pain, and then took acetaminophen, after which the pain decreased slightly. She called her obstetrician, who recommended that she present to the clinic for evaluation. In the obstetrics clinic, transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasonography were performed. The fetus was in cephalic presentation, with a biophysical profile score of 8/8 (indicating normal fetal well-being) and a fetal heart rate of 134 beats per minute. The placenta was positioned anteriorly, the cervical length was 21 mm, and the umbilical artery appeared normal on Doppler examination. The patient was referred to the emergency department of a local hospital for further evaluation and arrived approximately 7 hours after the onset of symptoms. In the emergency department of the other hospital, the patient reported that the abdominal pain persisted and that nausea had developed. Her surgical history consisted of breast augmentation surgery and extraction of wisdom teeth in the distant past. She was gravida 4, 2-0-1-2. Her first and third pregnancies had been uncomplicated and had resulted in vaginal deliveries at full term; the second pregnancy had ended in a spontaneous abortion. She was immune to varicella and rubella; tests performed during this pregnancy for syphilis, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, gonorrhea, chlamydia, human immunodeficiency virus, and group B streptococcus had been negative. The patient was taking prenatal vitamins and was allergic to iodine-containing contrast material, which had caused anaphylaxis. She lived with her husband and two children in a suburban neighborhood in New England. She did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. Her father had died of liver disease associated with alcohol use disorder; her mother had had cervical cancer and hypertension and had died of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm. On examination, the temperature was 36.7°C, the pulse 71 beats per minute, the blood pressure 113/67 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was gravid and soft, with hyperactive bowel sounds; on palpation, there was severe tenderness in the right lower quadrant that extended inferiorly to the inguinal region, with voluntary guarding and without rebound tenderness. Rovsing’s sign (pain in the right lower quadrant with palpation of the left lower quadrant) was present. A limited pelvic examination revealed that the cervix was closed, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Urinalysis showed cloudy, yellow urine, with a specific gravity of 1.002, moderate ketones, and few bacteria. The blood type was O, Rh-positive; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Acetaminophen and ondansetron were administered orally and normal saline intravenously. An imaging study was obtained; after the results were available, ampicillin–sulbactam and clinda-mycin were administered intravenously, and the patient was transferred by ambulance to the emergency department of this hospital for further treatment.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,02,nejm-case-2012-02,A 63-Year-Old Woman with Dyspnea and Rapidly Progressive Respiratory Failure,"Dr. Susan K. Mathai (Internal Medicine): A 63-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of rapidly progressive respiratory failure. The patient had a history of Poland syndrome (agenesis of the right breast, pec-toralis muscle, and the third and fourth costal cartilages) and had received a silicone implant in the right breast 28 years earlier. She had been well until 5 years before admission, when a diagnosis of granulomatous polyangiitis (formerly termed Wegener’s granulomatosis) was made, characterized by uveitis and pulmonary hemorrhage with respiratory failure and requiring intubation. Treatment with azathio-prine and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole resulted in improvement; the titer of antimyeloperoxidase antibodies normalized within 5 months after the start of treatment and remained normal. Nine months before admission, the patient reported pain associated with the right breast implant; it was removed and replaced with a saline implant at another hospital. For 6 weeks after the procedure, there was drainage of sanguinous fluid and local induration at the site. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. The dose of azathioprine was decreased from 75 mg to 50 mg daily. Because of persistent pain at the site, the implant was replaced 7 months before admission and again 3 weeks before admission, with reconstruction of the right chest wall. Five weeks before admission, the patient began to have dyspnea on exertion and intermittent back pain. The platelet count reportedly decreased to 16,000 per cubic millimeter. A specimen from a bone marrow biopsy reportedly revealed an increased number of megakaryocytes, which was suggestive of peripheral destruction of platelets. Azathioprine and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole were stopped, and prednisone (40 mg daily) and narcotic analgesia were administered. During the 2 weeks before admission, intravenous immune globulin and a dose of romiplostim were given, without improvement. Testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) was negative. The dose of prednisone was tapered to 20 mg daily. The day before admission, dyspnea worsened. The patient came to the emergency department at this hospital. The patient reported a nonproductive cough, pain in the right upper back, but no other chest-wall or breast pain; she reported no fevers, chills, sweats, hemoptysis, urinary or bowel symptoms, or edema. She had a history of hypothyroidism, hypertension, supra-ventricular tachycardia, hyperlipidemia, and herpes zoster in a thoracic dermatome (2 years earlier); she also had a remote history of chole-cystectomy and tonsillectomy. Medications included prednisone, atenolol, levothyroxine, simvastat-in, estrogen (vaginal), multivitamins, and iron. She had no known allergies. She was married, had no children, and worked in an office. She had stopped smoking 25 years earlier and drank alcohol rarely. Her mother had had hypertension and died of heart failure, and her father died of emphysema. On examination, the blood pressure was 119/56 mm Hg, the pulse 58 beats per minute, the temperature 35.6°C, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while she was breathing 3 liters of oxygen per minute through a nasal cannula. There were fine inspiratory crackles in both lungs, and there was an implant in the right breast, with well-healed scars on the right chest wall and breast without erythema, tenderness, fluctuance, crepitance, or drainage; there was no axillary lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination was normal. Serum levels of electrolytes, protein, albumin, globulin, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, as-partate aminotransferase, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, troponin T, troponin I, and creatine kinase isoenzymes were normal, as were results of tests of coagulation; other test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, after the administration of intravenous contrast material, performed according to pulmonary embolism protocol, revealed no evidence of pulmonary embolism. There were multifocal areas of ill-defined ground-glass opacities and consolidation in all lobes of the lungs and scattered discrete nodules, some with a surrounding ground-glass halo; there was layering of a small pleural effusion on the left side and a loculated pleural effusion within the right major fissure, and there were multiple pleural or pleural-based nodules. There was a right breast implant with a surrounding minimally enhancing soft-tissue mass containing foci of gas superiorly, which extended through the chest wall into the anterior mediastinum. A nasal specimen showed no evidence of respiratory viruses or methicillin-resistant staphy-lococcus. Blood cultures were sterile; urinalysis revealed trace ketones and protein and was otherwise normal. Vancomycin, cefepime, piperacillin– tazobactam, levofloxacin, trimethoprim–sulfa-methoxazole, metronidazole, oseltamivir, and methylprednisolone were administered, and le-vothyroxine, simvastatin, atenolol, and iron sulfate were continued. Oxygen supplementation was increased to 4 liters at rest and 6 liters when walking, to maintain oxygen saturation between 92 and 94%. Early on the third hospital day, the respiratory rate increased to 28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation decreased to 87%, and diffuse crackles were heard on auscultation. Serum levels of vitamin B12, folate, iron, iron-binding capacity, IgG and IgA were normal. Testing was negative for ANCA, lupus anticoagulant, antiphospholipid IgM and IgG antibodies, and urinary legionella antigen; other test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph showed persistent diffuse bilateral air-space opacities with multiple coalescing pulmonary nodules. Red cells and platelets were transfused. Dr. Meghan Sise (Internal Medicine): Later that day, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for elective intubation. Bronchoscopic examination with bronchoalveolar lavage of the right middle lobe revealed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. The lavage fluid was red, with a hemato-crit of less than 3.0% (reference range, 0) and a white-cell count of 463 per cubic millimeter (72% neutrophils, 2% band forms, 3% lymphocytes, 6% monocytes, 1% eosinophils, and 16% macrophages). Hemosiderin-laden macrophages were present. There was no evidence of respiratory viruses, fungi (including Pneumocystis jirovecii), bacteria, or acid-fast bacilli. After the procedure, hy-potension developed and pressors were begun. Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole was stopped, and liposomal amphotericin B and atovaquone were added. Pathological examination of a specimen from a bone marrow biopsy revealed trilin-eage hematopoiesis and no abnormal lymphocyte populations or cytogenetic abnormalities. On the fourth day, cultures remained negative, and antimicrobial agents except for atovaquone were stopped. During the next week, the patient remained dependent on the ventilator and pressors; large ecchymoses developed on the skin. Pulmonary suctioning produced thick, bloody sputum, and transfusions of platelets and fresh-frozen plasma were administered. Transthoracic echocardiogra-phy revealed right ventricular hypertrophy and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 74%. Amino-caproic acid, immune globulin, and romiplostim were administered, and parenteral nutrition was begun. On the ninth day, cyclophosphamide, mesna, and ganciclovir were begun. On the 10th day, testing for antibodies to Bor-relia burgdorferi, ehrlichia, and anaplasma was negative. The galactomannan antigen index of the bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid from the third day was 1.03 (negative test, <0.5). Repeat bronchos-copy revealed blood-tinged secretions in all segments of the lungs, without focal lesions or evidence of active bleeding. Examination of bronchial washings showed a moderate number of leukocytes, with no microorganisms, and testing for respiratory viruses was negative. The administration of doxycycline was begun. On the 13th day, cultures of the bronchoalve-olar-lavage fluid grew aspergillus. Doxycycline was stopped, voriconazole was begun, and ganciclo-vir was continued. On the 14th day, oxygen saturation decreased, and acidosis and renal failure developed (Table 1). In consultation with the patient’s family, a decision was made to continue care, without escalation for further deterioration. The next day, the patient died. An autopsy was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2011,12,nejm-case-2011-12,A 9-Month-Old Boy with Acute Liver Failure,"Dr. Jess L. Kaplan (Pediatrics): A 9-month-old boy was admitted to the hospital because of fever, diarrhea, and liver failure. The patient had been well until 2 days before admission, when lethargy, irritability, rhinorrhea, intermittent vomiting, and nonbloody diarrhea developed, with decreased oral intake. The next day, the temperature reportedly increased to 38.1°C. He was seen in a health center associated with this hospital; the temperature was 37.6°C, and the physical examination was normal. Acetaminophen and a pediatric oral electrolyte solution were prescribed for presumed viral gastroenteritis, and he was sent home. The next day, symptoms worsened; in the evening, he was brought to the emergency department at this hospital. The patient was born after a full-term gestation and was delivered vaginally; Ap-gar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Results of routine newborn metabolic screening were normal. Hepatitis B vaccine was administered before discharge. One month before admission, he reportedly had a respiratory infection; 3 days before admission, he had fallen while taking his first steps and bruised his forehead. He had been well otherwise, with normal growth and development. His only medication was acetaminophen (120 mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed for fevers) for 1 day; childhood immunizations were reportedly up to date. He had no known allergies. He lived with his mother, who had had respiratory symptoms for 1 week and received azithromycin. He did not attend day care and did not have known travel or toxic exposures, including mushroom ingestion. His mother had had seizures in childhood. On examination, he was listless, intermittently restless, and whimpering. The weight was 8.9 kg (25th to 50th percentile for age), the temperature 37.6°C, the blood pressure 95/46 mg Hg, and the pulse 133 beats per minute; the respiratory rate was 26 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The conjunctivae were pale and nonicteric. There was a bruise above the left eye. Bowel sounds were diminished, and the abdomen was soft, without tenderness or distention. The liver edge extended 4 to 5 cm below the costal margin. The remainder of the examination was normal. The levels of magnesium, C-reactive protein, amylase, lipase, iron, total iron-binding capacity, and lactate were normal; additional results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis was normal, and screening of the urine for toxins was negative. A radiograph of the abdomen showed a nonspecific bowel-gas pattern, with no evidence of free air or bowel obstruction. Intravenous fluids were administered. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain, without contrast administration, was normal. Ul-trasonography of the abdomen showed a slightly echogenic liver and pericholecystic fluid, with no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary-duct dilatation. After sedation with midazolam, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with the administration of oral and intravenous contrast material showed a markedly enlarged liver with diffuse hypoattenuation consistent with fatty infiltration and pericholecystic fluid. The CT examination was otherwise normal. The patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. A central line was placed in the femoral vein; cardiovascular and respiratory variables were monitored continuously; and oral intake was restricted. N-acetylcysteine and ceftri-axone were given; ranitidine and vitamin K were administered; lorazepam and morphine were given for agitation. The level of serum acetaminophen was less than 10.0 mg per liter (reference range, 10 to 25); none was detected in the urine. During the first 2 days, testing for serum hetero-phile antibodies, Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), and hepatitis A and C viruses was negative, as were tests for respiratory viruses (adenovirus, influen-za A and B viruses, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus antigen) performed on a nasal specimen; testing for hepatitis B virus surface antibody was positive and surface antigen negative. Cultures of the blood, urine, and stool were sterile. Other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. During the next 2 days, hypotension and hy-poxemia developed, with systolic blood pressures of 60 to 70 mm Hg, diastolic pressures of 30 to 40 mm Hg, and an oxygen saturation of 88% while the patient was breathing ambient air; he became increasingly lethargic, with sluggish pu-pillary reactions. Oxygen by nasal cannula and normal saline boluses were administered; blood pressure returned to normal but then decreased; dopamine and norepinephrine were administered. Electrocardiography revealed a sinus rhythm of 153 beats per minute, with an incomplete right bundle-branch block and right ventricular hypertrophy; echocardiography was normal. CT of the head was normal. Testing for syphilis, antibodies to toxoplasma and parvovirus B19, bartonella (immunoglobulins IgG and IgM), varicella–zoster virus (IgG), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigen was negative; other results are shown in Table 1. On the third day, red cells were transfused; the hematocrit increased to 31.4%. The liver was 6 to 8 cm below the costal margin, extending to the umbilicus and firm to palpation. Additional test results were pending. A diagnostic procedure was performed. ",{},Fatty acid–oxidation defect (CACT vs. CPT2 deficiency). ,,Fatty acid–oxidation defect (CACT vs. CPT2 deficiency). ,0
NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2020,20,nejm-case-2020-20,A 7-Year-Old Girl with Severe Psychological Distress after Family Separation,"Dr. Rachel M. Erdil (Medicine and Pediatrics): A 7-year-old girl who had immigrated to the United States from Central America was evaluated in the asylum clinic of this hospital — where forensic medical evaluations of asylum seekers are performed to document evidence of persecution — because of psychological distress after family separation while in U.S. immigration detention. Seven months before this evaluation, the patient and her mother fled their village in Central America because of physical and emotional abuse. They traveled by foot, motorcycle, bus, and truck for thousands of kilometers, with limited access to food, water, and other basic resources during their journey. They traveled without legal authorization; on one occasion, they hid in a farmhouse for several days to evade local authorities. Six months before this evaluation, the patient and her mother crossed the United States–Mexico border. The mother reported that they had been surrounded by border patrol officers and instructed to relinquish personal belongings and remove pieces of clothing; these items were not returned. The patient and her mother were driven to a border detention facility in the Southwest region of the United States and were placed with approximately 40 other women and children in a room that was locked and guarded by male guards. The room had cement floors, a toilet shielded by a partial wall, and a mattress for every four people. After 2 days of detainment, the patient’s mother was instructed to bathe the child, dress her in an oversized, unmarked uniform, and place her in a line of children approximately 5 to 12 years old. The children were led out of the room without their mothers and transported to a facility in another state. The patient and her mother were not informed of the destination or told when they would be able to communicate. The mother was told that she would be deported and would not see her child again. Five days later, the patient’s mother was transported to a facility more than 1000 km away from the patient’s new facility. After 15 days of separation, the patient and her mother communicated by telephone for the first time. During the next month, they talked approximately once per week. The patient described that, while she was in the facility, she was bullied by other children. They called her names, insulted her, and stole a hat that she had made for her mother. A boy hit the patient in the face and loosened a tooth; another child kicked a ball toward her mouth and caused a nosebleed. The patient befriended a girl and cried for days when that girl was transported to another location without notice. When the patient had a fever, cough, and conjunctivitis, she was held in isolation for an unknown amount of time; the symptoms resolved spontaneously. The patient felt uncomfortable with male staff members and requested that female staff members be assigned to care for her; she reported that this request had not been granted. Four months before this evaluation and approximately 5 weeks after crossing the border, the patient’s mother filed for asylum in the United States. She was released and traveled to New England, at which point she petitioned for the release of the patient. After 2 months of separation, the patient was released and transported to New England to join her mother. During the evaluation in the asylum clinic, the patient’s mother reported that the girl no longer had interest in activities that she had previously enjoyed. She had performed well in school but now had trouble focusing during class and had become afraid of other children, especially boys. She had begun to have aggressive behavior — such as throwing rocks at people, cursing, and frequently getting into fights with other children — along with food aversions; the patient now ate only soup from a cup and had no interest in foods she had previously enjoyed. The patient’s mother also reported that the girl had anxiety, which was worse when she was separated from her mother. During these times, the patient had catastrophic thoughts, such as thoughts of her mother dying or being run over by a vehicle. She insisted that her mother walk her to the door of her school every day. At night, she could not fall asleep unless she was holding her mother’s hand, and she had frequent nightmares. The patient scratched and kicked during sleep and would awake suddenly, screaming and crying. The patient had no history of illness and had met normal developmental milestones. She took no medications and had no known drug allergies. She lived with her mother in a suburban area of New England. In Central America, the patient had lived with her parents and grandparents. Her father drank alcohol and used illicit drugs. The patient reported that, in Central America, “bad people wanted to kill my mother.” She was aware that her mother had been abducted at gunpoint and held against her will for an extended period. She recalled a burglary of the family’s home. The patient had also witnessed her father hitting her mother. She reported that she had heard her father tell her mother that he wished the mother would die. On multiple occasions, he had locked the patient and her mother inside their home for several days while he drank alcohol or used drugs. The father had used a belt to strike the patient. The patient was well developed and appropriately dressed. She was alert and cooperative but detached. Speech was spontaneous and fluent in Spanish. Mood and affect were normal initially but became more negative during the interview. She became visibly anxious when discussing her childhood in Central America and her detention in the Southwest. A diagnosis and management decisions were made. ",{},Post-traumatic stress disorder. ,Post-traumatic stress disorder. ,Post-traumatic stress disorder. ,0
NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,14,nejm-case-2012-14,A 43-Year-Old Woman with Fever and a Generalized Rash,"Dr. Sarah Gee (Dermatology): A 43-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of fever and a generalized rash. The patient had a history of atopic dermatitis and had been in her usual health until approximately 1 week before admission, when a painful, pruritic rash developed on her chin, neck, and chest; it gradually spread to involve her entire body, sparing the palms, soles, and genitalia. Four days before admission, she went to the emergency department at another hospital. She reported that the rash was similar to but more severe than her usual atopic dermatitis, which was not painful. Prednisone and hydroxyzine were administered, and she was discharged home. The next day, the rash persisted, chills developed, and the temperature reportedly rose to 39.4°C. The patient returned to the other hospital. On examination, the temperature was 38.6°C, and the blood pressure, pulse, and oxygen saturation were normal. A diffuse, erythematous rash with vesicles, pustules, and excoriations involved the forehead, nose, lips, chin, periorbital areas, chest, back, arms, and legs and spared the palms, soles, and part of the cheeks. The complete blood count was reportedly normal. The patient was admitted to the other hospital, and clindamycin, hydromor-phone, hydroxyzine, acetaminophen, and intravenous fluids were administered; white petrolatum ointment was applied to dry and cracking areas. The next day, a dermatologic consultation was obtained, and a skin biopsy and culture were performed. A chest radiograph was normal. During the second night, the temperature rose to 39.6°C, and sloughing of the skin occurred with pressure. Gram’s staining of the skin-biopsy specimen reportedly showed no neutrophils or organisms; culture of the skin revealed a heavy growth of Staphylococcus aureus. Infectious disease consultation was obtained; the administration of clindamycin was stopped, and vanco-mycin and acyclovir were begun. The blood pressure ranged from 110 to 130 mm Hg systolic and from 50 to 69 mm Hg diastolic, and the oxygen saturation was 95 to 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Blood cultures were sterile. Other laboratory-test and culture results were pending. The patient was transferred to this hospital. Medications on transfer included vancomycin, acyclovir, hydro-morphone, hydroxyzine, acetaminophen, and fluoxetine, with albuterol as needed. The patient and her boyfriend reported that the lesions had first appeared vesicular, were followed by erosions, and ultimately became small, round, open, and painful areas, with larger eroded areas on the chest and limbs; this course differed from her usual flares of atopic dermatitis. She reported mild eye irritation, tearing, and visual blurring. Her history of asthma and atopic dermatitis began in childhood. Three years earlier, a flare of atopic dermatitis had occurred after treatment with trimethoprim–sulfamethox-azole for a urinary tract infection; the dermatitis resolved after the administration of oral gluco-corticoids and hydroxyzine. Examination of a skin-biopsy specimen obtained at that time reportedly showed atopic dermatitis. Recurrences since then were associated with stress, menses, and allergens, including pet hair, and responded to glucocorticoids and hydroxyzine. The patient had no history of cold sores. She had depression and anxiety and several years earlier had had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Medications before admission included fluoxetine, lorazepam, albuterol (as needed), and triamcinolone ointment. She was allergic to penicillin (reaction unknown) and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole and had seasonal and environmental allergies. She had had a positive test for tuberculosis 20 years earlier, for which she had taken isoniazid for 9 months. Testing for the human immunodeficiency virus was reportedly negative in the past. She had moved to New England 2 weeks earlier and lived with her boyfriend, who owned a cat and who had a history of cold sores but had had none recently. Her mother had died of ovarian cancer; multiple paternal relatives had atopic dermatitis. She smoked five cigarettes a day and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. On examination, the patient was extremely uncomfortable. The blood pressure was 146/62 mm Hg, the pulse 109 beats per minute, the temperature 39.3°C, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while she was breathing ambient air. Pain was severe and increased with any small movements or pressure on the skin. There was mild expiratory wheezing in the right lung fields, with decreased basilar breath sounds bilaterally. A diffuse rash involved nearly all areas of her body, including the scalp, face, neck, torso, and limbs; the palms, soles, and genitalia were spared. There were scaly, erythematous plaques with small, round, “punched out,” and crusted erosions (approximately 1 mm in diameter) and scattered larger erosions with scalloped borders, with larger confluent areas on the chest, arms, and legs; lesions were less prominent on the posterior trunk, buttocks, and posterior knees. Blood levels of glucose, biliru-bin, magnesium, amylase, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, globulin, and platelets were normal, as were the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and results of renal-function tests; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed yellow turbid fluid, with 2+ ketones and albumin, 3 to 5 red cells, 5 to 10 white cells, and a few squamous cells per high-power field, and was otherwise normal. A chest radiograph was normal. The patient was admitted to the burn service, and dermatologists and ophthalmologists were consulted. Morphine was administered intravenously by a patient-controlled device, other narcotic analgesic agents were administered orally, and van-comycin and acyclovir were continued. Open areas of the skin were covered with nonadherent, silicone fine-mesh dressings and antimicrobial barrier dressings. During the first 3 days, the temperature rose to 39.6°C intermittently, with tachycardia (up to 130 beats per minute). Oph-thalmologic examination revealed corneal epithelial staining (in areas measuring approximately 0.5 mm) in both eyes, without a dendritic pattern; ophthalmic lubricant ointment and moxifloxacin ophthalmic drops were administered. The patient was able to consume liquids and small amounts of solid foods with no adverse effects, was hemo-dynamically stable, and had adequate urine output. Lesions on the upper chest and face became coalescent, forming large erosions with scalloped borders. Cultures of blood and urine were sterile, a nasal specimen was negative for evidence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, a rectal specimen was negative for vancomycin-resistant enterococ-cus, and a sputum culture grew mixed normal respiratory flora. The administration of daltepa-rin was begun. A diagnostic test result was received.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,29,nejm-case-2010-29,A 29-Year-Old Woman with Fever and Abdominal Pain,"Dr. Vernon A. Rayford (Medicine–Pediatrics): A 29-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of fever and increasing abdominal pain. The patient had spastic quadriplegia due to cerebral palsy but had been in her usual state of health until approximately 2 weeks before admission, when intermittent fevers, with temperatures up to 37.7°C, developed. One day before admission, pain in the left flank and left lower quadrant developed, and she noted foul-smelling urine. During the night before admission, the oral temperature rose to 39.1°C, associated with nausea and pain in the chest, both legs, and the abdomen, which radiated to the back, both flanks, and the midscapular region. She took ibuprofen, and her parents brought her to the emergency department at this hospital in the early afternoon. The patient rated the pain at 8 on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. She had cerebral palsy with spastic quadriplegia, obesity, iron-deficiency anemia, polycystic ovary syndrome with irregular menses, recurrent urinary tract infections, and nephrolithiasis. A ureteral stent had been placed temporarily 10 years earlier because of an obstructing stone in the left ureter. She drank alcohol socially and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. She lived with her parents and a sibling in an urban area, and she had recently broken up with her boyfriend. She used a wheelchair and required assistance cutting food. She followed a low-oxalate diet. She reported no contact with sick persons and no exposure to ticks, and she was not sexually active. Her father and paternal grandfather had diabetes mellitus, her father had reactive arthritis (formerly known as Reiter’s syndrome), one grandfather had relapsing polychondritis, and two grandparents had coronary artery disease. On examination, the patient, who was in a wheelchair, was alert and communicative. The temperature was 37.5°C, the blood pressure 119/63 mm Hg, the pulse 108 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while she was breathing ambient air. There was mild tenderness of the sternum, which was reproduced with deep inspirations, and tenderness of the left costovertebral angle. The abdomen was soft and tender to palpation on the left side, with the most severe tenderness in the left lower quadrant; there was no rebound or guarding. Radial pulses were 2+. The remainder of the examination was consistent with spastic quadriplegia. The platelet count and levels of serum electrolytes, glucose, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, total protein, albumin, globulin, amylase, and lipase were normal, as were tests of renal function; other test results are shown in Table 1. Review of the peripheral-blood smear revealed anisocytosis (2+), polychromatocytosis (1+), hypochromatocy-tosis (2+), and microcytosis (3+). Urinalysis revealed clear amber urine with a specific gravity of 1.025, a pH of 6.0, 2+ bilirubin, 1+ protein, and trace amounts of ketones and urobilinogen; a culture was sterile. While the patient was in the emergency department, narcotic analgesia was administered intravenously, and her pain decreased to a score of 7 out of 10. Eight hours after arrival, the patient vomited once; ondansetron was administered. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen was performed after the oral and intravenous administration of contrast material, but it was complicated by extravasation of the contrast material at the intravenous site in the right arm. The study showed malrotation of the left extrarenal pelvis, multiple cortical defects in the left kidney that were consistent with scarring, and a urinary catheter in the urethra. The spleen was mildly enlarged (14.8 cm in the craniocaudal dimension; upper limit of the normal range, 12 to 13). There were prominent periportal, mesenteric, inguinal, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, up to 1.4 cm in diameter, with trace free fluid in the pelvis. The patient was admitted to the hospital early the next morning. On the day of admission, the temperature was 38.1°C. The pain (rated as 8 out of 10) persisted, and narcotic analgesia was administered intravenously. Nausea and vomiting recurred but lessened after the administration of prochlorperazine. Treatment with dalteparin sodium was begun. A repeat culture of the urine grew rare mixed bacteria. The chest radiograph showed low lung volumes and no opacities that were suggestive of pneumonia. The next day, ultrasonography of the kidneys and the venous system of the lower extremities was normal, with no evidence of hy-dronephrosis or deep venous thrombosis. During the third, fourth, and fifth hospital days, the serum iron-binding capacity and levels of iron, ferritin, folate, and vitamin B12 were normal; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. On the third day, the temperature rose to 38.5°C. Urinalysis revealed leukocytes (>100 white cells per high-power field), and a urine culture grew Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli; blood cultures remained sterile. Ciprofloxacin was administered. The next day, a cherry-red rash developed on the patient’s feet and resolved spontaneously after several hours. Ultrasonography of the abdomen was normal. Low-grade fevers occurred intermittently thereafter, and severe abdominal pain (8 out of 10) persisted; it was greatest in the left upper quadrant, with radiation to the left flank, and was associated with nausea and intermittent vomiting. On the fifth day, testing for antibodies to Bor-relia burgdorferi, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and hepatitis B and C viruses was negative, as were tests for antinuclear antibody, CMV antigenemia, and heterophile antibody; other test results are shown in Table 1. A CT scan of the abdomen, after the intravenous administration of contrast material, showed persistent mild splenomegaly with peripheral wedge-shaped areas of hypoattenuation that were consistent with infarcts; other findings were unchanged from the CT performed on admission. Tests for malaria and antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and heparin– platelet factor 4 were negative, as were nucleic acid testing for ehrlichia, Coombs’ direct antibody test, cold-agglutinin screening, and testing for lupus anticoagulant; hemoglobin electrophoresis and levels of fibrinogen, homocysteine, lipopro-tein(a), β2-glycoprotein I, antithrombin III, and protein C (functional) were normal. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures remained sterile. Transthoracic echocardiography was normal, with no evidence of valvular vegetations. On the 10th day, diagnostic test results were received.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2023,30,nejm-case-2023-30,A 50-Year-Old Woman with Confusion,"Dr. Grace R. Bobkowski (Medicine): A 50-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of confusion. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 5 months before the current presentation, when dysphagia developed. One month later, she was evaluated by her primary care physician. She reported having a sensation that pills and food were getting stuck in her throat when she swallowed. She was unable to take her medications, and her food intake had decreased to two eggs per day. She estimated that her weight had decreased by 5 kg during the previous month. She was referred for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which reportedly revealed ulceration of the gastrojejunal junction from a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass performed 12 years earlier but otherwise normal mucosa. Examination of biopsy specimens obtained during the procedure reportedly revealed findings consistent with lym-phocytic esophagitis. Treatment with swallowed fluticasone was recommended. Three months before the current presentation, leg swelling developed, and the patient was again evaluated by her primary care physician. She had stopped using fluticasone after 1 week of treatment because she had not noticed any decrease in the dysphagia. Her weight had decreased by 3 kg since the evaluation 1 month earlier. Pitting edema was present in the legs. A diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency was considered, and compression stockings were recommended. Two months before the current presentation, leg swelling worsened, arm swelling developed, and the patient had trouble performing activities of daily living. She was admitted to another hospital. She reported persistent dysphagia and reduced food intake. Her weight had increased by 3 kg since the evaluation 1 month earlier. Pitting edema was present in the arms and legs. The blood albumin level was 2.2 g per deciliter (reference range, 3.5 to 4.8), and the zinc level was 0.36 μg per milliliter (reference range, 0.66 to 1.10). Blood levels of vitamin B2, vitamin B12, folate, and methylmalonate were normal; the blood level of N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide was normal for the patient’s age. Urinalysis revealed trace ketones but was otherwise normal. The albumin:creatinine ratio in a random urine CME at NEJM.org sample was 11.6 mg of albumin per gram of creatinine (reference value, <30.0). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Abdominal ultrasonography reportedly revealed an echogenic liver, a finding consistent with fatty infiltration, as well as trace free fluid. Pitting edema of the arms and legs was attributed to hypoalbuminemia from limited oral intake, which was related to dysphagia from untreated lymphocytic esophagitis. The use of fluticasone was encouraged, and supplemental nutritional drinks were recommended, along with a multivitamin and zinc sulfate. On the fourth hospital day, the patient was discharged home. One month before the current presentation, the patient was admitted to this hospital because of confusion and a urinary tract infection (UTI) with Escherichia coli. Confusion resolved with treatment of the UTI. Her weight had decreased by 2 kg since the admission 1 month earlier. The patient reported loose stools without blood or mucus, which had occurred for 1 month. Edema was present. The blood albumin level was 1.7 g per deciliter, the zinc level 0.3 μg per milliliter, the selenium level 34 ng per milliliter (reference range, 70 to 150), the vitamin A level 16.6 μg per deciliter (reference range, 32.5 to 78.0), and the vitamin C level 0.2 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0.4 to 2.0). Blood levels of vitamin B1  and vitamin B3  were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. EGD showed ulceration of the gastrojejunal anastomosis but otherwise normal mucosa. Biopsy specimens of the esophagus, stomach, and jejunum showed normal mucosa. A biopsy specimen of the gastrojejunal anastomosis showed small-intestinal mucosa with erosion and nonspecific morphologic features; periodic acid– Schiff staining was negative for microorganisms, Congo red staining was negative for amyloid, and immunohistochemical staining was negative for cytomegalovirus. Magnetic resonance en-terography of the abdomen and pelvis, performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no evidence of active inflammatory bowel disease. A high-protein diet was recommended, along with a multivitamin, zinc sulfate, and selenium. On the eighth hospital day, the patient was discharged home. After discharge, the patient initially felt well. The edema abated, and her appetite improved. She began to have six small meals and three protein shakes per day. Two weeks after discharge, and 1 week before the current presentation, confusion developed, and the gait became unsteady; she began using a walker for ambulation. During the next week, confusion increased, and she fell while walking. Her family brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. On the patient’s arrival in the emergency department, she was unable to answer questions about her history. Her family reported that she had had slowed and slurred speech for the past week and increasing difficulty with attention, including difficulty with holding a conversation. Other medical history included chronic back pain, bipolar disorder, seizure disorder, and ulcerative colitis. Medications included carbamazepine, ergo-calciferol, fluticasone, gabapentin, mesalamine, methocarbamol, mirtazapine, a multivitamin, olanzapine, omeprazole, oxycodone–acetamino-phen, selenium, sucralfate, thiamine, topira-mate, and zinc sulfate. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was receiving disability benefits and did not work because of chronic back pain. She had smoked two packs of cigarettes per day for 35 years. She did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her mother had endometrial cancer, and her father had lung cancer. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.8°C, the blood pressure 89/52 mm Hg, the pulse 132 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.9. Her weight had decreased by 6 kg since the admission 1 month earlier. She appeared chronically ill and was lethargic but arose in response to voice. She moved her arms and legs but did not participate in a detailed neu-rologic examination. Pitting edema was present in the arms and legs. The white-cell count was 17,150 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), with neutrophil predominance. The blood zinc level was 0.35 μg per milliliter, the copper level 0.28 μg per milliliter (reference range, 0.75 to 1.45), and the vitamin B6 level less than 2 μg per liter (reference range, 5 to 50). Urinalysis revealed trace ketones and 50 to 100 white cells per high-power field (reference value, <10). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph was normal, without evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. Urine, blood, and stool specimens were obtained for culture. Three liters of intravenous lactated Ringer’s solution were administered, and the systolic blood pressure increased to 100 mm Hg. Three hours after the patient’s arrival in the emergency department, she became more lethargic and had no response to voice; she reacted to being shaken but did not open her eyes or answer questions. Additional imaging studies were performed. Dr. Theodore T. Pierce: Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, showed no abnormalities. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Fig. 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed diffuse hepatic steatosis, as well as mucosal hyperen-hancement and submucosal edema involving portions of the small and large bowel, with relative sparing of the distal jejunum, proximal ileum, descending colon, and sigmoid colon. Dr. Bobkowski: Treatment with intravenous van-comycin, cefepime, and metronidazole was initiated. Six hours after the patient’s arrival in the emergency department, the blood pressure decreased to 85/45 mm Hg, and the heart rate increased to 132 beats per minute. There was no response to painful stimuli. Myoclonic jerking movements were observed. Treatment with norepinephrine was initiated, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. The trachea was intubated for airway protection, and sedation with propofol and dexmedetomidine was initiated. Treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole was continued; prescribed medications of carbamazepine, a multivitamin, omeprazole, selenium, sucralfate, thiamine, topiramate, and zinc sulfate were administered. On the first hospital day, the blood pressure increased, and vasopressors and sedative medications were discontinued. The patient had no spontaneous interaction or speech production. She did not follow commands or grimace in response to noxious stimuli. The pupils were equal and reactive to light. The corneal reflexes were intact, as were the cough and gag reflexes. There was no spontaneous movement of the arms or legs, but they withdrew in response to pain; the deep-tendon reflexes were normal. The results of CT of the head were normal. Sedation was not resumed, and serial neurologic examinations were performed. On the second hospital day, leukocytosis had resolved, but the patient’s mental status had not improved. Electroencephalography (EEG) with long-term monitoring revealed near-continuous generalized periodic discharges with triphasic morphologic features, often with superimposed rhythmic activity. The results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head were normal, as were the results of magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck. Lumbar puncture was performed, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed normal protein levels and no nucleated cells. The urine culture grew Klebsiella pneumoniae. The blood and stool cultures were negative, as was a stool test for Clostridioides difficile and an examination of the stool for ova and parasites. Treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole was stopped, and treatment with ciprofloxacin was started. On the third hospital day, the patient’s mental status had not improved. EGD showed a small scar at the gastrojejunal anastomosis but otherwise normal mucosa. The results of flexible sigmoidoscopy were normal. Biopsy specimens of the jejunum and descending colon showed normal mucosa. A diagnostic test was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,33,nejm-case-2019-33,A 35-Year-Old Woman with Cardiopulmonary Arrest during Cesarean Section,"Dr. Rachel Wood (Obstetrics and Gynecology): A 35-year-old pregnant woman was admitted to the labor and delivery unit of this hospital at 36 weeks 4 days of gestation for a planned repeat cesarean section because of placenta previa. At 6 weeks 4 days of gestation, the patient had been seen at a community health center because of a positive pregnancy test. She was gravida 4, 1-0-2-1. Her first pregnancy, 5 years earlier, had resulted in the need for a cesarean section because the fetus was in the breech presentation; the baby was delivered at full term without complications. The second and third pregnancies had been electively terminated. The patient reported that her husband had human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and that he had been taking antiretroviral therapy; he had had undetectable plasma levels of HIV-1 RNA during the 5 months before this visit. Blood testing in the patient for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies and HIV-1 p24 antigen with the use of a fourth-generation combination assay was negative. Pre-exposure prophylaxis with a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was prescribed. The patient continued to receive routine prenatal care at the community health center. At 16 weeks 5 days of gestation, the result of an oral glucose tolerance test was abnormal, and a diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus was made. Dietary modifications, exercise, and fingerstick glucose monitoring were prescribed. Obstetrical ultrasonography with fetal survey performed at 18 weeks 4 days of gestation revealed a placenta that was positioned anteriorly, with complete placenta previa. The results of all other prenatal screening tests were normal. The blood type was O, Rh-positive, with negative antibody testing. The patient was advised not to have sexual intercourse and to seek immediate medical attention if vaginal bleeding were to occur. She was informed that a cesarean delivery would be scheduled to occur between 36 and 37 weeks of gestation. Twenty-five days before presentation, at 33 weeks of gestation, vaginal bleeding developed, and the patient was brought by ambulance to the obstetrical unit of this hospital. She reported that on awakening that morning, she had passed a large volume of bright red, liquid blood and three large clots, each measuring approximately 1.5 cm in diameter, through the vagina. She felt occasional contractions; fetal movement was normal. She reported no recent trauma, fall, or sexual intercourse. On examination, the patient appeared well. The pulse was 112 beats per minute, and other vital signs were normal. The abdomen was gravid, soft, and nontender. A speculum examination revealed a closed cervical os, a small amount of bright red blood, and no pooling fluid. The hemoglobin level was 11.5 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0), and the hematocrit was 35.0% (reference range, 36.0 to 46.0). On a nonstress test, the fetal heart rate was 140 beats per minute, with moderate variability, accelerations, and a single deceleration with a rapid return to baseline. Ultrasonographic examination was performed; the placenta was positioned anteriorly along the midline of the uterus, completely overlying the cervical os, and there was no evidence of placenta accreta. The measurements of the fetus were appropriate for gestational age, with a biophysical profile score of 8/8 (indicating normal fetal well-being). The patient was admitted to the labor and delivery unit for observation. External tocodyna-mometry showed uterine irritability; magnesium, betamethasone, and penicillin were administered, but the contractions persisted. After she received additional treatment with oral nifedipine, the contractions stopped. No additional vaginal bleeding occurred, and the hemoglobin level and hematocrit remained stable. Postprandial hyperglycemia was noted, and a regimen of subcutaneous insulin was initiated. The patient was discharged home on the fifth hospital day. Two days after discharge, at 33 weeks 6 days of gestation, unprovoked vaginal bleeding recurred, and the patient was transported by ambulance to the emergency department at another hospital. She reported copious bright red vaginal bleeding, with several large clots, and pelvic cramping; fetal movement was normal. On examination, the patient appeared well, and the vital signs were normal. The abdomen was gravid and soft, with mild tenderness on palpation at the fundus. A speculum examination revealed a closed cervix and approximately 5 ml of dark brown blood in the vaginal vault, with no ongoing bleeding through the os. The patient was transferred by ambulance to the antepartum care unit of this hospital; the fetal heart rate was 145 beats per minute, with moderate variability and accelerations and without decelerations. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was observed for 4 days; she had no contractions or further vaginal bleeding. On the third hospital day, she was discharged home, and a cesarean section was scheduled for 36 weeks 4 days of gestation. On admission for the scheduled cesarean delivery, the patient reported feeling well, with no abdominal pain, contractions, or recurrent vaginal bleeding. She was obese and had a history of sciatica, for which she had undergone lumbar laminectomy in the remote past. Medications included prenatal vitamins and subcutaneous insulin. She had no known allergies. The patient had been born in southeastern Africa and lived in New England. She was monogamous with her husband and did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit substances. The family medical history was unknown. That afternoon, the patient underwent cesarean section under combined spinal–epidural anesthesia. Cefazolin was administered intravenously before incision of the skin. During the surgery, a low transverse uterine incision was made through the anterior placenta. The membranes were ruptured bluntly, yielding clear amniotic fluid. The uterine incision was extended, and the infant was delivered 37 minutes after injection of the spinal anesthetic agent, which was administered during a combined spinal–epi-dural procedure; the opaque surgical drape was lowered, allowing the patient to see the infant through the clear drape. The 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores were 8 and 10, respectively. The placenta was removed with gentle traction. Three minutes after delivery of the infant, while clot and debris were being cleared from the uterine cavity, the exteriorized uterus became blanched with minimal bleeding. Concurrently, the patient was noted to be unresponsive, with sporadic respirations; carotid and aortic pulses were present. Manual ventilation was begun. Two minutes later, the patient became pulseless, with normal sinus rhythm seen on the patient monitor of the anesthesia machine. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was begun, the trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was initiated. Thirty-eight minutes after delivery of the infant, generalized bleeding and oozing began, with blood and debris emanating from the surgical incision and spreading throughout the operative field. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnosis and management decisions were made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2009,33,nejm-case-2009-33,"A 35-Year-Old Woman with Fever, Abdominal Pain, and Hypotension after Cesarean Section","Dr. Claudius H.O. Conrad (Surgery): A 35-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of abdominal pain, fever, and hypotension. Three days earlier, an elective cesarean section was performed at another hospital through a transverse incision of the lower uterine segment, and a healthy, full-term infant was delivered. Cefazolin was administered intravenously after clamping of the umbilical cord. That evening, an episode of rigors occurred, reportedly without fever. The next day the patient passed flatus and stool; abdominal distention developed, and a nasogastric tube was inserted. On the second postpartum day, diffuse abdominal pain developed, most severe in the left lower quadrant, and no additional flatus or stool passed. In the evening, the temperature rose to 38.4°C, and abdominal distention increased. In the early morning of the third postpartum day, rigors recurred, with fever. The blood pressure decreased to 80/48 mm Hg, with a pulse of 130 beats per minute, and urine output ceased. Results of laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Fluid was administered intravenously. A radiograph of the abdomen showed mild gaseous distention of the small bowel and colon, increased soft-tissue density in the lower pelvis that was thought to be related to a postpartum uterus, and no evidence of free in-traperitoneal air. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). The blood pressure decreased to 55/30 mm Hg, and the pulse rose to 140 beats per minute. A urethral catheter was inserted. Analysis of a urine specimen revealed turbid, yellow urine, with a pH of 5.5, a specific gravity of 1.020, a small amount of blood, 100 mg of protein per 100 ml, a small amount of leukocyte esterase, 6 to 10 white cells and 3 to 5 red cells per high-power field, a moderate number of bacteria, epithelial cells, and many amorphous urates. Specimens of blood and urine were cultured, and levofloxacin, vancomycin, and metronidazole were administered. Additional crystalloid and norepinephrine were given intravenously. During the next 2 hours, the blood pressure increased to 120/80 mm Hg and urine excretion resumed (rate, 10 to 15 ml per hour). The patient was transferred by medical helicopter to this hospital. During transport, the temperature was 37.7°C, the blood pressure 79 to 91 mm Hg systolic and 43 to 48 mm Hg diastolic, the pulse 154 to 162 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 20 to 25 breaths per minute. The rate of norepinephrine infusion was increased, and soon after arrival, a non-rebreathing mask was applied. The patient had gestational diabetes (diet-controlled), and dry, flaky lesions had developed on the right leg during pregnancy. She had had one previous pregnancy, 9 years earlier, that had been complicated by cephalopelvic disproportion, which required vacuum extraction. She had had an appendectomy in the past. She lived with her fiancé and child and worked in an office. She smoked 10 cigarettes per day. Her only medication at home was prenatal vitamins. She was allergic to penicillin. On examination, the patient appeared acutely ill. The temperature was 39.2°C, the blood pressure 70/52 mm Hg, the pulse 149 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, with an oxygen saturation of 96% while she was breathing ambient air. The skin was hot and flushed. The oral mucous membranes were dry. Bowel sounds were decreased. The abdomen was distended, with diffuse rebound tenderness. There was erythema and edema in the region of the surgical incision, extending to the left flank, with no drainage. The lungs were clear, there were no heart murmurs or gallops, the pulses measured 2+, and the arms and legs appeared well perfused. There were two li-chenified plaques (<3 cm in diameter) with hemorrhagic crusts on the right anterior tibial skin. In the emergency department, a radiograph of the chest revealed low lung volumes but was otherwise normal. Arterial and central intravenous catheters were placed. Norepinephrine and normal saline were continued; additional doses of levofloxacin, vancomycin, and metronidazole were given. An analysis of arterial blood gas drawn while the patient was breathing ambient air revealed a pH of 7.38 and a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 26 mm Hg and of oxygen of 66 mm Hg; the base excess was −8.9 mmol per liter. The central venous pressure was 8 mm Hg, and vasopressin was begun. Two hours 20 minutes after arrival, a diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,38,nejm-case-2012-38,A 60-Year-Old Man with Abdominal Pain and Aortic Aneurysms,"Dr. Sebastian Unizony (Medicine): A 60-year-old man was seen in the emergency department of this hospital because of abdominal pain. The patient was well until approximately 2 weeks before admission, when he reported feeling febrile; 1 week later, abdominal pain developed in the midline and both lower quadrants. On the day of admission, he went to another hospital where he rated the pain at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The temperature was 38.4°C, and the other vital signs were normal. The blood level of albumin and tests of renal function were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Computed tomography (CT) revealed enlargement of the infra-renal abdominal aorta (3.2 cm by 3.3 cm), with two aneurysms (1.3 cm by 1.4 cm and 1.7 cm by 1.2 cm) along the left lateral aspect. Blood cultures were drawn, and morphine, vancomycin, and imipenem were administered. The patient was transferred to this hospital and admitted. The patient reported constipation but no nausea, vomiting, jaundice, diarrhea, hematochezia, hematuria, dyspnea, or chest pain. He took no medications and had no known allergies. He was of African descent, was born in Central America, and had immigrated to this country 35 years earlier. He lived with his wife, with whom he was monogamous, and worked in an office. He smoked a pipe, drank alcohol in moderation, and reported no illicit drug use. There was no family history of rheu-matologic or vascular disease. On examination, the blood pressure was 139/80 mm Hg in the right arm and 148/90 in the left arm. The pulse was 81 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the temperature 37.5°C. The patient was largely edentu-lous and had severe periodontitis and marginal gingivitis. No bruits were heard in the carotid, subclavian, or femoral arteries, and the peripheral pulses were 2+ throughout. Cardiac examination revealed normal heart sounds and no murmurs. The lungs were clear. The abdomen was soft, with mild, diffuse periumbilical and lower abdominal tenderness, without a pulsatile mass. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of lactic acid, creatine kinase, troponin I, amylase, and lipase were normal, as were tests of renal function. Other results are shown in Table 1. The urinalysis revealed no blood or protein, and the stool was guaiac-negative. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm at 81 beats per minute, biatrial enlargement, and an incomplete right bundle-branch block. Additional blood cultures were obtained, and imipenem, morphine, and labetalol were administered, followed by vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole. Antihypertensive agents were given to maintain a systolic blood pressure of 120 mm Hg or less. CT angiography (CTA) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis confirmed the dilated distal abdominal aorta but showed no evidence of rupture or dissection. The paraaortic lymph nodes were mildly enlarged and enhanced. There was also aneurysmal dilatation of the distal thoracic aorta (4.1 cm by 3.6 cm), with mural thrombus, a periaortic-fluid collection, and a small, focal penetrating ulcer. The abdominal and thoracic aortic walls showed enhancement and periaortic fat stranding, features that raised suspicion for mycotic aneurysms. Red cells and fresh-frozen plasma were transfused. Cultures of the nasal mucosa and rectum showed no evidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or vancomycin-resistant entero-coccus. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction of 61%, thickening of the mitral and aortic leaflets (with no valvular vegetations), trace mitral regurgitation, tricuspid-valve and pulmonary-valve insufficiency, and protruding atheromata in the descending thoracic and abdominal aortas. On the second day, a right axillobifemoral bypass operation was performed, with resection of an abdominal aortic aneurysm and débridement of retroperitoneal and periaortic tissues. Pathological examination revealed evidence of recent dissection, an organizing adventitial hematoma, and severe atherosclerosis. Staining for microorganisms was negative. On the third day, cultures of the blood and surgical specimens remained sterile, and tests for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and bartonella, syphilis (with the use of rapid plasma reagin), and tuberculosis (Mantoux skin test and whole-blood interferon gamma testing) were negative. The patient was discharged on the 16th day. Discharge medications included vancomycin and ceftriaxone intravenously, meto-prolol tartrate, and oxycodone. One month later, the patient was seen in the rheumatology clinic. He reported improved energy and appetite. Abdominal pain in the left upper quadrant (rated at 2 out of 10) persisted on exertion but was relieved by rest. He had no chest pain, dyspnea, cough, fever, chills, sweating, nausea, vomiting, rash, mucosal lesions, or mus-culoskeletal problems. The blood pressure was 148/91 mm Hg, and the weight 58.2 kg; other vital signs were normal. The abdomen was soft and nontender, surgical incisions were healing, and the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Laboratory results are shown in Table 1. Four days later, he completed his 6-week course of antibiotics. Five days later, the patient returned to the emergency department because of left chest and back pain (rated at 5 out of 10). The blood pressure was 157/107 mm Hg in the right arm and 183/107 mm Hg in the left. The pulse was 96 beats per minute; the remainder of the vital signs and examination was normal. A chest radiograph showed a round mediastinal opacity that was inseparable from the aortic silhouette. CTA of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed enlargement of the aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta (6.6 cm by 6.2 cm). Narcotic analgesia, lorazepam, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and metro-nidazole were administered. Nitroprusside and esmolol were administered to achieve systolic pressures between 100 and 120 mm Hg and a pulse of 50 to 70 beats per minute. Blood levels of creatine kinase isoenzymes and troponin I were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. An ECG was unchanged. Red cells and fresh-frozen plasma were transfused. A procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,05,nejm-case-2010-05,"A 51-Year-Old Man with HIV Infection, Proteinuria, and Edema","A 51-year-old man with a history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was seen in the nephrology clinic of this hospital because of proteinuria, edema, and hypertension. The patient had been in his usual state of health until approximately 4 weeks earlier, in early spring, when headache, nasal congestion, pressure behind his eyes, and a nonproductive cough developed, which he attributed to seasonal allergies. His primary care provider prescribed loratadine. At follow-up 1 week later, he reported headache, nasal congestion, and intermittent blurred vision. The blood pressure was 154/100 mm Hg, the pulse 100 beats per minute, the weight 106.8 kg, and the height 170.2 cm. There was fat accumulation on the neck posteriorly and a mild right ventricular heave, and the abdomen was obese; the remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory-test results, obtained when the patient was not fasting, revealed a normal complete blood count and normal levels of serum electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and lipase; the CD4 T-cell count was 279 per cubic millimeter, and the HIV viral load less than 50 copies per milliliter; other results are shown in Table 1. The dosage of lisinopril, which he was taking for hypertension, was increased. Two weeks later, he reported persistent blurred vision. The blood pressure was 140/100 mm Hg in the right arm and 142/98 mm Hg in the left; the pulse was 100 beats per minute. The patient saw an ophthalmologist. Levels of glycated hemoglobin and serum bilirubin were normal; additional results of laboratory tests of the blood and urine are reported in Table 1. He was referred to the nephrology clinic. The patient reported increased urinary frequency without dysuria, as well as foamy urine. He had had two episodes of nephrolithiasis (once associated with the administration of indinavir); on two occasions, 10 and 11 years earlier, separated by 18 months, proteinuria was present on urinalysis (2+ and 3+, respectively). Two years earlier, ultrasonography of the kidneys was reportedly normal. He had had hypertension for 5 to 10 years. Diagnoses of HIV and HCV genotype 1a infections had been made 12 years earlier, during an admission for endocarditis of the tricus-pid valve caused by Staphylococcus aureus, associated with intravenous drug abuse. A liver biopsy, performed 3.5 years before this evaluation, had revealed mildly active chronic hepatitis, with a fibrosis score of 2 on a scale of 0 to 6, with a higher score indicating a greater degree of fibrosis; the level of HCV RNA was greater than 700,000 IU per milliliter. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver 2 years before this evaluation revealed diffuse fatty infiltration. The patient snored loudly and had chronic night sweats, headaches and joint stiffness (for which he took ibuprofen), coronary artery disease (with a history of myocardial infarction 6 years earlier), tricuspid regurgitation due to endocardi-tis, obesity, depression, condylomata acuminata, glucose intolerance, hyperlipidemia, gout, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and hemorrhoids. He was married and had two children, lived in the city, and worked in an office. He was black, was adopted, and had limited information about his biologic family. His mother had had thyroid disease, a grandmother may have had kidney disease, and his siblings were healthy. He had stopped smoking cigarettes after his myocardial infarction and had not abused drugs since the diagnosis of HIV infection. He drank alcohol and smoked cigars occasionally. Medications included amlodipine, antiretroviral medications (efavirenz, emtricitabine, tenofovir, and raltegra-vir), lisinopril, metoprolol, pantoprazole, allopuri-nol, colchicine, trazodone, aspirin, loratadine, vardenafil, l-glutamine, multivitamins, omega-3 fish oil, supplemental fiber tablets, and ibuprofen. He was allergic to quinine. On examination, the blood pressure was 130/90 mm Hg in both arms, the pulse 88 beats per minute, the height 170.2 cm, and the weight 107.1 kg. Small lymph nodes were palpable in the cervical and left epitrochlear regions. The neck was thick, most prominently in the submen-tal area. Breath sounds were diffusely decreased. The first and second heart sounds were normal, and a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur was heard at the apex. The point of maximal impulse was not palpable. There was 2+ edema of the knees. The remainder of the examination was normal. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed an IgG level of 1392 mg per deciliter (reference range, 614 to 1295); levels of IgA and IgM and complement (C3 and C4) were normal. Immunofixation showed two IgG kappa M components (0.17 g per deciliter and 0.12 g per deciliter) and one IgG lambda M component (0.08 g per deciliter) in the gamma region. A test for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies was negative. Urine protein electrophoresis showed large amounts of albumin, alpha and beta globulins, and probably intact immunoglobulin; three M components in the same location as the bands seen on serum protein electrophoresis; and no Bence Jones proteins (in urine that was concentrated by a factor of 50). A test for antinuclear antibodies was positive at dilutions of 1:40 and 1:160, with a speckled pattern. The serum level of uric acid was normal; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was advised to stop amlodipine and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); furosemide was prescribed, and acetaminophen was prescribed for pain, as needed. One month later, ultrasonography of the kidneys revealed normal size (right, 11.7 cm in the sagittal dimension; left, 11.4 cm) and diffusely increased echogenicity, with no evidence of hydro-nephrosis or masses. A sleep study revealed an apnea–hypopnea index (the mean number of episodes of apnea and hypopnea per hour of sleep) of 97 (mild apnea or hypopnea ranges from 5 to 15, moderate ranges from 15 to 30, and severe is >30). The severe obstructive apnea and hypopnea in this case were associated with arousals and oxygen desaturations to 81%, which improved with the administration of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Ten weeks after the initial evaluation, the patient returned to the nephrologist. He reported total abstinence from NSAIDs. His edema was subjectively improved, and his urine was still intermittently foamy. The blood pressure was 142/100 mm Hg (before the medications were taken) and the weight 111.1 kg, and there was 1+ edema of the legs; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. The serum level of free kappa light chains was 44.8 mg per liter (reference range, 3.3 to 19.4) and free lambda light chains 49.6 mg per liter (reference range, 5.7 to 26.3). There was no cryoprotein present in the serum, and levels of electrolytes, calcium, and phosphorus remained normal; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. During the next 8 weeks, he began using CPAP, and his sleep improved. On follow-up with the nephrolo-gist; the blood pressure was 125/80 mm Hg, the pulse 100 beats per minute, and the weight 112.9 kg; the remainder of the examination was unchanged.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2011,28,nejm-case-2011-28,A 74-Year-Old Man with Pemphigus Vulgaris and Lung Nodules,"Dr. Omobolaji T. Campbell (Infectious Diseases): A 74-year-old man was seen in the surgery clinic at this hospital for evaluation of lung nodules. A diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris had been made 5 months earlier after a 2-month history of skin lesions that had progressed from erosions on the patient’s lips to multiple bullae and crusted erosions on his face, trunk, scalp, lips, and oral mucosa. The erosions and bullae were itchy and painful and associated with difficulty swallowing, anorexia, and weight loss of 1.4 kg. The patient had a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Medications included enalapril, nifedipine, loratadine, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, and acetylsali-cylic acid; all these except metformin had been discontinued by the patient’s primary care physician when the rash first developed, before evaluation by the dermatologist. On examination by the dermatologist at that time, there were multiple pink crusted plaques and flaccid blisters on the trunk, face, and scalp and erosions on the oral mucosa. Nikolsky’s sign (blistering of the skin and mucosa as a response to slight rubbing or pressure) was positive on the left upper back. The serum level of IgG antibodies to desmoglein 1 was 180.7 U (reference range, <14.0), and to des-moglein 3 was 154.6 U (reference range, <9.0). Pathological examination of a skin-biopsy specimen of the lesions on the lower back showed intraepidermal blistering that was consistent with pemphigus vulgaris. The administration of prednisone (60 mg daily) was begun; the lesions rapidly improved, and the dose was reduced to 40 mg daily. Hyperglycemia developed, and treatment with glipizide was begun. Two weeks later, the serum sodium level was 131 mmol per liter (reference range, 135 to 145), the chloride level 97 mmol per liter (reference range, 100 to 108), and the glucose level 213 mg per deciliter (11.8 mmol per liter) (reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]); serum levels of potassium, carbon dioxide, calcium, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were the results of tests for liver and renal function and thiopurine methyltransferase activity. Urinalysis showed glucose 2+ (300 to 500 mg per deciliter [16.7 to 27.8 mmol per liter]); results were otherwise normal. Three weeks later, a skin test for tuberculosis was negative. The dose of prednisone was gradually increased to 60 mg daily, and treatment with azathioprine (initial dose, 50 mg daily) was begun as a glucocorticoid-sparing agent. At follow-up in the dermatology clinic 1 month later, the patient reported hoarseness and a cough with yellow sputum of 1 week’s duration. Despite resolution of many of the skin lesions, the oral lesions persisted. He reported eating and drinking well; however, his weight had decreased from 60.0 kg to 56.4 kg. The administration of trimeth-oprim–sulfamethoxazole for prophylaxis against infection was begun, and the patient was referred to an otolaryngologist; fiberoptic laryngoscopic examination reportedly revealed involvement of the vocal cords with pemphigus. Testing for paraneo-plastic pemphigus IgG autoantibodies was negative. The dose of azathioprine was increased to 100 mg daily. At follow-up 5 months after the onset of symptoms, the patient reported less discomfort of his oral mucosa and resolution of his hoarseness, but he reported new painful lesions on his back and burning with urination, without urinary frequency, hematuria, or blood in his stool. Physical examination revealed new crusted erosions on his back. The white-cell count was 11,900 per cubic millimeter (88% neutrophils). Urinalysis revealed a glucose level greater than 1000 mg per deciliter (55.5 mmol per liter), trace amounts of blood, and 3 to 4 red cells, 10 to 15 bacteria, and 3 to 10 epithelial cells per high-power field. A urine culture was sterile. Ultrasonography of the kidneys performed at another hospital reportedly revealed bilateral, nonobstructing renal calculi. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis reportedly showed nephrolithiasis and pros-tatic hypertrophy, without obstruction, with incidental findings of a pulmonary consolidation and lung nodules in the right lower lobe. Treatment with insulin was begun for persistent hyperglycemia. Five weeks before this evaluation, the dose of azathioprine was increased to the goal dose of 150 mg daily. The patient reported soreness of his tongue; examination revealed white plaques on the lateral edges of the tongue. Fluconazole (100 mg orally, once weekly) was initiated for presumed thrush. CT of the chest reportedly revealed enlargement of parenchymal and pleural densities (predominantly in the right lower lung) and nodules in both lower lobes, which had not been present 4 years earlier. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose–posi-tron-emission tomography (FDG-PET) reportedly revealed FDG avidity of the nodules in both lower lobes and of the pleura of the right lung. Seventeen days before this evaluation, the white-cell count was 5200 per cubic millimeter (90% neutrophils); the dose of azathioprine was decreased to 50 mg daily. The patient was referred to the surgery clinic at this hospital for evaluation of the lung nodules. The patient reported a weight loss of 11.3 kg associated with his illness; he had regained 4.5 kg after the symptoms had improved. He had persistent fatigue and dysuria; he did not have back pain, difficulty swallowing, cough, sore throat, hoarseness, blood in the urine or stool, headache, fever, chills, or sweats. He had had an episode of chest pain with normal cardiac perfusion 6 months earlier, mild-to-moderate left ventricular hypertrophy according to echocardiography, and prostatic hypertrophy; he had also undergone an appendectomy. Oral medications included prednisone, azathioprine, metformin, glipizide, acetylsalicylic acid, acetaminophen, ergocalciferol, calcium carbonate, and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, with tramadol as needed for pain. Topical medications included mupirocin ointment, gentian violet, and halobetasol propionate ointment for active skin lesions, and viscous lidocaine as needed for painful mouth sores. The patient was allergic to rosi-glitazone maleate, which had caused a rash. He was from Brazil and had immigrated to the United States more than 10 years earlier. He lived in New England with his wife and was retired. He had stopped smoking 40 years earlier, after 5 pack-years, and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. He was monogamous with his wife and had traveled only to Florida; he had not returned to South America. There was no history of exposure to blood products or animals. His father had died of stomach cancer at 69 years of age, and his mother had died during childbirth. One of his eight children had died of an “immune problem”; there was no family history of skin diseases. On examination, the height was 157.5 cm and the weight 54.9 kg. The vital signs were normal. There were multiple healed pink scars on the chest, abdomen, inguinal folds, and scalp; several active ulcers on the back in various stages of healing; and several broad erosions on the hard and soft palate. The remainder of the examination was normal. Pulmonary-function tests revealed a forced vital capacity of 2.42 liters (76% of the predicted value) and a forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 1.83 liters (73% of the predicted value), and the carbon monoxide diffusing capacity was 80% of the predicted value. The white-cell count was 9800 per cubic millimeter, and the serum electrolyte levels were 134 mmol of sodium per liter, 5.4 mmol of potassium per liter (reference range, 3.4 to 4.8), and 95 mmol of chloride per liter. The remainder of the complete blood count was normal, as were tests of coagulation and liver and kidney function. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2008,32,nejm-case-2008-32,A 10-Year-Old Girl with Recurrent Oral Lesions and Cutaneous Bullae,"Dr. Melissa M. Burnett (Pediatric Dermatology): A 10.8-year-old girl was seen in the Pediatric Dermatology Clinic of this hospital because of recurrent oral ulcers and cutaneous bullae. The patient was well until 2 years of age, when white lesions developed in the mouth that were followed by vesicles and bullae on the dorsal and plantar surfaces of the feet and, to a lesser degree, on the knees and hands. The white lesions on the buccal mucosa became ulcerated and painful; the other lesions were occasionally painful and pruritic. The lesions lasted 4 days to 2 weeks. Similar lesions recurred intermittently thereafter, at intervals of approximately 3 to 4 months, without seasonal variation or precipitant trauma. At age 6.9 years, she saw her pediatrician because of recurrent blisters on her feet, left knee, and both hands. A swab from a lesion on the toe was sent for culture, and antibiotics were prescribed; the culture was sterile. During the following week, a pink rash developed under the arms and on the inner thighs. The patient saw a dermatologist at another facility. On examination, there were white, slightly oval plaques on the buccal mucosa that were approximately 2 to 3 cm in diameter. Tense bullae, containing clear to slightly cloudy fluid and measuring 3 to 8 mm in diameter, were located on the dorsum of all toes, extending slightly onto the feet (Fig. 1A); on the plantar surfaces of the toes and feet; and on the fingers and palms. Several lesions were confluent. There were resolving bullae with minimal overlying erythema and a slight hemorrhagic crust on the toes, and there was a resolving bulla approximately 1 cm in diameter on the left knee (Fig. 1B). There were multiple pink-to-tan hyperkeratotic papules, 2 to 3 mm in diameter, on the upper thighs and arms (Fig. 1C). There were no nail changes or scarring of the skin. Nikol-sky’s sign (ready removal of the epidermis with slight tangential pressure) was negative. Skin care to decrease local trauma and biopsy of a skin lesion for pathological examination were recommended. Two months later, a punch biopsy of the skin of the left inner arm was performed. Pathological examination revealed a subepidermal microvesicle.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2018,32,nejm-case-2018-32,A 36-Year-Old Pregnant Woman with Newly Diagnosed Adenocarcinoma,"Dr. Malavika Prabhu (Obstetrics and Gynecology): A 36-year-old pregnant woman was evaluated at this hospital at 33 weeks of gestation because of newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma. Seven months before this admission, when the patient was at her initial routine prenatal visit, transvaginal ultrasonography revealed a normal gestational sac and embryo. Thereafter, prenatal follow-up was uneventful, although she had abnormal results on a 1-hour glucose tolerance test at 27 weeks of gestation. One week before the current evaluation, at 32 weeks of gestation, the patient had 3 days of nonradiating, severe pain in the lower back that she rated at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The pain started in the epigastric region and then migrated to the right upper quadrant and lower back. It was accompanied by severe nausea and an inability to eat any food or drink liquid without vomiting. She had night sweats and difficulty sleeping because of back pain. Four days after the pain began, the patient was admitted to the obstetrics service of another hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.6°C, the heart rate 96 beats per minute, the blood pressure 105/68 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared to be uncomfortable. There was tenderness in the right upper quadrant, and the gravid uterus was soft. There was no costovertebral tenderness. The remainder of the examination was normal. The amylase and lipase levels and the white-cell differential count were normal; additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Fetal heart tones were noted on Doppler ultrasonography, and the measurements of the fetus on ultrasonography were appropriate for gestational age. The fetal biophysical profile (breathing motion, movement, tone, and amniotic-fluid volume) was reportedly normal. Dr. Kimberly Shampain: On renal ultrasonography, the kidneys and bladder appeared normal but the liver was incidentally noted to be diffusely heterogeneous and nodular and to contain numerous masses. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed multiple lesions in the liver that were mildly hyperintense on T2-weighted images and hypointense on T1-weighted images; the largest lesion measured 7.4 cm by 3.9 cm, and some lesions had central necrosis (Fig. 1A). Dr. Prabhu: Allopurinol, an injection of beta-methasone acetate–betamethasone sodium phosphate, and intravenous fluids were administered. One day after admission to the first hospital, the patient was transferred to the obstetrics service of a second hospital for further evaluation. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Shampain: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed numerous hypoattenuating hepatic lesions, some with well-defined borders and others with ill-defined, irregular borders; the largest measured 8.2 cm in diameter. Multiple enlarged periaortic and portocaval lymph nodes were present (Fig. 1B). Dr. Prabhu: Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A percutaneous liver biopsy was performed, and examination of the biopsy specimen revealed evidence suggestive of metastatic adenocarcinoma. Plans for chemotherapy were discussed, as was early fetal delivery. One week after admission to the second hospital, the patient left against medical advice. She presented to her obstetrician’s office the next day, at 33 weeks of gestation, and then she was transferred to the obstetrics service of this hospital. On evaluation at this hospital, the patient reported ongoing severe back pain. She had no vaginal bleeding or contractions. The temperature was 36.2°C, the blood pressure 114/74 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was breathing ambient air. There was no abdominal tenderness, and fetal movement was detectable in the gravid uterus. The fetal heart rate was 125 beats per minute, with moderate variability and accelerations and without decelerations. Additional history was obtained. Four years earlier, the patient had had a spontaneous abortion at 10 weeks of gestation. Medications included a prenatal vitamin with ferrous sulfate and folate. The patient had no known allergies. She was originally from Asia and lived in a suburb of Boston. She was married and was a college pro-fessor. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use any illicit substances. Her father had diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and her maternal grandfather had cancer, the details of which were unknown to the patient. Management decisions were made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2018,24,nejm-case-2018-24,A 71-Year-Old Man with Acute Renal Failure and Hematuria,"Dr. Joshua Z. Drago (Medicine): A 71-year-old man was transferred to this hospital because of worsening renal function and hematuria. Three weeks before this admission, the patient’s wife became ill with chills, fatigue, and myalgias, and she thought she had influenza. A few days later, the patient reportedly had a subjective fever, with intermittent shaking chills, fatigue, malaise, anorexia, and mild diffuse myalgias. He noted that he had reduced his fluid intake and that his urine had become darker. His symptoms were temporarily relieved with the administration of acetaminophen. Approximately 10 days before this admission, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician, who thought the patient was dehydrated. Laboratory tests were performed, and the results came back later that day, revealing a serum creati-nine level of 4.9 mg per deciliter (433 μmol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.4 mg per deciliter [53 to 124 μmol per liter]); the creatinine level had been 0.8 mg per deciliter (71 μmol per liter) 2 months earlier. He was referred to the emergency department of another hospital. On evaluation at the other hospital, the patient reported persistent constitutional symptoms, intermittent lower abdominal cramping, and increased darkening of the urine, which had become the color of cola. The temperature was 36.9°C, the heart rate 87 beats per minute, the blood pressure 153/82 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 103.2 kg, and the mucous membranes were moist. The remainder of the examination was normal. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for influenza A and B viruses was negative, and a urine culture was obtained; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained. A chest radiograph was reportedly normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, reportedly revealed bilateral renal cysts without evidence of hydronephro-sis, diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis, cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis, and vascular calcifications of the abdominal aorta, with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (3.9 cm in diameter). Intravenous normal saline was administered, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. His outpatient medications were aspirin, ator-vastatin, amlodipine with benazepril, metformin, cholecalciferol, and n–3 fatty acids, as well as ibuprofen every other day for knee pain. Ibuprofen, aspirin, benazepril, and metformin were discontinued on admission. Renal ultrasonography revealed normal-sized kidneys (13.3 cm on the right and 11.8 cm on the left), with bilateral cysts (≤5.5 cm in diameter), including one with a thin septation, and no evidence of hydronephrosis. A nephrology consultation was obtained; additional test results are shown in Table 1. On hospital day 4, the creatinine level decreased to 3.2 mg per deciliter (283 μmol per liter), but over the next 2 days, hematuria occurred and the creatinine level increased to 3.9 mg per deciliter (345 μmol per liter). Examination of the urinary sediment revealed red cells, red-cell casts, and white-cell casts. Empirical treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was started, and a plan was made for kidney biopsy. Because the patient had temperatures of up to 37.7°C and persistent leukocytosis, two sets of blood cultures were obtained. Two days later, gram-negative rods grew in the two anaerobic bottles. Treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone was started, and methylprednisolone was discontinued. Repeat cultures of the blood and urine were obtained, ceftriaxone was discontinued, and treatment with cefepime and aztreonam was started. Repeat CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed an increased amount of perinephric fluid without evidence of a discrete abscess. It also revealed a hyperintense renal cyst (0.9 cm in diameter) in the right upper pole, new evidence of presacral fat stranding, and trace bilateral pleural effusions. An echocar-diogram showed normal ventricular function and no valvular calcifications. On hospital day 11, the creatinine level was 3.0 mg per deciliter (265 μmol per liter), and the patient requested transfer to this hospital. On evaluation at this hospital, a review of systems was notable for gross hematuria with brown urine, fatigue, low-grade fevers, anorexia, and intermittent cough. The patient reported diffuse crampy abdominal pain that he rated at 3 on a scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (the most severe pain). He reported that he had no dysuria, increase in urinary frequency, flank pain, nausea, vomiting, pharyngitis, dyspnea, rash, headache, or neurologic symptoms. The patient had a history of impaired glucose tolerance, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, abdominal aortic aneurysm, eczema, benign colonic polyps, diverticulosis, and osteoarthritis of the knees, shoulders, and lumbar spine. He had undergone right inguinal hernia repair, as well as radical prostatectomy for the treatment of prostate cancer 16 years previously. He had had no adverse reactions to medications. Several of his five young grandchildren had been ill during the month before this admission. He had retired 1 year earlier from a job in sales, which had involved travel to Europe and most recently to Mexico. He had drunk 3 or 4 beers daily since he had retired. He had smoked a half pack of cigarettes daily for 50 years but had most recently smoked a few cigarettes per day. His father had had lung cancer and his mother had had diabetes, but there was no family history of autoimmune or renal disease. On physical examination, the temperature was 37.4°C, the heart rate 84 beats per minute, the blood pressure 159/90 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 103.6 kg, the height 175 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 33.8. The patient appeared comfortable. Dentition was poor, but there were no oropharyn-geal lesions. Auscultation of the chest revealed an early-peaking systolic murmur (grade 2/6) at the left base and bibasilar crackles. The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, and there was no tenderness at the costovertebral angle. A left inguinal hernia was present. There were no septic lesions on the nails and no rashes. Voided urine was rose-colored, without clots. The rest of the examination was normal. Cultures of the urine and blood were obtained. Blood levels of magnesium, phosphorus, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotrans-ferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Examination of the urinary sediment revealed nondysmorphic red cells that were “too numerous to count,” a few granular casts, and no cellular casts. Results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal, and a urine test for Bence Jones protein was negative. Dr. Jad S. Husseini: CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material (Fig. 1). There was mild bilateral perinephric stranding with no hydronephrosis. The kidneys contained multiple, bilateral simple renal cortical cysts. There was colonic diverticulosis, predominantly involving the sigmoid colon, with fat stranding and multiple prominent lymph nodes in the sigmoid mes-entery. These findings were compatible with acute sigmoid diverticulitis. The peritoneum contained a trace amount of free fluid and no free air. There were vascular calcifications involving the abdominal aorta and its major branches, with an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (3.9 cm in diameter). The lung bases were clear. There were trace bilateral pleural effusions. Dr. Drago: Intravenous ceftazidime and metro-nidazole were administered. On hospital day 2, crampy abdominal and suprapubic pain occurred and the urine appeared darker red. Diagnostic tests were performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2008,24,nejm-case-2008-24,"A 35-Year-Old Woman with Postpartum Confusion, Agitation, and Delusions","Dr. Alexia E. Koukopoulos (Psychiatry): A 35-year-old woman was admitted to the inpatient psychiatry service of this hospital 5 days after the birth of her first child because of confusion, agitation, and delusions. The patient had been well until approximately 2 years earlier, when insomnia, auditory hallucinations, and disorientation, followed by severe depression and suicidal ideation, developed. After two inpatient psychiatric admissions, a diagnosis of bipolar disorder was made. The patient’s symptoms were controlled with lithium, 900 mg at bedtime, and citalopram, 40 mg per day, for the next 9 months. One year before admission, she was seen in consultation by the perinatal psychiatry service, since she and her husband wished to start a family. Approximately 11 months before admission, she discontinued her medications against the advice of her psychiatrist and the perinatal psychiatry consultant, and 2 months later, she became pregnant. During her pregnancy, she had intermittent dysphoria, anxiety, insomnia, and blunting of affect. She was advised by her physicians to resume her medications, but she declined to do so; she also stated that, should she become psychotic, she would not want to be given medications that could harm her child or preclude breast-feeding after delivery. Five days before admission to the psychiatry service, at 41 weeks 4 days of gestation, spontaneous rupture of membranes occurred. Approximately 12 hours later, a healthy male infant was delivered by emergency cesarean section, which was performed because there had been prolonged fetal heart-rate decelerations during labor. The patient’s postoperative recovery was uncomplicated. She began breast-feeding, and for the first 3 postpartum days, she was alert and oriented and interacted appropriately with her baby. During the third night, insomnia developed. At 5:30 a.m. on the fourth day, she was disoriented. She did not recall having given birth and did not recognize her baby; she appeared frightened and thought the nurses were trying to hurt her. An emergency psychiatry consultation was obtained, and olan-zapine (15 mg) was administered orally. Around-the-clock observation by a hospital staff member was initiated. During the next 24 hours, the patient remained agitated and confused, and she refused all medications. She spoke only in her native language, and tried to choke herself and bite others. She appeared to be having auditory hallucinations. Restraints were placed on her arms and legs. The patient’s hus-band gave consent for pharmacologic treatment, provided that, if possible, the medications chosen would be consistent with the patient’s desire to breast-feed her child. Haloperidol, lorazepam, and benztropine were administered intramuscularly. By the afternoon of the fifth postpartum day, the patient was alert and calm, speaking English, and asking what had happened. The restraints were removed. She pumped breast milk and had a supervised visit with her baby. She consented to a medication regimen that had been approved by the perinatal psychiatry team for use during breast-feeding. Valproic acid (500 mg), haloperidol (5 mg), and lorazepam (1 mg) were administered orally twice daily. The patient was transferred to the inpatient psychiatric unit. At the time of her initial evaluation for bipolar disorder, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, electroencephalographic studies, routine hematologic and serologic tests, and levels of electrolytes, glucose, vitamin B12, and folate were normal, as were tests of renal and thyroid function. Prenatal screening for hepatitis B virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and syphilis were negative. The patient was white and had immigrated to the United States from Europe approximately a decade earlier. She was married and worked in a professional occupation. There was no history of alcohol or substance dependence, and she had no allergies to medications. She had had a positive tuberculosis skin test and a normal chest radiograph in the past. Her family history was positive for severe depression in two first-degree relatives, including one who had attempted suicide; a second-degree relative had committed suicide. On transfer to the psychiatry unit, the patient had only a vague recollection of the events of the preceding days in the hospital. Her vital signs were normal. She was alert, oriented, attentive, cooperative, and well-groomed. Her mood was depressed and labile. She had insomnia and feelings of guilt about what had happened. She had no thoughts of suicide or of hurting her baby and no hallucinations or symptoms of psychosis. During the next 5 days, she had supervised visits with the baby and was breast-feeding and pumping milk. On the 10th postpartum day, she was discharged home. The family was educated about postpartum psychosis and the need for 24-hour supervision, and the patient and her husband reluctantly agreed to allow extended family members to stay with them for at least a month. Medications at discharge included valproic acid (500 mg) twice daily, lora-zepam (1 mg) three times daily as needed, and haloperidol (5 mg) at bedtime. One week after discharge, sertraline (50 mg per day) was added to the patient’s medications because of persistent depression, and 10 days later, she came to the emergency room because of thoughts of harming her baby. She was transferred to a psychiatric hospital affiliated with this institution, and eight sessions of electroconvulsive therapy were administered. The patient decided to stop breast-feeding; valproic acid was discontinued, and treatment with lithium was begun. The patient had persistent memory loss after the electroconvulsive therapy, but her symptoms abated, and she was discharged home on the 23rd hospital day. Three days later, she saw her obstetrician, who suggested that she consider not having more children because of her severe postpartum psychosis. The next day, she returned to the emergency department because of recurrent auditory hallucinations, intrusive thoughts about harming her baby, suicidal ideation, and agitation. She was readmitted to the psychiatric hospital. Halo-peridol and sertraline were discontinued, and treatment with olanzapine and citalopram was begun. Her symptoms abated, and she was discharged on the 17th hospital day. One week later, at a follow-up visit with her psychiatrist, the patient was alert and appropriate, and her mood appeared to be normal. She was working half-time and was able to take care of her baby. Her medications were olanzapine (25 mg daily), citalopram (20 mg daily), and lithium (300 mg three times daily). Two months later, the patient, her husband, and their baby moved to her native country to be closer to her extended family.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,09,nejm-case-2019-09,"A 62-Year-Old Man with Atrial Fibrillation, Depression, and Worsening Anxiety","Dr. Jonathan P. Zebrowski (Psychiatry): A 62-year-old man was evaluated in the psychiatry clinic of this hospital because of depression and worsening anxiety. The patient had received a diagnosis of major depressive disorder from a psychiatrist 15 years before this presentation, after his wife had received a diagnosis of cancer while she was pregnant with their daughter. The patient had severe depression and the onset of generalized anxiety symptoms in association with his wife’s progressive illness and ultimate death. Trials of buspirone, sertraline, and escitalopram were ineffective, but depression and anxiety symptoms diminished with the use of citalopram and clonazepam. The patient continued to use these two medications to control his depression and anxiety, and he stopped seeing his psychiatrist after almost 7 years of treatment, remaining under the care of his primary care physician. Six years later, he discontinued citalopram. One year later (20 months before this presentation), the patient contacted his primary care physician to report recurrent anxiety, depression, and lethargy. Cita-lopram was restarted. On evaluation in the primary care clinic 3 weeks later, he reported that his condition had improved with the use of medication but lethargy persisted. On examination, the blood pressure was 108/75 mm Hg, and the heart rate 130 beats per minute and irregular. An electrocardiogram (ECG) and rhythm strip (Fig. 1) showed new atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Treatment with metoprolol succinate and dabigatran was initiated, and during the next 4 weeks, the metoprolol dose was adjusted to control the heart rate. Trans-thoracic echocardiography revealed left atrial and left ventricular dilatation, a low-normal left ventricular ejection fraction, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, and no clinically significant valvular disease. Four weeks later (18 months before this presentation), the patient was evaluated in the cardiology clinic of this hospital; he reported daily episodes of palpitations. The blood pressure was 140/60 mm Hg, and the heart rate 60 beats per minute and regular. An ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with a slightly prolonged corrected QT (QTc) interval, measuring 466 msec. Holter monitoring for 24 hours was performed to assess for control of the heart rate; the average heart rate was 65 beats per minute, the maximum heart rate was 84 beats per minute, and no episodes of atrial fibrillation were detected. Approximately 1 year later (5 months before this presentation), the patient reported several weeks of heightened anxiety and recurrent depressive symptoms, which were in part due to financial stressors and the fact that his girlfriend of several years had received a diagnosis of recurrent cancer. The patient was binge drinking intermittently. He reported weekly panic attacks that were characterized by a “racing” heart, light-headedness, restlessness, and shaking; the panic attacks lasted 30 minutes and had some correlation with episodes of increased alcohol intake. After 4 months of persistent symptoms, the patient sought psychiatry consultation. One month later, on evaluation in the psychiatry clinic, the patient described his mood as depressed and anxious. He had persistent anxiety and panic symptoms, as well as worsened depressive symptoms, including difficulty concentrating, low energy, low self-worth, and sleeping for 2 to 3 hours more than usual each night. He reported having a stable appetite but had lost 6.4 kg during the preceding 18 months. He had had no hallucinations or thoughts of harming himself or others. He again reported weekly panic attacks that were characterized by a racing heart, light-headedness, restlessness, shaking, and generalized weakness. Some of these episodes had lasted several hours. There were no predictable triggers; the episodes had occurred at all times of day and had occasionally awakened him from sleep. He reported no chest pain or dyspnea. The patient’s medical history was notable for atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, osteoarthritis, colonic polyps, and vitamin D deficiency. He had undergone appendectomy and knee arthroplasty. He had had no psychiatric hospitalizations. Medications were citalopram, clonazepam, dabigatran, metoprolol succinate, fluticasone, and albuterol. Montelukast had caused an adverse reaction, and sertraline had caused paresthesia. The patient’s parents had a history of heavy alcohol use. Several paternal relatives had a history of depression, and a maternal aunt had died of an intentional drug overdose. His mother had had emphysema and had died of breast cancer. His father had had hyperlipidemia and had died of asbestosis. The patient was born and raised in New England. He had completed an undergraduate degree and had worked at a university for 20 years; in the past year, because of financial stressors, he had begun to work two jobs in retail. The patient did not smoke cigarettes and reported no illicit drug use. He reported drinking 4 to 6 servings of whiskey weekly, with occasional binges. On examination, the blood pressure was 112/67 mm Hg, and the heart rate 64 beats per minute and regular. The patient was well groomed, alert, oriented, and cooperative. He had fluent speech. His mood was sad and dysphoric, and his affect was flat. His thought process was goal-directed, and his attention was intact. He had good insight into his worsening depressive and anxiety symptoms. On review of laboratory data obtained during the previous 5 months, results of tests of thyroid function, kidney function, and liver function were normal, as were electrolyte levels and the complete blood count. Treatment with clonazepam and citalopram was continued, and aripiprazole was initiated. Three weeks after this presentation, the patient had fatigue and several episodes of palpitations followed by near syncope. He had no chest pain or dyspnea. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital. The temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 163/92 mm Hg, and the heart rate 120 beats per minute and irregular. He appeared to be well. Results of urinalysis, urine toxicologic testing, and kidney-function tests were normal, as were electrolyte and troponin T levels and the complete blood count. An ECG showed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response and nonspecific ST-segment changes. Intravenous and oral diltiazem were administered. While the patient was undergoing telemetry monitoring, he had two episodes of near syncope that correlated with sinus pauses of 6 seconds and 7 seconds. He was admitted to the cardiology unit, and a dual-chamber permanent pacemaker was placed. Metoprolol succinate was continued, and the patient was discharged home 2 days later. Two weeks later, the patient was seen in the psychiatry clinic. He reported marked improvement in his mood and energy after the initiation of aripiprazole; he did not report any further episodes of anxiety or panic. He had stable hyper-somnia, ongoing fatigue, and late-day mental “fogginess.” On evaluation at the primary care clinic 3 days later, the blood pressure was 124/82 mm Hg, and the heart rate 69 beats per minute and regular. Metoprolol was discontinued because of fatigue. Three weeks later, the patient reported to his psychiatrist that he had missed work because of increasing anxiousness, with the feeling of a racing and “thumping” heart and excessive worry. He reported that aripiprazole was not controlling his anxiety symptoms. He stated that his mood was “good” and his energy, sleep, and appetite were unchanged, but he had noticed weakness in his legs, restlessness, and some new difficulty breathing in association with his anxiety symptoms. The aripiprazole dose was increased. Several days later, a diagnostic test was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2009,09,nejm-case-2009-09,An 81-Year-Old Man with Massive Rectal Bleeding,"Dr. John C. Lamattina (Surgery): An 81-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of massive rectal bleeding. He had been in his usual state of health until 4 a.m. on the day of admission, when he awoke with a feeling of abdominal fullness, nausea, and rectal urgency. He passed a mixture (estimated volume, 0.7 liter) of bright-red blood and soft stool through the rectum. Emergency medical services were called. On their arrival, the blood pressure was 102/86 mm Hg, the pulse 46 beats per minute (which rose to 86), the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 89% while he was breathing ambient air. The skin was pink, warm, and dry. He was taken to the emergency department of another hospital. On arrival, he appeared alert. He reported no abdominal or rectal pain, heartburn, or dyspepsia, and he had no vomiting or dysphagia. The temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 113/88 mm Hg, the pulse 101 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute. The physical examination was normal except for the presence of blood in the rectum. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. A percutaneous intravenous catheter was inserted. Radiographs of the chest revealed an ectatic aorta and prominence of the interstitium of the lungs peripherally and at the bases, with no focal pulmonary consolidation or free air under the diaphragm. A radiograph of the abdomen revealed a nonobstructive pattern of gas and scoliosis. Oxygen (3 liters per minute) was administered by nasal cannula, and furosemide was given intravenously. Approximately 3 hours after arrival, three episodes of diarrhea with red blood occurred within a 19-minute period; each episode was preceded by the sensation of abdominal fullness and nausea. Results of laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. A second catheter was inserted, and normal saline (500 ml) was administered intravenously. The patient was transferred to this hospital, arriving in the emergency department 2 hours after the last episode. Every year for the past few years, an episode of lower gastrointestinal bleeding had occurred. Two years earlier, endoscopic evaluation of the lower gastrointestinal tract at the time of a bleeding episode revealed diverticulosis throughout the colon, blood throughout the colon but no active bleeding, and no blood or mucosal abnormalities in the terminal ileum; esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed superficial erosions and altered blood in the stomach, thought to be consistent with trauma from a nasogastric tube, and superficial erosions in the duodenum, without active bleeding. The patient had a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease with a myocardial infarction (for which he underwent coronary-stent placement), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis, gout, arthritis, spinal osteomyelitis, and a hip fracture. Laboratory-test results from 1 year earlier are shown in Table 1. He was a widower who lived alone. He had consumed alcohol daily and smoked in the past; he had stopped drinking several months earlier and had stopped smoking several years earlier. There was no family history of gastrointestinal cancer. He was allergic to penicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and vancomycin. Medications on admission included buprenorphine– naloxone, digoxin, modafinil, verapamil, aspirin, furosemide, escitalopram, simvastatin, folate, potassium chloride, finasteride, quinine, panto-prazole, galantamine, and a multivitamin. During the previous 5 months, he had used oxygen supplementation (4 liters per minute) at home. On examination, the patient was in moderate respiratory distress and mildly diaphoretic. The blood pressure was 97/51 mm Hg, the pulse 95 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 80% while he was breathing ambient air, which improved to 92% with oxygen (2 liters per minute by nasal cannula). The jugular venous pulse was visible at 10 cm. There were crackles in both lungs. The abdomen was soft, with hyperactive bowel sounds; no tenderness, distention, or hepatosplenomegaly was present. Red and maroon blood was present in the rectum. No hemorrhoids were seen. The feet were warm, the pulses were full, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Levels of serum electrolytes were normal; tests for cre-atine kinase cardiac isoenzymes and troponin I were negative. Other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Insulin, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, ondan-setron, furosemide, esomeprazole, albuterol, normal saline (1 liter), fresh-frozen plasma (2 units), and packed red cells (4 units) were administered intravenously; the blood pressure rose as high as 110 to 117/45 to 60 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 90 to 95 beats per minute. A nasogastric tube was placed, and gastric lavage revealed no blood in the stomach. Hematochezia continued. Results of laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Approximately 7 hours after arrival, a central intravenous catheter was inserted, and additional red cells (3 units) were infused. Dyspnea worsened, with respirations up to 32 per minute, and the trachea was intubated. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,13,nejm-case-2010-13,An 18.5-Month-Old Girl with Watery Diarrhea and Poor Weight Gain,"Dr. Sara V. Bates (Pediatric Service): An 18.5-month-old girl was seen in the pediatric gastroenterology clinic of this hospital because of watery diarrhea and poor weight gain. The patient was born to a multigravida mother after a full-term gestation. She was breast-fed for the first 2 months of life and then began to receive a milk-containing formula. When she was approximately 12 months of age, whole milk was added to her diet. Shortly thereafter, watery diarrhea developed, occurring up to 10 to 15 times per day, with no vomiting or blood in the stools. After approximately 2 months, she refused milk, although she occasionally ate cheese products; diarrhea continued. Her diet included baby food, bananas and other fruits, pudding, and diluted white grape juice. At a routine office visit when the patient was 18 months of age, her weight for her age and sex had decreased from the 56th percentile at 7 months of age to less than the 10th percentile at her current age. The white-cell count was 9700 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 6000 to 17,500), with 32% neutrophils (37 to 80%), 65% lymphocytes (10 to 50%), 1% monocytes (0 to 12%), and 2% atypical lymphocytes (0 to 5%); the platelet count was 431,000 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 140,000 to 400,000), and the plasma level of globulin 2.5 g per deciliter (reference range, 2.6 to 4.1). Results were normal for the hematocrit; the erythrocyte sedimentation rate; plasma levels of electrolytes, glucose, total protein, albumin, bilirubin, and calcium; tests of liver function; and urinalysis. Examination of a stool specimen for ova and parasites, fecal reducing substances, fecal fat, fecal fibers, and giardia antigen was negative, as was a culture of the stool specimen for pathogens. The patient was referred to the pediatric gastroenterology clinic of this hospital, where she was seen 3 weeks later. The patient’s mother reported watery diarrhea that was green and occasionally mustard-colored, occurring up to 15 times per day. The patient was otherwise healthy and active, but her mother noted that the child had become increasingly irritable during the previous 2 months. The patient refused milk and pediatric supplemental formula. She enjoyed foods such as macaroni and cheese, pizza, lasagna, yogurt, and baby food. She had received her childhood immunizations, took no medications, and had no known allergies. She lived with her parents and two older siblings. Her mother and maternal aunt had undergone urologic procedures in childhood. Her maternal grandmother had type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism. The patient’s brother was developmentally delayed; her other sibling was well. On examination, the patient was small and thin (Table 1). The abdomen was soft, without tenderness, organomegaly, or masses. A rash was present on her perineum in the distribution of her diaper, and the skin was otherwise clear. The remainder of the examination was normal. The stool in the diaper was watery, with specks of solid material; a test of the stool for blood was negative. Ultrasonography of the abdomen was normal; the kidneys were 5.9 cm (right) and 6.3 cm (left) in length (normal, 6.6±0.5), and the spleen was 4.7 cm in length (normal, 6.3±0.7). When the child was in the prone position, there was minimal fluid in the right renal pelvis and no distention; no calyceal or ureteral dilatation, ascites, or pleural effusions were present. Five days later, endoscopic examination of the gastrointestinal tract revealed normal mucosa in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum and no inflammation. Colonoscopic examination showed multiple nodules in the rectum, sigmoid colon, and descending colon; biopsy specimens were obtained. Pathological examination of the nodules of the sigmoid colon and rectum showed lymphoid aggregates; examination of tissue from the stomach and duodenum was normal. The intestinal biopsy specimen had normal levels of disac-charidase activity. The level of total serum IgA was normal; testing for IgA antibody to endomy-sial antigen and IgA and IgG antibodies to tissue transglutaminase was negative, and radioallergo-sorbent testing for the five common food allergens was negative. At a repeat visit 1 month later, the results of physical examination were unchanged. Height and weight are shown in Table 1. A sweat test revealed a chloride level equivalent to 34 mmol per liter on the right arm, and 40 mmol per liter on the left arm; these were interpreted as borderline results (normal, <40; borderline, 40 to 60; abnormal, >60). An upper gastrointestinal study with a small-bowel follow-through examination was normal. Cystic fibrosis genotyping (508 FIRST test, Ambry Genetics) showed no mutation. Stool testing showed a fecal pancreatic elastase level of 85 µg per gram (reference value, ≥201 µg per gram); however, the test was limited by the watery stool submitted. Further testing of a stool sample revealed a sodium level of 100 mmol per liter, a potassium level of 33.6 mmol per liter, a chloride level of 29 mmol per liter, and osmolality of 285 mOsm per kilogram (reference ranges not defined). Culture of a specimen of stool grew aeromonas. Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole in an oral suspension was prescribed for 2 weeks. A diagnostic test result was received. ",{'Causes of chronic diarrhea and weight loss in infants': []},"Paraneoplastic diarrhea, probably resulting from catecholamines and VIP secreted from a ganglio-neuroblastoma or ganglioneuroma. Dr. Esther J. Israel (Pediatric Gastroenterology): The diagnostic test was a measurement of urinary catecholamines. The level of vanilmandelic acid was elevated at 27.6%. The dopamine level was very elevated (19,135 µg per gram of creati-nine; normal range for patients 1 to 2 years of age, 86 to 1861), and the VIP level was also abnormally elevated (135 pg per milliliter; normal range, <75).

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2013,03,nejm-case-2013-03,A 72-Year-Old Woman with Abdominal Pain and Distention after Peritoneal Dialysis,"Dr.AdaStefanescu (Medicine): A 72-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) was admitted to this hospital because of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain and distention. The patient had been receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis for 18 months for ESRD presumed to be due to diabetic nephropathy. Six weeks before the patient was admitted, the dialysis catheter reportedly became occluded. A tunneled hemodialysis catheter was inserted in the right chest wall, and hemodialysis three times weekly was begun at another facility. During the next few weeks, nausea and vomiting developed and were associated with an unspecified loss of weight. Seventeen days before admission, the patient was evaluated in an outpatient clinic at this hospital for removal of the peritoneal catheter and for creation of an arterio-venous fistula. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Venograms of the arms were normal. While the patient was awaiting surgery, abdominal discomfort and constipation developed, nausea worsened, and the frequency of vomiting increased. Anemia and guaiac-positive stool were reportedly noted by her primary care provider. One week before admission, abdominal distention and increasing anorexia developed. On the day of admission, she underwent scheduled hemodialysis, after which she was brought to the emergency department at this hospital. The patient reported constipation, occasional bleeding from the site of the peritoneal catheter, and slight chest pain with movement, associated with the site of the hemodialysis catheter. Her family reported that she possibly had low-grade fevers without chills. She had insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslip-idemia, aortic-valve and mitral-valve regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, mild dementia, and depression. She had had an episode of unstable angina approximately 2.5 months before her admission to this hospital, for which percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with placement of a bare-metal stent in the left main coronary artery had been performed at another hospital. She reportedly had recurrent urinary tract infections, pyelonephritis, and episodes of peritonitis, for which she had been admitted to other hospitals and received antibiotics. Medications on admission included isosorbide mononi-trate, lisinopril, amlodipine, carvedilol, clopido-grel, allopurinol, niacin, sertraline, simvastatin, insulin, aspirin, docusate sodium, and renal vitamin supplements. The patient had been born in Southeast Asia, had moved to New England several years earlier, and lived with her husband; a son and daughter lived in the area. She spoke no English. She required assistance with ambulation, bathing, and other daily activities. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. The family history was unknown. On examination, the blood pressure was 145/66 mm Hg and the temperature 37.6°C; the pulse, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were normal. The patient was drowsy but easily aroused, and she answered questions slowly. There was a pansystolic cardiac murmur, loudest at the apex, and a diastolic murmur along the left sternal border. The abdomen was distended, with normal bowel sounds and without tenderness or masses. The sites of the peritoneal and hemodialysis catheters were dry, without redness, drainage, or warmth. The remainder of the examination was normal. The platelet count, mean corpuscular volume, corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, serum levels of calcium and lactic acid, and tests of coagulation were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm, 88 beats per minute, with evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy and strain. A chest radiograph revealed diffuse interstitial opacities in the lungs that were consistent with interstitial edema, mild cardiac enlargement, and aortic atherosclerosis. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis without intravenous contrast material showed atelectasis in both lung bases; small calcified nodules in the right lower lung and a nodule (3 mm in diameter) in the lingula; free-flowing ascites throughout the abdomen, surrounding the liver and spleen, and in the paracolic gutters and cul-de-sac; and a lytic lesion in the fifth lumbar vertebral body. The peritoneal catheter was flushed with peritoneal-dialysis solution (approximately 60 ml). The effluent withdrawn (30 ml) was dense and contained material with the consistency of a fibrin clot; results of fluid analysis are shown in Table 1. A specimen of the fluid was cultured, and vancomycin was administered. The patient was admitted to this hospital. Overnight, the temperature rose to 38.3°C; the examination was unchanged. On the second day, peritoneal-dialysis solution (500 ml, warmed) was instilled through the peritoneal catheter; effluent (1700 ml) with sediment and clumps of fibrinous material was drained immediately, and the catheter was capped. Ceftazidime was administered. Blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, total and direct bilirubin, total protein, globulin, lipase, thyrotropin, and lactate were normal, and testing for troponin I was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. The next day, urinalysis revealed cloudy yellow fluid, 2+ glucose, a specific gravity of 1.029, and a pH of 7.5. The urinalysis also revealed 3+ albumin, with 3 to 5 red cells, 20 to 50 white cells, few squamous cells, very few transitional cells, and very few renal tubular cells per high-power field, as well as 20 to 100 hyaline casts, 20 to 100 granular casts, and 5 to 10 waxy casts per low-power field. Cultures of the blood, peritoneal fluid, and urine remained negative. Hemo-dialysis was performed, and vancomycin and epoetin alfa were administered. Fevers resolved after the third day, and antibiotics were continued for a planned 14 days. On the fifth hospital day, nuclear cardiology testing suggested mild scarring and ischemia of the distal inferolateral left ventricular wall. Trans-thoracic echocardiography revealed an estimated ejection fraction of 79%, with symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, moderate aortic insufficiency, mild mitral regurgitation, a dilated ascending aorta, and no pericardial effusion. A skin test for tuberculosis was negative at 48 hours. Testing for antibodies to hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen was positive, with no evidence of HBV antigens or hepatitis C virus infection. Cultures of the blood, urine, and peritoneal fluid remained negative. Additional laboratory-test results were pending. On the eighth day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2013,02,nejm-case-2013-02,"A 20-Year-Old Man with Recurrent Ear Pain, Fever, and Headache","A 20-year-old man was transferred to this hospital because of recurrent ear pain, fever, and headache. The patient had been well until 8 months earlier, when pain developed in the right ear; a diagnosis of otitis media was made and antibiotics were administered. During the next 7 months, pain recurred intermittently, despite additional antimicrobial therapy. One month before admission, computed tomography (CT) of the head reportedly revealed opacification of the mastoid air cells bilaterally with erosive and destructive changes, more on the right side than on the left side. Amoxicillin was administered for 3 weeks. Two weeks before admission, headache developed and gradually increased in severity. Five days before admission, the patient went to another facility; tramadol was administered, without improvement. That night, he awoke with a severe occipital headache and stiff neck, with photophobia, phono-phobia, fever, chills, and dizziness. He went to the emergency department of another hospital. The temperature was 37.6°C on examination and rose to 38.3°C later that day; the blood pressure was 118/79 mm Hg and the pulse 130 beats per minute, with normal respirations and oxygen saturation. The right external auditory canal was erythematous and scarred, the tympanic membrane was dull and retracted, without purulent drainage, and the mastoid area was tender. The neck was stiff, and the patient was unable to rotate his head laterally. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, at a rate of 133 beats per minute. CT of the head, without the administration of contrast material, reportedly showed opacification of both middle-ear cavities and the mastoid air cells, with erosion of the inferomedial wall of the right temporal bone, contiguous to the meningeal space. Lumbar puncture was performed; results of analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are shown in Table 1. Gram’s staining of the CSF showed no organisms, and testing for antigens to Haemophilus influenzae, group B streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Neis-seria meningitidis was negative. Specimens of blood and CSF were cultured. Vanco-mycin, ceftriaxone, dexamethasone, acetaminophen, and a narcotic analgesic were administered, and droplet precautions were instituted. CT of the temporal bones, performed after the administration of contrast material, revealed enhancing soft tissue in the superior external auditory canal of the right ear. The CT images also showed opacification of the mastoid air cells and middle-ear cavities, with lytic and sclerotic bony changes in the right mastoid, and mastoid dehis-cence communicating to the dura of the middle cranial fossa. The next day, a right tympanostomy tube was placed through a markedly thickened tympanic membrane. Edema of the posterior canal wall was noted; aspiration revealed bloody fluid but no pus or mucus. Analysis of the fluid revealed many red cells, very few neutrophils, and no organisms on Gram’s staining; culture was sterile. An otic solution of ciprofloxacin and hydrocortisone was administered. Two sets of blood cultures obtained on the first day grew Proteus mirabilis, sensitive to all antibiotics tested; peptostrepto-coccus and a possible anaerobic, gram-negative rod (negative for beta-lactamase) grew in one bottle. A culture of the fluid from the right ear grew moderate numbers of anaerobic gram-negative rods and anaerobic gram-positive cocci and, in the bottle of broth, few mixed flora; cultures of the CSF remained sterile. The administration of metronidazole was begun. Headache, neck stiffness, and pain in the right ear and mastoid region persisted. On the fourth day, the temperature rose to 38.8°C. CT of the temporal bone and brain, performed after the administration of contrast material, reportedly showed thrombosis of the right sigmoid sinus, extending to the transverse sinus and internal jugular vein. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain reportedly confirmed abnormal fluid signal surrounding the contra-lateral cerebellum. The patient was transferred to this hospital on the fifth day. Medications on transfer included ceftriaxone, metronidazole, fludrocortisone, hydromorphone, ondansetron, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and an otic solution of neomycin, polymyxin, and hydrocortisone. The patient reported a severe right hemispheric headache and rated the pain at 9.5 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He also reported retro-orbital pain (worse on the right side than on the left side), right-sided neck pain associated with limited range of motion, mild photophobia, discomfort with swallowing, and double vision on standing. He had been well and taking no medications before this illness. He had no known allergies. He was born in a Caribbean country, lived with his family, and had recently graduated from college. He drank alcohol rarely and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. On examination, the temperature was 36.7°C, the blood pressure 151/99 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 23 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. There was proptosis in the right eye, the pupils were 2 to 3 mm in diameter and sluggishly reactive, and there was occasional exophoria of the right eye. Facial function was normal bilaterally, but the patient could not open his mouth fully because of pain; the tongue was midline. The right mastoid was tender, without fluctuance or edema. The right ear canal was edematous and ballot-able, partly obscuring the drum. The anterior drum was thickened and erythematous, without landmarks. The tympanostomy tube was in place, patent, and dry. A tuning fork was used to show that Rinne testing was negative bilaterally (i.e., bone conduction was greater than air conduction) and that, in the Weber test, sound lateralized to the right. Hearing was decreased bilaterally. The neck was tender to palpation on the right side, and neck motion was limited and painful; the remainder of the examination was normal. Gait was not tested. Levels of glycated hemoglobin, total protein, globulin, phosphorus, calcium, amylase, lipase, troponin T, and creatine kinase MB isoenzymes were normal, as were the results of renal- and liver-function tests; screening for toxins was negative. Other test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph showed bibasilar subsegmen-tal atelectasis, mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, and nonspecific mediastinal fullness. A diagnostic procedure was performed, and management decisions were made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,12,nejm-case-2010-12,An 89-Year-Old Man with Progressive Dyspnea,"An 89-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of progressive dyspnea. The patient had been in his usual state of health, with diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and complete heart block, until 6 months before admission, when shortness of breath developed. His exercise capacity gradually decreased from walking three blocks to climbing one flight of stairs. Three days before admission, dyspnea increased, and he had difficulty walking two to three steps on a level plane. During the next 2 days, his children noted that he was somnolent and less interactive than usual, with decreased appetite and urine output and an unsteady gait. On the morning of admission, they called emergency medical services. When the emergency medical services personnel arrived, the patient was sitting, with labored breathing. The blood pressure was 118/70 mm Hg, and the pulse 60 beats per minute; there were rales in both lung fields. The blood glucose level, by fingerstick measurement, was 230 mg per deciliter (12.8 mmol per liter), and an electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a paced rhythm with no ectopy. During transport to this hospital by ambulance, oxygen (15 liters per minute) and furosemide were administered, with improvement. The patient did not have fevers, chills, night sweats, chest pain, or leg edema. A chronic, dry cough was unchanged. He had lost approximately 2.3 kg within the previous 2 months. He had coronary artery disease (treated with a stent 10 years earlier), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cerebrovascular disease, osteoarthritis, hearing impairment, vertigo, and cataracts, and he had undergone a trans-urethral prostatectomy in the past. A diagnosis of complete heart block had been made 6 years earlier, when he presented with syncope; ECG at that time revealed an atrial rate of 120 beats per minute, with complete heart block and a ventricular escape rhythm of 30 to 33 beats per minute. A pacemaker was inserted. Chest radio-graphs showed bilateral coarse reticular opacities, which were most pronounced at the lung bases. The patient lived alone and did his own shopping and cooking. He was a retired plumber who had been exposed to asbestos while working in a shipyard. He had smoked three packs of cigarettes per day for 50 years but had stopped 14 years ear-lier, and he drank alcohol occasionally; he did not use illicit drugs. His mother had died at 49 years of age of unknown causes, his father had died of colon cancer, a brother had heart disease and asbestosis, and his adult children were well. Medications included metformin, rosiglitazone, acetyl-salicylic acid, captopril, metoprolol, atorvastatin, furosemide, tolazamide, nifedipine, and cimeti-dine. He had no known allergies. On examination in the emergency department, the temperature was 36.1°C, the blood pressure 105/43 mm Hg, and the pulse 81 beats per minute; the respirations were 28 per minute. The oxygen saturation was 78% while the patient was breathing ambient air, 91% with supplemental oxygen (6 liters) by nasal cannula, and 100% while he was breathing from a nonrebreather mask. The jugular venous pulse was visible at 14 cm above the right atrium. Crackles extended halfway up the lungs, with occasional expiratory wheezes; the remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. An ECG showed a pacemaker rate of 88 beats per minute. A chest radiograph showed bilateral patchy air-space opacities, indistinct pulmonary vessels, possible small pleural effusions, and a dual-lead pacemaker on the left chest wall. Additional furosemide and sodium polystyrene sulfonate were administered, and the patient was admitted to the medical service. Later that day, while walking with assistance, a syncopal episode occurred. The systolic blood pressure was initially 60 mm Hg; 5 minutes later, his blood pressure was 140/68 mm Hg. The next day, a chest radiograph revealed decreased air-space opacities, calcified pleural plaques on the right hemidiaphragm, and coarse reticular opacities, with increased cystic lucency, at both bases. Serial testing of cardiac biomark-ers showed no evidence of myocardial infarction. Oxygen supplementation, captopril, atorvastatin, and metoprolol were continued; esomeprazole, insulin on a sliding scale for hyperglycemia, heparin, and low-dose acetylsalicylic acid were begun, with intravenous furosemide as needed for diuresis. Dyspnea on exertion persisted. On the third day, oxygen saturation intermittently decreased to 77 to 85% while the patient was breathing 10 liters of oxygen with the use of a nonrebreather mask. A transthoracic echocardio-gram showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and an ejection fraction of 54%. The right ventricle was markedly dilated and hypoki-netic, with moderate-to-severe tricuspid-valve regurgitation, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and systolic and diastolic flattening of the interven-tricular septum, features that were consistent with both right ventricular volume and pressure overload. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed calcification of the pericardium and pleura, mild-to-moderate atherosclerosis in the aorta, and a dual-chamber pacemaker with leads in the in-nominate vein, right atrial appendage, and right ventricular septum. Paratracheal, hilar, and sub-carinal lymph nodes ranged from 1.5 to 2.3 cm in diameter. Cystic changes and septal thickening were seen throughout both lungs, with bronchial-wall thickening, honeycomb changes, and traction bronchiectasis. There was diffuse asymmetric ground-glass opacification. During the next 4 days, dyspnea and intermittent oxygen desaturation recurred with minimal activity, despite assistance by means of bilevel and continuous positive airway pressure. Ceftriaxone, azithromycin, levofloxacin, prednisone, morphine, bronchodilators, and additional furosemide were given. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. On the seventh day, the trachea was intubated; mechanical ventilation was begun, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. Despite pressors, broad-spectrum antibiotics, morphine sulfate, stress-dose corticosteroids, insulin by intravenous infusion, intravenous fluids, and maximal ventilator support, his condition worsened, and on the eighth day, an asystolic cardiac arrest occurred. In consultation with the patient’s family, cardiopulmonary resuscitation was not attempted, and the patient was pronounced dead. An autopsy was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,08,nejm-case-2019-08,"A 58-Year-Old Woman with Vision Loss, Headaches, and Oral Ulcers","Dr. Chio Yokose (Medicine): A 58-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital for vision loss in the right eye, acute progressive vision loss in the left eye, headaches, and rashes. Four years before admission, a brown, nonpainful, nonpruritic, maculopapular rash developed on the trunk. Approximately 4 weeks later, the rash had spontaneously resolved; however, painful, peeling, erythematous papules had appeared on the hands and in the web spaces between the fingers, and oral and nasal aphthous ulcerations had occurred. During the following weeks, the hand lesions and nasal ulcers spontaneously resolved. The oral ulcers waxed and waned but continued to be present intermittently. Dr. Lana M. Rif kin: Three and a half years before admission, bilateral temporal pingueculae were identified on routine ophthalmologic examination. Approximately 18 months later, pain and redness developed in both eyes; the patient received a diagnosis of bilateral conjunctival ulcerations, and prednisolone eyedrops were prescribed. Four weeks later, she returned to the ophthalmology clinic and reported headaches on the right side and 3 days of bilateral blurry vision, photophobia that led her to wear sunglasses indoors, and redness and pain in the right eye. She rated the eye pain as 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. Bromfenac eyedrops were prescribed, and she was referred to an ophthalmologist who specialized in uveitis. Examination by the uveitis specialist revealed scleritis in the right eye and oral ulcers; prednisolone eyedrops were resumed, and oral piroxicam was prescribed. Dr. Yokose: During the next 4 weeks, the blurry vision and photophobia decreased. Five weeks later (21 months before admission), the patient was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital for worsened oral ulcers and recurrent blurry vision in the left eye that had developed as the glucocorticoid dose was tapered. Examination was notable for aphthous ulcers on the tongue and several nasal erosions. Blood levels of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, total protein, albumin, and globulin and results of liver-function tests were normal. Tests for antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Rif kin: One month later, the patient returned to the ophthalmology clinic for follow-up. She reported pain in the left eye (rated as 7 out of 10) and recurrent blurry vision and photopho-bia. Examination revealed new scleritis in the left eye. Dr. Yokose: During the next 6 months, the patient could not be fully weaned off glucocorti-coid therapy because of both chronic asthma and worsening oral ulcerations that occurred with medication tapers. Azathioprine, adalimumab, and intravitreal glucocorticoids were administered for scleritis and oral ulcers. Because testing for HLA-B51 was positive, a working diagnosis of atypical Behçet’s disease was considered. During the next 2 months (13 to 12 months before admission), two doses of rituximab were administered for persistent eye pain, blurry vision, and photophobia. During the next 10 months (12 to 2 months before admission), the patient had monthly follow-up visits for persistent pain in both eyes and waxing and waning redness of the eyes, blurry vision, and photophobia. The treatments that were administered included pulse therapy with high-dose glucocorticoids, two additional doses of rituximab with cyclophosphamide, and cyclo-sporine, which caused worsening leg rashes and ulcerations. While the patient was receiving rituximab, a blood specimen was obtained for flow cytometric studies. There were 46 CD4+CD3+ T cells per cubic millimeter (reference range, 419 to 1590) and 97 CD8+CD3+ T cells per cubic millimeter (reference range, 190 to 1140). The percentage of total lymphocytes was 3%, and no B cells were detected. Dr. Rifkin: Two months before admission, oph-thalmologic examination revealed new bilateral iridocyclitis; the findings were more prominent in the left eye than the right eye. Loteprednol eyedrops and tocilizumab were administered, and the iridocyclitis resolved. Four weeks later, the patient noticed decreased vision in her right eye. Ophthalmologic examination of the right eye revealed new panuveitis, with a cell grade of 2+ in the anterior chamber, a cell grade of 0.5+ in the anterior vitreous, and vitreous haze, as well as retinitis. Results of fluorescein angiography were normal. Lotepred-nol eyedrops and tocilizumab were continued. Two weeks later, ophthalmologic examination of the right eye revealed a cell grade of 3+ in the anterior chamber, a cell grade of 1+ in the anterior vitreous, a haze grade of 1+ in the vitreous, and new chorioretinitis; high-dose prednisone was administered. One week later, although the iritis and scleritis were diminishing in both eyes, there was new retinitis in the inferior aspect of the right eye (Fig. 1). An intravitreal dexametha-sone implant was placed, and infliximab was administered. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Yokose: Three days later (6 days before admission), the patient had decreased vision in the left eye and worsened headaches, which occurred in a bifrontal distribution. These symptoms were associated with tearing, nasal pain, and nausea. In addition, a painful desquamating rash began on her lower legs and spread proximally, and it was accompanied by worsened painful peeling of her hands. The headaches and pain in her hands and legs did not respond to ibuprofen and acetaminophen. Two days before admission, the patient had decreased vision in both eyes with associated photophobia and shooting eye pain. She was admitted to the medical service of this hospital. The patient had a 20-year history of asthma that had led to multiple hospitalizations, as well as treatment with prolonged courses of oral gluco-corticoids, which were complicated by osteoporosis and hyperglycemia. She had had spontaneous pneumothoraxes in her 20s, gastroesophageal reflux disease, breast fibroadenoma and fibrocystic changes, and hypertension. Her ocular history also included meibomian gland dysfunction and aqueous tear deficiency, and she had undergone bilateral laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery 12 years earlier. A review of systems was notable for chronic headaches, pain in the knees and elbows, mild epistaxis, and Raynaud’s phenomenon. She had no fever, chills, anorexia, weight loss, confusion, seizure, vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss, hair loss, ocular flashes or floaters, jaw claudication, nasal discharge, sinus tenderness, morning stiffness, pathergy, history of genital ulcers, skin or hair changes, or gastrointestinal or genitourinary symptoms. Medications were prednisone, atovaquone, pantoprazole, theophylline, and valganciclovir, as well as an albuterol inhaler and nebulizer, lidocaine–diphenhydramine suspension, ibuprofen, and tramadol as needed. Eyedrops included brimonidine–timolol, latanoprost, and predniso-lone. Sulfa drugs had caused anaphylaxis, cyclo-sporine had caused skin ulcerations, azathioprine had caused hepatotoxicity, and latex had caused bronchospasm. The patient taught at an academic institution in New England. She had smoked cigarettes only briefly, as a teenager; she drank wine once weekly and did not use illicit drugs. She was divorced and lived with her boyfriend, with whom she was monogamous. She had a dog and had recently traveled to Nevada, where she was caught in a dust storm; she had traveled to Shanghai in the past. The patient’s family was of Italian descent; her father had Crohn’s disease, her mother had glaucoma and breast cancer, one sister had Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, and the other sister had endometrial cancer. The patient appeared to be uncomfortable. On examination, the temperature was 36.4°C, the heart rate 98 beats per minute, the blood pressure 157/99 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was breathing ambient air. The weight was 54.5 kg, the height 160 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 21.3. The sclerae were erythematous, and the right pupil was nonreactive to light. Neurologic examination was notable for two beats of clonus on dorsi-flexion of the ankles. There were multiple aph-thous ulcers on the buccal mucosal and inner surfaces of the lips, as well as linear ulcers on the tongue edges. There was an erythematous rash on the palms (Fig. 2A), with desquamation, areas of healing fissures in the web spaces between the fingers, and tender erythematous pap-ules on both upper arms. There was an erythem-atous, maculopapular rash on the legs (Fig. 2B), with several scaled and scabbed lesions and areas of epidermal atrophy. There was bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. No joint erythema, tenderness, or warmth was noted. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, total protein, albumin, and globulin and results of liver-function tests were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Karen A. Buch: Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass, or acute territorial infarct; there was possible patchy hypoattenuation in the mesencephalon. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, including venography and arteriography, revealed no acute intracranial or intraocular abnormality, no abnormal enhancement, no thrombosis of the du-ral venous sinuses or deep cerebral veins, and no hemodynamically significant stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm. There was mild dilatation of the superior ophthalmic veins that was greater on the right side than on the left side. There was no definite evidence of abnormal enhancement of the vessel wall involving the proximal major in-tracranial arteries. MRI of the head also revealed no focal signal abnormality or abnormal enhancement in the orbits. Dr. Yokose: Hydromorphone, gabapentin, and ketorolac were administered for pain. The patient was urgently transferred to the eye infirmary affiliated with this hospital for ophthalmologic evaluation, which revealed normal intraocular pressures, visual acuity of 20/25 in the left eye, only light perception in the right eye, and an afferent pupillary defect in the right eye. Slit-lamp examination of the right eye revealed bilateral scleral thinning and nuclear sclerosis, a cell grade of 2+ in the anterior chamber, and a cell grade of 3+ and a haze grade of 2+ in the vitreous. Fundu-scopic examination revealed round, circumferential, yellow retinal lesions that were consistent with infection. Intravitreal foscarnet and gan-ciclovir were administered, and oral valacyclo-vir therapy was started. Prednisolone, latanoprost, and brimonidine–timolol eyedrops were continued. A dose of intravenous methylprednisone was administered, and then treatment was transi-tioned to oral prednisone (60 mg daily). On the second day, a lumbar puncture was performed; the opening pressure was 22 cm of water, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was colorless, with a glucose level of 60 mg per deciliter (3.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]) and a total protein level of 160 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55). There were 64 nucleated cells per cubic millimeter (reference range, 0 to 5), of which 63% were neutrophils, 16% lymphocytes, and 21% monocytes. A punch biopsy of the rash on the left leg was performed. Treatment with clobetasol cream and tacrolimus ointment was started. On the second and third days, the patient’s temperature reached 37.3°C. Blood tests were negative for toxoplasma antibodies and for cyto-megalovirus (CMV) DNA and varicella–zoster virus (VZV) DNA. CSF tests were negative for cryptococcal antigen and for human herpesvirus 6 DNA, herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2 DNA, CMV DNA, and VZV DNA. Vitreous fluid tests were negative for toxoplasma and for HSV DNA, CMV DNA, and VZV DNA. On the fifth day, repeat vitreous aspiration was performed with intravitreal injection of fos-carnet. On the sixth day, diagnostic test results were received.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2018,25,nejm-case-2018-25,A 63-Year-Old Man with Syncope,"Dr. William J. Hucker: A 63-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of syncope. Approximately 13 years before admission, the patient had an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and was found to have multivessel coronary artery disease. He underwent coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) at another hospital, with grafting of the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery, grafting of a segment of a radial artery to an obtuse marginal branch of the left circumflex coronary artery, and grafting of a saphenous vein to the posterior descending artery. Thereafter, he was followed by a local cardiologist, and he remained active and worked full-time, without cardiac symptoms or limitations. The night before admission, the patient drank 12 beers. Later that night, after he stood up to walk to the bathroom, his wife heard a thud and found him on the floor of the bedroom. He had sustained facial trauma. She noted that he looked gray, and she started to administer chest compressions. She did not check his pulse or observe jerking movements or tongue laceration, but she noted that he may have had some urinary incontinence. The patient regained consciousness after chest compressions had been administered for a few seconds. On evaluation by emergency medical services personnel, the patient was awake and alert. He did not recall having any prodromal symptoms, although he could not remember anything that had happened before emergency personnel had arrived. The initial heart rate was 50 beats per minute, the blood pressure 65/40 mm Hg, and the blood glucose level 98 mg per deciliter (5.4 mmol per liter) on fingerstick testing. An electrocardiogram reportedly showed horizontal ST-segment depressions of 1 mm in the inferior leads. The patient initially refused medical care, but he stumbled when he stood up, so he was brought to the emergency department of this hospital. A review of systems was negative for chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, light-headedness, dizziness, edema, and constitutional symptoms. The patient reported mild, progressive bilateral hearing loss and intermittent numbness of the lower legs. He had a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, gout, varicose veins, and venous insufficiency, and he had undergone a knee replacement 9 months previously for the treatment of osteoarthritis. Medications included clopidogrel, metoprolol succinate, furose-mide, ezetimibe, and allopurinol. Statin therapy had been stopped 3 months previously owing to persistent elevations in the creatine kinase level; in addition, sulfa drugs had caused a rash and aspirin use may have been associated with dyspepsia. The patient had a long-term history of alcohol consumption, typically 8 to 12 beers daily, and withdrawal symptoms had occurred in the hospital after his knee replacement. He smoked currently and had smoked up to 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years. There was no history of illicit-drug use. The patient lived with his wife, had two grown children, and was employed as a mechanic. His father had died from a myocardial infarction at 56 years of age, and his mother had died from colon cancer at 76 years of age. On examination, the temperature was 36.2°C, the heart rate 68 beats per minute, the blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg and symmetric in both arms, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He appeared to be comfortable. He had flushed skin and superficial abrasions on the left side of the forehead. The jugular venous pressure was 5 cm of water, and the carotid pulses were 2+ without bruits. A sternotomy incision was well approximated. Cardiac examination revealed a normal apical impulse and a normal rhythm, without murmur or rub. Auscultation of the lung revealed a prolonged expiratory phase, without wheezes or rales. Mild varicosities were present in the lower legs, without edema. Scars from the venectomy, knee replacement, and harvest of the left radial artery were all well healed. The stool was guaiac-negative. The remainder of the examination, including a comprehensive neurologic evaluation, was normal. Blood levels of thyrotropin, glycated hemoglobin, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, globulin, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase were normal, as were the white-cell differential count, prothrombin time, and partial-thromboplastin time. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, borderline first-degree atrioventricular block, left atrial abnormality, and anterolateral J-point elevation but no ST-segment changes (Fig. 1A). Aspirin and intravenous heparin were administered, and the patient was admitted to the cardiology service. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Nandini M. Meyersohn: A portable chest radio-graph showed clear lungs. There was borderline enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch. The presence of mediastinal clips and sternotomy wires was consistent with the history of CABG. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed mild, diffuse cerebral paren-chymal volume loss. There was prominence of the cerebrospinal fluid spaces, including the ventricles, sulci, and cisterns. There was no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, territorial infarction, or intracranial mass lesion. Dr. David M. Dudzinski: A transthoracic echo-cardiogram (TTE) was notable for normal left ventricular ejection fraction and cavity size, with subtle hypokinesis of the inferior wall and mild hypertrophy in the left ventricle. There was no evidence of pericardial effusion, obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract, obvious aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, or right ventricular dysfunction. There was sclerosis of the noncoronary leaflet of the aortic valve and the posterior mitral annulus but no evidence of clinically significant valvular disease. There appeared to be two masses with heterogeneous echotex-ture, measuring up to 3.8 cm in diameter, each with an echo-bright (bright white) circumference. The masses were located at the right atrioventricu-lar groove and were compressing the tricuspid annulus at the juncture of the right atrium and the right ventricle, resulting in turbulent trans-tricuspid flow on color Doppler imaging (Fig. 1B through 1F; and Videos 1, 2, and 3, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Additional diagnostic tests were performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2008,25,nejm-case-2008-25,A 43-Year-Old Man with Fatigue and Lesions in the Pituitary and Cerebellum,"Dr. Flavia V. Castelino (Rheumatology, Allergy, and Immunology): A 43-year-old man was seen in the neuro-oncology clinic of this hospital because of fatigue and lesions in the pituitary and cerebellum detected on radiography. He had been well until approximately 9 years earlier, when thirst, insomnia, fatigue, and arthralgias developed. On evaluation at another facility, a diagnosis of diabetes insipidus was made, and desmopressin was prescribed. The symptoms resolved; however, during the next several years, he and his wife were unable to conceive a second child. Approximately 3 years earlier, insomnia, fatigue, and joint pain recurred, associated with cold intolerance. Evaluation disclosed no evidence of sleep apnea. The results of laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed a suprasellar mass with nodular enhancement involving the upper pituitary stalk and hypothalamus and an enhancing nodule in the left cerebellar hemisphere. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed sclerotic foci in the right humeral head, several thoracic vertebral bodies, and the iliac wings, with fullness of the renal collecting systems. The results of CT were otherwise normal. Ferrous sulfate, levothyroxine, and testosterone transdermal gel were prescribed, and the symptoms abated. Two years before this evaluation, the patient was evaluated at a local hospital because of a syncopal episode; the physical examination was normal, and there was no orthostatic hypotension. CT of the head, performed without contrast material, revealed mucosal thickening in the right frontal and ethmoid sinuses and sclerotic areas within the calvaria; no abnormalities were seen in the brain. MRI of the brain showed a suprasellar lesion, approximately 4 mm by 6 mm by 9 mm, involving the upper pituitary stalk and hypothalamus; a lesion in the deep cerebellar white matter, 1.2 cm in diameter; and mild mucosal thickening of the right maxillary sinus and anterior ethmoid sinuses. On follow-up evaluation by a neurologist, an electroencephalogram and ophthalmologic examination showed no abnormalities. CT of the chest and upper abdomen, performed after the administration of contrast material, reportedly showed slight prominence of both kidneys, with bilateral perinephric stranding, and no lymphadenopathy. A small amount of fluid was noted around the aorta in the retroperitoneum and thorax, and sclerotic foci were seen in multiple vertebrae. Ultrasonography of the kidneys showed that the right and left kidneys were 12.1 cm and 10.9 cm in length, respectively, with bilateral grade 2 hydronephrosis; no renal masses, cysts, or stones were seen. CT of the pelvis revealed slight edema surrounding both kidneys and possible stones (<3 mm in diameter) in the distal left ureter. Lumbar puncture and results of an examination of the cerebrospinal fluid were normal; no oligoclonal bands were seen, and the angiotensin-converting enzyme level was normal. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Prednisone (80 mg per day) was administered for treatment of suspected sarcoidosis. One month after the start of prednisone therapy, another MRI scan of the brain, obtained after the administration of gadolinium, reportedly revealed that the cerebellar and neurohypophyseal lesions had decreased slightly in size as compared with the lesions seen on the earlier MRI study. Retrograde pyelography and cystoscopy showed diffuse enlargement of the calyces, a normal infundibulum, and no evidence of stones or obstruction. The patient felt better, and the fatigue, joint pain, and chills resolved. The prednisone dose was gradually tapered, but the symptoms returned when the dose was reduced to less than 40 mg per day. MRI scans of the head, obtained 18 months and 12 months before the current evaluation, showed no changes. Weight gain, acne, and hypertension (138/104 mm Hg) developed. The prednisone dose was tapered to 10 mg per day. One year before the current evaluation, the patient was seen by a neuro-oncologist at this hospital. He reported fatigue, anxiety, difficulty sleeping, weakness in the proximal thighs, difficulty with balance, and cold intolerance. He did not have postural light-headedness, headache, rashes, penile sores, joint effusions, urethritis, diarrhea, or visual symptoms; erectile function was normal. He lived with his wife and child, and he worked in an office. He did not smoke and rarely drank alcohol. His father had diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease, his mother had undergone a thyroidec-tomy for thyroid disease, an uncle had died of a brain tumor, and his daughter had Tourette’s syndrome; his three brothers were healthy. Medications included prednisone (10 mg daily), desmo-pressin, atenolol, levothyroxine, and topical testosterone. On examination, his blood pressure was 132/80 mm Hg, and his pulse 80 beats per minute; his respirations were 16 per minute. Mental status was normal. Visual fields were full to confrontation; acuity was 20/30 bilaterally, and there were no acromegalic or cushingoid features. The head was tilted to the right, and the left pupil was minimally enlarged (1 mm) as compared with the right, with very subtle ptosis of the left lid. His face was otherwise symmetric, with normal eye sensation and motor function, eye movements, and visual fields; the optic disks were also normal. Strength in the arms and legs was normal. Rapid alternating movements of the arm and leg on the right appeared to be slower than on the left, and the patient could not stand on his right foot. The reflexes were symmetric and 2+, with bilateral flexor plantar responses. The remainder of the examination was normal. Testing for antibodies to SSA (Ro), SSB (La), Smith, and RNP was negative; other results are shown in Table 1. Ophthal-mologic examination showed clean chambers, full visual fields, and normal results on slit-lamp microscopy. Three weeks later, prednisone was discontinued; however, fatigue and cold intolerance worsened, and joint pains recurred. Treatment with hydrocortisone was begun at a dose of 20 mg twice daily. Eight months before the current evaluation, an MRI scan obtained after the administration of gadolinium revealed an expansile enhancing process involving the infundibular recess of the third ventricle and pituitary stalk; a mildly enhancing rounded lesion, 1.7 cm in diameter, in the medial left cerebellum; and nonenhancing sclerotic foci in the left frontal and parietal bones. A lumbar puncture was performed; analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid showed no increase in leukocytes and normal levels of protein, glucose, and acetylcholinesterase. Cytologic analysis showed no malignant tumor cells; flow cytometry showed no evidence of a monoclonal B-cell population or an unusual T-cell population. Other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Five months before the current evaluation, an MRI scan of the brain was unchanged. Trans-sphenoidal biopsy of the pituitary gland was performed at this hospital. Pathological examination of the specimen revealed a normal anterior pituitary gland with no evidence of granulomas or inflammation; immunostaining for pituitary hormones showed a mixed population of cells. The patient declined craniotomy, which would have been necessary to obtain another biopsy specimen. Fatigue, somnolence, and difficulty with coordination and balance worsened. Three months before the current evaluation, repeated MRI of the brain showed no changes. One month later, a bone densitometry study showed osteoporosis of the lumbar spine and slightly low bone density at the femoral neck. Results of laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. The dose of hydrocortisone was increased to 40 mg per day, and treatment with alendronate (70 mg weekly) and calcium carbonate (600 mg daily) was begun. The patient’s fatigue diminished, and the hydrocortisone dose was tapered to 30 mg per day. For follow-up examination, he returned to the neuro-oncology clinic, where he saw a second neuro-oncologist. The patient reported insomnia, fatigue, occasional cough, depressed mood, joint and muscle pains, slurred speech, and difficulty with balance and coordination, without vertigo, light-headed-ness, falls, or dropping of objects. His wife reported that during the previous 2 years his speech had become slower and more difficult to understand. Medications included calcium carbonate, desmopressin, ferrous sulfate, alendronate, hy-drocortisone, and levothyroxine. On examination, the weight was 88.6 kg, the blood pressure 148/82 mm Hg, the pulse 92 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the temperature 36.3°C. His speech was dysarthric, and there was left-sided dysmetria on finger– nose–finger testing. Tandem gait was slightly unsteady. The remainder of the examination was normal. The results of coagulation tests were normal, as were measurements of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, bilirubin, total protein, albumin, and globulin and tests of renal and liver function; other test results are shown in Table 1. Another MRI scan of the brain revealed slight enlargement of the left cerebellar lesion (maximal diameter, 1.8 cm) and was otherwise unchanged. Testing for serum antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus, Borrelia burgdorferi, and toxoplasma (IgG and IgM) were negative. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed increased soft tissue extending from the origin of the left subclavian artery through the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta (thickness, approximately 5 to 10 mm; density, 75 Hounsfield units) and surrounding the kidneys (thickness, approximately 5 mm), with mild bilateral hydronephrosis and mild thickening of the adrenals. Sclerotic foci were seen in the right humeral head, several vertebral bodies, and the iliac wings. There were no masses, lung nodules, or lymphadenopathy. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2008,33,nejm-case-2008-33,A 63-Year-Old Woman with Dyspnea on Exertion,"Dr. Andrew Tinsley (Medicine): A 63-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of dyspnea on exertion. The patient had been in her usual state of health until approximately 3 weeks before admission, when dyspnea developed. Approximately 1 week later, she began to have tightness in the chest on exertion, as well as burning pain in the left sub-scapular region that radiated down the left arm and was relieved by massage therapy, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen. The dyspnea gradually increased in severity, until she became short of breath while walking up one flight of stairs or moving a lawn chair a few feet. She had a mild dry cough but no fever, chills, hemoptysis, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, night sweats, weight loss, anorexia, joint pain, or rashes. On the afternoon before admission, the patient went to the emergency department of another hospital because of progressive dyspnea. On examination, she appeared comfortable. She rated the subscapular pain as 3 on a scale of 0 to 10, in which 10 is the most severe. The blood pressure was 104/72 mm Hg, the pulse 105 beats per minute, the temperature 36.4°C, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while the patient was breathing ambient air. There were rales in both lungs, extending halfway up from the bases. The remainder of the examination was normal. An analysis of arterial blood while the patient was breathing ambient air revealed a pH of 7.40, a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 38 mm Hg (reference range, 35 to 45), a partial pressure of oxygen of 69 mm Hg (reference range, 75 to 100), and a serum total carbon dioxide content of 22.5 mmol per liter (reference range, 20 to 26). Other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia but was otherwise normal. A chest radiograph revealed mild, diffuse air-space disease in both lungs and no pleural effusions; the heart was normal in size. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed multiple patchy infiltrates peripherally in both lung bases. The central airways were clear; the pulmonary artery was 2.2 cm in diameter, and there was no evidence of pulmonary embolus or lymphadenopathy. She was transferred to this hospital. The patient had had ulcerative colitis for more than 10 years, with recurrent episodes of cramps, diarrhea, tenesmus, urgency of defecation, and mucus. She had been treated intermittently with balsalazide, hydrocortisone enemas, azathioprine, and tapering courses of oral prednisone. Nine months earlier, persistent bloody diarrhea developed that did not respond to prednisone; 6 months before admission, prednisone was discontinued. A skin test for tuberculosis was negative; a 90-day course of aza-thioprine and monthly infusions of infliximab were begun. The most recent dose of infliximab had been administered 15 days before admission. Regular screening colonoscopies showed pancoli-tis with no evidence of dysplasia. There was a history of osteoporosis, sinusitis, and bronchitis. At the time of the onset of symptoms, she lived with her husband in the southern United States and had been exposed to smoke from fires in the area. During the preceding 6 months, she had traveled to the southwestern United States, and had been in contact with a person who was taking antibiotics for bronchiectasis. Ten days before admission, in late spring, she had traveled by car and boat to an island off the coast of Massachusetts, arriving 6 days before admission. She drank less than one glass of wine daily, had stopped smoking cigarettes 30 years earlier, and owned a dog. There was no exposure to tuberculosis or to birds, and she did not recall recent insect or tick bites. Other medications included balsalazide disodi-um, ibandronate sodium, and conjugated estrogen. She was not allergic to any medications. On examination, the blood pressure was 130/74 mm Hg, the pulse 88 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was breathing 2 liters of supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula. Crackles were heard at the bases and halfway up the lungs. There was no tenderness to palpation of the left scapula or arm. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. In the emergency department, furosemide was administered intravenously. A chest radiograph revealed opacities in both lower lobes, which were thought to represent pneumonia. During the next 5 hours, the blood pressure decreased to 86/54 mm Hg. Intravenous fluids and levofloxacin were administered, and the blood pressure rose to 101/52 mm Hg. A pulmonary consultant noted mild wheezes in the upper lobes of both lungs on inspiration, rhonchi in both lower lobes, and decreased tym-pany on percussion at the base of the right lung. There was no egophony. Jugular venous pulsations were observed at 6 cm while the patient was elevated at a 30-degree angle. The remainder of the examination was normal. Specimens of blood were sent for culture. The patient was admitted to a negative-pressure room in the hospital. Levofloxacin was discontin-ued because of nausea; supplementary oxygen, estrogen, and balsalazide were continued; and one dose each of ondansetron, azithromycin, and cef-triaxone were administered. Analyses of specimens obtained from nasal mucosa were negative for antigens of adenovirus; influenza A and B; parain-fluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3; and respiratory syncy-tial virus, and a urine specimen was negative for Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 antigen. A tuberculin skin test was performed. The next day, CT of the chest, performed after the administration of contrast material, revealed bilateral peripheral ground-glass opacities most concentrated at the lung bases. Indirect immuno-fluorescence testing of the serum for antineutro-phil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) showed a nuclear pattern of staining, which was interpreted as not characteristic of an ANCA-associated vas-culitis. The next day, after 48 hours, the tuberculin skin test was negative. During the first 3 hospital days, attempts to produce sputum for analysis were not successful. On the fourth hospital day, bronchoscopy was performed. The airways appeared normal; cyto-logic examination of bronchoalveolar-lavage specimens of the right lower lobe revealed bronchial columnar cells, pulmonary macrophages, and evidence of chronic inflammation, with no malignant cells. The white-cell count of the lavage fluid was 280 cells per cubic millimeter, with 53% lymphocytes, 1% neutrophils, 9% monocytes, 15% eosinophils, 1% basophils, and 21% nonhematic cells. No organisms were seen. Test results for Myco-plasma pneumoniae nucleic acid, pneumocystis, and antigens of adenovirus, influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3 were negative. Evaluation of hematopoietic cell-surface markers by flow cytom-etry revealed 66% lymphocytes, with no evidence of monoclonal B-cell or unusual T-cell populations. Fluid from the bronchoalveolar lavage was cultured. Dyspnea on exertion persisted. When supplemental oxygen was transiently discontinued, oxygen saturation decreased to between 85% and 90%. On the seventh hospital day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2011,29,nejm-case-2011-29,A 66-Year-Old Woman with Cardiac and Renal Failure,"Dr. Jason E. Faris (Medicine): A 66-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of cardiac and renal failure. The patient had been well until approximately 6 months earlier, when dyspnea on exertion and leg edema developed. A diagnosis of congestive heart failure was made at another facility. Two months before this evaluation, dyspnea worsened. The patient was admitted to the other hospital. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed T-wave inversions in leads I and aVL. The serum level of urea nitrogen was 38 mg per deciliter (13.6 mmol per liter), and the level of creatinine was 1.9 mg per deciliter (168 µmol per liter); the estimated glomerular filtration rate was 27 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area. Results of a complete blood count and of tests of coagulation were normal, as were serum levels of sodium, carbon dioxide, glucose, total bilirubin, aminotransferases, and amylase. A chest radiograph was reportedly normal; computed tomography (CT) of the chest after the administration of contrast material reportedly revealed findings that were consistent with pulmonary edema. Noninvasive testing for venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli was negative. Urinalysis at that time reportedly revealed protein (30 to 100 mg per deciliter), and a culture grew group B streptococci. Ultrasonography of the kidneys was normal. Diuretic agents were administered, and the patient was discharged. Dyspnea on exertion persisted and gradually worsened. Five days before admission, the patient came to the emergency department at this hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 143/80 mm Hg, the pulse 60 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. There was mild pitting edema in the legs, and the remainder of the examination was normal. The complete blood count and levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal; other laboratory results are shown in Table 1. An ECG showed sinus rhythm at 62 beats per minute, with low-voltage QRS complexes, T-wave abnormalities in precordial leads V5 and V6, and evidence of possible left atrial enlargement. A chest radiograph was normal. The patient was referred to the cardiac and renal clinics. During the next 5 days, a cough productive of yellow sputum devel-oped, with rhinorrhea, worsening orthopnea, and dyspnea on exertion, and the patient was able to walk only short distances before resting. She returned to the emergency department. The patient reported no chest pain or pressure and no nausea, sore throat, rashes, myalgias, he-moptysis, sinusitis, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fevers, chills, or dysuria. She had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis, coronary artery disease, and a history of myocardial infarction several years earlier. She was born in Europe, had immigrated to the United States 40 years earlier, lived with her husband, and was retired. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Medications included furosemide, ezetimibe, aten-olol, pravastatin, valsartan, and acetylsalicylic acid. Her father had had a myocardial infarction at 76 years of age, her mother had had a stroke at 86 years of age, and her brother had had a stroke at 45 years of age. On examination, the temperature was 38.3°C, the blood pressure 164/94 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The jugular veins were distended 11 cm above the right atrium; there were decreased lung sounds with expiratory wheezes bilaterally and crackles at the left base. A grade 2/6 systolic murmur was heard at the left upper sternal border and apex, radiating to the axilla; there was 1+ pitting edema of the legs, and the remainder of the examination was normal. An ECG showed low-voltage, nonspecific T-wave abnormalities and findings suggestive of left atrial enlargement. A chest radiograph was normal. The complete blood count and differential count were normal, as were antistreptolysin O and anti–DNase B titers and measurements of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, total protein, albumin, globulin, total and direct bilirubin, aminotransferases, complement (C3 and C4), iron, iron-binding capacity, and fer-ritin; tests for hepatitis B and C viruses were negative. Screening for toxins and serologic testing for the human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, and cryoglobulins were negative; a test for antinuclear antibodies was positive at 1:40 and 1:160 dilutions, in a speckled pattern; antibodies to double-stranded DNA, Ro, La, Sm, RNP, Scl-70, and histone were negative. Urinalysis showed clear, yellow urine, with a specific gravity of 1.012, pH 6.5, 2+ occult blood, 3+ albumin, 20 to 50 red cells, a few squamous cells per high-power field, and 10 to 20 hyaline casts per low-power field. Cultures of the sputum grew normal respiratory flora; the urine grew moderate mixed flora. Testing for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus antigens was negative. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Furosemide and levofloxacin were administered, and the patient was admitted to this hospital. The next day, the temperature was normal and bibasilar pulmonary crackles persisted. CT of the chest revealed atelectasis in the lingula, patchy ground-glass opacities in the right upper lobe, and diffuse bronchial-wall and interlobular septal thickening, features that are consistent with pulmonary edema or atypical pneumonia. The pulmonary artery was mildly enlarged, and multiple subcentimeter lymph nodes in the media-stinum and diffuse osteopenia were present. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 56% with biventricular hypertrophy, left atrial dilatation (55 mm in the greatest dimension), elevated left atrial pressure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 56%, and an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 49 mm Hg. On the third day, pulmonary-function tests revealed a forced vital capacity of 1.77 liters (72% of the predicted value), and the forced expiratory volume in 1 second was 1.11 liters (57% of the predicted value). Renal ultrasonography was normal. Test results are shown in Table 1. A radiographic skeletal survey on the sixth day revealed lytic lesions within both humeri and the skull. A diagnostic procedure was performed, and management decisions were made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,04,nejm-case-2010-04,"A 53-Year-Old Man with Arthralgias, Oral Ulcers, Vision Loss, and Vocal-Cord Paralysis","Dr. Arezou Khosroshahi (Rheumatology): A 53-year-old man was seen in the rheuma-tology clinic of this hospital because of arthralgias, oral ulcers, vision loss, and vocal-cord paralysis. The patient had been well until 19 months before presentation, when he awoke with severe joint pain. On examination by his internist 1 month later, there was incomplete fist closure and decreased extension of the right elbow, without joint deformities or synovial swelling. Serum levels of electrolytes, bilirubin, calcium, thyrotropin, creatine kinase, C-reactive protein, and uric acid; the erythrocyte sedimentation rate; and tests of renal and liver function were normal. Testing for serum antinuclear cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) was negative. Ten days later, a rheuma-tologist detected a left-knee effusion. Synovial-fluid analysis revealed a white-cell count of 13,000 per high-power field (85% neutrophils), no crystals, and sterile cultures. Radiographs of the hands, wrists, knees, sacroiliac joints, and chest were normal. Assays for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), rheumatoid factor, and antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptides were negative. Treatment with methylpredniso-lone, methotrexate, and folic acid were begun. The joint symptoms improved. During the following months, increased fatigue developed whenever methylpred-nisolone was tapered below 10 mg per day. Fourteen months before this evaluation, treatment with etanercept was begun. Two months later, joint swelling, myalgias, low-grade fevers, and tinnitus developed. During the next 2 months, increasing muscle pain and tingling developed. Tests for ANCA were negative; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Etanercept was discontinued. Eight months before this evaluation, Bence Jones proteinuria was detected (Table 1). Serum levels of protein and complement were normal, and protein electrophoresis with immunofixation showed no M component. A radiographic skeletal survey and computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed neither lesions (sclerotic or lytic) nor other evidence of a malignant condition. Two weeks later, the white-cell count was 2400 per cubic millimeter, with an absolute neutropenia and lymphopenia. Methotrexate was discontinued. Pathological examination of a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy specimen showed increased iron stores and 5% plasma cells in the marrow but was otherwise normal. Methylpred-nisolone was tapered to 4 mg per day. Four months before this evaluation, daily low-grade fevers developed in the evenings, with temperatures to 38.1°C, associated with malaise, myalgias, arthralgias (most painful in the morning on awakening and after 4 p.m.), sore throat, large ulcers on the tongue accompanied by tongue swelling, and ophthalmic migraines (wavy lines in the patient’s vision that were not associated with headaches). The patient awoke frequently at night because of discomfort in his shoulder, hip, elbow, or fingers. Eszopiclone was prescribed, without improvement. On two occasions, methylprednisolone (48 mg in a single dose) was administered for the ophthalmic migraines, with resolution of the ocular symptoms for 1 week on each occasion. Daily fevers persisted. Three months before this evaluation, tinnitus worsened and hearing decreased. Auditory testing revealed high-frequency hearing loss in the right ear, which was attributed to methotrexate. Four days later, left-sided chest pain developed. The patient went to the emergency department of another hospital, where radiologic studies revealed a left pleural effusion with atelectasis and a thickened pericardium. Methylprednisolone (125 mg) was administered intravenously, followed by 40 mg orally, which was tapered to discontinuation over a period of 9 days. The chest pain resolved. Methotrexate was restarted. The following day, severe mouth ulcers and dysphagia developed. Treatment with acyclovir was begun, methylpred-nisolone was restarted, and symptoms improved within 24 hours. Later that week, a neuro-ophthalmologist prescribed propranolol (20 mg twice daily) for ophthalmic migraine. The same day, the patient saw an otolaryngologist for severe throat pain and odynophagia associated with swallowing. On examination, there was an epiglottic ulcer; valacy-clovir was administered, and methylprednisolone was tapered to 1 mg per day. Four days later, the patient saw rheumatologic and infectious-disease consultants because of persistent tongue ulcers and daily fevers. Cytomegalovirus cultures were negative. The next evening, loss of vision occurred suddenly in the left eye, spreading in diagonal patches from the nasal to the temporal region, with total blindness in the left eye for approximately 30 minutes, then partial recovery in the inferior visual field. The patient was admitted to another hospital, where the results of fundu-scopic examination were interpreted as consistent with occlusion of the central retinal artery. Testing for ANCA was negative; other laboratory results are shown in Table 1. Magnetic resonance angiography of the brain and neck was normal. Methylprednisolone was stopped, and treatment with prednisone (60 mg per day) and a daily baby aspirin was begun. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiograms were normal. Examination of a biopsy of the right temporal artery was interpreted as negative for giant-cell arteritis by one pathologist but as “healed arteritis” by another. The patient’s musculoskel-etal symptoms and headaches improved, but the visual-field loss remained. Nine days after the central retinal artery occlusion and 2 months before this evaluation, hoarseness developed abruptly. Otolaryngologic examination disclosed right vocal-cord paralysis. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck revealed swelling of the right vocal cord. Three weeks later, the patient’s dentist noted ulcers on the tongue up to 1 cm in diameter and 0.5 cm deep. Methotrexate and leucovorin were discontinued, and amoxicillin was begun. Six days later, oral fluconazole and parenteral triamcinolone (80 mg into the tongue) were administered. During the next 9 days, odynophagia and additional painful tongue lesions developed. The patient resumed treatment with acyclovir. Fourteen days before this evaluation, administration of acyclovir was stopped and famciclovir started. Eight days before this evaluation, a cardiac stress test was performed but was stopped after 12 minutes because of sudden throbbing bitem-poral headache. On examination, the temporal arteries were not tender. The headache resolved gradually within 30 minutes, without medication. On evaluation in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital, the patient reported mild temporo-mandibular joint pain and recurrent episodic diplopia; the diplopia had been attributed to an acquired Brown syndrome (transient paralysis or tendinopathy of the superior oblique muscle). He had had ulcerative proctitis decades earlier. The patient was an ophthalmologist. He was married and had two children, who were well. There was no family history of cancer or autoimmune diseases. He was allergic to honeybee venom. Medications included prednisone (20 mg in the morning and 15 in the evening), diclofenac, propranolol, acetylsalicylic acid (81 mg), viscous lidocaine mouthwash, sucralfate suspension for mouth ulcers, folic acid, zinc, a multivitamin, and calcium with vitamin D. On examination, the patient appeared well, but his voice was faint. The vital signs were normal. There was a well-healed scar from a temporal-artery biopsy on the right, and there were normal temporal-artery pulsations bilaterally. There were large, bilateral noninflamed ulcers of the tongue and small erosions on the top of the tongue posteriorly (Fig. 1). The remainder of the examination was normal. Serum levels of electrolytes, calcium, total protein, albumin, globulin, total bilirubin, complement, and serum free light chains and tests of coagulation and renal and liver function were normal. Testing for antibodies to the Sm and U1-RNP antigens, β2-glycoprotein I, cyclic citrullinated peptide, rheumatoid factor, anticardiolipin antibodies, and lupus anticoagulant was negative. Serum immunoelectrophoresis was normal. Other results are shown in Table 1. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,39,nejm-case-2012-39,"A 55-Year-Old Man with Alcoholism, Recurrent Seizures, and Agitation","Dr. Benjamin C. Silverman (Psychiatry): A 55-year-old man with a history of alcoholism was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) at this hospital because of seizures and agitation. One day before admission, the patient discontinued his daily consumption of alcohol in preparation for a family event. On the day of admission, generalized tonic–clonic movements developed and resolved spontaneously after 1 minute. During the episode, he was caught while falling; he had no head trauma. On examination by emergency medical services personnel, he was oriented to person, place, and time. The blood pressure was 160/110 mm Hg, the pulse 88 beats per minute and regular, and the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. The patient had dilated pupils, slurred speech, and diaphoresis. There was no evidence of incontinence. Oxygen was administered through a nonrebreather face mask at a rate of 15 liters per minute. A capillary glucose level was 135 mg per deciliter. He was brought to the emergency department at this hospital. The patient reportedly drank one case of beer daily. Nine years earlier, he had had a seizure related to alcohol withdrawal. Approximately 3.5 years earlier, he was found on the street intoxicated, with a fractured mandible; he was admitted to another hospital, and delirium and agitation associated with alcohol withdrawal developed during admission. He had asthma, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and coronary artery disease; in the past, he had undergone coronary-artery bypass grafting and aortic-valve replacement with a porcine valve and had had Klebsiella pneumoniae infection. A skin test was positive for tuberculosis 4 years earlier. The patient had taken cardiac and antihypertensive medications in the past; current medications were unknown. He had no known allergies. He lived with his girlfriend and had previously been homeless. He had been smoking cigarettes for many years; it was not known whether there was a history of illicit drug use. His father had died of heart disease, and there was a family history of diabetes mellitus. On examination, the patient was confused and afebrile. The blood pressure was 140/84 mm Hg, the pulse 75 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing oxygen through a nonrebreather face mask. The pupils were 2 mm in diameter and reactive; the remainder of the examination was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the head without the administration of contrast material revealed nonspecific peri-ventricular hypodensities and prominent ventricles and sulci, features that were consistent with mild generalized volume loss; there was no evidence of acute infarction or hemorrhage. A chest radiograph showed clear lungs, with cardiac enlargement and postoperative changes that were stable as compared with 4 years previously. Approximately 4.5 hours after the patient’s arrival, generalized tonic–clonic movements recurred, along with urinary incontinence. Lor-azepam was administered intravenously, with resolution of seizure activity. The partial-throm-boplastin time, blood levels of glucose and lipase, and results of renal-function tests were normal, and screening of the blood for toxins was negative; other results of laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. During the next 2 hours, increasing agitation and confusion occurred, with incoherent speech, diaphoresis, and combative behavior that required the use of restraints. Lorazepam, halo-peridol, magnesium sulfate, and intravenous fluids were administered, which led to eventual sedation and decreased agitation; the trachea was intubated for airway protection, propofol was administered, and a urinary catheter was placed. An electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation, with a ventricular rate of 135 beats per minute and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes. Urinalysis revealed trace occult blood, 0 to 2 red cells per high-power field, and mucin; screening of the urine (after the administration of lorazepam) revealed cannabinoids and benzodiazepines. The patient was admitted to the medical ICU. On admission, the temperature was 37.4°C, the blood pressure 136/85 mm Hg, the mean arterial pressure 100 mm Hg, and the pulse 110 beats per minute. The patient was sedated and intubated. There were no other focal abnormalities on examination. During the next 2 days, levels of cardiac enzymes and isoenzymes were normal and testing for antibodies against heparin–platelet fac-tor 4 complexes was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Lorazepam and propofol were continued, and diazepam, folate, thiamine, aspirin, atenolol, dalteparin, multivitamins, magnesium sulfate, potassium phosphate, and normal saline were administered. As the dose of propofol was gradually decreased, agitation increased and the respiratory rate rose to 40 breaths per minute; the dose of propofol was increased, with improvement. On the third day, management decisions were made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,32,nejm-case-2019-32,A 70-Year-Old Woman with Rapidly Progressive Ataxia,"Dr. Kun-Wei Song (Neurology): A 70-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of rapidly progressive ataxia. The patient had been in her usual state of good health until 3 months before this admission, when fatigue and general unsteadiness developed. Two months before admission, episodes of worsening unsteadiness occurred. The patient was no longer able to walk in a straight line or to remain stable in yoga poses that had previously been easy for her. No associated falls, vertigo, loss of consciousness, ear pain, hearing loss, tinnitus, or headache were reported. She was evaluated by her primary care physician, who was affiliated with another hospital, and a neuro-logic examination was reportedly normal. The white-cell count, hematocrit, hemoglobin level, and blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and thyrotropin were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests; a test for Lyme disease was negative. The patient was referred to an otolaryngologist. Seven weeks before admission, the patient was evaluated by an otolaryngologist at the other hospital. The examination revealed auditory canals and tympanic membranes that were normal in appearance; an audiogram showed normal hearing. The patient was told that her symptoms were not caused by a vestibular process, and she was referred to a neurologist. Four weeks before admission, progressive gait imbalance developed. The patient was able to walk in her home without falling by leaning on walls and surfaces for support, but she needed a cane or the assistance of her husband to walk outside. She was evaluated in a neurology clinic at the other hospital. She reported a sensation of impaired balance that persisted when she was seated in a chair and diminished, but did not resolve, when she was in the supine position. She also noted a loss of coordination in her hands; her handwriting had progressively become larger, and she had difficulty eating soup. She reported new blurry vision, insomnia, and a constant mild headache. On examination, the patient was awake, alert, and oriented. Her speech was fluent and clear. A slightly wide-based, unsteady gait was noted, with jerking movements of the trunk, hips, and legs. She was unable to walk with a tandem gait or on her toes or heels. The Rom-berg sign was present, and a subtle postural tremor in both hands was noted. The remainder of her neurologic examination was normal. Antinuclear antibodies were present at a titer of 1:40 with a speckled pattern. Blood levels of fo-late, thiamine, cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12), vitamin E, vitamin B6, and C-reactive protein were normal, as was the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Results of serum protein electrophoresis were also normal. A screening test for syphilis was negative. Dr. Bradley R. Buchbinder: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material. T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging showed minimal, confluent periventricular signal hyperinten-sity and scattered focal subcortical signal hyper-intensity in both cerebral hemispheres, with mild ventricular prominence (Fig. 1). Dr. Song: The patient was advised to undergo physical therapy for balance training. Two weeks before admission, sudden and involuntary movements of the arms developed that were associated with loss of positional awareness. The patient sought a second opinion from an otolaryngolo-gist at this hospital, who referred her to the emergency department; she was admitted to the neurology service for further evaluation. She reported ongoing involuntary movements of the arms and loss of positional awareness. Her husband reported that she would often place her coffee cup on a table with excessive force or drop it several inches above the surface. She now re-quired a walker and had had two falls resulting from loss of balance. She also noted new horizontal double vision, decreased appetite, weight loss of approximately 2 to 3 kg in the past month, and a cough. The patient was right-handed. She had a history of hyperlipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, and asthma and a long history of mild hearing loss. Medications included simvastatin, vaginal estrogen, and, as needed, lorazepam for insomnia. She had no known medication allergies. The patient was a retired educator and lived with her husband in New England. She had traveled extensively in the eastern United States and in Western Europe. She had previously participated in daily aerobics, yoga, and dance classes. She had consumed one glass of wine nightly but stopped when her symptoms began. She did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. Her mother had hypertension, and her father had died from lung cancer; her brother and two adult children were healthy. There was no family history of ataxia, dementia, autoimmune disease, or neurodegenerative disease. On examination, the patient was alert, oriented, and interactive. The temperature was 36.1°C, the pulse 71 beats per minute, the blood pressure 143/94 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The neck was supple, and she did not have thyromegaly or thyroid nodules. The speech was fluent, with no dysarthria. She had marked dysmetria bilaterally on finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin testing; severe dysdiadochokinesia (i.e., an impaired ability to perform rapid alternating movements) was also noted. The gait was wide-based and unsteady, with truncal ataxia. The remainder of the examination was normal, including repetition and naming, strength, deep-tendon and plantar reflexes, and sensory function. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, arsenic, lead, mercury, and cadmium were normal, as were the results of kidney-function testing and urine toxicologic screening. A lumbar puncture was performed, and tests for paraneoplastic antibodies in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were negative. Other laboratory test results and the results of the CSF analysis are shown in Table 1. An MRI of the head was obtained and was interpreted as unchanged from the study obtained 1 month earlier. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed a single sharp wave in the left parietal region but was otherwise normal. Combined positron-emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT) from the skull base to midthigh, performed after the administration of intravenous 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) tracer, revealed no abnormal FDG uptake. A working diagnosis of autoimmune cerebellitis was made, and intrave-nous immune globulin was administered. The patient was discharged home on the sixth hospital day, with a plan to follow up in the ataxia unit of this hospital. Three weeks after discharge, the patient was evaluated in the ataxia unit. Her gait and coordination had worsened; she could no longer ambulate independently with a walker and required one-person assistance. New dysarthria had developed, along with short-term memory loss; she began to forget conversations held earlier in the day. Oculomotor examination revealed occasional square-wave jerks in the primary position (i.e., inappropriate saccades that take the eyes off the target when a person is looking forward, followed by a corrective saccade that brings the eyes back to the target), slowed pursuit movements with frequent saccadic intrusions, hypermetric and hypometric saccades, and mild gaze-evoked nystagmus in the horizontal plane. Her dysar-thria was mild but became worse when she attempted to recite consonants rapidly. On finger-to-nose testing, there was bilateral end-point dysmetria with oscillating movements at the elbows, overshoot during rapid finger movements, and dysdiadochokinesia. On heel-to-shin testing, the patient had jerking movements of the shins in the axis, with occasional superimposed lateral movements that occurred more frequently on the left side than on the right side. Rapid tapping of the heels on the ground was dysrhythmic. The gait was profoundly impaired; it was wide-based and unstable, and there was marked titubation of the trunk. The patient required maximal one-person assistance. She was unable to spontaneously recall a list of five words learned a few minutes earlier, and her recall did not improve even after she was provided a category clue or a list of multiple-choice answers. Her score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment was 15 on a scale of 0 to 30, with a score of less than 25 indicating cognitive impairment and lower scores indicating greater cognitive impairment. The patient was readmitted to the neurology service of this hospital, and a diagnosis was made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2009,32,nejm-case-2009-32,A 27-Year-Old Man with Progressive Dyspnea,"A 27-year-old man was seen in the outpatient pulmonary division of this hospital because of progressive dyspnea and decreased exercise tolerance. Approximately 2 years earlier, the patient noted a slight decrease in his exercise tolerance. He was able to exercise regularly and so did not seek medical attention. Six months before this evaluation, dyspnea on exertion progressively increased, and the next month, an episode of hemoptysis occurred. Wheezing developed, associated with a chronic cough productive of clear-to-green sputum. He saw a physician at another facility. The temperature was normal, the blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg, the pulse 116 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 36 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 76% while the patient was breathing ambient air, increasing to 98% with supplemental oxygen (2 liters) by nasal cannula. The breath sounds were diminished. Skin testing for tuberculosis was reportedly negative. A chest radiograph and computed tomography (CT) of the chest reportedly showed diffuse bronchiectatic changes, especially in the upper lung zones, with increased lung markings bilaterally, features consistent with an interstitial process. Albuterol, delivered by a metered-dose inhaler (90 μg, one to two puffs every 4 to 6 hours as needed), and fluticasone, also delivered by a metered-dose inhaler (110 μg, two puffs twice daily), were prescribed, and arrangements were made to provide supplemental oxygen at home. Approximately 3 months before this evaluation, the patient saw a pulmonary specialist at another facility. On examination, there were rhonchi on auscultation of both lungs and clubbing of the fingers and toes. Oxygen saturation at rest was 91% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Results of laboratory tests, including the serum levels of alpha1-antitrypsin and immunoglobulins, were normal; results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. A sweat chloride test was negative. His medications were continued. During the next 2 months, shortness of breath increased, and the patient was able to walk only 5 to 6 m before requiring 5 to 6 minutes of rest. Three weeks before evaluation at this hospital, he returned to the pulmonary specialist. He reported occasional headaches and weight gain of 4.5 kg during the previous 6 months. On examination, the oxygen saturation was 91% while he was breathing ambient air; with exertion, it decreased to 86%. Physical examination was unchanged. He was referred to the pulmonary clinic of this hospital. He reported no fevers, chills, rashes, chest pain, or joint or gastrointestinal symptoms. He had a history of albinism, easy bruisability, and nearsightedness. He had had mild shortness of breath for many years, and he reported that his mother had been told that he might have cystic fibrosis. There was no history of chest trauma, asthma, seasonal allergies, or eczema. He was allergic to shellfish. He had no known allergies to medications but avoided aspirin because of bleeding problems. Medications included albuterol and flutica-sone, each by a metered-dose inhaler. He was of Puerto Rican ancestry, was born in New England, and lived with a female partner and their child. He had stopped attending school because of his illness and was unemployed. He drank alcohol occasionally and had a 10-pack-year smoking history, but he had stopped smoking approximately 9 months earlier. Many family members had asthma; two siblings had albinism and milder respiratory problems. The patient’s height was 165.1 cm and his weight 69.9 kg. The blood pressure was 105/70 mm Hg, the pulse 104 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 91% while he was breathing ambient air. The skin was pale, and the irises were pigmented. Horizontal nystagmus was present. Breath sounds were decreased bilaterally, with no crackles or wheezes. Percussion of the chest was normal. There was digital clubbing, and the remainder of the examination was normal. The he-matocrit was 54.7% (reference range for men, 41.0 to 53.0), and the erythrocyte count was 6,570,000 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 4,500,000 to 5,900,000). The remainder of the complete blood count; urinalysis; serum levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, aminotransferases, lipids, homocysteine, amylase, thyrotropin, testosterone, parathyroid hormone, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D; and results of tests of coagulation (including prothrombin time, partial-thromboplastin time, and levels of functional protein C and protein S), renal function, and osmolality were normal. Tests for lupus anticoagulant and factor V Leiden mutation were negative. There was evidence of previous infections by herpes simplex virus type 1, toxoplasma, varicella, cytomegalovirus, and Ep-stein–Barr virus and no evidence of syphilis, herpes simplex virus type 2, hepatitis B or C virus, or human immunodeficiency virus infections. An electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with poor R-wave progression and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave findings in leads V1 through V3. Cardiac ultrasonography showed an ejection fraction of 76%, trace tricuspid and pulmonary insufficiency, and an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 56 mm Hg. The main and right pulmonary arteries were dilated, measur-ing 25 mm and 17 mm, respectively. The right ventricle was dilated and mildly hypokinetic, with no hypertrophy. The mitral and aortic valves and the left atrium and ventricle were normal. A chest radiograph revealed coarse reticular nodular opacities bilaterally and decreased lung volumes that were consistent with lung fibrosis and bron-chiectasis, with no evidence of pleural effusions. CT of the chest showed small lung volumes, diffuse ground-glass opacification, bronchiectasis, and architectural distortion in the upper lobes, with diffuse honeycombing predominantly in the subpleural location, features consistent with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. Results of pulmonary-function testing are shown in Table 1. An exercise test, performed while the patient was breathing 8 liters of oxygen, revealed an oxygen saturation of 94% at rest and 77% with exercise and revealed poor exercise tolerance, limited by pulmonary vascular function. The right ventricle was hypokinetic with exercise and had slow diastolic filling at rest; the breathing reserve index, defined as the ratio of minute ventilation at peak exercise to maximal voluntary ventilation, was 0.77, indicative of a secondary pulmonary mechanical limit to exercise. Platelet-aggregation studies showed appreciably impaired platelet function; primary aggregation response to several agonists was present, but full secondary aggregation was absent. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed a moderately echogenic liver texture consistent with fatty infiltration. Three months later, the patient was admitted to this hospital. The temperature was 36.4°C, the blood pressure 116/62 mm Hg, the pulse 77 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, with an oxygen saturation of 98% while the patient was breathing supplemental oxygen (6 liters by nasal cannula). Diffuse crackles, most pronounced in the bases, were heard bilaterally, and there was decreased expansion of the rib cage. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Arterial blood gas analysis, of gases drawn while the patient was breathing 6 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula, revealed a pH of 7.41, a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 44 mm Hg (reference range, 35 to 50), and a partial pressure of oxygen of 205 mm Hg (reference range, 40 to 90, while breathing ambient air). The chest radiograph was unchanged. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2023,31,nejm-case-2023-31,A 79-Year-Old Man with Involuntary Movements and Unresponsiveness,"CME at NEJM.org Dr. Carrie Chui (Neurology): A 79-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of involuntary movements on the left side and transient unresponsiveness. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 9 months before admission, when involuntary movements of the left shoulder and left side of the face developed. The movements were described by the patient as twitching, were not associated with a change in the level of consciousness, and resolved after 1 to 2 minutes. During the next 6 months, the patient had similar episodes approximately once per month, but the episodes increased in duration, lasting 5 to 6 minutes. Three months before admission, the episodes of involuntary movements increased in frequency, and the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. The physical examination was normal. Results of kidney-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of glucose and electrolytes, except for the sodium level, which was 129 mmol per liter (reference range, 135 to 145). There was a history of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and the sodium level was similar to levels obtained during the past 4 years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Fig. 1A), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a focus of enhancement in the right middle frontal gyrus that was thought to be a small vascular anomaly. Electroencephalography (EEG), performed with the patient in awake and drowsy states, revealed rare, brief, focal slowing in the left temporal lobe during drowsiness; no epileptiform abnormalities were present. Two months before admission, the patient was evaluated in the epilepsy clinic affiliated with this hospital. He reported that the episodes of involuntary movements had increased in both frequency and duration, occurring once or twice per day and lasting approximately 10 minutes. Episodes began with tingling and numbness in the left leg that prompted the patient to voluntarily stomp the left foot to relieve the uncomfortable sensation. Then, the patient had involuntary movements that he described as an uncontrollable invisible force moving the left leg and arm, with hyperex-tension of the arm backward and pronation of the wrist. There was associated numbness in the distal portions of the left third, fourth, and fifth fingers and involuntary movement of the left cheek. No prodromal symptoms occurred. The patient had awareness during the episodes, and after the episodes, he felt fatigued but had a normal level of consciousness, without confusion. The examination in the epilepsy clinic was normal. A diagnosis of seizure disorder was considered, and treatment with levetiracetam was started. Three weeks before admission, the patient was again evaluated in the epilepsy clinic. He reported that the episodes of involuntary movements still occurred on a daily basis but had decreased in duration and involved only the left leg, without abnormal movements of the arm or face. Dizziness, headache, and weakness had developed and were attributed to the use of levetiracetam. The patient’s family had recorded a video of one of the episodes of involuntary movements. After reviewing the video, the patient’s neurologist thought that the episodes were less likely to be caused by seizures and more consistent with choreoathetoid movements. Cross-tapering of medications — with the simultaneous administration of levetiracetam in decreasing doses and clobazam in increasing doses — was initiated, and the patient was referred to the movement disorders clinic affiliated with this hospital. On the morning of admission, an episode of involuntary movements of the left leg and left shoulder occurred and persisted for 1 hour. Several hours after the symptoms abated, the patient’s wife found the patient to be unresponsive; he was sitting in a chair. Emergency medical services were called, and when they arrived, the patient was responsive. The fingerstick blood glucose level was 180 mg per deciliter (10.0 mmol per liter) and the blood pressure 110/80 mm Hg. The patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported dysuria and increased urinary frequency. The patient’s daughter noted that he had been more anxious during the past 3 years and occasionally had trouble with memory. Other medical history included Barrett’s esophagus, benign prostatic hypertrophy, chronic hepatitis B virus infection, eczema, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypertension, nonischemic cardiomyopa-thy, and osteoporosis. There was no history of head trauma or extended loss of consciousness. Medications included aspirin, atorvastatin, doxa-zosin, finasteride, omeprazole, metoprolol, sacu-bitril, and valsartan. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was a lifelong nonsmoker and drank alcohol rarely; he did not use illicit drugs. His mother had had gastric cancer, and his sister had had esophageal cancer; there was no family history of seizures. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.8°C, the blood pressure 152/97 mm Hg, the pulse 65 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.7. The blood pressure decreased to 130/63 mm Hg with standing. The patient was alert and interactive. The lower jaw was held to the left, but the nasolabial folds and smile were symmetric with activation. There were nonrhythmic, nonstereotyped, writhing movements of the left arm. Tone was normal, and strength was assessed as 5 out of 5 in the arms and legs. Results of liver-function and kidney-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of glucose and electrolytes, except for the sodium level, which was 125 mmol per liter. The lactate level was 2.1 mmol per liter (19 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [5 to 18 mg per deciliter]). The urinalysis was normal. Intravenous fluids were administered. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Rajiv Gupta: Computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the head and neck (Fig. 1B) revealed extensively calcified plaque with severe stenosis of the distal right common carotid artery (CCA), extending into the proximal right internal carotid artery (ICA), as well as stenosis of the right and left paraclinoid ICAs and the left vertebral artery at its origin. There was no vas-cular abnormality on the CT angiogram that corresponded to the abnormality in the right middle frontal gyrus seen on the previous MRI. Dr. Chui: The patient was admitted to the hospital. On the second hospital day, the sodium level had increased to 130 mmol per liter, and the lactate level was normal. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Gupta: MRI of the head showed no evidence of acute infarction. The focus of enhancement in the right frontal lobe that had been noted previously was not seen on the current MRI. Dr. Chui: Blood levels of thyrotropin, cobala-min, and glycated hemoglobin and results of coagulation tests were normal. Screening tests for Lyme disease, tuberculosis, and syphilis were negative, as were tests for antibodies to cardio-lipin and β2-glycoprotein. A test for antinuclear antibodies was positive, at a titer of 1:160 in a homogeneous pattern. During a physical therapy session, the patient had abnormal movements of the left leg, left arm, and left side of the face. The abnormal movements diminished when the patient used distraction techniques, such as thigh tapping, finger snapping, and walking while holding a glass of water. The transient unresponsiveness that led to the patient’s admission was attributed to a combination of sedation from clobazam and hypovo-lemia. Treatment with clobazam was stopped, and hydration was encouraged. A diagnosis of functional neurologic disorder was considered; outpatient physical therapy with continued use of distraction techniques was recommended. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day. Episodes of involuntary movements continued to occur on a daily basis at home. Two weeks after discharge, when the patient was doing exercises while sitting in a chair and having a conversation with his wife, he suddenly stopped talking. She found him slumped in the chair with his eyes closed, no longer exercising. When she asked him questions, he repeatedly said “yes.” Emergency medical services were called, and when they arrived, the patient was alert, diaphoretic, and nonverbal. He had a facial droop on the left side and a right gaze preference. The fingerstick blood glucose level was 130 mg per deciliter (7.2 mmol per liter) and the blood pressure 120/60 mm Hg. The patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department, the temporal temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 143/63 mm Hg, the pulse 66 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was alert and interactive. There was a facial droop on the left side. There was no effort against gravity in the left arm. The patient was able to lift the left leg off the bed for 1 to 2 seconds. He had a right gaze deviation that could not be overcome and mild dysarthria. The remainder of the examination was normal. A diagnosis of stroke was considered, and emergency CT angiography was performed. Dr. Gupta: CT angiography showed no evidence of acute territorial infarction and no changes in cerebrovascular disease. Dr. Chui: On repeat physical examination performed after CT angiography, the gaze deviation and dysarthria had resolved, and strength was normal. Mild facial paralysis was present. A diagnosis was made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2020,21,nejm-case-2020-21,A 66-Year-Old Homeless Man with Covid-19,"Dr. Denise De Las Nueces: A 66-year-old homeless man who had sought refuge at a local men’s congregate shelter for the past several years was evaluated for cough and rhinorrhea during the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Nine days before the current evaluation, the patient presented to a Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program (BHCHP) clinic at a local homeless shelter for evaluation of dry cough and rhinorrhea that had developed earlier that morning. He reported no fever, chills, sore throat, anosmia, myalgias, headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or fatigue. He had had no known sick contacts or exposure to anyone with a diagnosis of Covid-19. He had received a seasonal influenza vaccination. A review of systems was notable for cough, rhinorrhea, insomnia, and chronic musculoskeletal pain. The patient’s medical history was notable for ischemic stroke 9 years earlier with residual mild ambulatory deficits, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, abdominal aortic aneurysm, hyperthyroidism, and obesity. Medications included aspirin, atorvastatin, insulin glargine, metformin, empagliflozin, dulaglutide, losartan, chlorthalidone, amlodipine, metoprolol, and methimazole, along with trazodone, gabapentin, and acetaminophen as needed. All the patient’s medications were stored at the BHCHP clinic at the shelter, which provided access to a refrigerator dedicated for proper storage of temperature-sensitive medications. He had no known adverse reactions to medications. The patient had immigrated to the United States from the Caribbean more than 30 years earlier. He had a history of alcohol use disorder but had abstained from drinking for several years. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years but had quit 4 years earlier. There was no history of illicit substance use. His family medical history was unknown. On examination, the temperature was 36.8°C, the blood pressure 127/57 mm Hg, the heart rate 71 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 31.6. The patient appeared to be well and in no distress. He was alert and oriented. The oropharynx was clear and moist. The lungs were clear on auscultation. The remainder of the examination was normal. Point-of-care blood testing revealed an elevated postprandial glucose level of 260 mg per deciliter (14.4 mmol per liter; normal range, <180 mg per deciliter [10 mmol per liter]). No additional laboratory testing or imaging was performed. Rest and oral hydration were recommended, along with ibuprofen and over-the-counter cough suppressants as needed for symptom relief. The patient returned to the congregate shelter. Seven days later, in response to a newly recognized cluster of Covid-19 cases at the shelter and with the support of the state public health authority, the BHCHP launched a campaign for universal testing of all guests at the shelter.1 A nasopharyngeal swab was obtained from the patient at a testing tent adjacent to the shelter and was sent to the Massachusetts State Public Health Laboratory to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. At the time that the specimen was obtained, the patient reported no new symptoms. Two days later, the test returned positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The shelter staff were notified of the result, and an alert was placed on the shelter intake database. When the patient presented to the shelter that evening, management decisions were made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,28,nejm-case-2010-28,"A 32-Year-Old Woman, 3 Weeks Post Partum, with Substernal Chest Pain","Dr. Rebecca R. Saff (Medicine): A 32-year-old woman, 3 weeks post partum, was seen in the emergency department of this hospital because of substernal chest pain. The patient had been well until the day of admission when, while she was shopping at 7:25 p.m., pain in the left jaw and substernal area developed suddenly. She drove home and called emergency medical services (EMS). During evaluation by EMS personnel, oxygen was administered; her symptoms resolved after a duration of approximately 20 minutes. She declined further treatment, and the emergency responders departed. Shortly thereafter, the pain recurred, associated with shortness of breath. The patient called EMS again. On repeat evaluation at 8:34 p.m., the patient rated the pain at 5 (on a scale of 0 to 10, where 10 is the most severe pain) and stated that at its onset, the pain rated a score of 7. The blood pressure was 148/74 mm Hg. An electrocardiogram (ECG) reportedly showed a normal sinus rhythm, with a rate from 90 to 100 beats per minute, and ST-segment elevation of up to 4 mm in leads V3 through V6. Oxygen, acetyl-salicylic acid, nitroglycerin, and morphine were administered. The pain resolved while the patient was in the ambulance; a repeat ECG showed ST-segment elevations (1 to 4 mm) in leads V1 through V6; hyperacute T waves in leads V4, V5, and V6; and ST-segment depressions (1 to 1.5 mm) in the inferior leads (Fig. 1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). The patient was brought to the emergency department at this hospital 1 hour 25 minutes after the initial onset of symptoms. The patient did not have diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, pain or swelling in the legs, or back pain. Three weeks earlier, she had had an uncomplicated, spontaneous vaginal delivery at 39 weeks of gestation. During the first trimester of pregnancy, her systolic blood pressures ranged from 120 to 140 mm Hg, and her diastolic blood pressures from 60 to 80 mm Hg; in the second trimester, 118 to 120 mm Hg systolic and 60 to 82 mm Hg diastolic; and in the third trimester, 104 to 130 mm Hg systolic and 60 to 78 mm Hg diastolic. No antihypertensive medications had been given. The placenta weighed 340 g (less than the 5th percentile in size for gestational age); pathological examination revealed an increased amount of perivillous fibrin. Her child was healthy and was breast-feeding. During her first pregnancy, the patient had hypertension, with onset before 20 weeks of gestation, followed by preeclamptic toxemia that was treated with magnesium sulfate. Between pregnancies, her blood pressure was normal and she took no medications. At the 10-day postpartum visit, she felt well and was ambulating; the blood pressure was 120/80 mm Hg. She lived with her husband and her toddler and newborn and was a physician. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her parents had had hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, and a distant cousin had had a stroke at a young age. The patient was taking no medications and had no allergies. On examination, the temperature was 36.2°C, the blood pressure 143/92 mm Hg in the left arm and 137/81 mm Hg in the right arm, the pulse 83 to 92 beats per minute without ectopy, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air and 100% while she was breathing oxygen (2 liters by nasal cannula). The carotid pulses were 2+ bilaterally, without bruits, and the jugular veins were distended at 6 to 7 cm. The remainder of the examination was normal. ECG revealed a sinus rhythm, 89 beats per minute, with normal intervals; possible left atrial enlargement; incomplete right bundle-branch block; and ST-segment elevation of 1 mm in leads V2 and V3 (Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Testing for troponin I was negative. The d-dimer level was 1166 ng per milliliter (reference range, <500), and the amylase level was 134 U per liter (reference range, 3 to 100); other tests, including a complete blood count, measurement of electrolyte and glucose levels, and tests of renal and liver function, were normal. A chest radio-graph obtained in the emergency department was normal. While in the emergency department, the patient continued to have episodes of substernal chest pain lasting approximately 5 minutes. Between episodes, the ST-segment changes seen on the ECG resolved completely (Fig. 3 in the Supplementary Appendix). A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,15,nejm-case-2012-15,"A 48-Year-Old Woman with Diplopia, Headaches, and Papilledema","Dr. Rocío Hurtado (Infectious Diseases): A 48-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of diplopia, headaches, and papilledema. The patient had been well until 2 weeks before admission, when diplopia developed, which improved when she covered either eye. One week later, an intermittent stabbing headache developed, worse on the left side than on the right side. She saw her physician; hypertension was reportedly noted, and the administration of amlodipine was begun, without improvement in the headache. On the day of admission, examination by an ophthalmologist at another hospital reportedly revealed papilledema and a sixth-nerve palsy; hypertension was noted, and the administration of labetalol was begun. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain reportedly revealed hydrocephalus, without a midline shift or mass. She was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital. The patient reported occasional tingling of the feet; she did not have eye pain, visual loss, tearing, eye redness, difficulty swallowing, hearing loss, nausea or vomiting, or weakness or numbness. She had hypertension; serologic testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) had been positive, whereas testing for hepatitis B e antigen and antibodies against HBsAg were negative. She was born in the Dominican Republic, had immigrated to the United States 12 years earlier, and had not traveled outside the United States in 5 years. She worked in a service industry, was separated from her husband, and lived with her niece. Medications included amlodipine and lisinopril. She had no known allergies, and she did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. There was no known family history of neurologic diseases. On examination, the blood pressure was 181/103 mm Hg, the pulse 81 beats per minute, the temperature 36.3°C, and the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute. Neurologic examination revealed bilateral papilledema (worse on the left side than on the right side), decreased visual acuity (near vision, 20/100 in the left eye and 20/50 in the right eye), and diplopia (on far vision only, when the patient was standing); extraocular movements and other cranial-nerve functions were normal. The patellar and Achilles’ deep-tendon reflexes were 1+, equal, and symmetric, and the plantar reflex was extensor on the left and flexor on the right; the remainder of the examination was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 61 mm per hour (reference range for women, 0 to 25). The blood level of total protein was 9.4 g per deciliter (reference range, 6.0 to 8.0), globulin 5.6 g per deciliter (reference range, 2.6 to 4.1), alanine aminotransferase 300 U per liter (reference range, 7 to 30), and aspartate aminotransferase, 265 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 25). Results of a complete blood count, tests of coagulation, blood levels of electrolytes, and other routine laboratory tests were normal, as were the results of urinalysis and an electrocardiogram. CT of the brain after the administration of contrast material revealed bilateral enlargement of the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles and effacement of the sulci. The patient was admitted to this hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after the administration of gadolinium revealed moderate, diffuse ventricular enlargement with an abnormally bright T2-weighted signal surrounding the ependymal surfaces; a thin-walled cystic structure, 1.8 cm in diameter, that filled the midportion of the fourth ventricle; a nonenhancing isointense nodule, 3 mm in diameter, in the lateral aspect of the cystic structure; and enlargement of the optic-nerve sheaths. A lumbar puncture was performed; analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is shown in Table 1. No bacteria, acid-fast bacilli, or fungal organisms were seen on smears or cultures, and cyto-logic examination revealed no malignant cells. The next day, MRI of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine revealed a nonenhancing cystic structure, 11 mm by 4 mm, in the left lateral aspect of the spinal canal, adjacent to the T7 vertebral body, that appeared bright on T2-weighted images; the study was otherwise normal. Testing for HBsAg was positive; the IgG level was 2670 mg per deciliter (reference range, 614 to 1295), the IgA level 460 mg per deciliter (reference range, 69 to 309), and the IgM level 390 mg per deciliter (reference range, 53 to 334), with five very-low-concentration bands in the slow gamma region. The level of homocysteine was normal, and testing for lupus anticoagulant, antiphospholipid antibodies, syphilis, cryptococcal antigen, and antibodies to hepatitis C virus, the human immunodeficiency virus, and Borrelia burgdorferi was negative, as were stool examinations for ova and parasites. On the third day, MRI with three-dimensional magnetic resonance angiography revealed no changes from the previous examination; CT of the chest and abdominal ultrasonography were normal. A skin test for tuberculosis was negative after 72 hours. The administration of dexameth-asone was begun on the eighth day. On the 10th day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2023,27,nejm-case-2023-27,A 53-Year-Old Woman with Celiac Disease and Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding,"CME Dr. Emily W. Lopes: A 53-year-old woman with celiac disease was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of this hospital for the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding with hemorrhagic shock. The patient had been in her usual state of health until approximately 3 weeks before the current presentation, when fatigue, malaise, anorexia, generalized weakness, and watery diarrhea developed. Two weeks later, the diarrhea increased in frequency and became bloody. The patient presented to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. On examination, the blood pressure was 63/32 mm Hg, the hemoglobin level 6.0 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0), the international normalized ratio 7.63 (reference range, 0.90 to 1.10), the creatinine level 1.4 mg per deciliter (124 μmol per liter; reference range, 0.5 to 1.3 mg per deciliter [44 to 115 μmol per liter]), the alkaline phosphatase level 330 U per liter (reference range, 56 to 136), the albumin level 1.4 g per deciliter (reference range, 3.4 to 5.5), and the lactate level 3.3 mmol per liter (30 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [5 to 18 mg per deciliter]). Normal saline, albumin, norepinephrine, fresh-frozen plasma, vitamin K, 4 units of packed red cells, vancomycin, piperacillin– tazobactam, octreotide, and pantoprazole were administered intravenously. The patient was admitted to the other hospital. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of oral contrast material, reportedly revealed ground-glass opacities in the lungs, pulmonary nodules, esophageal dilatation, and diffuse osteo-penia, along with ascites, hepatic steatosis, diffuse bowel-wall thickening, dilated loops of small bowel, and horseshoe kidney. A heterogeneous mass, measuring 11 cm by 8 cm by 7 cm, with internal necrosis was identified near the pancreatic tail. Abdominal ultrasonography reportedly showed a cirrhotic-appearing liver and ascites. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was reportedly notable for severe esophagitis but showed no source of acute bleeding. During the first 7 hospital days, diarrhea continued, with an output of up to 2 liters of green liquid stool daily. Examination of a stool specimen was reportedly positive for leukocytes and negative for Clostridioides difficile and Shiga toxin, as well as campylobacter, giardia, and cryptospo-ridium antigens. On hospital day 7, anuria occurred, and the bladder pressure was 23 mm Hg. Paracentesis was performed for the treatment of abdominal distention, and 3.7 liters of ascitic fluid was removed. Testing of the ascitic fluid revealed 14,000 erythrocytes per microliter and 91 neu-trophils per microliter. The albumin level in as-citic fluid was 0.3 g per deciliter; the concurrent serum albumin level was 3.2 g per deciliter. No organisms were detected on Gram’s staining of the ascitic fluid. Norepinephrine and albumin were administered intravenously. The next day, there was an output of copious black stool. The hemoglobin level decreased from 8.1 g per deciliter to 5.1 g per deciliter; additional norepinephrine was administered intravenously, along with 4 units of packed red cells, cryoprecipitate, vitamin K, and fresh-frozen plasma. Intubation of the trachea was performed for repeat EGD, which reportedly revealed a pulsatile vascular lesion in the distal esophagus; blood was detected around the lesion. Octreotide and pantoprazole were administered intravenously, and the patient was transferred by helicopter to the ICU of this hospital. Because the patient had undergone intubation, the medical history was initially obtained from her husband and was limited. Celiac disease had been diagnosed in her late 30s, but she did not follow a gluten-free diet. Her one pregnancy had been complicated by severe gestational hypertension, with delivery by cesarean section performed at 33 weeks’ gestation. Menopause had occurred in her mid-40s. Recurrent otitis media had led to tympanic membrane perforation and resultant chronic hearing loss. In the past year, she had lost 7 kg of weight unintentionally. In the 2 weeks before she was admitted to the other hospital, after the onset of diarrhea, she had had a decreased appetite and had eaten only candy and cereal, with 2 kg of weight loss. The patient attended college and worked as a technical consultant. She lived with her husband. She had no history of nicotine, alcohol, or illicit substance use. She took no medications or supplements, and there were no known adverse reactions to medications. Her family history included stroke in her father, colon cancer in her paternal grandfather, and pancreatic cancer in a paternal great-grandfather and a paternal aunt. She had an adult child, who was healthy. On examination in the ICU, the patient appeared chronically ill. The temporal temperature was 37.1°C, the heart rate 91 beats per minute, the blood pressure 102/67 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 98% while she was receiving mechanical ventilation on a spontaneous-breathing mode (positive end-expiratory pressure, 5 cm of water; fraction of inspired oxygen, 35%). The height was 142 cm, the weight 50.6 kg, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 25.1. The bladder pressure was 12 mm Hg. The sclerae were icteric, and the skin was jaundiced. The corners of the mouth were inflamed, ery-thematous, and crusted. The abdomen was distended, and a fluid wave was present. The palmar surfaces appeared mildly erythematous and denuded, and there were pigmented nevi on the back and shoulder. Symmetric 1+ pitting edema was observed in the lower legs. The calcium and phosphorus levels were normal. Tests for hepatitis A antibodies, hepatitis B surface antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigens, hepatitis B core antibodies, hepatitis C antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and liver–kidney–microsomal autoantibodies type 1 were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Stool was obtained for culture and examination for ova and parasites. Albumin, 2 units of packed red cells, ceftriaxone, propofol, pantoprazole, and octreotide were administered intravenously. EGD was performed the next morning (Fig. 1). There was a blind-ended submucosal pouch that suggested the possibility of an intramural dissection in the posterior esophagus. Severe esoph-agitis, cratered esophageal ulcers, and a distal esophageal varix with an overlying fibrin plug were noted. An attempt at esophageal band ligation was unsuccessful, with unroofing of the fibrin clot and active spurting of blood. Two clips were applied for hemostasis. Hematin was found throughout the stomach. The duodenal bulb appeared nodular, and the duodenal mucosa appeared scalloped; a duodenal biopsy was performed. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Ranjodh S. Dhami: CT angiography of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed for assessment of the esophageal vessels and possible esophageal perforation (Fig. 2). Multiple esophageal, perigastric, and perisplenic varices were present. A 1.8-cm esophageal diverticulum, pneumomediastinum, and foci of air in the ret-ropharyngeal space and other deep spaces of the neck were noted, along with diffuse hepatic ste-atosis (without morphologic features of cirrhosis), mild splenomegaly, horseshoe kidney, and diffuse thickening of the small and large bowel walls. An enhancing, centrally hypodense left retroperi-toneal mass, measuring 10.7 cm in greatest dimension, was present. There was diffuse mottling of bones. Dr. Lopes: In the first 24 hours of hospitalization, there was an output of 800 ml of red liquid stool. On hospital day 2, a total of 3 units of packed red cells were administered. On hospital day 3, transthoracic echocardiography revealed normal left ventricular function, aortic-valve sclerosis, and mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Additional diagnostic tests were performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,03,nejm-case-2012-03,"A Newborn Boy with Vomiting, Diarrhea, and Abdominal Distention","Dr. Rebecca C. Bell (Pediatrics): A 6-day-old boy was admitted to this hospital because of vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal distention. The patient was born at another hospital to a teenaged primigravida by vaginal delivery after a full-term, uncomplicated gestation. The mother had received prenatal care; she had no history of sexually transmitted infections, and prenatal screening tests were negative. Meconium was present at delivery. The patient’s birth weight was 4.3 kg (95th percentile), and the 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores were 7 and 9, respectively. Breast-feeding was initiated. The newborn passed two stools on the second day (the first at 30 hours of age). The next day, he reportedly had one loose, green stool. He was discharged home at 50 hours of age. He lived with his mother and her parents. When he was 3 and 4 days of age, he vomited yellow-green emesis on several occasions. He was otherwise well and breastfeeding regularly. At 3 a.m. on the day of admission, he became fussy and did not complete his normal feeding. Between 3 a.m. and 9 a.m., approximately six episodes of vomiting (initially breast milk, followed by mucus) occurred, with increasingly foul-smelling emesis. Diarrhea developed, and urine output decreased. Later that morning, he became less active; abdominal distention developed, and he stopped voiding. He was taken to a clinic affiliated with this hospital. On examination, he appeared tired, with intermittent grunting. The rectal temperature was 38.0°C. The abdomen was distended and tender, with hypoactive bowel sounds; stool was positive for occult blood. He was transported by ambulance to the emergency department of this hospital. On examination, the patient appeared alert and slightly uncomfortable. The temperature was 37.2°C, the pulse 160 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 3.9 kg. The abdomen was distended, soft, and tympanic, with decreased bowel sounds. There were small, bilateral noncommunicating hydroceles. The remainder of the examination was normal. A stool specimen showed no occult blood. Urinalysis revealed clear orange urine, with a specific gravity greater than 1.030, pH 6.5, nitrites, 1+ urobilinogen, 3+ bilirubin, 2+ albumin, and trace white cells, blood, glucose, and ketones. Urinalysis also revealed 0 to 2 red cells, 3 to 5 white cells, moderate bacteria, and a few squamous and renal tubular cells per high-power field. Ampicil-lin, gentamicin, and boluses of normal saline were administered. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Radiographs of the abdomen showed dilated loops of bowel in the lower abdomen, which were suggestive of distal bowel obstruction. There was no free air. An upper gastrointestinal series showed severe gastroesophageal reflux without evidence of malrotation. An enema administered with a water-soluble contrast agent revealed free flow of contrast material, with a long segment of narrowing involving the rectum and distal sigmoid colon and proximal distention of the descending colon. No stricture was identified. Rectal examination performed after the enema did not reveal blood or mucus. After the enema, the patient passed multiple non-bloody stools, and the abdominal distention decreased. Seven hours after arrival in the emergency department, the temperature rose to 38.7°C; acetaminophen was administered. Lumbar puncture was performed; analysis of cerebrospinal fluid is shown in Table 2. Acyclovir was administered. The patient was admitted to the pediatric service. Shortly after admission, the temperature rose to 39.1°C and the pulse to 179 beats per minute, with poor capillary refill. He was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit. Vancomycin and additional crystalloid were administered intravenously. During the first day, increasing abdomi-nal distention, poor perfusion (as evidenced by cool extremities), and respiratory failure developed. A nasogastric tube was placed. A continuous infusion of dopamine followed by norepinephrine was administered, and the trachea was intubated. Transthoracic echocardiogra-phy revealed a patent foramen ovale, a small patent ductus arteriosus with left-to-right shunting, and normal ventricular function. Stools became positive for occult blood, and perianal excoriation developed. Serum levels of lactate, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. A repeat abdominal radiograph showed multiple distended loops of small bowel containing residual contrast material and relative decompression of the large bowel. Surgical consultants inserted a femoral central venous cathe-ter and a radial arterial catheter. The administration of ampicillin was stopped, and meropenem was begun; pressors were adjusted to maintain a mean arterial pressure between 50 and 60 mm Hg. Urine obtained by catheter on admission was cultured and grew few nonhemolytic streptococci (1000 to 10,000 colonies per milliliter; the streptococci were consistent with viridans group streptococci and were thought to be a contaminant); a blood culture was sterile. Screening of nasal specimens for respiratory viruses and en-terovirus and of stool cultures for enteric pathogens and enterovirus was negative. On the third day, serum levels of lactate, magnesium, and ionic calcium were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Bicarbonate and immune globulin were administered intravenously. Total parenteral nutrition was begun. During the first week, blood-pressure instability persisted and anasarca developed, with decreased urine output; dopamine, norepineph-rine, albumin, and isotonic fluid boluses were administered. Vecuronium, fentanyl, and midaz-olam were given for sedation and analgesia. The platelet and red-cell counts decreased, and coagulation-test results showed a prolonged time to coagulation. Transfusions of platelets and red cells were administered, as was vitamin K. The serum level of C-reactive protein was 17.1 mg per liter (reference range for inflammation, <8.0); the level of alpha1-antitrypsin in the serum was 137 mg per deciliter (reference range not de-fined) and in stool, 328 mg per deciliter (reference range, <55). Testing of stool for Clostridium difficile toxin, cultures of stool specimens for fungi and enteric pathogens, and culture of the urine for cytomegalovirus were negative. On the fifth day, the abdomen became mottled and tense, and the abdominal girth increased from 41 to 48 cm. An abdominal ultrasound examination revealed abundant ascites with septations that were worrisome for peritonitis. Paracentesis was performed, and peritoneal fluid (30 ml) was drained; results of fluid analysis are shown in Table 2. Intravenous fluid requirements gradually decreased, and the mean arterial pressure and results of renal- and hepatic-function tests improved. Acyclovir and vancomycin were stopped, and furosemide was administered for gradual diuresis. During the second week, the patient’s vital signs and clinical condition gradually stabilized. Gentamicin and dopamine were stopped, norepinephrine was weaned, and gradual diuresis continued. On the 14th day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,24,nejm-case-2019-24,"A 39-Year-Old Woman with Palpitations, Abdominal Pain, and Vomiting","Dr. Kelsey Hills-Evans (Medicine): A 39-year-old woman with cyclic vomiting syndrome and polysubstance use disorder was seen in the emergency department of this hospital because of abdominal pain and vomiting. Eleven weeks before the current presentation, the patient was admitted to a hospital affiliated with this hospital because of intractable nausea and vomiting. She also had loose stools and pain in the right lower abdomen in the presence of menses. Her symptoms were similar to those in previous episodes that had been attributed to cyclic vomiting syndrome. Testing for Clostridium difficile toxin and fecal leukocytes was negative, as was an examination of the stool for ova and parasites; a stool culture showed normal enteric flora. A urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine and opiates. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Mark A. Anderson: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed bilateral, punctate, nonobstructing renal calculi without hydronephrosis. There was no evidence of bowel obstruction or acute inflammation in the abdomen or pelvis, including the appendix. Normal premenopausal ovaries that contained functional follicles were noted. Dr. Hills-Evans: Ondansetron, hydromorphone, and intravenous fluids were administered. Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain resolved. On the second hospital day, the patient was able to eat normally and was discharged home. One day before the current presentation, the patient inhaled smoke from an electrical fire in her basement. After the smoke inhalation, pain in the left lower abdomen and severe fatigue developed, but she did not seek medical evaluation. On the day of the current presentation, menses began, and she awoke with nausea and profuse vomiting of dark-brown fluid. Her temperature at home was 39.4°C. During the next 12 hours, she had persistent nausea and repeated episodes of vomiting. Weakness, light-headedness, and dizziness developed, and she presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing nausea, vomiting, and pain in the left lower abdomen. She reported recent use of cannabinoids but no other drugs. Other medical history included nephrolithiasis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, chronic back pain, depression, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and severe dysmenor-rhea. Past surgeries included shoulder replacement, reduction mammoplasty, and removal of an ovarian cyst. Medications included acetaminophen, intranasal fluticasone, inhaled fluticasone propionate, albuterol, promethazine, ondansetron, polyethylene glycol, and a multivitamin. She had no known allergies. She did not know of any medical problems in her family. Three years before presentation, she had moved to New England from the northwestern United States after marrying her husband. She had worked in the pharmaceutical industry but had stopped working 3 months previously because of cyclic vomiting syndrome. She did not use tobacco or alcohol. She had a history of using cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphet-amine (MDMA). The temperature was 37.2°C, the pulse 165 beats per minute, the blood pressure 152/70 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 52.5 kg; at the affiliated hospital 11 weeks earlier, it had been 59.3 kg. She was alert and oriented but had a labile affect, with alternating periods of laughing and crying. Her gaze was noted to be intense, and her speech was rapid, pressured, and at times slurred. She was agitated and was seen thrashing in her bed, pulling at equipment and clothing. Her face and chest were erythematous, and her skin was warm to the touch. A fine tremor was noted in her hands, but no tongue fasciculations were seen. She did not cooperate during a neck examination. The heart sounds were rapid and regular; a systolic ejection murmur was noted. The abdomen was soft, with normal bowel sounds and no distention; there was tenderness on palpation of the left lower abdomen. Shortly after arrival in the emergency department, the patient vomited “coffee grounds” material. Twenty-five minutes later, the pulse increased from 165 beats per minute to 210 beats per minute. Dr. Conor D. Barrett: A 12-lead electrocardio-gram obtained in the emergency department showed supraventricular tachycardia with a long RP interval (Fig. 1A, and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Adenosine was administered intravenously, and after a ventricular ec-topic beat and a brief episode of atrial ectopy, sinus tachycardia emerged. It is important to note that the last observed event on cessation of this patient’s supraventricular tachycardia was a QRS complex and not a P wave, and the previously observed P wave was of high-to-low atrial activation, as seen in lead II (Fig. 1B). A subsequent 12-lead electrocardiogram confirmed ongoing sinus tachycardia (Fig. 1C). Dr. Hills-Evans: The alkaline phosphatase level was 165 U per liter (reference range, 27 to 129); the results of other tests of liver function were normal. A urine test for beta human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.013, with 2+ ketones and 2+ blood per high-power field, as well as 2 leukocytes per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 4). A urine toxicology screen was positive for fen-tanyl, oxycodone, and cannabinoids. The results of other laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Anderson: A chest radiograph showed clear lungs, a normal cardiac silhouette, no pulmonary edema, and no mediastinal or hilar lymph-adenopathy. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed bilateral, punctate, nonobstructing renal calculi without hydronephrosis. During the portal venous phase, the liver attenuation level was 27 Hounsfield units lower than the splenic attenuation level, a finding consistent with hepatic steatosis. There was no bowel obstruction or acute inflammation in the abdomen or pelvis. The appendix appeared normal, and the ovaries were premeno-pausal, containing functional follicles (Fig. 2). Dr. Hills-Evans: Intravenous fluids, ondansetron, pantoprazole, fentanyl, and lorazepam were administered. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and a diagnostic test was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2008,09,nejm-case-2008-09,A 65-Year-Old Woman with a Nonhealing Ulcer of the Jaw,"Dr.StevenE. Smullin (Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery): A 65-year-old woman was seen in the oral surgery clinic of this hospital because of a nonhealing ulcer of the mandible. Three years earlier, the patient had been referred to the oral and maxillofacial surgery clinic for evaluation and extraction of three teeth: the mandibular right cuspid and first bicuspid and the mandibular left second bicuspid. Dental extractions were performed on an outpatient basis with local anesthesia. The right mandibular teeth were extracted nonsurgically; the mandibular left second bicuspid required a surgical extraction with flap elevation and bone removal. At a postoperative visit 1 week later, the wounds were healing well. During the next 21∕2 years, the patient had regular routine dental care and reported no problems. Six months before this evaluation, her dentist noticed that the mandibular right second bicuspid was fractured, with an adjacent area of red swollen gingiva at the site of the extraction of the mandibular right first bicuspid. Three months later, a return visit to her dentist revealed a persistent nonhealing ulcer at the right mandibular extraction site and mobility of the mandibular right second bicuspid. The patient was referred to the oral and maxillofacial surgery clinic for further evaluation. A diagnosis of multiple myeloma had been made 61∕2 years earlier, after an 8-year history of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Radiographs of the skeleton at that time showed degenerative changes in the lumbar and thoracic spine and knees, with no lytic lesions. Treatment with chemotherapy, including vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone for six cycles, followed by high-dose therapy with busulfan and cyclophosphamide and autologous stem-cell rescue resulted in a complete remission. Intravenous pamidronate (90 mg) administered monthly was begun; 2 years later (41∕2 years before admission), zoledronic acid replaced the pamidronate. During the 4 years before the current evaluation, multiple myeloma recurred, with a lytic bone lesion of the femoral neck that was treated with radiation therapy. There were also elevations of the serum levels of IgG and paraprotein and a positive bone marrow–biopsy specimen. Treatment with thalidomide and dexamethasone resulted in stabilization of the serum protein levels and a reduction in the number of plasma cells in the bone marrow. Treatment with thalidomide was discontinued after 20 months because of peripheral neuropathy. There was a history of hypertension, glaucoma, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, osteoarthritis, and an episode of sciatic pain caused by a synovial cyst at the L4–L5 level. The patient, who was black, was married with grown children and worked in education. She did not smoke or drink alcohol. There was a family history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. A brother had prostate cancer, and a grandmother had had uterine cancer. Medications included zoledronic acid (4 mg) given intravenously each month, dexamethasone (40 mg weekly), furosemide, potassium supplements, and conjugated estrogen cream. On examination of the mouth, there was red, raised soft tissue in the right mandible bicuspid and cuspid region, with mucosal ulceration and exposed bone underlying it. Multiple teeth were missing. A panoramic radiograph revealed an area of sclerotic bone of the right mandible in the region of the extractions, with well-corticated condyles. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,23,nejm-case-2012-23,A 59-Year-Old Man with Abdominal Pain and Weight Loss,"Dr. Katie R. Famous (Medicine): A 59-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 9 months before admission, when weakness and anorexia developed. Evaluation at another hospital disclosed normal blood levels of thyrotropin and vitamin B12; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Six stool specimens showed no occult blood. Esoph-agogastroduodenoscopy reportedly revealed a normal esophagus and stomach; biopsy specimens of abnormalities in the distal duodenum were obtained. Colonoscopy revealed erythema in the right colon and transverse colon, without ulceration. Pathological examination of the duodenal-biopsy specimen reportedly revealed villous blunting, active inflammation, and intraepithelial lymphocytes, findings that were considered consistent with celiac disease. The colonic lamina propria showed marked chronic inflammatory changes, without granulomas. The patient did not recall being told of a diagnosis of celiac disease at that time. Three months before admission, episodes of abdominal discomfort recurred, with anorexia and a 10-kg weight loss. Three weeks before admission, the patient had diffuse, crampy abdominal pain, nausea that worsened after eating, and increased frequency of formed stools. He returned to the other hospital. Levels of amylase and lipase and tests of liver function were normal, and testing for Helicobacter pylori, IgA antibody to endomysial antigen, and IgA and IgG antibodies to tissue transgluta-minase was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen reportedly showed atherosclerotic disease in the distal aorta and iliac vessels and no bowel-wall thickening or obstruction. The diagnosis of celiac disease was communicated to the patient, and he began a gluten-free diet, eating only soup. One week before admission, intermittent bilious nonbloody emesis developed. The evening before admission, nausea and abdominal pain worsened, vomiting recurred, and he stopped eating. The next morning, he was brought to the emergency department at this hospital. The patient reported leg swelling of 3 weeks’ duration, chronic constipation, with a recent increase in stool frequency without overt diarrhea, and confusion about the gluten-free diet. He did not have hematochezia, melena, hematemesis, night sweats, urinary symptoms, or rash. Fourteen years earlier, the patient had sus-tained multiple fractures in an accident; recovery was complicated by nonunion of the left iliac wing and a persistent intestinal hernia in the region of the nonunion. Four years earlier, a neurofibroma of the jejunum had been resected after the patient presented with small-bowel obstruction; helminths consistent with Strongyloides stercoralis were noted in the resected bowel. Ivermectin, 12 mg (0.2 mg per kilogram of body weight) orally, was administered in the hospital and was to be repeated 7 days later; it was not clear whether the patient had taken the second dose. He also had hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Medications included lisinopril, atorvastatin, acetaminophen, and docusate sodium. He had no known allergies. He was born in a Caribbean country, immigrated to the United States 25 years earlier, and spoke only Spanish. In the past 10 years, he had returned to his native country only once, 1 month earlier. He did not consume undercooked meat or fish or unpasteurized dairy products, and he had no known exposures to tuberculosis. He was divorced, lived alone, had three children, and was unable to work because of a pelvic fracture. He did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. There was no family history of bowel disease. On examination, the patient was thin. The blood pressure was 116/71 mm Hg, the pulse 74 beats per minute, the temperature 36.7°C, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. There were coarse inspiratory breath sounds, more marked on the right side than on the left side; a distended tympanic abdomen, without tenderness or hernias; hypoactive bowel sounds; blanching erythematous macules, 1 to 2 mm in diameter, on the torso; and 1+ pitting edema on the legs. The stool was brown and guaiac-positive. The prothrombin time and blood levels of glucose, globulin, phosphorus, magnesium, amylase, lactic acid, and IgA were normal, as were tests of liver and renal function. Testing for IgA antibodies to endomysial antigen and tissue transglutaminase was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis was positive for nitrites and trace ketones and was otherwise normal. CT of the abdomen, after the oral administration of contrast material, showed mucosal enhancement in the duodenum, jejunum, and splenic flexure of the colon; dilated loops of small bowel up to 6 cm in diameter, with a caliber change in the right middle abdomen at the level of the surgical clips; dilatation of the cecum to 8 cm, with a normal appendix; colonic-wall thickening at the splenic flexure; and a chronic, displaced, comminuted fracture of the iliac crest, with large-bowel herniation and no evidence of obstruction. In the emergency department, the temperature rose to 37.9°C and bilious emesis developed. Normal saline, esomeprazole, a narcotic analgesic agent, ondansetron, and metoclopramide were administered intravenously; a nasogastric tube was placed and 700 ml of bilious fluid suctioned, with improvement in the patient’s symptoms. He was admitted to this hospital. Culture of the urine grew Escherichia coli, and ciprofloxacin was administered. He was discharged on the third day, taking ciprofloxacin, nutritional supplements, ferrous sulfate, a multivitamin, ascorbic acid, and his usual medications. Four days after discharge, the patient returned to the emergency department because of recurrent abdominal pain. The examination was unchanged. Levels of glucose, globulin, lipase, and amylase were normal, as were tests of coagulation and liver and renal function; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis was positive for nitrites, 3 to 5 white cells per high-power field, and bacteria. Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxa-zole was administered for a presumptive urinary tract infection. Nine days later, the patient’s temperature reportedly rose to 38°C; anorexia, postprandial nausea, and occasional vomiting recurred. He returned to this hospital. On examination, he appeared cachectic. The height was 167.6 cm, the weight 53.1 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 18.9; other vital signs were normal. The bowel sounds were faint, and the abdomen was diffusely tender; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. The stool was positive for occult blood. A chest radiograph revealed increased linear opacities in the lungs. CT of the abdomen and pelvis after the intravenous and oral administration of contrast material was unchanged from the previous study. Fluids were administered intravenously, and oral intake was withheld. Blood levels of glucose, phosphorus, magnesium, IgG, and IgA were normal, as were serum protein electrophoresis and tests of renal and liver function; testing for IgA antibodies to tissue transglutamin-ase was negative. Other test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was readmitted to this hospital. Analysis of the stool revealed 25% fat (reference value, <20%). Diagnostic procedures were performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2020,17,nejm-case-2020-17,A 68-Year-Old Man with Covid-19 and Acute Kidney Injury,"Dr. Meridale V. Baggett: A 68-year-old man was admitted to this hospital with fever, shortness of breath, and acute kidney injury during the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The patient had been in his usual state of health until 4 days before admission, when fever developed, with a temperature of up to 39.9°C and associated shaking chills. He had a poor appetite and was eating and drinking less than usual. Three days before admission, he stopped using long-acting insulin for his diabetes because fasting blood glucose levels were less than 100 mg per deciliter (5.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 99 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 5.5 mmol per liter]). One day before admission, a dry cough developed. On the morning of admission, the patient noticed shortness of breath. He called his primary care physician, who recommended that he present to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing shortness of breath, with no chest pain, orthopnea, or leg swelling. He had not traveled recently. He worked as a limousine driver but had not had known contact with anyone with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient had a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea. A drug-eluting stent had been placed in the left anterior descending coronary artery 7 years earlier. Medications included aspirin, clopidogrel, dulaglutide, empagliflozin, ezetimibe, glipizide, insulin glargine, lisinopril, metformin, metoprolol, rosuvastatin, and testosterone. There were no known drug allergies. The patient did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit substances. He lived with his girlfriend in a suburb of Boston. His family history included coronary artery disease in his father and emphysema in his mother. On examination, the temperature was 37.6°C, the blood pressure 157/74 mm Hg, the heart rate 124 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 40 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 37.1. The patient had moderately increased work of breathing and diffuse coarse crackles at the lung bases. The mucous membranes were dry. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The blood creatinine level of 1.3 mg per deciliter (115 μmol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.5 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 μmol per liter]) was higher than the level obtained 1 year earlier (0.8 mg per deciliter [71 μmol per liter]). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: A chest radiograph obtained in the emergency department showed bilateral multifocal patchy opacities, a finding suggestive of pneumonia (Fig. 1A). Dr. Baggett: Blood samples were obtained for culture, and a nasopharyngeal swab was submitted to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Two liters of intravenous lactated Ringer’s solution were administered, along with ceftriaxone and azithro-mycin. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Three hours after admission, the oxygen saturation decreased to 87% while the patient was breathing ambient air and then increased to 92% with the administration of oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. Five hours later, shortness of breath increased and the oxygen saturation decreased, and the oxygen flow rate was adjusted to 6 liters per minute. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Intravenous vancomycin and furosemide were administered. The nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA returned positive. Treatment with hydroxychloroquine was started, and the patient was enrolled in a placebo-controlled clinical trial of remdesivir (ClinicalTrials .gov number, NCT04280705). Sixteen hours after transfer to the ICU, the patient underwent intubation and mechanical ventilation for persistent tachypnea and worsening oxygen saturation. During the next 24 hours, hypotension developed, with the blood pressure decreasing to 78/45 mm Hg, and treatment with intravenous norepinephrine was initiated. On hospital day 3, the creatinine level increased to 1.8 mg per deciliter (159 μmol per liter), and the patient’s participation in the clinical trial of remdesivir was discontinued. During the next 5 days, his urine output was maintained at 100 ml per hour with the administration of increased doses of intravenous loop diuretics, but the blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels continued to rise — reaching 111 mg per deciliter (39.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter [2.9 to 8.9 mmol per liter]) and 6.9 mg per deciliter (610 μmol per liter), respectively — and a mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis developed. Management decisions were made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2018,29,nejm-case-2018-29,A 31-Year-Old Woman with Infertility,"Dr. Caitlin Sacha (Obstetrics and Gynecology): A 31-year-old woman with infertility was referred to the fertility center of this hospital by a surrogate parenting agency to discuss the possibility of family building with an oocyte donor and a gestational carrier. The patient reported that, when she was 16 years of age, she had been evaluated for primary amenorrhea and had received a diagnosis of congenital absence of the uterus and ovaries. When she was approximately 12 years of age, adrenarche and thelarche had occurred in association with a linear growth spurt. The patient had never had menstrual molimina or any headaches, vision problems, galactor-rhea, vasomotor symptoms, or reduction in exercise tolerance. The patient also reported that, when she was 10 years of age, she had fractured her arm and had undergone tonsillectomy. She took no medications and had no known allergies. Four months before the current evaluation, she had moved to New England from northern Europe; she currently lived with her husband in a suburban area and worked in an office. She drank alcohol rarely, smoked 3 to 5 cigarettes a day, and did not use illicit drugs. Her mother had conceived her children easily and had undergone hysterectomy because of endometriosis when she was 46 years of age, and her maternal grandfather had died of a myocardial infarction when he was 70 years of age. The patient’s father and two sisters were healthy; one sister was the patient’s fraternal twin and had regular menses. On examination, the blood pressure was 118/74 mm Hg, the weight 68.1 kg, the height 172.7 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 22.8. The patient had minimal body hair. A pelvic examination revealed normal female external genitalia and normal vaginal length and rugae; there was no abnormal vaginal discharge or evidence of pelvic-organ prolapse. The cervix and uterus were absent. There was mild fullness in the left adnexal region, without tenderness or a discrete mass. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Ultrasonography of the pelvis confirmed the absence of the uterus and cervix. The right ovary was not visualized; there were clusters of simple cysts in the adnexal region on the right side (one measuring 24 mm by 25 mm and another measuring 18 mm by 17 mm) and on the left side (one measuring 18 mm by 17 mm and another measuring 20 mm by 21 mm). Tests were positive for rubella virus IgG antibodies and vari-cella–zoster virus IgG antibodies, and screening tests were negative for hepatitis B virus surface antigen, human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, hepatitis C virus, human T-lymphotropic virus types 1 and 2, syphilis, and cytomegalovi-rus. The complete blood count and white-cell differential count were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood specimens were collected for measurement of the antimüllerian hormone level and for chromosome analysis. Five days later, additional diagnostic tests were performed; laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was performed for the assessment of bone mineral density. There was borderline low bone mass in the spine on posterior–anterior examination (bone mineral density T score, −1.10), normal bone mass in the vertebral bodies on lateral examination (T score, −0.20), and normal bone mass in the femoral neck (T score, −0.90). Four days later, a diagnostic test result was received, and management decisions were made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2009,04,nejm-case-2009-04,A 39-Year-Old Pregnant Woman with Fever after a Trip to Africa,"A 39-year-old woman in the first trimester of her first pregnancy was seen in the obstetrics and gynecology clinic of this hospital at 14 weeks of gestation because of a recent febrile illness. She had been well until approximately 9 weeks before this evaluation, when daily fevers with temperatures of up to 38.3°C developed, accompanied by rigors, malaise, myalgias, and fatigue. She took ibuprofen every 6 hours, with some improvement. One week later, she saw her primary care provider. She reported no headache, stiff neck, nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, nausea, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. Four months before the onset of fever, she had traveled to East Africa, where she worked for 6 weeks with her husband in an orphanage while awaiting completion of adoption procedures. Approximately 12 weeks before the onset of fevers, she returned to the United States with her adopted child. She had first traveled to East Africa 10 months earlier. Before this travel, she had received vaccinations for yellow fever, polio, hepatitis A and B viruses, Neisseria meningitidis, and typhoid. She took mefloquine weekly during each trip and for 3 weeks after returning from each trip. After the first trip, she had prolonged fatigue, intermittent diarrhea, flatulence, and bloating. Testing of the stool for ova and parasites was negative; the symptoms persisted for 5 months, and metronida-zole was administered for a presumptive diagnosis of giardiasis. During the more recent visit, she and her husband had episodes of diarrhea; she had had intermittent diarrhea since returning but otherwise felt well. On examination, the temperature was 37.7°C; the remainder of the examination was normal. Urinalysis, tests of renal function, and levels of serum electrolytes, glucose, and total bilirubin were normal; cultures of the blood were sterile. Other laboratory-test results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. On follow-up examination 4 days later, the temperature was 36.6°C and a diffuse macular rash was present on the trunk and extremities. A tuberculin skin test was negative. Two days later, 7 weeks before this evaluation, she saw an infectious-disease specialist at another hospital. She felt better but was still fatigued. She reported that during her recent trip to Africa, she had stayed in a large city but had traveled briefly to an area where malaria is endemic; she had had a rash, which she attributed to hives, that had spontaneously resolved. On her return, she was treated for scabies. Her last menstrual period was 5 weeks earlier, and a home pregnancy test the previous day was positive. Tests in the preceding 18 months for antibody to rubella were positive, and tests for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative. She had had a mononucleosis-like illness as an adolescent, herpes simplex vulvovaginitis, exposure to diethylstilbestrol in utero, an abnormal Papanicolaou smear of the cervix that led to a loop electrosurgical excision procedure, meningitis while in college, and infertility, for which she had received in vitro fertilization treatments without success. She was married and lived in New England. She did not smoke or use illicit drugs. Her medications included valacyclovir as needed for genital herpes and ibuprofen every 6 hours for fever. She had no known allergies. Her newly adopted, 17-month-old child had had diarrhea without fever and had been treated for gastrointestinal parasites and salmonella infection. On examination, the temperature was 36.7°C; other vital signs were normal. There was mild conjunctival erythema; a faint maculopapular rash over the arms, hands, and torso; and a mildly enlarged liver, with no tenderness or splenomeg-aly. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood type was A Rh-positive, and an antibody screen and a rapid plasma reagin test were negative. Testing for antinuclear antibody and anti–smooth-muscle antibody were negative. Analysis of the stool disclosed no ova or parasites, and a culture was negative for pathogens. A urine specimen for shell-vial isolation of cyto-megalovirus (CMV) was negative. Culture of the urine and nucleic acid testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea were negative. Other laboratory-test results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. One week later, transvaginal ultrasonography of the uterus revealed a single live fetus at 7.4 weeks of gestation. Testing for antibody to hepatitis B e antigen was negative. The patient’s symptoms gradually resolved. Repeat ultrasonography 1 month before this evaluation revealed a live fetus at 11.4 weeks of gestation. Results of laboratory tests performed 3 weeks before this evaluation are shown in Tables 1 and 2. The patient was referred to the obstetrics and gynecology clinic of this hospital. She felt well and was taking no medications. She and her husband greatly desired this unexpected pregnancy and declined termination after discussion of the risks of fetal CMV infection. Twelve days later, testing of blood for CMV-specific IgG avidity was 0.60 (positive result, ≥0.60). Repeat ultrasonog-raphy of the pelvis 3 weeks and 5 weeks later showed a single active fetus with no identifiable anatomical abnormalities and a size consistent with the gestational age. At 21 weeks of gestation, a diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,04,nejm-case-2019-04,An 18-Year-Old Man with Abdominal Pain and Hematochezia,"Dr. Fabian J. Scheid: An 18-year-old male professional athlete was admitted to this hospital because of fevers, abdominal pain, and hematochezia. The patient had been well until 20 days before this admission, when fevers and pain in the right lower quadrant developed during a trip to the southeastern United States for athletic training. One day later, the patient had mild postprandial nausea and loose stools. He presented to a local emergency department for evaluation. In the emergency department of the first hospital, the pulse was 59 beats per minute, the blood pressure 114/65 mm Hg, and the weight 72.1 kg. The results of the rest of the physical examination were not documented. The blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and lipase were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The results of computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of oral and intravenous contrast material, were reportedly normal. After 5 hours of observation, the patient was discharged to his hotel without receiving a specific diagnosis. During the next 2 weeks, the abdominal pain diminished and the fevers and loose stools resolved; mild nausea persisted. The patient traveled with his team to the western United States and participated in reduced-intensity athletic training. Four days before this admission, pain in the right lower quadrant recurred and was associated with low-back pain on the right side. In addition, he produced well-formed stools that contained blood. The following day, the abdominal and back pain persisted. Because the patient had not had a bowel movement, his athletic trainer recommended that he take a rectal suppository. After he took the suppository, he had a bowel movement that consisted of loose stools admixed with blood and mucus. That evening, a temperature of 39.7°C developed, prompting the patient to present to the emergency department of a second hospital. In the emergency department of the second hospital, the patient reported pain in the right flank and abdomen and loss of appetite. The temperature was 38.9°C, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the blood pressure 124/76 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. The lower quadrants of the abdomen and the right flank were tender; the remainder of the examination was normal. The anion gap and blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and lipase were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly revealed mildly distended, fluid-filled loops of small bowel in the left half of the abdomen and the presence of air–fluid levels in the rectum. Acetaminophen and intravenous fluids were administered, and the fever and tachycardia resolved. The team’s internist encouraged the patient to return to New England for further medical evaluation. Two days later and 1 day before this admission, the patient was seen by the team’s internist at an outpatient clinic of this hospital. He reported that the abdominal and back pain persisted. He also reported that, earlier that day, he had had a temperature of 38.9°C, which had decreased after the administration of acetaminophen, and produced well-formed stools that contained blood. The patient appeared to be uncomfortable. The temperature was 36.3°C, the pulse 84 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 110/74 mm Hg. The abdomen was soft, with normal bowel sounds; there was tenderness in the right lower quadrant and the suprapubic region, without guarding, rebound tenderness, or masses. The remainder of the examination was normal. Arrangements were made for an expedited colonoscopy to be performed by a gastroenterologist at this hospital the following afternoon. The next morning, the patient called the team’s internist and reported that, after he had taken the bowel-preparation regimen, he had had a bowel movement that contained a large volume of blood. He also reported shaking chills and fever, with temperatures as high as 39.4°C, as well as worsening pain in the right lower quadrant. He was advised to present to the emergency department of this hospital. In the emergency department of this hospital, the patient reported light-headedness and malaise. His medications included ibuprofen and acetaminophen as needed, and he had no known allergies. A review of systems was negative for emesis, diarrhea, tenesmus, genitourinary symptoms, arthralgias, rash, and skin and oral ulcerations. The patient was a professional athlete who lived with his family in an urban area of New England and traveled frequently throughout the continental United States. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. There was no family history of autoimmune diseases or inflammatory bowel disease. The patient appeared to be tired. The temperature was 37.6°C, the pulse 122 beats per minute, the blood pressure 110/56 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 72.3 kg, the height 185 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 21.1. The abdomen was soft, with normal bowel sounds; there was tenderness on palpation of the right lower quadrant and the suprapubic region, without guarding, rigidity, distention, or masses. Examination of the rectum revealed a few external hemorrhoids, and there was scant bright-red blood in the rectal vault; there were no skin tags or palpable fissures or masses. There was no testicular tenderness, warmth, or erythema, but there was an enlarged right inguinal lymph node. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood samples were obtained for culture. Stool samples, which were liquid and bloody, were obtained for culture, examination for ova and parasites, tests for antigens of Clostridium difficile and Shiga toxins 1 and 2, and measurement of the calprotectin level. The anion gap and blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bili-rubin, and lipase were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Tests for infection with human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and Helicobacter pylori were negative. Intravenous fluids were administered, and CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed. On the initial interpretation of the CT scan, no evidence of an acute process in the abdomen or pelvis was detected and the appendix was not visible. The patient was admitted to the hospital. That evening, a temperature of 40.2°C developed, with associated rigors, and the patient appeared to be confused. The pulse was 145 beats per minute, the blood pressure 109/52 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 35 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. There was a new systolic ejection murmur (grade 2/6) that was best heard at the left upper sternal border; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Another blood sample was obtained for culture. The lactate dehydro-genase level was normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cefepime, metro-nidazole, acetaminophen, and intravenous fluids were administered, and the vital signs and mental status normalized. Ninety minutes after the initiation of treatment, the microbiology laboratory reported that cultures of the blood that had been obtained in the emergency department 11.5 hours earlier had grown gram-negative rods. During the next day, additional fevers occurred, with temperatures as high as 40.6°C and with associated rigors. Cultures of the blood that had been obtained in the emergency department grew Klebsiella pneumoniae and gram-positive cocci, and repeat blood cultures reportedly grew a second type of gram-negative rod. A diagnostic test was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,12,nejm-case-2019-12,A 60-Year-Old Man with Weakness and Difficulty Chewing,"Dr. Amanda C. Guidon: A 60-year-old man was evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital because of weakness and difficulty chewing. Six months before this presentation, weakness developed in the muscles of the patient’s shoulders and arms, and he found it difficult to carry objects. He also noticed cramps in the muscles of his chest and shoulders. Four months before this presentation, the patient began to have difficulty chewing food. He described mild difficulty chewing at the beginning of a meal, with the severity increasing during the meal. The weakness and difficulty chewing persisted, and 5 weeks before this presentation, the patient was evaluated in a neurology clinic at another hospital. He reported excess salivation, slurred speech, mild constipation, and a weight loss of 3.6 kg over a period of 3 months. He had no associated pain, numbness, shortness of breath, memory deficits, or changes in bladder function or mood. Chronic dip-lopia had developed approximately 30 years earlier, after the patient had undergone surgery for correction of a retinal detachment; the diplopia was unchanged and improved with covering either eye. On examination, the patient’s speech was fluent, without dysarthria. There was no ophthalmoplegia or ptosis initially or with prolonged gaze. Results of formal testing of facial muscle power and jaw strength were normal. Motor testing revealed full, symmetric strength in the arms and legs, except for the strength on shoulder abduction and elbow flexion bilaterally, which was 4+ out of 5. Atrophy and fasciculations of the deltoid muscles were noted. Deep-tendon reflexes were 3+ and symmetric in the arms. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, vitamin B12 (cobalamin), copper, zinc, mercury, and arsenic were normal, as were results of tests of kidney, liver, and thyroid function. The complete blood count, erythrocyte-sedimentation rate, and creatine kinase level were normal. Screening tests for Lyme and syphilis antibodies were negative, as were tests for acetylcholine receptor binding, modulating, and blocking antibodies and antibodies to muscle-specific tyrosine kinase. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, was negative. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed without the administration of contrast material; T2-weighted images showed nonspecific, minimal, bilateral white-matter disease, a finding consistent with chronic small-vessel ischemic disease. MRI of the cervical spine revealed a normal cervical spinal cord and mild cervical spondylosis. Therapy with pyridostigmine was initiated, and the patient was referred to this hospital for further evaluation. On presentation to this hospital, the patient reported that pyridostigmine had had no effect on his weakness or chronic diplopia but that his difficulty chewing had improved. However, 5 weeks after the initiation of treatment, the difficulty chewing had worsened despite continued therapy with pyridostigmine. The patient reported new weakness in the legs, with difficulty rising from a seated position. He also reported increasing frequency of the fasciculations and one fall at home. He had a history of hypertension, treated Lyme disease, psoriasis, and a traumatic compression fracture of the thoracic spine. Surgeries included cataract extractions and correction of a retinal detachment. He had no known allergies. Medications included pyridostigmine, hydrochlorothiazide, irbesartan, zolpidem, a multivitamin, and topical calcipotriene. He drank two alcoholic beverages weekly and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. There was no family history of neurologic disease. On examination at this hospital, the temperature was 36.4°C, the blood pressure 146/82 mm Hg, the pulse 66 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 22.7. The patient’s mental status was normal. Cranial-nerve testing revealed exo-phoria with upgaze that was present in both eyes but was most prominent on the right side. There was slightly reduced and slowed elevation of the eyebrows and mild weakness on eye closure and cheek inflation. Tongue movements were quick but weak with attempted opposition in the cheek. Lingual dysarthria was observed. There was reduced bulk of the temporalis, periscapular, pectoralis, quadriceps, and intrinsic hand muscles. Diffuse fasciculations were ob-served in the face, tongue, trunk, quadriceps, and arms. Some fasciculations were forceful enough to result in movement of the fingers. Mild weakness was noted in the intrinsic hand muscles and proximal muscles of the arms and legs. Deep-tendon reflexes were asymmetrically brisk in the arms and normal in the legs. The plantar responses were flexor. Sensation, coordination, and gait were normal. Gynecomastia was present. The remainder of the examination was normal. The creatine kinase level was 498 U per liter (reference range, 60 to 400), and results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal. Serum testing for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 antibodies and p24 antigen was negative. A diagnostic test was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,35,nejm-case-2012-35,"A 69-Year-Old Chronically Ill Man with Weakness, Anorexia, and Diffuse Pain","Dr. Yin Ge (Medicine): A 69-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus, heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, and renal transplantation was admitted to this hospital because of increasing weakness, malaise, anorexia, diffuse pain, and a history of falling. Twenty months before this admission, renal transplantation was performed because of renal failure caused by diabetic and hypertensive nephrosclerosis; a myocardial infarction occurred intraoperatively. Immunosuppression was begun with the administration of antithymocyte globulin, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone. The next month, coronary-artery bypass grafting of three vessels was performed for unstable angina. During the next 18 months, the patient was admitted to this hospital multiple times for recurrent sternal osteomyelitis; cultures were positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Candida tropicalis, and 3 months before admission, coagulase-negative staphylococcus. Treatment included antimicrobial agents, surgical débridement, and chest-wall reconstruction. Thirteen months before this admission, testing of the blood for BK virus nucleic acids was positive. Two months later, worsening renal failure and congestive heart failure occurred. Pathological examination of a biopsy specimen of the allograft kidney showed glomerulitis, with mononuclear cells, scattered neutrophils, and swollen endothelial cells; there were also dilated peritubular capillaries containing mononuclear cells, plasma cells, and occasional neutrophils. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed widespread, intense staining of the peritubular capillaries for C4d; the results were thought to represent acute cellular and humoral rejection. Plasma-pheresis was performed, and methylprednisolone, immune globulin, and rituximab were administered. Five months before admission, increasing fatigue, anorexia, and failure to thrive developed. The patient had recurrent fevers and chills and felt cold, all in association with sternal and central-catheter infections. During this time, he saw numerous physicians, including generalists and specialists; however, his condition continued to deteriorate. The results of testing 8 weeks before admission are shown in Table 1. Increasing fatigue and diffuse weakness that was worse in the legs developed 6.5 weeks before admission. The patient tripped, hit his head, and lacerated his parietal scalp on the right side; the results of computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed at another hospital, were reportedly normal. During the remaining weeks before this admission, chronic pain and anorexia worsened, associated with weight loss of 9.1 kg. The patient reported pain in the lower abdomen, constipation, nausea with recurrent retching, and decreased urination, and he required increasing narcotic analgesia. One week before admission, he had difficulty arising from bed and fell several times. Four days before admission, he saw his primary care physician for pain, weakness, and anorexia. The blood pressure was 112/70 mm Hg and the pulse 70 beats per minute. The physician prescribed megestrol acetate for anorexia. According to the patient’s wife, he had had constipation, a depressed mood, and hair loss for the past several months. The day before this presentation, his wife noted slurred speech and increasing somnolence. Diabetes mellitus had been diagnosed 16 years earlier. The patient also had hypertension, hyper-cholesterolemia, hyperkalemia, peripheral vascular disease (for which angioplasty of the left superficialfemoral artery and bilateral stent placements in the common iliac arteries had been performed), and prostatic hypertrophy. Medications on admission included tacrolimus (0.5 mg daily), mycophe-nolate mofetil (250 mg twice daily), prednisone (5 mg daily), fluconazole, simvastatin, amlodipine, carvedilol, isosorbide mononitrate, acetylsalicylic acid, acetaminophen, furosemide, fentanyl patch, tamsulosin hydrochloride, omeprazole, insulin, fludrocortisone (prescribed 9 months earlier for hyperkalemia), megestrol acetate, polyethylene glycol, zinc sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, ferrous sulfate, narcotic analgesia, trimethoprim–sulfa-methoxazole, stool softeners, and fluticasone by inhalation. He lived with his wife and was retired. He drank alcohol in moderation until this recent illness and had stopped smoking 7 years earlier; he had not used illicit drugs. His mother had had diabetes mellitus and died at 81 years of age of throat cancer; his father died at 80 years of age of prostate cancer. On examination, the patient was somnolent but arousable. The blood pressure was 93/45 mm Hg, the pulse 43 beats per minute and regular, the temperature 36.0°C, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Trace ery-thema over the inferior sternal incision and a healing laceration over the right parietal scalp were noted. There were minimal crackles in the lung fields and diffuse muscle wasting; the remainder of the examination was normal, although the neu-rologic examination was limited owing to the patient’s decreased ability to concentrate. The platelet count and the activated partial-thromboplastin time were normal, as were blood levels of calcium, total and direct bilirubin, as-partate and alanine aminotransferase, amylase, lipase, and lactic acid. The tacrolimus level was 7.0 ng per milliliter; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed a pH of 5.0 and a specific gravity greater than 1.030; the results were otherwise normal. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 44 beats per minute (decreased from 64 beats per minute 5 weeks earlier), with a PR interval of 200 msec, a QRS complex of 88 msec, and QT and QTc intervals of 517 and 442 msec, respectively; new nonspecific T-wave abnormalities appeared in leads V1, V2, and V3 as compared with 5 weeks earlier. A chest radiograph showed mild interstitial pulmonary edema, with surgical clips in the mediastinum and a tortuous aorta with atherosclerotic calcification. CT of the head without the administration of contrast material revealed periventricular and subcortical mi-croangiopathic changes and atherosclerosis in the carotid siphons, with no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass lesion, or territorial infarct. Ultrasonography of the transplanted kidney revealed resistive indexes of the arcuate arteries throughout the kidney of 0.84 to 1.00 (normal range, 0.6 to 0.7), which were increased as compared with a study from 5 months previously, which showed indexes of 0.74 to 0.83; these findings suggested the possibility of transplant rejection. Within 80 minutes after arrival, the patient’s blood pressure decreased to 83/35 mm Hg and the pulse to 40 beats per minute. Normal saline (4 liters intravenously within the first 6 hours), vancomycin, cefepime, fluconazole, and methyl-prednisolone were administered. Hypotension and bradycardia persisted. Calcium gluconate, atropine, dopamine (followed by norepinephrine), vaso-pressin, glucagon, and ondansetron were added. Screening of the blood for toxins revealed the presence of dextromethorphan, methylpredniso-lone, and amlodipine. The patient was admitted to the coronary intensive care unit (ICU). Cipro-floxacin, metronidazole, sodium bicarbonate, calcium gluconate, insulin, and glucose were administered intravenously. Anuria occurred, despite bumetanide challenge, and continuous venove-nous hemofiltration was begun. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 64% and an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 68 mm Hg, which were unchanged from a previous study. Regional wall-motion abnormalities seen on the previous study were improved. Cultures of the blood and urine were obtained. Diagnostic tests were performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,08,nejm-case-2010-08,A 22-Year-Old Woman with Hypercalcemia and a Pelvic Mass,"A 22-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of hypercalcemia and a pelvic mass. The patient had been well until 1 month before admission, when abdominal pain developed, initially in the right lower quadrant; during the following 3 weeks, the pain increased in severity, involved the entire abdomen, and radiated to the back. Two weeks before admission, she noted abdominal fullness. A home pregnancy test was negative. During the same interval, increased thirst, fatigue, and anorexia developed, and she had a weight loss of 2.3 kg. Two days before admission, nausea and vomiting developed. The night before admission, multiple episodes of nocturia occurred. On the day of admission, she went to the emergency department of another hospital. The patient reported increasing abdominal fullness without increasing girth. She had chronic constipation (bowel movements once per week), which was unchanged. She did not have fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, vaginal bleeding or discharge, or pain with intercourse. The physical examination was normal. Levels of serum protein, albumin, total bilirubin, and lipase and tests of renal and liver function were normal; urinalysis was consistent with contamination, and a screening pregnancy test was negative. Other test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 70 beats per minute and a shortened QT interval and was otherwise normal. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed a complex cystic mass in the right adnexa, 16.7 cm by 13.4 cm by 13 cm, which displaced the uterus posteriorly and to the left. The mass contained peripheral solid components along the left lateral and inferior wall, which showed slight progressive enhancement on delayed-phase images, and central fluid density representing either cyst fluid or necrotic tissue. There was no calcification or tissue with the density of fat within the mass. The left ovary measured 3.2 cm by 1.8 cm. The right ureter passed posteriorly to the mass, and no ureteral obstruction was seen; the urinary bladder was normal. Zoledronic acid, ondansetron, and fluids were administered intravenously; results of repeat laboratory tests are in Table 1. The patient was transferred to this hospital. Menarche had occurred at the age of 13 years; the patient’s menstrual cycles were regular and of 4 days’ duration. Her most recent menses had begun 23 days earlier, and flow was slightly lighter than normal. She had had an abnormal Papanico-laou smear 3 years earlier; colposcopy and cryosurgery were performed, and subsequent studies had reportedly been normal. She was sexually active with one male partner and had not used contraception for 8 months. She took no medications and was allergic to amoxicillin and penicillin. She lived with her partner, worked in an office, was a vegetarian, and did not smoke, drink, or use illicit drugs. Her parents and siblings were healthy. There was no family history of cancer. On examination, the temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 117/63 mm Hg, the pulse 78 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft, with no tenderness, rebound, or guarding; a mass (13 cm in diameter) was palpated in the midline. The remainder of the examination was normal. Levels of protein, albumin, globulin, total and direct bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase and tests of renal and liver function were normal. Other results of laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Furosemide, magnesium sulfate, potassium phosphate, and potassium chloride were administered intravenously, and magnesium hydroxide was given orally. Laboratory-test results are given in Table 1. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2020,01,nejm-case-2020-01,An 11-Year-Old Boy with Vomiting and Weight Loss,"Dr. Jenna R. Lillemoe (Pediatrics): An 11-year-old boy was seen in the emergency department of this hospital because of ongoing vomiting and weight loss. One month before this presentation, the patient was evaluated by his primary care pediatrician because of nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, and weight loss. The patient and his parents reported that these symptoms had begun approximately 3 months earlier and had worsened during the past 3 weeks. The nausea and vomiting occurred in the early morning, abated later in the day, and were exacerbated by stress. The patient also reported fatigue and an intermittent sensation of regurgitation and burning in the throat. He had begun treatment with lansoprazole 5 days earlier, with no decrease in symptoms. On examination, the weight was 36.4 kg (37th percentile) and the height was 148.6 cm (58th percentile); at a visit to the primary care clinic 11 months earlier, the weight had been 40.5 kg (78th percentile) and the height had been 143.5 cm (62nd percentile). The abdomen was soft, with normal bowel sounds and without tenderness or masses. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Omeprazole was prescribed, and the patient was referred to a pediatric gastroenterologist and a pediatric psychologist at this hospital. On presentation to the pediatric gastroenterology clinic of this hospital (3 weeks before this presentation), the patient reported that the nausea and vomiting had decreased slightly after he had begun treatment with omeprazole, and then the symptoms had worsened. The vomitus was nonbloody and nonbilious. He had normal bowel movements, without blood, two or three times each day. The patient was a twin and had been born by cesarean section at 36 weeks of gestation. During infancy, he had had gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) that was treated with ranitidine, omeprazole, and lansoprazole. He had been admitted to a local hospital because of bronchiolitis at 15 months of age, after which he had occasional episodes of wheezing. When the patient was 5 years of age, decreased appetite, weight loss, and episodes of vomiting preceded by sore throat developed, and he was evaluated by a pediatric gastroenterolo-gist at another hospital. At that time, an upper gastrointestinal series, performed after the administration of barium contrast, was normal. Tests for IgA and tissue transglutaminase IgA and IgG were negative. Lansoprazole and an anti-reflux diet were prescribed, and the symptoms resolved over a period of approximately 2 months, after which the proton-pump inhibitor was discontinued. When the patient was 6 years of age, he was referred to a pediatric nephrologist at the other hospital because of hypertension. Renal ultra-sonography was normal, and the results of ambulatory blood-pressure monitoring suggested the “white coat” effect (i.e., blood pressure elevated only in a clinical setting). The patient also had seasonal allergies, red–green color blindness, and a history of speech delay and retractile testes. At a visit to the primary care clinic when the patient was 9 years old, his body-mass index had been in the overweight range. One year before the current presentation, he had had a Salter– Harris type 2 fracture of the left fifth finger. The patient had been receiving omeprazole and had no known allergies to medications; immunizations were up to date. He lived with his parents and twin sister in a suburban area of New England. At school, he did well academically and participated in sports. He had recently been preparing intensively for a private-school entrance examination. His father had type 1 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and a paternal uncle had hypothyroidism. The results of the abdominal and general physical examinations were unchanged from those obtained at the primary care clinic, and an external rectal examination was normal. The dose of omeprazole was increased, and the patient was advised to keep a food and symptom diary and follow up with a psychologist. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnostic test was performed. Eight days after presentation in the pediatric gastroenterology clinic of this hospital (13 days before this presentation), the patient’s father called the clinic to report worsening of the patient’s vomiting, weight loss, and fatigue; the patient also seemed to be breathing heavily at times and reported dizziness when walking. Ondansetron was prescribed by telephone and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was scheduled for the next morning. Dr. Maureen M. Leonard: The next day, the patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy. The esophagus, stomach, and small intestine were visualized. The esophagus appeared normal. The gastric body also appeared normal; however, the gastric antrum was erythematous, which suggested the presence of inflammation. The second part of the duodenum had diffuse, moderate indentations of the circular folds (valves of Kerckring) that were described as moderately scalloped mucosa. Biopsy specimens of the distal esophagus, gastric antrum, and duodenum were obtained for histopathological examination. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Lillemoe: Eleven days after the esophago-gastroduodenoscopy, syncope occurred when the patient got up from bed in the early morning to use the bathroom. His parents called the gas-troenterologist, who recommended evaluation in the emergency department at this hospital. On arrival at the emergency department, the patient reported that the nausea and vomiting had not decreased, that his fatigue had progressively worsened, and that he felt weak. He had recently returned from a beach vacation in the southeastern United States, where he had used sunscreen and an umbrella for sun protection. On examination, the patient was alert, interactive, and appeared thin. The temperature was 36.8°C, the pulse 87 beats per minute, the blood pressure 108/55 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 33.7 kg (20th percentile). The oral mucous membranes were dry. On examination of the abdomen, mild tenderness of the left upper quadrant was noted. The skin was markedly tan, most notably on light- exposed areas, including the face. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was admitted to the hospital, additional diagnostic tests were performed, and a diagnosis was made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2011,25,nejm-case-2011-25,A 62-Year-Old Woman with Anemia and Paraspinal Masses,"Dr. Elizabeth L. Courville (Pathology): A 62-year-old woman was seen in the outpatient cancer center of this hospital because of anemia and paraspinal masses. The patient was in her usual state of health, with a history of asthma, until 8 months before this evaluation, when exertional dyspnea, shortness of breath, and fatigue developed. She went to the emergency department at another hospital. A chest radiograph reportedly showed a paraspinal mass in the right lower thorax. Two months later, a repeat chest radiograph showed clear lung fields; the paraspinal mass was unchanged. The next week, computed tomography (CT) of the chest reportedly revealed a well-marginated paraspinal mass (3 cm by 5 cm by 5 cm) on the right, extending from the T9 vertebral body to the T11, with no extension into or widening of the neural foramina and no expansion or cortical erosion of the ribs or vertebral bodies. There was also a mass (1.2 cm in diameter) adjacent to the right posterior eighth rib and another mass (1.0 cm in diameter) adjacent to the left posterior ninth rib. Two weeks later, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thoracic spine after the administration of gadolinium reportedly showed a paraspinal mass (3 cm by 5 cm) on the right, extending from T9 to T11, with a heterogeneous pattern and mild enhancement. The mass had no effect on the neural foramina, caused no expansion of the ribs or vertebral bodies, and had no evidence of signal suppression on fat-suppressed sequences to suggest the presence of fat. Six weeks later, 3 months before this evaluation, the patient was seen in follow-up by her internist. The vital signs and examination were normal; laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. The following week, a percutaneous, CT-guided needle biopsy of a right paravertebral mass was performed at another hospital; pathological examination of the tissue revealed maturing myeloid and erythroid precursors and megakaryocytes, features consistent with extramedullary hematopoiesis (myeloid metaplasia). Seventeen days before this evaluation, the patient was evaluated by a hematologist at another hospital. Serum levels of electrolytes, glucose, and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, as were tests of renal and liver function. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed moderate hypochromia, microcytosis, and anisocytosis and occasional elliptocytes, schistocytes, teardrop red cells, and polychromatophilic red cells; other test results are shown in Table 1. Additional test results were pending. On evaluation in the hematology clinic of this hospital, the patient reported occasional mild dys-pnea on exertion and no fevers, chills, or night sweats, no diarrhea, and no sinopulmonary infections. Her appetite was normal, and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 1 (symptomatic but ambulatory and working) on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0 is normal and 5 signifies death. She had arthritis in the left knee and asthma and had had a lung biopsy in the past for unclear reasons; examination of the biopsy specimen reportedly showed no abnormalities. Medications in the recent past included albuterol and ipratropium metered-dose inhalers, tramadol hydrochloride, and iron supplements; she had no known allergies. She was born in Cambodia, lived in the northeastern United States with her daughter, and worked in a health-related field. She had stopped smoking cigarettes 15 years earlier, drank alcohol in moderation, and did not use illicit drugs. Two sisters had died of heart disease; there was no family history of hematologic cancer. On examination, the patient appeared well, without respiratory distress. The weight was 63.5 kg, the temperature 36.1°C, the blood pressure 122/68 mm Hg, the pulse 85 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. There were occasional expiratory wheezes, without rales or rhonchi. The spleen tip was palpated approximately 12 cm below the left costal margin, and there was no hepa-tomegaly. The remainder of the examination was normal. Serum levels of electrolytes, glucose, protein, albumin, globulin, calcium, magnesium, and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, as were results of tests of coagulation, renal function, and liver function. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear showed features similar to those of the earlier specimen; other test results are shown in Table 1. Later that day, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were performed. Pathological examination of the core-biopsy specimen revealed a normocellular marrow for the patient’s age (overall cellularity of approximately 40%), with erythroid hyperplasia and marked dyserythropoiesis. Megakaryocytes were normal in number and morphology. There were no morphologic abnormalities in the granulocytic series. Reticulin deposition was not increased. Storage iron was present, and there were no ring sideroblasts. Flow cytometry showed normal B cells and T cells and no increase in myeloid blasts. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a normal female karyotype (46,XX). A diagnostic-test result was received.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2008,13,nejm-case-2008-13,A 46-Year-Old Man with Rheumatoid Arthritis and Lymphadenopathy,"Viviany Taqueti (Harvard Medical School): A 46-year-old man was seen in the hema-tology–oncology clinic of a cancer center affiliated with this hospital because of anorexia and generalized lymphadenopathy. The patient had a history of rheumatoid arthritis but had been otherwise well until 1 month earlier, when diffuse lymphadenopathy gradually developed in his neck, axillae, and groin, associated with sore throat and loss of appetite but not with weight loss. Approximately 1 week before this evaluation, fatigue, nausea, bloating, loose stools, and a cough productive of white sputum developed. On examination by his primary care physician 5 days before this evaluation, the patient’s blood pressure was 118/70 mm Hg, the pulse 108 beats per minute, the temperature 37.3°C, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. White lesions were present laterally on the tongue, and there were enlarged, tender lymph nodes, up to 2 cm in diameter, in the right submandibular, bilateral anterior cervical, left posterior cervical, and both axillary regions. The remainder of the examination was normal. The results of laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Oral nystatin was prescribed. The patient returned the next day, with wheezing and purulent nasal discharge; on examination, there was tenderness over the maxillary sinuses and serous effusions behind the tympanic membranes. The lymphadenopa-thy had decreased slightly. The chest was clear on auscultation. A chest radiograph revealed prominence of the pulmonary hila and superior mediastinum, suggestive of lymphadenopathy, and biapical pleural thickening and bibasilar parenchymal scarring that were unchanged from a study 16 months earlier. Treatment with levofloxacin was begun. The next day, computed tomographic (CT) scanning of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis after the intravenous administration of contrast material showed enlarged lymph nodes, ranging from 5 mm to 2.5 cm in diameter, in the bilateral supracla-vicular, axillary, hilar, internal and external iliac, and inguinal regions; the medias-tinum; and the retroperitoneum. Some of the axillary lymph nodes contained lucent centers, suggesting necrosis. There was basilar and biapical pulmonary fibrosis, and two subpleural pulmonary nodules on the right side, each 9 mm in diameter, were evident. A rounded density, 2.5 cm in diameter, was present posterior to the stomach, and the colonic wall was thickened. The patient was referred to a hematologist–oncologist. The patient reported no shortness of breath or chest pain. Rheumatoid arthritis had been diagnosed 31/2 years earlier, manifested as morning stiffness, joint pain, and swelling mostly in the hands and feet, decreased range of motion in the hips and lumbar spine, and positive serologic tests (Table 1). At the age of 18 years, the patient had pain and swelling in the right elbow and both ankles; juvenile rheumatoid arthritis was diagnosed. The symptoms resolved spontaneously when the patient was in his early 20s. A diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis was also mentioned to him, but he did not recall back pain, iritis, aphthous ulcers, dysuria, or rash. At the age of 32 years, an enlarged spleen (measuring 19 cm in length by ultrasonography) had been found incidentally during evaluation for acute cholecysti-tis; splenectomy and cholecystectomy were performed. On pathological examination, the spleen weighed 400 g, with fibrocongestive changes and reactive lymphoid hyperplasia. Pathological examination of a biopsy specimen of the bone marrow showed no abnormalities. Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis were controlled with prednisone, methotrexate, folic acid, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications, and leflunomide. Nineteen months before this evaluation, cutaneous lesions had developed on sun-exposed areas; examination of a biopsy specimen showed changes consistent with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Methotrexate was discontinued, and hydroxychloroquine was added; the skin lesions resolved. One year before this evaluation, corticosteroids were discontinued because of recurrent oral candidiasis. Routine laboratory monitoring revealed fluctuating and intermittently low leukocyte counts (Table 1). Three months before this evaluation, the patient had been referred to the hematolo-gist–oncologist for evaluation of neutropenia. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed Howell–Jolly bodies; test results for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis A, B, and C viruses were negative; serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, protein, and albumin and tests of liver and renal function were normal; other laboratory-test results from this earlier evaluation are shown in Table 1. Flow-cytometric analysis of peripheral-blood lymphocytes was normal. A scan of the liver and spleen showed no evidence of an accessory spleen. The neutropenia was thought to be related to the patient’s medications, and he was advised to discuss possible changes in therapy with his rheumatol-ogist. The patient had occasional gastroesophageal reflux that was relieved by pantoprazole. A tonsillectomy had been performed in childhood. He had no drug allergies. He had received pneumo-coccal vaccine after the splenectomy. He was married, had been monogamous with his wife for more than a decade, and did not smoke or drink alcohol. He worked as a painter and had not traveled recently. There was no family history of autoimmune disease or hematologic cancer. Medications included hydroxychloroquine, lefluno-mide, meloxicam, pantoprazole, folic acid, and levofloxacin; he had never received tumor necrosis factor antagonists. On examination, the blood pressure was 120/60 mm Hg, and the weight 68.2 kg. There were enlarged, mobile, nontender lymph nodes in the cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, and inguinal regions, which were larger on the left side than on the right; an axillary node on the left side was 4 cm in diameter. The remainder of the examination was normal. The prothrombin time, partial-thromboplastin time, and test results for lupus anticoagulant were normal. One week later, a diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,19,nejm-case-2012-19,A Premature Newborn Boy with Respiratory Distress,"A newborn boy was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of this hospital because of respiratory distress. The patient was born at a gestational age of 29 weeks at another hospital by cesarean section for breech presentation, premature labor, and rupture of membranes of approximately 2 hours’ duration. He weighed 1275 g and appeared vigorous, with spontaneous respirations; the 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores were 7 and 9, respectively. Shortly thereafter, subcostal retractions developed. Analysis of umbilical arterial blood revealed a pH of 7.35, a partial pressure of oxygen of 47 mm Hg, and a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 22 mm Hg. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was administered, and he was transferred to the nursery. The temperature was 37.2°C under radiant heat, the blood pressure 58/44 mm Hg, the pulse 119 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94 to 96% while the patient was breathing 50% oxygen with CPAP; the blood glucose level was 72 mg per deciliter (4.0 mmol per liter). Transfer to this hospital was arranged; 1 hour after birth, the MassGeneral Hospital for Children NICU transport team arrived at the other hospital. On examination, the patient was nondysmorphic and the skin was pink and well perfused. There were moderate subcostal retractions, shallow respirations, and bronchial breath sounds that were slightly diminished in intensity; the remainder of the examination was normal for the gestational age. The trachea was intubated and assisted ventilation was begun; oxygen was administered to maintain hemoglobin saturation levels in the mid-90s percentage range. Proper position of the endotracheal tube was confirmed with the use of radiography. The blood glucose level decreased to 34 mg per deciliter (1.9 mmol per liter). A peripheral intravenous catheter was placed, and an infusion of 10% glucose was begun; the glucose level rose to 134 mg per deciliter (7.4 mmol per liter). He was transported by ambulance to this hospital and admitted to the NICU. The patient’s mother was 24 years of age, gravida 4, para 1 to 2, with a history of intravenous drug abuse, hepatitis C virus infection, and bipolar disorder; 6 months earlier she had had a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus skin infection. She had received regular prenatal care and lived in a shelter. Medications during pregnancy included methadone, clonazepam, clonidine, and iron supplements. The maternal blood type was A, Rh-positive, with negative antibody screening. Prenatal testing for hepatitis C virus antibody was positive; testing for syphilis, the human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, and gono-coccal and chlamydial infections was negative. The newborn had a healthy half-sibling; there was no family history of genetic abnormalities. On examination in the NICU, the patient’s temperature was 37.6°C, the blood pressure 60/30 mm Hg, the pulse 174 beats per minute (normal, 80 to 180), and the respiratory rate 56 breaths per minute (normal, 30 to 60). He attempted to cry around the endotracheal tube; breath sounds were decreased bilaterally. Heart sounds were normal, without murmurs; the extremities were warm and well perfused; testes were in the inguinal canals; the skin was ruddy and thin, with visible veins; no plantar creases were present; and there was no breast tissue. He moved all extremities, with resting posture in extension; the remainder of the examination was normal for his gestational age. Blood levels of phosphorus, magnesium, total and direct biliru-bin, and creatinine were normal, as was the anion gap; other results are shown in Table 1. Chest radiographs showed diffuse, fine granular opacities and mild perihilar linear opacities bilaterally, features thought to be consistent with the respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn. Surfactant, caffeine, ampicillin, and gentamicin were administered. An umbilical venous catheter was placed. On the patient’s second day of life, the neonatal abstinence syndrome developed (characterized by tremors, agitation, poor sleeping, and frantic behavior); screening of the urine for illicit drugs was negative. Morphine was administered, resulting in improvement. Radiographs showed improvement in the pulmonary opacities. The trachea was extubated, and nasal CPAP was administered transiently. Results of testing conducted by the Massachusetts newborn screening program were normal. Culture of blood drawn on admission was sterile, and the administration of antibiotic agents was stopped. During the patient’s third day of life, when he was still in the NICU, a systolic ejection murmur was heard, respiratory distress recurred, and respiratory acidosis developed (Table 1). The trachea was reintubated, and a radiograph showed changes consistent with pulmonary edema and an increase in the size of the cardiac silhouette. Echocardiography revealed normal cardiac structures, normal ventricular function and thickness (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF], 69%), a patent ductus arteriosus (2.3 mm) with left-to-right shunting, estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 55 mm Hg with systemic systolic pressure of 58 mm Hg, a patent foramen ovale, and no pericardial effusion. The administration of ampicillin and gentamicin was restarted, and ibuprofen was added. Feedings of pasteurized human milk, administered by ga-vage, were started. Ultrasonography of the brain revealed grade 1 hemorrhage into the germinal matrix bilaterally, with normal brain parenchy-ma. The patient’s respiratory status improved, clinical evidence of the patent ductus arteriosus resolved, and the trachea was extubated on the patient’s fifth day of life. On the sixth day of life, the patient’s work of breathing increased suddenly and mottled skin developed; the trachea was reintubated, and stress doses of hydrocortisone, oxacillin, gentamicin, and intravenous saline were administered. Echo-cardiography revealed a small, concentric pericar-dial effusion, no evidence of tamponade, markedly thickened ventricular walls, near obliteration of right and left ventricular cavities, and underfill-ing of both ventricles; biventricular systolic function was preserved (LVEF, 61%). A radiograph showed increased opacification of the lungs. Hy-potension and oxygen desaturation to 70% occurred. Dopamine, morphine, midazolam, vanco-mycin, normal saline, sodium bicarbonate, red cells, increased oxygen supplementation, and high-frequency oscillator ventilation were administered. Nitric oxide was administered, and oxygen saturation rose transiently to 86%, followed by worsening hypoxemia, anuria, and bradycardia. The neonate’s mother was informed and came to the NICU; she requested the presence of the hospital chaplain, who arrived shortly thereafter. Epinephrine was administered and positive-pressure ventilation and chest compressions were begun. However, refractory asystole developed, and the patient died early on his seventh day of life. An autopsy was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,24,nejm-case-2010-24,A 56-Year-Old Woman with a History of Hodgkin’s Lymphoma and Sudden Onset of Dyspnea and Shock,"Dr. Karen M. Winkfield (Radiation Oncology): A 56-year-old woman with a history of childhood Hodgkin’s lymphoma was admitted to the emergency department of this hospital because of the sudden onset of dyspnea and hypotension. The patient had been in her usual state of health until approximately 2 hours before arrival, when, during an airplane flight home from a vacation in the Caribbean, she reported shortness of breath and pain in the left arm. She lost consciousness and possibly had a seizure. She awoke spontaneously and reported continued dyspnea. She was given aspirin. When she arrived at the airport, emergency medical services personnel found her awake and cyanotic; oxygen was administered by face mask, and she was transported to this hospital. On arrival in the emergency department, she reported shortness of breath. She reported no chest, arm, back, or abdominal pain and no nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, or upper respiratory symptoms. A diagnosis of Hodgkin’s lymphoma had been made when the patient presented to this hospital at 16 years of age with an 8-month history of cough; physical examination revealed a mass of cervical and supraclavicular lymph nodes, 7 cm in diameter, on the left side, and chest radiographs revealed bilateral paratracheal, left hilar, and subcarinal lymphadenopathy, with compression of the left main-stem bronchus. Pathological examination of a specimen from a supraclavicular lymph-node biopsy revealed the nodular-sclerosis type of Hodgkin’s lymphoma. A bipedal lymphangiogram showed enlarged lymph nodes, with filling defects, in the left para-aortic region, features consistent with involvement by Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and an enlarged spleen. Staging laparotomy was aborted because of excessive bleeding from the incision site. The clinical stage was III AS (involvement of lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm, including the spleen, without systemic symptoms). Radiation therapy (a total of 38 Gy) was administered from a 2-MeV van de Graaff accelerator to a mantle field (mediastinal, pectoral, cervical, supraclavicular, and axillary lymph nodes) during a period of 25 days. This was followed by six cycles of chemotherapy with mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) and radiation (36 Gy) to the para-aortic lymph nodes and spleen. At the completion of therapy, there was no residual lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly, and the patient reported feeling well. Follow-up radiographs showed mediastinal widening and perihilar fibrosis, with the size of the heart at the lower limits of normal. The patient was monitored annually thereafter by her oncologist; chest imaging was unchanged and laboratory-test results, including tests of thyroid function, were normal. At 32 years of age, while she was pregnant, a 3-cm nodule on her left scapula was excised; pathological examination revealed a spindle-cell sarcoma. Imaging studies showed no evidence of metastatic disease. Reex-cision revealed no residual tumor, and no further treatment was given. After delivery of the baby, hypothyroidism was diagnosed in the patient and treated with levothyroxine. She reported occasional episodes of atypical chest pain; a cardiac stress test at 38 years of age was normal. Annual screening mammograms beginning at 35 years of age were normal. At 40 years of age, atrophy of the muscles of the upper back was noted, with prominence of the spine. The patient had intermittent arthralgias; waxing and waning skin lesions on her limbs, abdomen, and back that were thought to be morphea or atrophoderma; and frequent epigastric discomfort, with a sensation of gurgling in her chest when recumbent. At 46 years of age, the patient was admitted to this hospital because of shortness of breath. Imaging studies showed a left pleural effusion. Cardiac ultrasonography showed thickening of the aortic-valve leaflets, without stenosis or regurgitation. Cytologic examination of pleural fluid revealed inflammatory cells. The antinuclear-antibody titer was 1:640; testing for antibodies to double-stranded DNA, Jo-1, La, Ro, Sm, Scl-70, and RNP was negative. Pathological examination of a biopsy specimen of the pleura revealed chronic inflammation and fibrosis. The patient’s symptoms improved gradually without treatment, but the pleural effusion persisted. Pulmonary-function tests showed a gradual decrease in function: when the patient was 51 years of age, the forced expiratory volume in 1 second was 36% of the predicted value, the vital capacity 48%, the total lung capacity 64%, and the carbon monoxide diffusing capacity 67%. Echocardiograms obtained when the patient was between 46 and 55 years of age showed increasing thickening of aortic-valve and mitral-valve leaflets, with restriction of motion and mild insufficiency. Two cardiac stress tests showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia. Mild hypertension and hyperlipidemia developed. When the patient was 53 years of age, bilateral carotid bruits were noted. Carotid ultrasonog-raphy revealed no stenosis of the internal carotid arteries. At 54 years of age, she was readmitted to the hospital because of pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, and worsening pleural effusions, which required thoracentesis and placement of a chest tube. A cardiac stress test was nondiagnostic. Cardiac catheterization showed calcification of the aortic valve; aortic stenosis (mean aortic-valve pressure gradient, 23 mm Hg; valve area, 0.9 cm2); a right-dominant coronary-artery system, with 50% stenosis in the proximal third of the left anterior descending coronary artery, 40% steno-sis in the proximal left circumflex coronary artery, and 60% stenosis in the proximal right coronary artery; normal left ventricular contraction, with an ejection fraction of 0.73; and a pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure of 22 mm Hg. Treatment with prednisone (60 mg daily, followed by a slow taper, ending 2 months before this admission), furosemide, and metoprolol was begun. At 55 years of age, the patient was admitted for episodes of aspiration pneumonia; a barium-swallow examination showed severe esophageal dys-motility, with reflux to the clavicles. Omeprazole was begun. Seven months before this admission, screening mammography showed calcifications in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an enhancing lesion in the same area. Examination of an excisional-biopsy specimen revealed ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Examination of specimens from a bilateral simple mastectomy and right sentinel-lymph-node biopsy revealed no residual carcinoma and no lymph-node metastases. The patient had never smoked; she drank alcohol socially, lived with her husband, and was a social worker. She was physically active and exercised regularly, although her exercising had been limited recently by shortness of breath; her body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 23.3 (normal range, 18.5 to 25.0). Medications included levothyroxine, metoprolol, furosemide, omepra-zole, simvastatin, and acetylsalicylic acid. On examination in the emergency department, the patient was alert, oriented, and uncomfortable, with perioral and acral cyanosis. The blood pressure could not be measured; the body temperature was 36°C, the heart rate 40 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing 100% oxygen by means of a face mask. The breath sounds were coarse, and the heart sounds were normal, with no murmurs. An electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads, a feature consistent with an acute inferior myocardial infarction, and third-degree atrioventricular block with a ventricular rate of 40 beats per minute. A chest radiograph was unchanged from 5 months earlier. The pH of a specimen of arterial blood was 6.83 (reference range, 7.35 to 7.45), the partial pressure of oxygen 156 mm Hg, and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide 43 mm Hg. External cardiac pacing resulted in improvement in the heart rate and blood pressure, but shortly thereafter bradycardic cardiac arrest occurred. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, resulting in a return of the pulse and a systolic blood pressure of 60 mm Hg while the patient was being treated with pressors. Emergency cardiac catheterization revealed 85% steno-sis of the proximal right coronary artery and 70% stenosis of the middle segment. Stents were placed, with no residual stenosis. A ventricular pacing wire and intraaortic balloon pump were placed. The patient was transferred to the coronary intensive care unit. Acidosis and hypoten-sion persisted despite increasing doses of pres-sors, and she died 5 hours after arrival. An autopsy was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2011,09,nejm-case-2011-09,A 37-Year-Old Man with Flushing and Hypotension,"Dr. Leana S. Wen (Emergency Medicine): A 37-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of flushing and hypotension. That morning, sneezing, rhinorrhea, scratchy throat, and subjective fever had developed. After lunch, he took an over-the-counter cold preparation that included acetylsalicylic acid, dextromethorphan hy-drobromide, and phenylephrine bitartrate. Thirty minutes later, fatigue, weakness, nausea, epigastric pain, facial flushing, and “beefy red” ears developed, accompanied by two episodes of nonbloody emesis. Light-headedness, diaphoresis, and near-syncope developed. He was caught by a coworker as he fell to the ground, without head trauma or loss of consciousness. Emergency medical services were called. On evaluation, his skin was flushed; the systolic blood pressure was 50 mm Hg, the pulse 56 beats per minute and regular, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing supplemental oxygen by means of a nonrebreather face mask. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus bra-dycardia with T-wave inversions. Ondansetron and normal saline were administered intravenously. He was transported to the emergency department at this hospital. On arrival, the patient reported pleuritic chest pain and worsening diffuse abdominal discomfort. He had had multiple similar episodes during the previous 12 years, with flushing, conjunctival injection, vomiting, and diarrhea. These episodes had increased in frequency in the past year, from approximately twice a year to once every 2 months. The symptoms, which were usually provoked by physical exertion, mental stress, or intense emotion, lasted up to 12 hours and were followed by weakness of 3 to 4 days’ duration. Evaluations at other hospitals had shown systolic pressures as low as 60 mm Hg. The episodes were attributed to dehydration and stress, and they were treated with intravenous normal saline (≤5 liters). The patient had no other illnesses and no known allergies to medications and took no other medications. Kiwifruit had caused throat constriction and vomiting. He worked in a health-related field and participated in triathlons. He drank alcohol occasionally, had smoked in the past, and did not use illicit drugs or over-the-counter herbal preparations. There were no recent exposures to ill persons, seafood, or unusual foods. He was of mixed European and Caribbean ancestry. There was no family history of renal disease, anaphylaxis, or rheuma-tologic diseases. On examination, the patient was alert and oriented. The temperature was 36.2°C (over the temporal artery), the blood pressure 57/33 mm Hg, the pulse up to 116 beats per minute and irregular, the respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while he was breathing 4 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula. There was scleral injection and diffuse blanching erythema over the upper body; the extremities were warm and well perfused, with normal capillary refill. The examination was otherwise normal. Levels of sodium, chloride, carbon dioxide, D-dimer, magnesium, amylase, lipase, creatine kinase MB isoenzymes, and troponin T; tests of liver function; the activated partial-thromboplas-tin time; and the red-cell indexes were normal. Screening for troponin I and serum toxins was negative. The results of other laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. An ECG showed atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 102 beats per minute, with ST-segment elevations (2 mm, convex) in leads aVR and V1 and downsloping ST-segment depressions (3 to 4 mm) in leads I, II, III, aVF, and V3 through V6 (Fig. 1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Normal saline was transfused rapidly through two peripheral intravenous catheters, and 325 mg of aspirin was administered. The patient then had increased flushing. Fifty minutes after his arrival, the blood pressure was 140/81 mm Hg. A chest radiograph showed low lung volumes with interstitial prominence and was otherwise normal. During the next 7 hours, the temperature rose to 38.1°C and abdominal pain increased, with tenderness in the upper abdomen. Normal saline, potassium chloride, magnesium sulfate, ondan-setron, and metoclopramide were administered intravenously, and his nausea transiently improved. Urinalysis showed yellow clear urine, with trace ketones, trace urobilinogen, 1+ biliru-bin, and 2+ albumin, with 20 to 50 white cells (reference range, 0 to 2) and a few squamous cells (reference range, no cells) per high-power field. There were more than 100 hyaline casts (reference range, 0 to 5) and 10 to 20 granular casts (reference range, none) and mucin per low-power field. The urinalysis was otherwise nor-mal. The oxygen saturation increased to 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Eight hours after the patient’s arrival, an ECG showed sinus rhythm, at 100 beats per minute, and no ST-segment depressions (Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Appendix. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous and oral contrast material showed hypodense lesions in the liver and spleen that were consistent with hemangiomas; the study was otherwise normal. Ciprofloxacin was begun. He was admitted to the cardiac telemetry unit. The temperature rose to 39.4°C, systolic blood pressure decreased to 80 to 90 mm Hg, oxygen saturation decreased to 89% while he was breathing ambient air, and vomiting occurred. Oxygen supplementation (4 liters) was restarted, and he was transferred to the medical intensive care unit. Two hours later (18 hours after the patient’s arrival at the hospital), the systolic blood pressure decreased to 75 mm Hg. Diphenhydramine, ranitidine, phenylephrine, hydrocortisone, epinephrine, acetaminophen, vancomycin, ceftriax-one, and oseltamivir were administered. Trans-thoracic echocardiography showed an estimated ejection fraction of 76%, a mildly dilated right ventricle, right ventricular hypertrophy with normal right ventricular function, right atrial dilatation, trace mitral regurgitation, trace pulmonary insufficiency, and findings consistent with mild pulmonary-valve stenosis. Examination of a blood smear showed no malarial forms, and testing for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus and Borrelia burgdorferi, a nasal swab for influenza virus types A and B, and stool specimens for white cells, ova and parasites, rotavirus, and Clostridium difficile toxin were negative. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and tests of thyroid function were normal; other results are shown in Table 1. Hypo-tension resolved within 2 hours, and phenyleph-rine was discontinued. The patient was transferred to the medical floor on the third day. During the next 3 days, tests for antinuclear antibodies, hepatitis viruses (A, B, and C), and Helicobacter pylori were negative, cultures of specimens of blood and urine remained sterile, and a stool culture grew normal enteric flora. Antibiotics were discontinued. Abdominal ultrasonog-raphy showed two lesions consistent with hem-angiomas in the liver and nonspecific thickening of the gallbladder wall. On the sixth day, a test result was received.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,32,nejm-case-2010-32,A Pregnant Woman with Abdominal Pain and Fluid in the Peritoneal Cavity,"Dr. Kevin M. Elias (Obstetrics and Gynecology): A 28-year-old primigravida was admitted to the labor and delivery suite of this hospital at 34 weeks 4 days of gestation because of abdominal pain and fluid in the peritoneal cavity. On the morning of admission, abdominal pain developed suddenly; it was sharp, constant, and associated with nausea but not vomiting. Emergency medical services personnel were called, and the patient was taken by ambulance to the emergency department of another hospital. She rated the pain at 10 on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain; it increased with movement and when she was in the supine position, and it radiated to the right flank. She reported noting normal fetal movements earlier that day, and she had no vaginal bleeding or contractions. A bowel movement the day before had been normal. On examination, the temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 119/71 mm Hg, the pulse 119 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute. The abdomen was soft and diffusely tender, particularly on the right side, with no organomegaly; there was minimal peripheral edema. A limited pelvic examination revealed no uterine contractions; the cervix was dilated 2 cm and was 60% effaced, with a reactive fetal heart-rate tracing. Serum levels of total bilirubin, total protein, albumin, amylase, and alanine and aspartate aminotransferases were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. The blood type was O, Rh-negative, and screening for antibodies was notable for passive Rh immunization. Ultrasonography of the abdomen and uterus revealed a moderate amount of maternal peritoneal fluid and a small pleural effusion on the left side; the gallbladder appeared normal, without ductal dilatation. The fetus was in cephalic presentation, with a biophysical profile score of 8/8 (indicating fetal well-being), an amniotic-fluid index of 20 (a sonographic assessment of amniotic-fluid volume that is on the cusp of polyhydramnios; normal range, 8 to 18), normal umbilical-artery Doppler flow velocimetry, and a heart rate of 138 beats per minute. The patient was transferred to this hospital, arriving approximately 8 hours after the onset of symptoms. Seven weeks before admission, an episode of pleuritic chest pain had occurred, lasting approximately 10 hours. The patient went to another hospital; evaluation reportedly revealed aortic insufficiency and possible pulmonary emboli. Low-molec-ular-weight heparin was administered for 10 days. Five weeks before admission, pleuritic chest pain recurred, and the patient came to the emergency department at this hospital. An echocardiogram showed trace aortic insufficiency and was otherwise normal, computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed no evidence of a pulmonary em-bolus, and an ultrasound study was negative for deep venous thrombosis. Heparin therapy was discontinued, and the patient was discharged. Prenatal care was begun at this hospital 1 month before admission. The patient had asthma, for which she used inhalers. She also took prenatal vitamins; Rho(D) immune globulin had been administered 4 weeks earlier. She had had an appendectomy as a child. She was immune to varicella and rubella; testing for syphilis, hepatitis B surface antigen, and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was negative, and the hemoglobin electrophoresis was normal. She had no known allergies to medications. She had been born in a Caribbean country and had lived with an aunt in the Boston area for several years and was unemployed; the father of the baby was working in their native country. She did not drink alcohol, smoke, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had died of cervical cancer, and her father and siblings were healthy; there was no family history of blood clots. On examination, she appeared uncomfortable and in severe pain. The temperature was 37.8°C, the pulse 120 beats per minute, the blood pressure 112/70 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was gravid and soft, with hyperactive bowel sounds. There was voluntary guarding, with diffuse tenderness to palpation and percussion. Pain was most severe in the right lower quadrant, where it was intermittently associated with rebound tenderness. There were no uterine contractions. The estimated fetal weight was 2400 g. The remainder of the examination was normal. There was no blood in the stool. Results of tests of coagulation and renal function were normal, as were levels of glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, total and direct bilirubin, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, lactate dehydrogenase, amylase, and lipase; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed protein (1+) and ketones (3+) and was otherwise normal. A chest radiograph that was limited because of lordosis and low lung volumes showed subsegmental atelectasis in the lung bases and no evidence of free air in the upper abdomen. Ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed normal ovaries and a moderate amount of peritoneal fluid, some of which was in Morison’s pouch. Morphine was administered for pain. The patient was admitted to the labor and delivery suite. Approximately 5 hours after arrival, uterine contractions began to occur every 2 to 3 minutes. Abdominal pain and tenderness on the right side persisted. The patient intermittently vomited clear fluid. Penicillin G was administered intravenously because the status of group B streptococcus was unknown. Oxytocin and epidural anesthesia were begun early in the morning of the second hospital day (9 hours after arrival); the abdominal pain decreased but persisted. Later that day, an episode of hemoptysis (approximately 20 ml) occurred. The level of thyrotropin was normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Approximately 23 hours after the onset of labor, a female infant was born by spontaneous vaginal delivery, weighing 2570 g, with 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores of 5 and 8, respectively. The placenta was expressed intact, and a first-degree perineal laceration was repaired; the estimated blood loss was 300 ml. After the epidural anesthesia was discontinued, the abdominal pain transiently increased in severity and then improved. On the third hospital day (postpartum day 1), the pain was improved, although the patient continued to report mild diffuse abdominal discomfort, without nausea or vomiting. The temperature was normal, the blood pressure 139/81 mm Hg, and the pulse 117 beats per minute. Bowel sounds were normal and the abdomen was soft, with tenderness in the right lower quadrant and no guarding or rebound. After the oral and intravenous administration of contrast material, CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis showed minimal bi-basilar linear atelectasis; minimal fluid around a nondistended gallbladder (without gallstones); an enlarged, heterogeneous, and hypervascular postpartum uterus; and a moderate amount of free intraperitoneal fluid, with a density of 60 Hounsfield units in Morison’s pouch, that inter-digitated between multiple loops of bowel and within the pelvis, with no evidence of free air. A repeat chest radiograph showed subsegmental atelectasis in the lower lobe of the left lung. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. On the morning of postpartum day 2, the patient felt well and was without pain. The vital signs were normal, and the abdomen was soft and nontender, with a firm uterine fundus palpated at the umbilicus. A purified protein derivative skin test for tuberculosis, applied 48 hours earlier, was negative. At 1:25 p.m., severe abdominal pain (rated at 10 out of 10) developed suddenly. The blood pressure was initially 120/70 mm Hg, with a pulse of 120 beats per minute; the abdomen was diffusely tender, with rebound and guarding. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. During the next 90 minutes, the blood pressure ranged from 105 to 119 mm Hg systolic and 60 to 70 mm Hg diastolic, and then the systolic pressure fell to 70 to 80. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

Bartley (Pediatrics): A 22-year-old woman was seen in the pediatric pulmonary clinic of this hospital because of chest pain, cough, and dyspnea on exertion. The patient had been well until she was 2 months of age, when an episode of bronchiolitis occurred. After this episode, repeated respiratory illnesses characterized by wheezing and cyanosis developed, and she was hospitalized frequently. The patient was subsequently evaluated by a pediatric pulmonologist at this hospital. Examination revealed decreased breath sounds at the apex of the right lung, and chest radiography revealed findings suggestive of congenital lobar emphysema of the right upper lobe. A blood test for alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency was negative. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed right ventricular dilatation and hypertrophy, mild pulmonary arterial hypertension, and a small patent ductus arteriosus. When the patient was 24 months of age, a right upper lobectomy, coil emboliza-tion for the patent ductus arteriosus, and a biopsy of the right middle lobe were performed. Dr. Mari Mino-Kenudson: Histopathological examination of lung specimens revealed lobar emphysema of the right upper and middle lobes that was characterized by the presence of fewer alveoli than the number typically seen in normal lung tissue and hyperinflation of the existing alveoli (Fig. 1A). The number of bronchioles in the peripheral emphysematous areas was disproportionately low relative to the number of pulmonary vessels, and the central bronchi had mucus plugs that may have obliterated the bronchial lumens (Fig. 1B). In the hilum, the central bronchi had mucus plugs that resulted in partial obstruction of the bronchial lumens, but the amount and contour of the bronchial cartilage were normal (Fig. 1C). No diagnostic findings were consistent with pulmonary hypertension. There are two possible causes of lobar emphysema in this case: obstruction (either ","{'Emphysematous Obstructive Lung Disease': [], 'Primary Lung Diseases': [], 'Childhood Interstitial Lung Diseases': [], 'Immunodeficiency Syndromes': [], 'Autoimmune Disorders': [], 'Connective-Tissue Disorders': []}",Mutation in the gene encoding filamin A (FLNA). ,Interstitial lung disease associated with FLNA mutation. ,Interstitial lung disease associated with FLNA mutation. ,0

Martin (Medicine): A 52-year-old man was transferred to this hospital for evaluation and treatment of hypoxemia. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 7 days before transfer to this hospital, when nonproductive cough and intermittent fever with temperatures of up to 38.2°C developed. During the subsequent 4 days, these symptoms persisted and were accompanied by malaise, mild anorexia, weakness, and exertional dyspnea. He had no chest pain, palpitations, antecedent respiratory symptoms, rashes, joint symptoms, or weight loss. The administration of dextromethorphan and acetaminophen did not improve symptoms. On the morning before transfer to this hospital, dyspnea occurred with minimal exertion. The patient presented to a local urgent care clinic, where the heart rate was 113 beats per minute and the oxygen saturation was 91% while he was breathing ambient air. He was referred to the emergency department at a local hospital for further evaluation. On presentation to the other hospital, the temperature was 37.6°C, the heart rate 115 beats per minute, the blood pressure 126/83 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 90% while the patient was breathing ambient air and then increased to 93% while he was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. No jugular venous distention or increased work of breathing was reported. Auscultation of the chest revealed rhonchi and occasional wheezes on the right side and a prominent systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border. The remainder of the examination was normal. The N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide level was 4850 pg per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 900), the d-dimer level 2487 ng per milliliter (reference range, <244), and the lactate dehydrogenase level 458 U per liter (reference range, 110 to 210); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cultures of the blood were obtained. Dr. Milena Petranović: Initial posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs (Fig. 1A and 1B) showed markedly asymmetric lung opacities located predominantly in the central portion of the right upper lobe. Dr. Rajeev Malhotra: An electrocardiogram (Fig. 2A) showed sinus tachycardia with left axis deviation, left atrial abnormality, early R-wave progression, and ST-segment depressions in the anterior leads. Bedside ultrasonographic examination of the heart revealed a hyperdynamic left ventricle. Dr. Martin: Ceftriaxone, azithromycin, aspirin, atorvastatin, and intravenous normal saline were administered, and the administration of supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula was continued. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the other hospital. That afternoon, 5 hours after presentation to the other hospital, hypoxemia worsened; the oxygen saturation was 86% while the patient was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute, and the respiratory rate was 34 breaths per minute. The levels improved after the administration of additional supplemental oxygen; the oxygen saturation increased to 92% while he was receiving oxygen through a nonrebreather face mask at a rate of 15 liters per minute and then increased to 100% while he was receiving oxygen through a high-flow nasal cannula at a rate of 60 liters per minute (fraction of inspired oxygen [Fio 2], 1.0), and the respiratory rate decreased to 28 breaths per minute. Dr. Petranović: A portable chest radiograph (Fig. 1C) showed persistent asymmetric lung opacities. Also seen were new septal lines, increased thickening of the right minor fissure, and increased perihilar haziness. Dr. Martin: Eight hours after presentation to the other hospital, worsening shortness of breath developed, along with diaphoresis. On examination, the temperature was 37.7°C, the heart rate 146 beats per minute, the blood pressure 150/76 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 46 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 88% while he was receiving oxygen through a non-rebreather face mask (Fio2, 1.0). Rapid antigen testing for influenza types A and B was negative. A trial of noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation was performed, but respiratory distress persisted. The trachea was intubated, and copious frothy secretions were noted. Mechanical pressure-control ventilation was initiated (inspi-ratory pressure, 15 cm of water; positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP], 10 cm of water; Fio 2, 1.0; respiratory rate, 14 breaths per minute; peak inspiratory pressure, 31 cm of water). Propofol was administered. Hypoxemia persisted despite the use of mechanical ventilation, deep suctioning, and recruitment maneuvers; paralysis with an infusion of cisatracurium was begun. Flexible bronchoscopy revealed a normal-appearing airway with pink frothy secretions, without purulent exudates or bleeding; bronchial washings and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were obtained for microbiologic testing. A central venous catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein; the central venous pressure was not recorded. Dr. Malhotra: A repeat electrocardiogram (Fig. 2B) showed sinus tachycardia with left axis deviation and moderate improvement in the previously observed ST-segment depressions in the anterior leads. Dr. Martin: Glucocorticoids and intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin, trimethoprim– sulfamethoxazole, and furosemide were administered. On serial arterial blood gas analyses performed over a 12-hour period, the patient had a pH as low as 7.11, a partial pressure of oxygen of 45 to 74 mm Hg, an oxygen saturation of 86 to 89% while he was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator (Fio2, 1.0), and persistent tachycardia at a rate of 120 to 150 beats per minute. Early the following morning, he was transferred by ambulance to the ICU of this hospital. On presentation to this hospital, additional information was obtained from the patient’s partner. The patient had a history of hyperlipid-emia, hypertension, benign prostatic hypertrophy, and hemorrhoids. He had undergone tonsillectomy but no other surgeries. His outpatient medications included atorvastatin, hydrochloro-thiazide, inhaled fluticasone, and hydrocortisone rectal cream, but he had not been taking any medications regularly. He had no known allergies to medications. His father had died of a myocardial infarction at 61 years of age, and two paternal uncles had also died of coronary artery disease, one in the fifth decade and one in the sixth decade. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. He had a long-term male partner but was not sexually active. He worked at a university. He had traveled to Washington, D.C., the week before presentation. On examination, the temperature was 36.7°C, the heart rate 98 beats per minute, the blood pressure 116/77 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 93% while the patient was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator (tidal volume, 420 ml; PEEP, 15 cm of water; Fio 2, 1.0; respiratory rate, 28 breaths per minute; plateau pressure, 26 cm of water). The central venous pressure ranged from 12 to 15 cm of water. Auscultation of the chest revealed regular heart sounds, a systolic murmur (grade 3/6) that was best heard at the right upper sternal border, and scant rales and rhonchi bilaterally. The arms and legs were warm, without edema; faint areas of livedo re-ticularis were noted, but no rashes were seen. The remainder of the examination was normal. Tests for Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigens in the urine were negative, as were polymerase-chain-reaction tests for influenza types A and B and respiratory syn-cytial virus in BAL samples. Tests for adenovirus and parainfluenza virus antigens in the sputum and human immunodeficiency virus p24 antigen and antibodies in the blood were negative. Gram’s staining of the BAL samples revealed few neutrophils and no organisms. The C-reactive protein level was 333.0 mg per liter (reference range, <8.0); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Malhotra: An electrocardiogram (Fig. 2C) showed normal sinus rhythm with early R-wave progression and resolution of the previously observed ST-segment depressions. Dr. Petranović: A portable chest radiograph (Fig. 1D) showed increased perivascular haziness diffusely, with a more widespread distribution of the previously seen opacities, which remained most dense in the right upper lobe. There was also new blunting of the left costophrenic angle. The endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, esophageal temperature probe, and central venous catheter were in the appropriate positions. Dr. Martin: When the patient had arrived at this hospital, the ventilator mode had been switched to volume-controlled ventilation for lung protection, and the PEEP increased. The dose of cisatracurium was increased, and an intravenous hydromorphone infusion was started to optimize patient–ventilator synchrony. Four hours after arrival, the administration of inhaled nitric oxide was initiated. Eight hours after arrival, the Fio2 was decreased from 1.0 to 0.4. Diagnostic tests were performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2009,23,nejm-case-2009-23,"A 13-Year-Old Boy with Headache, Nausea, Seizures, and Hypertension","A 13-year-old boy was admitted to the hospital because of headache, nausea, seizures, renal failure, and hypertension. The patient had been well until approximately 3 weeks earlier, when intermittent left-sided headaches and fatigue developed, followed by nasal congestion and anorexia. He began to nap daily after school. During the week before admission, nausea and vomiting occurred approximately every other day. Five days before admission, facial and periorbital swelling developed. He saw his primary care physician. A test for streptococcal pharyngitis was reportedly negative; amoxicillin was prescribed for presumed sinusitis. He continued to feel unwell and was not as energetic as usual, although he was able to play lacrosse 3 days before admission. He reported constipation and mild epigastric and periumbilical abdominal pain, he vomited intermittently, and he slept much of the day. On the morning of admission, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain developed while the patient was at school. At 11:15 a.m., his mother took him to the doctor’s office. Blood was drawn for laboratory tests, and he was sent to another hospital for a radiograph of his abdomen. En route to the car, at approximately noon, he reported numbness of the right leg and dizziness, and he became disoriented, with difficulty walking and coordinating his legs, but with no clear weakness; the episode lasted 5 minutes. During the car ride, he returned to his baseline mental status; numbness of the right leg persisted. At the hospital, radiography was performed, laboratory-test results revealed azotemia, and he was referred to the emergency department of another hospital. He began vomiting. On examination in the emergency department, the patient was awake, oriented, and vomiting intermittently. The blood pressure was 170/120 mm Hg, the pulse 63 beats per minute, the temperature 37°C, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air, and the weight 45.5 kg. The skin was pale and facial edema was present; the remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Screening tests for mononucleosis and hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Labetalol and ondansetron were administered, and the blood pressure decreased to 132/83 mm Hg. Computed tomography (CT) of the head showed a small, ill-defined focus of decreased density in the right parietal region and no other evidence of focal or diffuse lesions, hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, or focal bone lesions. After the CT scan, at approximately 3 p.m. and 4 p.m., he had two episodes of blank staring, one associated with incontinence, without shaking or body movement. After the episodes, he was somnolent but oriented. His mental status returned to normal after he slept. There was minimal urine output. He was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit of this hospital. He did not have sore throat, rash, arthralgias, arthritis, myalgias, photosensitivity, epistaxis, he-moptysis, shortness of breath, hematuria, or fever. He had been born via vaginal delivery after a full-term gestation. At 3 weeks of age, he required surgery for pyloric stenosis. One year before admission, on routine examination, the blood pressure was 100/70 mm Hg and pubertal development had begun. He had received all immunizations and took no medications. He had no al-lergies. He lived with his parents and brothers, who were healthy. Both grandfathers had had prostate cancer, and there was a family history of migraine headaches. There was no family history of an autoimmune disorder. On examination, the patient was intermittently somnolent but arousable and oriented. The weight was 45 kg and the blood pressure ranged between 150/60 and 170/115 mm Hg; the pulse was 80 beats per minute, the temperature 36.5°C, the respiratory rate between 10 and 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93 to 98% while he was breathing ambient air. The physical examination was unchanged. Laboratory-test results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Specimens of blood and urine were cultured. The electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with no peaked T waves. CT images from the other hospital were reviewed, and they were thought to show asymmetric ventricles, with the occipital horn of the lateral ventricle larger on the left side than on the right, a prominent temporal horn, and a normal third ventricle, and no evidence of acute stroke or hemorrhage. Radiographs of the chest and abdomen revealed increased perihilar markings with a butterfly pattern of vasculature suggestive of mild congestive heart failure and a moderate amount of stool in the colon with a nonobstructive gas pattern; they were otherwise normal. Analysis of the urine sediment by a nephrolo-gist revealed red-cell, mixed-cellular, granular, and waxy casts. An arterial catheter was inserted, and a continuous intravenous infusion of nitro-prusside was begun, with a goal of systolic pressures below 140 mm Hg. Labetalol and ondanse-tron were continued, and hydralazine, calcium gluconate, insulin, and dextrose were given intravenously. Emergency hemodialysis was per-formed. Fluid was restricted to 1 liter per day, and methylprednisolone and ranitidine were begun. Mannitol, midazolam, and fentanyl citrate were added. Magnesium was administered as needed to maintain a level greater than 1.0 mmol per liter. Indirect immunofluorescence testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) and anti–glomerular basement membrane antibodies was negative. On the second hospital day, tests for lupus anticoagulant were negative, and levels of IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies were normal. Ultrasonography of the kidney revealed mildly increased echogenicity of the renal parenchyma, most marked in the upper pole of the left kidney, moderate free fluid in the pelvis, and no hydro-nephrosis or solid-appearing mass lesions. The right kidney was 9.4 cm in length and the left kidney 10.3 cm in length. Cultures of the blood and urine were sterile. On the third day, analysis of a specimen of urine revealed a protein level of 27,280 mg per liter (reference range, 0 to 135) and a creatinine level of 2.3 mg per milliliter (20,332 μmol per liter). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed areas of increased T2-weighted signal intensity in the subcortical white matter in the frontal, parietal, and occipital regions, with a predominantly normal signal on diffusion-weighted imaging. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,04,nejm-case-2012-04,"A 37-Year-Old Man with Muscle Pain, Weakness, and Weight Loss","Dr. Ian J. Barbash (Medicine): A 37-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of muscle pain and weakness. The patient had been well until the evening before admission, when mild diffuse myalgias developed. He awoke in the morning with diffuse muscle cramps and intense pain in his legs (he rated the pain at 10 on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain). On arising to go to the bathroom, he felt unsteady and had difficulty walking. After he returned to bed, diffuse muscle pain persisted, with weakness in his arms and legs and numbness in his legs; he was unable to arise again. He called family members and was brought to the emergency department at this hospital. The patient reported that he had had similar but much less severe pain intermittently for the past month, not associated with weakness and primarily in his upper thighs, after prolonged periods of rest. The pain occurred several times a week, most often at night, occasionally awakened him, and resolved spontaneously after a few minutes. He reported weight loss of 3.2 kg during the previous month, occasional blurred vision during the previous year, intermittent left wrist pain, and a slight tremor. Six weeks before admission, he had fever, sore throat, and decreased appetite; a chest radiograph revealed patchy opacities in the upper lobe of the right lung, features consistent with possible pneumonia; his symptoms improved after azithromycin was administered. A diagnosis of gynecomastia had been made approximately 3 months earlier, when he presented with left breast tenderness and a palpable mass (4 cm by 3.5 cm) under the areola; mammography subsequently revealed bilateral subareolar densities (greater on the left breast than on the right breast) that were consistent with gynecomastia. The patient also had androgenetic alopecia and seborrheic dermatitis. He reportedly had been treated for tuberculosis 17 years earlier. His diet was high in carbohydrates; he reported eating 10 slices of pizza for dinner the night before admission. Medications included finasteride and clobetasol shampoo. He had no known allergies. He was born in Colombia, had lived in the United States for about 17 years, and had visited Colombia 6 months before admission. He drank alcohol infrequently, did not smoke or use illicit drugs, and reported no paint sniffing or exposure to toluene. He lived with his brother, worked in a restaurant, was single, and had been sexually active in the past, with women only. His mother had had diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia and died of bladder cancer, his father had hypertension, and a cousin and a niece had thyroid disease; the patient was not sure of the exact diagnoses. There was no history of autoimmune disease. On examination, the blood pressure was 166/72 mm Hg, the pulse 100 beats per minute, the temperature 37.3°C, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air, and the weight 66.2 kg. The patient was unable to stand; strength in the muscles of flexion and extension measured 3 out of 5 at the hips and knees and 4 out of 5 at the ankles and elbows. Hand grip measured 4+ out of 5. Ankle, knee, and brachio-radialis reflexes were absent. The remainder of the examination was normal. Results of a complete blood count were normal, as were blood levels of urea nitrogen, calcium, magnesium, total protein, albumin, globulin, total and direct bilirubin, creatine kinase, and aspartate aminotransferase. Serum toxicologic screening was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 96 beats per minute, with nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes. A urinalysis was normal. Potassium chloride (120 mmol, total) was administered orally and intravenously, with resolution of weakness. An intravenous catheter was placed in the internal jugular vein. A chest radio-graph was normal. Test results of urine solutes and osmolality, from a specimen obtained 3.5 hours after presentation, are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to the hospital.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,39,nejm-case-2010-39,"A 19-Year-Old Woman with Nausea, Jaundice, and Pruritus","Dr. Kerry L. Massman (Medicine): A 19-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of nausea, jaundice, and pruritus. The patient had been well until approximately 2.5 weeks earlier, when malaise, vomiting, and upper respiratory symptoms developed, which resolved after 3 days. Approximately 1 week before admission, pruritus and dark urine developed. She noted darkening of her skin, which she attributed to sun exposure. Three days later, for a headache, she reportedly took three doses of oxycodone–acetamino-phen that she received from a friend, pseudoephedrine, and tablets containing a combination of acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine. Three days before admission, her mother brought her to the emergency department at another hospital because of increasing discoloration of her eyes and skin. She reported generalized malaise, decreased appetite, and a weight loss of approximately 3 kg during the previous month. She did not have diarrhea or abdominal pain. On examination, the vital signs were normal, and the conjunctivae and skin were icteric; the remainder of the examination was normal. Results of a complete blood count, a differential count, and renal-function tests were normal, as were plasma levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, and albumin. The total protein level was 8.2 g per deciliter (reference range, 6.0 to 8.0); other results are shown in Table 1. The patient was advised to avoid alcohol and over-the-counter medications, and she was discharged with a follow-up appointment at a medical clinic 2 days later. The next day, an episode of abdominal pain occurred. At the follow-up appointment the day after that, the patient reported increasing pruritus and nausea. Testing for acute Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection was negative, and a complete blood count, a differential count, and plasma levels of amylase, lipase, protein, and ammonia were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed orange, cloudy urine, with a pH of 6.0, a specific gravity of 1.020, 3+ bilirubin, 2+ blood, 1+ protein, and trace amounts of glucose, ketones, and leukocytes. Urinalysis also revealed positive nitrites, 2+ squamous cells, and 5 to 10 white cells and 2 to 5 red cells per high-power field, with occasional bacteria; the urobilinogen level was normal. An ultrasonogram of the abdomen showed chole-lithiasis, a thickened gallbladder wall, and a normal-appearing liver and common bile duct. A specimen of urine was cultured. The patient was sent to this hospital, arriving shortly after midnight, and was admitted. Three months earlier, the patient had given birth to a healthy child by spontaneous vaginal delivery after an uncomplicated, full-term gestation. She breast-fed for 2 months. Prenatal testing for hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were reportedly negative, and the patient was not informed of any abnormal liver-function tests during pregnancy. She had migraines, for which she took pseudoephedrine and a tablet containing a combination of acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine as needed. She had had an abnormal Papanicolaou smear, for which she was scheduled to undergo colposcopy. Eighteen months earlier, she had undergone body piercing at a reputable shop; she had never received a blood transfusion. She had not recently traveled outside New England. She took no other medications, did not take herbal supplements, and had no known allergies to medications. She lived with her child and boyfriend in a rural area and had stopped working early in her pregnancy. She smoked cigarettes, drank alcohol rarely, and did not use intravenous drugs or eat wild mushrooms. She had had no industrial exposures, recent contacts with ill persons, or trauma. She was of mixed European ancestry. Her paternal grandmother had died of Laënnec’s cirrhosis, her paternal grandfather had died of lung cancer, and maternal relatives had type 2 diabetes mellitus and asthma; there was no other history of liver disease. On examination, the patient was awake, alert, and oriented. The blood pressure was 143/83 mm Hg; other vital signs were normal. There was marked conjunctival icterus, and the skin was yellow, with no spider angiomas, palmar erythema, or telangiectasias. The abdomen was soft, without tenderness, distention, or organomegaly. Neurologic examination revealed normal speech and attention and no asterixis. The remainder of the examination was normal. Results of a complete blood count and differential count were normal, as were serum levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, amylase, lipase, and ceruloplasmin. Testing was negative for EBV DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigenemia, antibodies to HIV and HCV, and IgM antibodies to hepatitis A virus (HAV); other test results are shown in Table 1. Urine testing for pregnancy and a toxicology screen were negative. Urinalysis revealed orange, clear urine, with a pH of 6.5, a specific gravity of 1.010, 3+ bilirubin, 2+ blood, and 20 to 50 white cells and 0 to 2 red cells per high-power field; there were few bacteria and squamous cells and very few tubular cells per high-power field; and mucin was present. An electrocardiogram was normal. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed cholelithiasis, gallbladder-wall thickening, and no evidence of common bile duct dilatation, pericholecystic fluid, or so-nographic Murphy sign (the presence of maximal tenderness elicited over a sonographically localized gallbladder).

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2011,14,nejm-case-2011-14,A Woman with Asymmetric Sensory Loss and Paresthesias,"Dr. Sheila L. Arvikar (Medicine): A 52-year-old woman was seen in the neurology clinic at this hospital because of asymmetric sensory loss and paresthesias in both arms and legs as well as impaired dexterity. The patient had been well until 5 months earlier, when her hands and feet gradually began to feel as though they were wrapped tightly in bandages. This sensation was most prominent in the right hand and arm and the left foot and leg. Approximately 2.5 months before this evaluation, the patient noted difficulty with fine motor control and recognizing objects by feel in both hands. Several weeks later, a sensation of imbalance occurred when the patient closed her eyes in the shower. She began to feel unstable while walking, although she did not fall. At about this time, numbness and tingling developed in both hands and arms, and an intermittent shooting pain in the hands that had no clear provocation or alleviation also developed. The symptoms progressed proximally in the right arm and left leg and affected the left arm and right leg in a milder fashion. She noted stiffness in her hands that was worse in the morning but never resolved completely. She was unable to discern whether the stiffness was confined to the joints or located elsewhere in the hands. The symptoms increased in severity over the following weeks, and the patient had difficulty keeping her balance while dressing. She lost approximately 17 kg (37 lb) and saw a gastroenterologist. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed mild gastritis but was otherwise normal. Pathological examination of biopsy specimens of the stomach showed chronic gastritis; biopsy specimens of the antrum and the duodenum were normal. Chest radiography and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis were normal. A complete blood count, chemistry panel, and levels of serum electrolytes, thyrotropin, and C-reactive protein were normal. An antinuclear antibody (ANA)–based multiplex assay was positive (titer unknown), as was an assay for rheumatoid factor (381 IU per milliliter; normal value, <30). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 65 mm per hour (normal rate, <20), and the levels of vitamin B12 and carcinoembryonic antigen were normal. A test for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi was negative. The patient was referred to the neurology clinic at this hospital. She attributed her weight loss to a decreased appetite and difficulty feeding herself; she reported no fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, night sweats, diarrhea, or constipation. Three years before this evaluation, she had been evaluated by a neurologist at another facility because of episodes of numbness and tingling over the shoulders, extending up into the neck and below both breasts; these episodes lasted for weeks at a time. On the examination at that time, muscle strength, tendon reflexes, gait (including tandem gait), and coordination were normal. There was patchy loss of sensation of pinprick in the arms that did not conform to a dermatomal pattern and a loss of pinprick sensation on the back, from C2 to T6 on the right side and from T1 to C4 on the left. Sensation of light touch, joint position, and temperature was intact. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine with contrast medium was normal. No treatment was prescribed, and the symptoms resolved. The patient had had mild Raynaud’s phenomenon for years, with no digital ulceration. She was married, lived with her husband, and worked in an office. She had a 25-pack-year history of smoking but had stopped smoking 1 year earlier, drank alcohol in moderation, and reported no use of illicit drugs or exposures to metals, toxins, or large doses of vitamin supplements. Her mother was 83 years of age and had a history of diabetes and breast cancer. Her father had died from cardiac disease at 81 years of age. Her brother and sister had ulcerative colitis, and her sister had myasthenia gravis. There was no other family history of neurologic diseases. On examination, the patient was alert, cooperative, and articulate. The blood pressure was 100/75 mm Hg in a sitting position, the pulse 90 beats per minute and regular without orthostatic change, and the weight 57 kg (126 lb). Mood, memory, language, and cranial-nerve examinations were normal. There was very mild atrophy of the intrinsic muscles of both hands, without evidence of muscle atrophy or fasciculations elsewhere; muscle tone and strength were normal and symmetric. There was a subtle pronator drift of the right arm. The finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin tests were normal. Successive hand tapping on a table and finger tapping of the index finger on the interphalangeal joint of the thumb were both slightly slowed on the right side as compared with the left. The reflexes of the biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, and finger flexors were absent on the right side but 2+ on the left; patel-lar reflexes were 1+ on the right and absent on the left; ankle reflexes were absent bilaterally; and the plantar reflexes were flexor. The gait was normal, with a normal base. On Romberg examination, the patient swayed slightly, without faltering, and she reported feeling unsteady. She required support with tandem walking but was able to walk normally on both heels and toes. Her sense of vibration was severely diminished in the fingers and forearm on the right side, and less severely diminished on the left. The sense of joint position was severely impaired at the interphalangeal joint of the right thumb and was intact on the left. The sense of vibration was absent in the left great toe and trace in the right great toe, and it was severely reduced at the left ankle and nearly normal at the right ankle. She had difficulty identifying coins with either hand when her eyes were closed; this difficulty was more pronounced on the right side than the left. Pinprick sensation was diminished throughout the arms and legs but present on the trunk. Facial sensation of light touch and cold was normal. The nasal tickle was intact. Diagnostic tests were performed.

Baggett (Medicine): A 60-year-old woman presented to this hospital with altered mental status during the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The patient had been in her usual state of health until 1 week before admission, when cough and headache developed. One day before admission, vomiting and diarrhea developed. That day, the patient was last seen by her husband at 3:00 p.m. before she went to sleep. The husband reported that the patient awoke screaming at 1:00 a.m. on the day of admission, and emergency medical services (EMS) were called. When EMS personnel arrived, the patient was reportedly lethargic and unable to answer questions. The blood glucose level, obtained by fingerstick testing, was 60 mg per deciliter (3.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). Intravenous dextrose was administered. A repeat fingerstick glucose measurement was 127 mg per deciliter (7.0 mmol per liter), and the lethargy abated. The patient was brought by EMS personnel to the emergency department of this hospital. In the emergency department, the patient reported weakness on the left side of her body and persistent headache. She reported that when she had awoken at 1:00 a.m., she was unable to move or speak, was afraid she was going to die, and began screaming for help. She reported no aura, urinary or fecal incontinence, or neck pain. She had recently moved from Puerto Rico and lived in a suburb of Boston. She did not speak English and was marginally housed, sleeping in the living room of a friend’s apartment with her husband. Several people living in the apartment had had cough and fever. The patient had a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and schizophrenia. Medications included aspirin, glipizide, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and risperi-done. She had no known drug allergies. She drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. On examination, the temperature was 37.4°C, the blood pressure 114/62 mm Hg, the heart rate 94 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air; the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 30.5. The patient was alert and interactive. She was oriented to person and place but not to time. The cranial-nerve examination was normal. Strength in the left arm and left leg was 4/5, and strength in the right arm and right leg was 5/5. She had difficulty manipulating small objects placed in the left hand. The left arm showed pronator drift and orbiting. Sensation to light touch was intact. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Dr. R. Gilberto Gonzalez: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed 2 hours after presentation. Diffusion-weighted images showed a punctate focus of restricted diffusion within the posterior limb of the right internal capsule; no corresponding abnormality was observed on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images (Fig. 1A and 1B). A chest radiograph (Fig. 1C) obtained 2.5 hours after presentation showed a nodular focus in the left midlung field. Dr. Baggett: A test of a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was positive. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The results of urine toxicologic screening were normal. Treatment decisions were made, and the patient was admitted to the hospital.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,12,nejm-case-2012-12,A 10-Month-Old Girl with Vomiting and Episodes of Unresponsiveness,"Dr. Helen H. Yeung (Pediatrics): A 10-month-old girl was seen in the emergency department at this hospital because of vomiting and episodes of unresponsiveness. The patient had been well until 2 a.m. on the day of admission, when she awoke with vomiting that was associated with irritability and frequent crying. During the next 7 hours, her oral intake decreased and four episodes of vomiting occurred, with nonbilious, nonbloody emesis (including formula after feeding). Episodes of unresponsiveness, which were unrelated to the episodes of vomiting, also occurred. During these episodes, her eyes were either open or closed, her head dropped, and she became limp, slumping over if she had been sitting. These episodes did not cluster, and she initially returned to baseline neurologic functioning after each episode. After the fourth or fifth episode, she became increasingly difficult to arouse, and the duration of the episodes increased from 2 to 3 seconds initially up to 30 to 60 seconds. Acetaminophen was administered at 5 a.m., without improvement. The patient’s mother called the pediatrician’s office and was advised to go the hospital. Emergency medical services (EMS) personnel arrived at 9:01 a.m. The mother reported that the child had no recent illnesses, fever, or change in bowel habits or stool consistency or color. On examination by EMS personnel, the patient was awake but lethargic, and she was otherwise behaving appropriately for her age. She became agitated when her mother was not present, but was otherwise calm, without evidence of trauma. The pulse was 104 beats per minute, the respiration rate was 26 breaths per minute, and the lungs were clear. She was brought to the emergency department at this hospital at 9:20 a.m. She had no fever, chills, cough, diarrhea, rash, generalized tonic–clonic movements, twitching, eye rolling or deviation, pallor or cyanosis, known head or other trauma, or toxin exposure or ingestions. Her most recent wet diaper was at 4 a.m. She was born by spontaneous vaginal delivery at 38 weeks’ gestation; the pregnancy had been complicated by preeclampsia. The patient’s birth weight was 2.85 kg (13th percentile) and length 45.7 cm (6th percentile). She had no jaundice in the newborn period, passed a bowel movement on the first day of life, and was fed formula from birth. She was initially followed by early intervention specialists because of decreased responses to auditory stimuli, but this follow-up had been discontinued a few months earlier; she had met other developmental milestones. At age 3.4 months, a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease was made, and lansoprazole was ad-ministered for 3 months, with resolution of symptoms. Immunizations were reportedly up to date. She had no allergies. Her parents were from South America and had recently separated. She lived with her mother and stayed overnight with her father intermittently, where she had been at the onset of the current symptoms, and she attended day care. Her mother had a history of migraines associated with intermittent “blackouts”; there was no family history of gastrointestinal illnesses. The patient appeared somnolent and mildly difficult to arouse, and fussy, but consolable. The skin was pink, warm, and dry. The blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg, the pulse 135 beats per minute, the temperature 36.3°C, the respiratory rate 36 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. Neu-rologic examination revealed a sleeping infant who was difficult to arouse but, once awake, had no neurologic abnormalities; there was no evidence of trauma, and the remainder of the physical examination was normal. The hematocrit and levels of hemoglobin, glucose, magnesium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, globulin, and total and direct bilirubin were normal, as were tests of liver function; toxicology screening of the blood and urine was negative. Other results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.020 (reference range, 1.001 to 1.035), 1+ white cells and ketones, trace albumin, and rare transitional cells; mucin was present, and the examination was otherwise normal. Electrocardiograph-ic findings were normal. Fluids wereadministered intravenously; thereafter, she alternated between being alert, interactive, cooperative, and interested in toys and being torpid, fretful, and resistant. Approximately 1.5 hours after her arrival, radiographic assessment of the patient’s chest was normal. Electroencephalography showed no evidence of seizure activity, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was normal. Her mother reported an additional episode of altered mental status at the hospital, which was not witnessed by hospital staff. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2023,36,nejm-case-2023-36,A 19-Year-Old Man with Diabetes and Kidney Cysts,"Dr. Weizhen Tan: A 19-year-old man was evaluated in the nephrology clinic of this hospital because of kidney cysts. The patient had been well until 3 years before the current presentation, when diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and increased urinary frequency developed. The patient’s mother brought him to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported that he woke up 3 or 4 times each night to urinate. He also had weight loss, decreased appetite, and increased thirst. The temporal temperature was 36.9°C, the blood pressure 123/70 mm Hg, and the heart rate 65 beats per minute. The weight was 51.3 kg, the height 165 cm, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 18.8. The patient had dry skin; the remainder of the examination was normal. The blood glucose level was 780 mg per deciliter (43.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]), and the glycated hemoglobin level was 12.9% (reference range, 4.3 to 5.6). The blood creatinine level was 1.45 mg per deciliter (128 μmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 μmol per liter]). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was made. Insulin and intravenous fluids were administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. During the subsequent 3 days, treatment with a basal–bolus insulin regimen was established. Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, polyuria, and polydipsia resolved. On the fourth hospital day, the morning fasting blood glucose level was 162 mg per deciliter (9.0 mmol per liter), and the creatinine level was 1.33 mg per deciliter (118 μmol per liter). The patient was discharged home with instructions to continue treatment with insulin, and follow-up was arranged in the endocrinology clinic of another hospital. During the subsequent 2 years, the patient continued treatment with insulin. Tests for glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65), islet antigen 2 (IA-2), and insu-CME at NEJM.org lin autoantibodies were negative. One year before the current presentation, the patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital because of elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransfer-ase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) obtained by his primary care provider as part of an annual physical examination. In the gastroenterology clinic, the patient reported no symptoms, and the examination was normal. The blood AST level was 87 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 40), the ALT level 158 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 55), the ALP level 468 U per liter (reference range, 55 to 149), and the γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) level 1158 U per liter (reference range, 8 to 61). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Samantha G. Harrington: Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant (Fig. 1A) showed a normal-appearing gallbladder and common bile duct. The right kidney was partially visualized and had two cysts, measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter; the left kidney was not seen. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) (Fig. 1B and 1C) showed a normal-appearing liver, biliary system, and spleen. The pancreatic head and neck were smaller than expected, and the body and tail of the pancreas were absent. There were multiple bilateral simple kidney cysts, ranging in size from 2 to 18 mm. Dr. Tan: After these imaging studies were obtained, the patient did not return for scheduled follow-up in the gastroenterology clinic. One year later, and 1 week before the current presentation, the patient returned for follow-up. He had no symptoms, and the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The MRCP findings were unchanged from the previous evaluation. The patient was referred to the nephrology clinic of this hospital for evaluation of his kidney cysts. In the nephrology clinic, the patient reported that he felt well. He had had normal growth and development and had received all routine childhood vaccinations. Medications included insulin degludec and insulin lispro. There were no known drug allergies. He was a senior in high school and worked part-time at a restaurant. He lived in an apartment in a suburban area of New England with his mother and three siblings. He did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His father had prediabetes, obesity, and hypertension; his mother and three siblings were healthy. His paternal grandfather, maternal grandfather, and maternal great-grandfather had diabetes. The blood pressure was 124/66 mm Hg and the heart rate 76 beats per minute. The weight was 65.5 kg, the height 176 cm, and the BMI 21.2. The examination was normal. Analysis of a freshly voided urine specimen revealed 1+ pro-teinuria, 2+ glucosuria, and trace ketonuria. Microscopic examination showed one mixed granular cast per low-power field and scattered squamous epithelial cells. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Harrington: Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder showed increased renal parenchy-mal echogenicity and loss of corticomedullary differentiation in both kidneys. The kidney cysts that had been seen previously were present. Dr. Tan: A diagnostic test was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2011,02,nejm-case-2011-02,A 30-Year-Old Woman with Shock after Treatment of a Furuncle,"Dr. Ari Brettman (Medicine): A 30-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient had been well until 4 days before admission, when she slipped and fell in her home, after which she reported severe posterior thoracic pain that radiated to the anterior chest and lower back and did not respond to acetaminophen. Two days later, she went to an urgent care clinic affiliated with this hospital. She rated the pain at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain; she reported that the pain increased with movement and breathing. She reported mildly decreased appetite, without nausea, vomiting, or weakness. On examination, she appeared comfortable; the temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 102/59 mm Hg, the pulse 100 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while she was breathing ambient air. The thoracic paraspinal muscles were tender, with spasm; the remainder of the examination was normal. Radiographs of the chest and thoracic spine were normal. Ke-torolac tromethamine was administered intramuscularly. The patient went home, with instructions to return if the pain did not resolve. The next day, she went to another hospital because of persistent pain. Cyclobenzaprine and oxycodone with acetaminophen were prescribed, and she returned home. On the day of admission, at approximately 8:30 p.m., a friend found her at home, unresponsive and moaning. Emergency medical services personnel were called, and the patient was taken to the other hospital by ambulance. Naloxone was administered en route, with minimal response. On arrival in the emergency department, the patient was agitated and aphasic and responded to painful stimuli. The rectal temperature was 39.6°C, the blood pressure 113/53 mm Hg, the pulse 156 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 46 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 83% while she was breathing ambient air. The skin was gray, warm, and clammy, and there were small cutaneous vesicles on the forehead and abdomen. The neck was supple. The left pupil was 5 mm in diameter and the right pupil 4 mm, and both were minimally reactive. The breath sounds were decreased in intensity without adventitious sounds, the nail beds were cyanotic, and plantar reflexes were flexor. The remainder of the examination was normal. The administration of 15 liters of oxygen by means of a nonrebreather mask was begun, and acetaminophen was administered rectally. Toxicologic screening of the plasma revealed the presence of salicylates, and analysis of the urine revealed opiates; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Three ampules of sodium bicarbonate were administered intravenously. A chest radiograph reportedly showed diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, and computed tomography (CT) of the head was reportedly normal. Oxygen saturation was 81% while she was receiving supplemental oxygen by means of a nonrebreather face mask. The trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was begun. Intravenous vancomycin and mid-azolam were administered. The blood pressure decreased to 73/20 mm Hg; norepinephrine bi-tartrate, normal saline, and an additional two ampules of bicarbonate were infused; the blood pressure rose transiently to 145/90 mm Hg, then fell to 112/20 mm Hg. Approximately 2.5 hours after arrival, the patient was transferred to this hospital by ambulance, while piperacillin and tazobactam sodium were being infused. During transport, pulseless electrical activity developed; cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, and a pulse was restored. One month earlier, the patient had been seen in an urgent care clinic affiliated with this hospital because of a red, hard, painful lump that had developed on her right lower leg 3 days earlier. On examination at that time, the temperature was normal. There was an abscess with local erythe-ma (1.5 cm in diameter) on the right upper pre-tibial region; distal circulation and sensory and motor examinations were normal. The lesion was incised under sterile conditions with local anesthesia, and purulent bloody discharge was drained and cultured; a wick was inserted and a dry sterile dressing applied. A 10-day course of cephalexin (500 mg four times daily) and trimethoprim– sulfamethoxazole (double-strength twice daily) was prescribed. Two days later, cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus that was resistant to oxacil-lin, penicillin G, levofloxacin, and erythromycin and susceptible to clindamycin, vancomycin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole. The patient was notified by telephone; she had not begun the antibiotics and declined to return for reevaluation. She reportedly obtained the antibiotics that day and completed the 10-day course. She had been well otherwise. She lived alone and worked in an office. She reportedly did not smoke or use illicit drugs and had not traveled or had recent exposure to animals. She had no known allergies to medications. On examination, she was unresponsive, with cool, mottled extremities. The blood pressure was 122/90 mm Hg, the pulse 141 beats per minute, the temperature 37.4°C, and the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, while she was on mechanical ventilation. The neck was supple. Coarse, loud rales were heard throughout both lungs on inspiration and expiration; there were no cardiac murmurs, and the abdomen was distended and firm without organomegaly. There was a diffuse papular and pustular rash on the face, neck, chest, and abdomen and a healing ulcer with eschar (1 cm in diameter) on the right lower leg, with no erythema, crepitus, or necrosis. The hands and feet were cool and cyanotic; there were no lesions on the palms or soles. Pelvic examination revealed a white, thick, foul-smelling vaginal discharge, with no intravaginal foreign body or intrauterine device. Toxicologic screening of plasma revealed the presence of cyclobenzaprine and oxycodone, and the urine was positive for benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, and acetaminophen; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm at 142 beats per minute, with nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Within 15 minutes after arrival, the blood pressure decreased to 74/56 mm Hg. Central venous and radial arterial catheters were placed. Isotonic intravenous fluids and norepinephrine were infused to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg. Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxa-zole, acyclovir, stress doses of glucocorticoids, bicarbonate, calcium gluconate, normal saline, fresh-frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, and albumin were administered. CT of the brain, without the administration of contrast material, revealed multiple, diffuse, hyperdense foci in the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes bilaterally, many at the junction of the gray and white matter and along the corpus callosum, locations that are consistent with intraparenchymal hemorrhage; there was also surrounding hypoden-sity, which was consistent with edema. CT of the chest, obtained without the administration of contrast material, revealed diffuse bilateral patchy areas of consolidation and ground-glass opacities in the lungs, with superimposed intra-lobular septal thickening, small focal cavitations in the right upper and left lower lobes, and small bilateral pleural effusions. CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a small amount of perihe-patic fluid, a mixture of fluid and soft-tissue attenuation in the portal region that was suggestive of mild lymphadenopathy, and a band of increased attenuation along the right lower pelvic sidewall that was suggestive of a hematoma. There was no free intraperitoneal air or abscess. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Ceftriaxone, clindamycin phosphate, me-ropenem, gentamicin, and doxycycline were administered. Hypoxemia, hypercarbia, acidosis, and hypotension worsened, despite maximal support with pressors; the pupils became fixed and dilated. In consultation with the family, resuscitative measures were stopped, and the patient died, less than 12 hours after arrival at this hospital. A diagnostic test result was received.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2008,18,nejm-case-2008-18,A 68-Year-Old Man with Headache and Visual Changes after Liver Transplantation,"A 68-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of headache and loss of vision in the right eye. Orthotopic allogeneic liver transplantation had been performed 31/2 months earlier because of liver failure due to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Perioperative medications included rabbit antithymocyte globulin, vanco-mycin, fluconazole, and piperacillin–tazobactam. Tacrolimus, azathioprine, furo-semide, spironolactone, and a short course of corticosteroids were administered postoperatively. The immediate postoperative course was complicated by coagu-lopathy, intraperitoneal thrombi, and worsening renal function, with ascites and peripheral edema. The patient was discharged 2 weeks after transplantation. He had persistent anorexia and fatigue, but his condition had otherwise been improving until 8 weeks before admission, when he noted that his jaws tired with chewing. Two weeks later, a right temporal headache that was associated with scalp tenderness developed and did not improve with acetaminophen. The headache gradually intensified in the right temporal area, and 3 weeks before admission, vision in the right eye became blurred. Three days later, the patient was evaluated by his ophthalmologist; funduscopic examination showed changes that were consistent with anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, and prednisone (60 mg daily) was prescribed. The transplantation team at this hospital was notified, azathioprine was stopped, and the patient was referred to a rheumatologist. Two weeks before admission, the patient was seen in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. His sense of well-being, appetite, and clarity of vision had returned to normal, and the scalp tenderness had resolved. There was no previous history of headaches, Raynaud’s phenomenon, arthritis, rash, leg ulcers, or peripheral neuropathy, and he had had no fever within recent weeks. On examination, the blood pressure was 140/80 mm Hg, and other vital signs were normal. The temporal arteries were thin-walled and pulsatile, with no tenderness on palpation, and visual acuity was normal. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was advised to undergo a biopsy of the temporal artery within the week; the patient and his family decided to have it performed at a facility near their home but had difficulty scheduling it. Three days before admission, the results of a follow-up examination by the ophthalmologist were unchanged. The next day, loss of central vision in the right eye and severe right-sided headache developed. There was no fever, chills, pain with movement of the eye, or ophthalmic inflammation. The patient took oxycodone and acetaminophen every 6 hours, with transient, partial relief of the headache. On evaluation at a local hospital emergency department, his blood pressure was reported to be 211/124 mm Hg. The dosage of spironolactone was adjusted, and the patient was discharged to his home. The next day, he was seen in both the rheu-matology clinic and the transplantation clinic of this hospital. On examination, the patient appeared to be comfortable. His blood pressure was 150/90 mm Hg. There was minimal facial asymmetry, with slight prominence of the right eye and no associated tenderness. A subtle decrease in the right nasolabial fold was noted; grimace and furrowing of the brow were symmetrical. Extraocular movements were normal; the pupils were 3 mm in diameter. Vision in the right eye was blurred and limited to the ability to distinguish hand movements. There was no conjunctival injection or periorbital rash. The temporal arteries were thin-walled, visible, and palpable, with a small area of thickening in the right temporal artery, which was slightly tender. No bruits were present. The patient was admitted to the hospital through the emergency department. A diagnosis of HCV infection had been made 10 years earlier, associated with cirrhosis and esophageal varices. The patient had declined therapy with interferon and ribavirin. He had been well until 6 months before admission, when an incarcerated inguinal hernia developed, and emergency herniorrhaphy and bowel resection were performed at another hospital. The postoperative course was complicated by peritonitis due to infection with Enterococcus faecium, acute tubular necrosis, and liver failure, after which his condition stabilized, and liver transplantation was performed. A native of Italy, the patient had immigrated to the United States more than 40 years earlier and spoke primarily Italian. He lived with his wife and worked as an apartment manager. He did not drink alcohol or smoke. His parents lived into their 90s; one sibling had lupus, and another hypertension; his children were healthy. Medications included prednisone (60 mg daily), tacrolimus, fu-rosemide, spironolactone, ursodiol, esomeprazole, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, epoetin alfa, valganciclovir, risedronate, iron, multivitamins, and calcium. In the emergency department, the blood pressure was 156/87 mm Hg, pulse 87 beats per minute, and temperature 36.3°C; respirations were 20 breaths per minute, with the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Both pupils measured 3 mm in diameter. He could distinguish between light and dark but could no longer discern hand movement with his right eye. His face appeared symmetrical, and the results of the remainder of the examination were normal. Levels of serum electrolytes, amylase, and lipase and results of liver-function tests were normal; other results are shown in Table 1. Specimens of blood were sent for cultures. Computed tomographic (CT) scanning of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed low attenuation in the white matter that was consistent with microangiopathy, as well as mild opacification of the ethmoid and right sphe-noid sinuses; there was no evidence of acute infarction or hemorrhage. After consultation with Ophthalmology, administration of methylprednisolone (250 mg) intravenously every 6 hours was begun, and the patient was admitted to the transplantation service of this hospital early the next morning. Examination there showed bilateral periorbital swelling, more on the right side than on the left. The temporal artery on the right side was tender on palpation; the pulses were palpable bilaterally. There was no perception of hand motion or light in the right eye. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head showed an abnormal signal that suggested inflammation in the right sphenoid sinus, which extended intracranially through a defect in the roof of the sinus; abnormal enhancement and signal in the right gyrus rectus, suggesting secondary encephalitis; inflammation of the right optic nerve and orbital apex; and segmental narrowing of both vertebral arteries, without evidence of infarct. Treatment with amphotericin B (liposomal), van-comycin, and cefepime was begun; methylpred-nisolone was stopped and replaced by prednisone that was tapered to 10 mg daily. On the second hospital day, endoscopic right sphenoidotomy revealed a polyp on the anterior sphenoid surface. Pathological examination of a biopsy specimen showed acute and chronic inflammation and no organisms. Portions of the specimen were sent for cultures. Postoperatively, the patient was alert, oriented, and conversant, but there was a new facial-nerve palsy on the left side, with incomplete closure of the left eye. Neuro-ophthalmologic examination revealed a pale right optic nerve, hypertropia in primary gaze in the right eye, restriction of the lateral gaze in the left eye, and nystagmus with a downward rotary component. On neurologic examination, there was decreased temperature sensation on the right side of the face and body, a left lower motor facial-nerve palsy, and possible slight ataxia of the left arm and leg, suggestive of a left pontine lesion. Another series of CT scans confirmed the defect in the bony wall of the sphenoid sinus. Additional MRI scanning of the brain and brain stem later that day showed new infarctions involving the left facial colliculus and right external capsule, with worsening of the inflammation of the sphe-noid sinus. Treatment with aspirin was begun. Testing and cultures of the blood and urine for adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus, anaerobic organisms, mycobacteria, and fungi remained negative. On the third hospital day, the left facial-nerve palsy was slightly diminished. The serum level of homocysteine was 14 μmol per liter (reference range, 0 to 12); levels of lipid in the serum and anticardiolipin IgG and IgM were normal; test results for lupus anticoagulant and indirect im-munofluorescence testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. CT angiography revealed a patent right cavernous internal carotid artery and right ophthalmic artery on the right side and irregularity of the walls of the middle and anterior cerebral arteries bilaterally and the basilar artery; it also confirmed the findings on MRI of segmental narrowing of the vertebral arteries and showed worsening opacification of the sphenoethmoid sinus. No aneurysm was detected. A CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed a moderate pericardial effusion, a small pleural effusion on the right side, a small volume of ascites, and linear and nodular soft tissue throughout the mesentery. There were no valvular vegetations or evidence of tamponade on transthoracic endoscopic echocardiographic evaluation. Ampicillin and metronidazole were added. During the next 2 days, the results of serum testing for galactomannan antigen, 1,3-β-d-glu-can, and cryptococcal antigen (at a 1:32 dilution) were positive, and a rapid plasma reagin test was negative. On the sixth hospital day, a lumbar puncture revealed an opening pressure of 26 mm Hg. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 2. Approximately 4 hours later, the patient’s central cardiac-monitor alarm indicated a run of ventricular tachycardia. On examination by members of the nursing staff, the patient was found to be unresponsive, with a palpable pulse. The trachea was intubated; food was suctioned from the orophar-ynx, and mechanical ventilation begun. A CT an-giogram revealed new and extensive subarachnoid, intraventricular, and subdural hemorrhage; hydrocephalus; a fusiform aneurysm of the basilar artery; severe narrowing of the extracranial and intracranial vertebral arteries that had worsened since the previous studies; and attenuated distal middle cerebral and posterior cerebral arteries. An electroencephalogram showed generalized, attenuated background slowing, which was consistent with markedly diffuse cerebral dysfunction. There were no focal or generalized epileptiform discharges. An intraventricular drain was placed. During the next 21 hours, hypotension developed; pressors were added, but neurologic examination showed no improvement in the patient’s condition. On the seventh hospital day, after consultation with family members, the pressor support was withdrawn, and the patient died. An autopsy was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2009,35,nejm-case-2009-35,"A 60-Year-Old Male Renal-Transplant Recipient with Renal Insufficiency, Diabetic Ketoacidosis, and Mental-Status Changes","Dr. Peter P. Moschovis (Medicine and Pediatrics): A 60-year-old man with diabetes mel-litus and a history of renal transplantation was admitted to this hospital because of mental-status changes, diarrhea, renal insufficiency, diabetic ketoacidosis, and hypo-tension. The patient was in his usual state of health, with chronic respiratory problems, until approximately 2 months before admission, when increasing fatigue, somnolence, and intermittent mild confusion developed, associated with diarrhea and decreasing glycemic control. Three weeks before admission, he was admitted to another hospital because of increasing orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dys-pnea. On examination, there were crackles in the bilateral midlung fields. The serum creatinine level was 1.5 mg per deciliter (133 μmol per liter), and the B-type natriuretic peptide level was reportedly elevated. A chest radiograph reportedly showed chronic interstitial lung disease with possible pneumonitis. Diuretic agents and metronidazole were administered. He was discharged home on the third day. During the next few weeks, the patient became unable to care for himself. Oral intake decreased, diarrhea increased in frequency, and increasing somnolence and depression developed. Four days before admission, he ran out of insulin. The day before admission, emergency medical services personnel were called to his home and transported him to the emergency department of the other hospital. The blood pressure was 92/46 mm Hg, the pulse 92 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing oxygen (3 liters) through a nasal cannula. Tests of coagulation, liver function, and serum protein and albumin levels were normal; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram showed left bundle-branch block and ST-segment elevations in leads II, III, and aVF. The systolic blood pressure fell to 70 to 80 mm Hg. Insulin, levofloxacin, clopidogrel bisulfate, oxygen, and intravenous crystalloid fluids were administered. Early the next morning, he was transferred to this hospital. The patient had insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure. Nine years earlier, cadaveric renal transplantation was performed at another hospital; the baseline plasma creatinine level was 1.4 mg per deciliter (124 μmol per liter). Four months before admission, levo-floxacin was administered for a urinary tract infection caused by Providencia stuartii. He also had congestive heart failure, hypertension, hypothyroidism, peripheral vascular disease, and pulmonary fibrosis with chronic interstitial markings on chest radiography. Previous surgical procedures included amputations below the knee on the left and of multiple toes on the right and enucleation of the right eye after traumatic injury. He was divorced and had lived in a desert region of the southwestern United States for 8 years; he had returned to the Northeast 7 months before admission. He smoked cigarettes, drank alcohol occasionally, and did not use illicit intravenous drugs. His children were healthy; other relatives had thyroid disease and diabetes mellitus. He was allergic to penicillin, codeine, morphine, oxyco-done–acetaminophen, propoxyphene, meperidine, and ibuprofen. Medications included prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, furosemide, lisinopril, isosorbide mononitrate, insulin, levo-thyroxine sodium, and sertraline. On examination, the patient appeared cachec-tic and confused. The temperature was 36.9°C, the blood pressure 84/48 mm Hg, the pulse 80 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing oxygen (2 liters) through a nasal cannula. The left pupil was constricted and the right orbital socket enucleated. The internal jugular venous pressure was estimated at 4 cm of water. There was poor inspiratory effort, and scattered crackles were heard in both lungs, loudest at the bases. A grade 2/6 systolic murmur was present at the left upper sternal border, and a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex. The abdomen was soft and was tender to palpation in the right lower quadrant, with no distention, guarding, or rebound; the renal allograft site was not tender. There was a palpable thrill in the right arm at the site of the arteriovenous fistula. The sacrum was erythematous; a dry, clean ulcer was present on the anterior tibial surface of the right leg; and amputations were as noted above. He was minimally verbal, answered questions inter-mittently, and was unable to follow commands. There was clonus in the right leg, and a tremor was present in both arms; reflexes were 1+. The remainder of the examination was normal. A central venous catheter was placed; the central venous pressure was 5 cm of water. Amylase and lipase levels and results of coagulation and liver-function tests were normal; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Cefepime, intravenous fluids, and pressors (dopamine followed by norepinephrine) were administered. An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm, with a left bundle-branch block and changes consistent with an inferior myocardial infarction of indeterminate age. Administration of intravenous heparin was begun. A chest radiograph revealed possible subsegmental atelectasis in the right middle lobe and mild pulmonary congestion. The patient was admitted to the coronary care unit. Vancomycin, levofloxacin, aztreonam, and stress doses of corticosteroids (hydrocortisone and dexamethasone) were given; supplements of calcium, magnesium, and potassium were administered intravenously as needed. Transtho-racic echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction of 20%, moderate mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid insufficiency, a tricuspid aortic valve with thickened leaflets and mild aortic stenosis, a mildly dilated left ventricular cavity, left ventricular hypertrophy and hypokinesis, and trace pulmonary insufficiency, with no evidence of tamponade. Screening of the urine for toxic drugs was negative. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain, without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a small focus of hypo-attenuation in the posterior superior right lenti-form nucleus (thought to represent a lacunar infarct) and vascular calcifications. CT of the chest showed multiple tiny nodular opacities (including tree-in-bud opacities), predominantly in the upper lobes and more on the right than on the left, that were thought to be features consistent with inflammatory or infectious processes. CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed a small native kidney and a transplanted kidney in the right iliac fossa, with no perinephric fluid, a small amount of air in the bladder and collecting system, ascites, extensive atherosclerosis, and findings consistent with anasarca. Ultrasonogra-phy of the pelvis revealed the transplanted kidney with a well-circumscribed, rounded, focal hypoechoic lesion within the upper pole that was associated with some central flow and heterogeneously increased parenchymal echogenicity. On the second day, results of a corticotropin stimulation test were normal. Examination of the stool showed no leukocytes, and a specimen was sent for culture, with testing for Clostridium dif­ficile toxins and ova and parasite analysis. Mag-netic resonance imaging (MRI) of the transplanted kidney, without the administration of contrast material, showed two focal lesions within the lower pole and anteriorly within the pelvis. The image of one of the lesions showed central T2 -weighted hyperintense signal with surrounding T2-weighted hypointensity, and the image of the other showed T2-weighted hypointense signal. A lesion (1.5 cm in diameter) in the upper pole, corresponding to that identified on the ultrasono-graphic examination, showed central T2-weighted hyperintense signal with surrounding T2-weighted hypointensity. Culture of the urine grew rare yeast organisms (approximately 100 colony-form-ing units per milliliter of urine) within 24 hours, and aerobic culture of the blood grew gram-positive cocci in two of two cultures. Additional specimens of blood were sent for culture. The patient remained critically ill, with diarrhea, persistent acidosis, and intermittent hypotension that required pressors. Test results from the third day are shown in Table 1. On the fourth hospital day, the patient’s mental status worsened and respiratory distress developed, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. A lumbar puncture was performed. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed clear, colorless fluid. There were 2 white cells and 69 red cells per cubic millimeter. The glucose level was 119 mg per deciliter (7 mmol per liter) (reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [3 to 4 mmol per liter]), and the protein level was 87 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55). Later that day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,35,nejm-case-2019-35,A 66-Year-Old Man with Pancytopenia and Rash,"Dr. Joshua Salvi (Medicine): A 66-year-old man with a history of pancytopenia was transferred to this hospital in the winter for evaluation of pancytopenia and rash. The patient had been well until 1 year before admission, when episodic fevers began to occur. Approximately 3 months before admission, fevers with a temperature of up to 38.3°C increased in frequency and severity and coincided with shaking chills. Scattered papules developed on the arms and legs; the lesions were initially deeply erythematous, but over a period of several days, the discoloration faded and the skin sloughed. There was no associated pruritus, and febrile episodes did not coincide with worsening of the skin lesions. Two months before admission, episodes of orthostatic hypotension and dizziness developed. The patient was admitted to other hospitals on two occasions for recurrent lightheadedness. Laboratory evaluation reportedly revealed a normal level of corticotropin in the blood and a normal increase in the serum cortisol level after intravenous administration of cosyntropin. The white-cell count was 850 per microliter (reference range, 4200 to 9900), the hemoglobin level 9.2 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.0 to 17.4), the platelet count 61,000 per microliter (reference range, 140,000 to 440,000), and the mean corpuscular volume 89 fl (reference range, 82 to 100). The blood levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine amino-transferase were elevated. Serologic tests for hepatitis A, B, and C viruses and for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 and type 2 were negative. The fer-ritin level was 12,620 ng per milliliter (reference range, 30 to 400), but subsequent testing for the HFE mutation most often associated with hemochromatosis was negative. Nineteen days before the ferritin level was measured, the iron level was 67 μg per deciliter (12 μmol per liter) (reference range, 45 to 182 μg per deciliter [8 to 33 μmol per liter]), the total iron-binding capacity 143 μg per deciliter (26 μmol per liter) (reference range, 261 to 478 μg per deciliter [47 to 86 μmol per liter]), the transferrin saturation 47% (reference range, 20 to 55), the folate level 18.3 ng per milliliter (41 nmol per liter) (reference range, 6 to 20 ng per milliliter [14 to 45 nmol per liter]), and the vitamin B12 level 861 pg per milliliter (635 pmol per liter) (reference range, 193 to 986 pg per milliliter [142 to 727 pmol per liter]).

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,03,nejm-case-2010-03,A 5-Month-Old Boy with Developmental Delay and Irritability,"A 4.5-month-old boy was seen in the pediatric neurology clinic of this hospital because of developmental delay and an abnormal neurologic examination. The patient had been born at full-term by normal vaginal delivery to a 36-year-old multigravid mother. His mother had a history of abuse of alcohol and drugs (including cocaine and oxycodone) and was taking methadone when pregnancy was confirmed, at approximately 2 months of gestation. She discontinued methadone on learning of her pregnancy. During pregnancy, a diagnosis of maternal hepatitis C virus infection was made, and IgG antibodies to herpes simplex virus were detected; valacyclovir was administered during the last 4 weeks of gestation. Screening for human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, hepatitis B virus, rubella, and cystic fibrosis was negative. At birth, 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores were 9; the amniotic fluid was meconium-stained, and oxygen was administered for respiratory distress. The birth weight was 3.7 kg (50th to 75th percentile), the length 51 cm (50th to 75th percentile), and the head circumference 34.5 cm (25th percentile). The infant was admitted to the newborn intensive care unit (ICU), where he intermittently appeared tremulous but did not require intubation. Ampicillin and gentamicin were administered until blood cultures were sterile at 24 hours. A newborn metabolic screen was normal, a toxicology screen of the urine was negative, and results of routine laboratory tests were normal. He was discharged on the sixth day, feeding normally. The infant was seen for routine visits at his pediatrician’s office. His mother reported that he would rapidly ingest a small amount of formula, then cease sucking, without spitting or vomiting. At 2 months of age, his weight was reportedly in the 25th percentile, and cereal was added to his formula. At the age of 3.5 months, he was admitted to another hospital because of abrasions to his left forehead, reportedly after accidental trauma. The vital signs were normal, and the weight was 5.2 kg (3rd to 10th percentile). There were abrasions over the left frontal scalp, with minimal soft-tissue swelling and no ecchymoses. The examination was otherwise normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the head showed increased attenuation along the corticospinal tracts, with no evidence of subdural hematoma or cerebral contusion. A radiographic skeletal survey was normal. He was discharged on the fourth day, with instructions for follow-up with social services and his pediatrician. At 4 months of age, on examination by his pediatrician, the infant was irritable, with decreased interaction and smiling. The length was 55 cm (<3rd percentile), and the weight 5.0 kg (<3rd percentile); there was increased muscle tone and a perirectal abscess. Amoxicillin–clavulanic acid was administered. The next day, he was seen at an early intervention clinic at the health center, and 10 days later in the neurology clinic at this hospital. His mother reported that he slept well, was intermittently cranky, startled easily to loud sounds, and occasionally arched his back. He smiled, tracked, and looked around, but he did not laugh, reach for objects, or roll over. He had received routine immunizations and had no allergies. The patient lived with his mother and a half sister; his father lived nearby and was involved in his care. One year earlier, a sibling had died during the perinatal period; the half sister had thal-assemia. There were no relatives with neurologic problems. His mother was of Scandinavian and Irish ancestry, and his father of Caribbean ancestry. On examination, the infant appeared irritable, with frequent crying, but he did not startle. The head circumference was 40.5 cm (5th to 10th percentile), the weight 4.9 kg (<3rd percentile), and the length 59 cm (<3rd percentile). There was increased muscle tone, with frequent arching, writhing, and stiffening. Head control was poor, with deviation to the right at rest. There was an oblique lateral deformity of the skull (plagio-cephaly). The anterior fontanel was small, with slightly overlapping sutures. Visual attention was normal, and the eyes tracked in all directions, without nystagmus. The pupils were reactive, and the funduscopic examination was normal. His hands were fisted, with prominent adduction and infolding of the thumbs (cortical thumbs); the grasp reflex was strong. The neck was hyper-extended, with head lag on traction. The limbs were extended, with increased tone; there was tightness of the adductors and hamstrings and scissoring of the legs (most prominent in the upright position). When prone, his body hyper-extended when he cried. Moro’s reflexes and bilateral tonic neck reflexes were present; plantar reflexes were extensor bilaterally, and the tendon reflexes were brisk but not hyperactive. The re-mainder of the examination was normal, including the tongue, the pitch of his cries, and the hearing. There was no ankle clonus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was scheduled. Approximately 1 week later, the infant began to attend day care. One week after that, loose stools developed. The next day, his mother noted several dry diapers, and the day-care staff reported that he appeared pale and tired, with poor oral intake. He was brought to the emergency room of this hospital. On examination, the infant was somnolent but easily aroused, and he was irritable but consolable. The rectal temperature was 36.4°C, the blood pressure 124/93 mm Hg, the pulse 84 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 36 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. There was a fluctuant mass consistent with an abscess on the medial left gluteus. Deep-tendon reflexes were difficult to elicit. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Urinalysis, complete blood count, and levels of serum electrolytes, glucose, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were tests of liver and renal function. He was admitted to the hospital. The gluteal mass was aspirated and confirmed to be an abcess; treatment with cephalexin was begun. Culture grew few enteric gram-negative bacilli. During the next week, the infant was irritable, with poor oral intake. On the fifth day, MRI of the brain revealed abnormal signal in both cerebellar hemispheres; increased T2-weighted signal in the vicinity of the deep nuclei, deep cerebral white matter, periventricular regions, internal capsules, corpus callosum, pons, medulla, and spinothalamic tracts; mild volume loss in the thalami; decreased T2-weighted signal within the hypothalami; and enlarged optic chiasm and optic nerves. There was no mass effect, midline shift, extra-axial collections, or evidence of acute hemorrhage or infarction. Spectroscopy disclosed marked depression of the N-acetyl aspartate peak in the deep cerebellar nuclei, left centrum semiovale, and left basal ganglia, and to a lesser degree within the parietal gray matter. On the seventh day, nerve-conduction studies showed slow conduction velocities that were consistent with a generalized primary demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Electroencephalography showed no abnormalities. On the ninth day, lumbar puncture showed light pink and slightly turbid cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with 3090 red cells and 1 white cell per cubic millimeter (13% neutrophils, 74% lymphocytes, and 13% monocytes); the level of protein was 145 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55), glucose 62 mg per deciliter (3.4 mmol per liter) (50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]), and lactate 1.9 mmol per liter (0.5 to 2.2). No organisms were seen on Gram’s staining, and culture was sterile. The patient was discharged on the 10th day, weighing 5.0 kg and taking ranitidine and cephalexin. A diagnostic-test result was received.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2013,13,nejm-case-2013-13,A 6-Year-Old Girl with Bone and Joint Pain and Abdominal Distention,"Dr. Harmony Caton (Pediatrics): A 6-year-old girl was admitted to this hospital because of a 1-year history of intermittent bone and joint pain and the recent onset of fever and abdominal distention. The patient had been well until 1 year before admission, when she fell on her outstretched left hand. That night, she awakened because of pain in her left arm. The following day, radiographs of the left forearm, performed at the emergency department of another hospital, were normal. During the next 16 days, the pain migrated among the joints in the distal arm and limited her usual activities. Ibuprofen provided symptomatic relief. On examination by the patient’s pediatrician, the distal humerus was slightly tender; the remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. On the 17th day, the patient saw an orthopedist at this hospital; examination revealed pain over the left biceps and was otherwise normal. The pain resolved spontaneously after approximately 3 weeks. During the next 6 months, she intermittently reported rib pain on the left side. Six months before admission, 2 days after a minor fall on grass, severe pain in the right knee awakened the patient from sleep, and her parents noted that she walked with a limp. There was partial improvement with ibuprofen. On examination by her pediatrician, the right tibial tuberosity was slightly tender, without swelling or effusion. A radiograph of the right knee was normal. Test results are shown in Table 1. One week later, the patient was seen in the rheumatology clinic at this hospital. She did not have fever, chills, weight loss, alopecia, eye pain, dysphagia, nausea, emesis, abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, epistaxis or other bleeding, dyspnea, cough, pleuritic or other chest pain, dysuria, new rash, or cold-associated color changes in the digits. She had a history of pollen allergy, with red eyes at night and sensitive skin. She had occasional wheezing in association with respiratory infections. Other than ibuprofen for pain, her only medication was albuterol administered by nebulizer, which was seldom used. On examination, the height was 122.3 cm (95th percentile) and the weight 25.6 kg; the vital signs and remainder of the examination were normal. Her parents were advised to return with the child if additional episodes occurred or symptoms worsened. One month later, conjunctival injection and swelling and erythema of the left eyelid occurred transiently. Three months before admission, severe, nonpleuritic pain in the left flank developed, without dyspnea. The pain radiated into the left leg, prevented the patient from sleeping, and was associated with limping. There was no improvement with ibuprofen. Two days later, the patient returned to the rheumatology clinic. At that time, the pain had resolved. On examination, there was moderate cervical lymphadenopathy; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests; other test results are shown in Table 1. Naproxen suspension was prescribed, and the parents were instructed to return with their daughter if symptoms recurred or worsened. Six days before admission, the patient was evaluated at the pediatrician’s office because she had back pain, limping, and intermittent fever, up to a temperature of 39.8°C. On examination, there was mild nontender swelling of the left upper eyelid and serous fluid behind both otic membranes; the remainder of the examination and a urinalysis were normal. Follow-up with the rheu-matologist was scheduled. The day before admission, swelling around the right eye, abdominal distention, and discoloration around the umbilicus developed, with a temperature of 39.4°C. The next day, at the pediatrician’s office, the weight was 27.7 kg, and there was bilateral periorbital swelling, right periorbital erythema, and bluish discoloration below the left eye; the abdomen was soft and nontender, without organomegaly, and there was periumbilical firmness with ecchymo-sis of the overlying skin. She was referred urgently to the hematology–oncology clinic of this hospital. The patient and her family reported no change in her appetite or weight. She awakened intermittently warm and diaphoretic at night, but she had not had soaking night sweats, difficulty sleeping, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, shortness of breath, or chest pain, nor had she had swelling, numbness, or tingling of the extremities. She had been born by uncomplicated, spontaneous vaginal delivery after a full-term gestation. Growth and development were normal, and performance in school was above average. She had had gastroesophageal reflux disease as an infant, for which ranitidine had been administered for 10 months, and she had allergic rhinitis in response to pollen. Medications included naproxen and ibuprofen as needed for pain and fever; she had received all routine childhood vaccinations except the influenza vaccine. She had no known allergies to medications. She lived with her parents and attended school and dance classes. Her parents smoked outside the home. Her mother had hypertension, her father had had knee pain during childhood, both grandfathers had had myocardial infarctions, her paternal grandmother had rheumatoid arthritis and breast cancer, a paternal aunt had breast cancer, and another paternal aunt had eczema. There was no family history of childhood arthritis, Crohn’s disease or other colitis, psoriasis, lupus, or thyroid disorders. On examination, the temperature was 38.7°C, the blood pressure 119/79 mm Hg, the pulse 112 beats per minute, the weight 27.2 kg, and the height 123.8 cm. There was discoloration below the right eye. The abdomen was soft and non-tender, with normal bowel sounds; there was a firm mass in the lower midline and periumbili-cal bruising. External rotation of the right hip caused flinching; the patient walked with a slight limp, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and uric acid were normal, as was the activated partial-thromboplastin time. Tests of renal and liver function, antinuclear-antibody titers, and urinalysis were negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest after the intravenous administration of contrast material revealed multiple subcentimeter left axillary lymph nodes and mixed lytic and sclerotic lesions involving multiple vertebral bodies and the sternum. CT of the abdomen after the administration of contrast material revealed multiple hypodense lesions in the liver, measuring up to 1.7 cm in diameter; enlarged kidneys (left, 14 cm; right, 13.5 cm), with multiple, bilateral hypodense lesions; a large abdominal mass, 10.8 cm by 8.3 cm by 12.2 cm, with heterogeneous enhancement and a hypodense peripheral rim; a small amount of ascites; retro-peritoneal lymphadenopathy up to 2.5 cm in diameter; and a mottled lytic–sclerotic appearance of the skeleton, most prominent in the L5 vertebral body, without pathologic fractures. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Positron-emission tomography (PET) was performed after the administration of 5.7 mCi of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). The PET scan showed moderate radiotracer uptake in the large anterior abdominal mass, in multiple lymph nodes, and in adenoidal soft tissue, as well as intense uptake in multiple bones. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2021,27,nejm-case-2021-27,A 16-Year-Old Boy Seeking Human Immunodeficiency Virus Prophylaxis,"Dr. Elizabeth A. Perzanowski (Pediatrics): A 16-year-old boy was seen in the infectious disease clinic at this hospital for consideration of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The patient identified as a cisgender male and reported having had more than 10 male sexual partners, many of whom he had met through online dating platforms. He had oral sex, as well as insertive and receptive anal intercourse. He used condoms intermittently. The patient had learned about HIV PrEP through websites linked to online dating platforms and expressed interest in initiation of HIV PrEP during a routine visit with his pediatrician. The patient reported that he might discuss this plan with one of his parents, but he had not yet chosen to disclose his sexual activity or his desire to initiate PrEP to either of them. He sought care at a sexual health clinic; because he was a minor seeking medication for HIV prevention rather than screening or treatment for other sexually transmitted infections, he was referred for an appointment on the same day with an internal medicine–pediatrics physician in the infectious disease clinic at this hospital for an evaluation for HIV PrEP. The patient arrived at the clinic alone and requested that the content of the visit remain confidential. He reported feeling well, with no dysuria, penile discharge, genital lesions, or penile or testicular pain. He had a history of mild dyslexia, herpes labialis, and seasonal allergies. Two months earlier, he had been seen by his primary care physician because of intermittent rectal pain and slight hematochezia. A rectal examination performed during that visit had revealed mild irritation of the perianal skin and a healing fissure; the symptoms were attributed to constipation and resolved with the administration of polyethylene glycol and increased intake of dietary fiber. Current medications were oral penciclovir as needed and a lysine supplement. Immunizations were current, and the patient had no known allergies to medications. He was a sophomore in high school and was physically active. He lived in an urban community in New England with his parents, younger sister, and pet cats; he had two older siblings who lived independently. He reported that he did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His mother had a history of anemia, obesity, and nephrotic syndrome; a maternal aunt had leiomyosarcoma; a maternal uncle had epilepsy; and his maternal grandmother had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. On examination, the patient was a well-appearing male adolescent. His race was recorded as Black in the electronic medical registration system. The vital signs were normal; the weight was 81.6 kg, the height 178 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 25.6. The mucous membranes were moist; there were no oropharyngeal exudates or ulcers. There was no rash or cervical, submandibular, supraclavicu-lar, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. The abdomen was soft, without tenderness. The penis was uncircumcised; there were no genital ulcers, fissures, or other lesions of the perianal tissue. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were results of kidney-function tests. Blood tests for hepatitis B surface antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, and syphilis were negative, as were tests for Neisseria gonor-rhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis nucleic acid performed on urine, an oropharyngeal swab, and a rectal swab. Screening tests for HIV types 1 and 2 were negative. Management decisions were made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2018,34,nejm-case-2018-34,A 58-Year-Old Woman with Paresthesia and Weakness of the Left Foot and Abdominal Wall,"Dr. Amrit Misra (Neurology): A 58-year-old woman was seen in the outpatient neurology clinic of this hospital in early autumn because of hypoesthesia, paresthesia, and weakness. The patient had been well until 10 weeks before this presentation, when back pain developed between the shoulder blades. The pain resolved during the next 2 weeks, without an intervention. Six weeks before this presentation, numbness developed in a bandlike distribution around her trunk, with involvement of the area between the shoulder blades and the area under the breasts. Five weeks before this presentation, the numbness extended to the upper abdomen. The patient was unable to sit up from the supine position without using her arms, and she had abdominal distention. Four weeks before this presentation, paresthesia developed in the third, fourth, and fifth fingers of the left hand and the fourth and fifth fingers of the right hand. The patient was seen at a clinic at another hospital, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine was scheduled. However, 2 weeks before this presentation, the numbness extended to the genital area and urinary incontinence developed, prompting the patient to present to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported no fevers, night sweats, change in weight, arm weakness, leg weakness, or change in gait. She had a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and symptomatic spinal stenosis, for which she had undergone L4–L5 decompression and bilateral medial facetectomy 6 years before this presentation. She had also undergone open reduction and internal fixation of left tibial and fibular fractures that had resulted from a fall, as well as excision of a foreign body that had punctured the right thenar. Three months before this presentation, the patient had noted an area of non-pruritic, nonpainful erythema (measuring 8 cm in diameter) on the left gluteal fold, surrounding what she had thought to be an insect bite. Fever did not develop, and the erythema resolved during the subsequent 4 weeks. The patient’s only medication was levo-thyroxine, and she was allergic to penicillin. She drank alcohol rarely, had smoked tobacco in the past, and did not use illicit drugs. She was married and lived with her husband in a wooded area in northeastern Connecticut. She worked in health care. There was no family history of neurologic disease. On examination, the temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 144/75 mm Hg, the heart rate 84 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. The weight was 74.8 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 25.8. There was decreased sensation on the posterior and anterior trunk and abdomen. The abdomen was distended. The remainder of the general medical examination was normal. The blood glucose level was 291 mg per deciliter (16.2 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). The blood electrolyte levels were normal, as were the results of tests of renal and liver function, the complete blood count, and the differential count. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. H. Benjamin Harvey: MRI of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed no spinal cord compression, cord signal abnormality, or epidural collection. There were multilevel degenerative changes of the spine, as well as postsurgical changes related to remote L4–L5 decompression, without associated high-grade spinal-canal stenosis or nerve-root impingement. The nerve roots of the conus medullaris and cauda equina appeared to be normal, and there was no evidence of thickening or clumping of the nerve roots. Dr. Misra: The patient chose to seek neuro-logic evaluation for her symptoms, and 2 weeks later, she was seen in the outpatient neurology clinic of this hospital. She reported stable pares-thesia of the hands, ongoing numbness of the trunk and abdomen, new numbness of the upper anterior legs, and a 5-day history of difficulty lifting the front part of her left foot when she walked. She also reported difficulty taking a deep breath and coughing. On examination, the temperature was 36.4°C, the blood pressure 106/67 mm Hg, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. The patient’s mental status was normal, as were the results of testing of the 2nd through 12th cranial nerves. Strength was 4/5 during flexion of the left wrist, 5/5 while the patient was gripping the examiner’s fingers, 4/5 during dorsiflexion of the left foot, and 4/5 during extension of the left toes; strength was otherwise 5/5. When the patient attempted to walk on her heels, she was unable to keep her left forefoot from touching the floor. Diaphragmatic excursion, as measured by percussion along the posterior chest at the end of inspiration and expiration, was symmetric. There was diminished tone in the bilateral rectus abdominis muscles, with associated abdominal distention. The patient was unable to rise from the supine position without assistance from the examiner. There was diminished sensation in response to light touch and pinprick in a bandlike distribution around the T6 dermatome spanning to the T12 derma-tome. Deep-tendon reflexes were absent at the biceps on the left side and at the ankles bilaterally. The remainder of the neurologic and medical examination was normal. Laboratory testing revealed a glycated hemoglobin level of 11.8% (reference range, <5.7), an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 25 mm per hour (reference range, <30), and normal levels of thyrotropin, creatine kinase, vitamin D, vitamin B12, and folate. Dr. Harvey: Chest radiographs obtained in the inspiratory and expiratory views showed no evidence of parenchymal opacity, pleural effusion, or lymphadenopathy. Hemidiaphragmatic movement between inspiration and expiration was present bilaterally. On MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine without contrast enhancement, the findings were stable, as compared with the previous study. On MRI of the thoracic spine with contrast enhancement, there was no evidence of abnormal cord or meningeal enhancement (Fig. 1). Dr. Misra: A diagnostic test was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2008,34,nejm-case-2008-34,A 58-Year-Old Woman with Neck Pain and Fever,"Dr. Mary Pisculli (Infectious Disease): A 58-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of severe right-sided neck pain, fever, and abnormal findings on cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Two to 3 weeks before admission, she noted swelling in the right anterior portion of the neck, which she thought was an enlarged lymph node; the swelling was associated with pain in her neck. The pain increased in severity over a period of several days and began to radiate intermittently to the right shoulder. She underwent an acupressure massage, without relief, and the next day tingling developed in all fingers but was most severe in the first three fingers of the right hand. She took nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, without improvement. Twelve days before admission, the patient went to the urgent care clinic at another hospital. She reported that intermittent right-sided neck pain and mild headaches had occurred for the past 3 months, which she had attributed to muscle strain from work-related activity. On examination, she appeared uncomfortable. The range of motion of the neck was decreased in all directions, and the muscles of the right lateral neck were tender and taut. Strength and sensation were intact in the arms. There was no evidence of radiculopathy. Cyclobenzaprine, ibuprofen, and oxycodone–acetaminophen were administered. Five days before admission, the patient returned to the urgent care clinic because of increasing pain that was not responsive to heat, as well as intermittent numbness in the left hand with a sensation of increased warmth. On examination, she appeared uncomfortable and held her head stiffly. The temperature was 38.2°C, the blood pressure 138/70 mm Hg, and the pulse 92 beats per minute. She was unable to raise her arms above her head, and the range of motion of the neck was estimated to be 25% of the normal range of motion. The suboccipital and trapezius muscles were tense, without point tenderness. Hand grasp, sensation in the arms, and deep-tendon reflexes were normal. A radiograph of the neck was normal. Analysis of the urine revealed values of 100 mg per deciliter (5.6 mmol per liter) for glucose and 15 mg per deciliter for ketones. The serum glucose level was 156 mg per deciliter (8.7 mmol per liter), and the sodium level was 132 mmol per liter; measurements of other electrolyte levels and renal function were normal. Other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Ke-torolac tromethamine (60 mg) was administered, with relief of the pain within 30 minutes. Ketoro-lac (10 mg up to every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain) was prescribed, and a soft cervical neck col-lar was provided. She was advised to return if her condition did not improve; an appointment with an orthopedist was scheduled for 3 days later. Two days later, 3 days before admission, the temperature rose to 40.0°C, with chills, cough, and pain on swallowing and neck movement. The patient returned to the urgent care clinic. She did not have headache, visual changes, weakness, bowel or bladder dysfunction, dysu-ria, or dyspnea. On examination, the temperature was 38.1°C, the pulse 80 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the blood pressure 130/60 mm Hg. The range of motion of the neck was limited because of pain; the remainder of the examination was normal. A 5-day course of azithromycin was prescribed. The next day, the temperature rose to 39.4°C; the patient saw her primary care physician and an orthopedist. She reported decreased neck pain. The temperature was 37.2°C; the face appeared flushed and slightly swollen. The neck was tender without masses; the pain was increased with both extension and flexion of the neck. Deep-tendon reflexes of the biceps and the brachialis muscles on the right were slightly diminished as compared with those on the left. Specimens of blood were sent for cultures. Measurements of creatine kinase and aldolase levels were normal; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1, and additional test results were pending. MRI of the cervical spine, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed a large epidural fluid collection in the disk space extending from the level of the fourth to seventh cervical vertebrae, with maximum thickness at the level of the fifth to sixth vertebrae. There was evidence of mild cord compression. The next day, she saw an infectious-disease specialist. The patient was a technologist in a microbiology laboratory. Seven months earlier, she had been exposed to a specimen obtained by fine-needle aspiration from which Brucella melitensis was subsequently cultured. Two weeks after the exposure, when the organism was identified, she was seen in the occupational health clinic of this hospital. A specimen of blood was drawn and stored for serologic testing for brucella. She was advised to take prophylactic antibiotics, but she declined therapy. Follow-up by telephone occurred weekly for the next 3 1/2 months, during which she felt well. Three months before admission, the patient noted discomfort in the right upper back and right side of the neck, swelling in the right side of the neck that she believed was an enlarged lymph node, and pain on swal-lowing; she returned to the occupational health clinic. She did not have fever, chills, night sweats, malaise, weakness, or arthralgias. The temperature was 37.1°C. Slightly enlarged, soft posterior cervical lymph nodes were palpated; the remainder of the examination was normal. At this time, testing for antibodies to brucella on a specimen of blood obtained 4 months earlier and a current specimen were performed (Table 1). The patient had received bacille Calmette– Guérin vaccine in childhood, and a tuberculin skin test had been positive years earlier. She had never taken antituberculosis medications. She had scoliosis of the thoracic spine, osteoporosis, and occasional hip pain; a bone scan obtained 17 days earlier revealed minimal degenerative changes in the lower lumbar spine, with no evidence of stress fractures. The patient had been born in Taiwan, immigrated to the United States 30 years earlier, and lived in New England. She was married and had two healthy adult children. She gardened frequently and drank alcohol occasionally; she had no history of tobacco or illicit drug use, recent travel, or exposure to sick persons. Medications included ketorolac, ibuprofen, aspirin, azithromy-cin, alendronate, and conjugated estrogens and medroxyprogesterone acetate. There were no allergies. On examination, the temperature was 36.8°C. There was severe pain on palpation of the right lateral neck; there were no palpable masses or lymphadenopathy, and the remainder of the examination was normal. The next day, an MRI scan obtained after the administration of gadolinium revealed a peripherally enhancing extra-dural fluid collection along the posterior aspect of the C5 and C6 vertebral bodies, a finding that was consistent with an epidural abscess. This lesion resulted in mass effect over the ventral aspect of the spinal cord. The patient was admitted to the other hospital. The vital signs were normal, and the findings on physical examination were unchanged. Vancomycin and narcotic analgesia were administered intravenously. Measurements of serum electrolyte levels and renal function were normal; results of other laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. On the fifth hospital day a diagnostic-test result was received. The patient was transferred to this hospital for further care.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,19,nejm-case-2019-19,A 38-Year-Old Woman with Abdominal Pain and Fever,"Dr. Erika J. Parisi (Medicine): A 38-year-old woman with a history of Crohn’s disease was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain and fever. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 years before the current admission, when nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and pain in the right upper quadrant developed. She was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital. The right upper quadrant was tender on palpation, and the remainder of the physical examination was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis revealed mild dilatation and fecalization of the distal small intestine. A diagnosis of small-bowel obstruction was suspected, and the patient was admitted to the hospital for bowel rest and administration of intravenous fluids. On the second hospital day, all the symptoms had resolved, and the patient was discharged home with a presumed diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis. One month later, the patient was evaluated in a gastroenterology clinic affiliated with a second hospital. She reported ongoing bloating, intermittent abdominal pain on the right side, and two or three bowel movements per day with loose stools without blood or mucus. She had no weight loss or fever. Physical examination was normal. CT with small-bowel enterography revealed mild circumferential wall thickening of the proximal ascending colon and distal ileum and prominent lymph nodes in the right lower quadrant. Colonoscopy was notable for erythema-tous, granular, hemorrhagic, ulcerated mucosa in the proximal ascending colon and cecum. Biopsy specimens of the ileum and ascending colon showed normal mucosa; a biopsy specimen of the cecum showed evidence of active chronic colitis that was consistent with Crohn’s disease. Mesalamine therapy was initiated, with a decrease in the bloating and abdominal pain but no change in the frequency of bowel movements. Seven months before the current admission, the patient was evaluated in a gastroenterology clinic affiliated with this hospital. She reported postprandial bloating and epigastric pain, as well as two or three bowel movements per day with hard stools and associated straining. Physical examination was normal. The fecal calpro-tectin level was 243 μg per gram (reference range, <50). An interferon-γ release assay for Mycobacte-rium tuberculosis was negative. The blood lipase level was normal, as were the results of liver-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Results of esophagogastro-duodenoscopy were normal, but gastric biopsy specimens showed evidence of Helicobacter pylori gastritis. Colonoscopy (Fig. 1) revealed shallow ulcerations, edema, and friability in the cecum and a segment of the ascending colon. Findings on examination of a biopsy specimen of the cecum were interpreted as consistent with severe active colitis, with marked ulceration but without dysplasia or granulomas; immunohistochem-ical staining for cytomegalovirus was negative. The H. pylori gastritis was treated with lansopra-zole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin, with near resolution of the bloating and upper abdominal pain. Five months before the current admission, mesalamine was discontinued and adalimumab was initiated for the treatment of Crohn’s disease. Three months before the current admission, bloating and epigastric pain recurred; stools contained blood and mucus, and bowel movements increased in frequency to three or four times per day. Two months before the current admission, the patient was again evaluated in the gastroen-terology clinic affiliated with this hospital. Physical examination was normal. The fecal calprotec-tin level was 2144 μg per gram. The adalimumab level and antiadalimumab antibody titer were interpreted as low. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Aileen O’Shea: Magnetic resonance enter-ography of the abdomen and pelvis (Fig. 2), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed thickening and edema of the ascending colon, cecum, and terminal ileum, with surrounding changes consistent with inflammation and marked contrast enhancement. There was no evidence of bowel obstruction. Dr. Parisi: The frequency of the adalimumab injections was increased, and prednisone therapy was initiated. However, 7 weeks before the current admission, nausea and vomiting developed, abdominal pain worsened, and the patient was admitted to this hospital. Physical examination was notable for pain on palpation of the epigas-tric area and tachycardia that resolved with the administration of intravenous fluids. The blood lipase level was normal, as were the results of liver-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The fecal calprotectin level was more than 3000 μg per gram. Results of esophagogastroduodenoscopy were normal, and biopsy specimens showed resolution of the previous gastritis. Colonoscopy revealed severe inflammation with deep ulcerations in the right side of the colon, extending from the area 1 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve to the hepatic flexure. Findings on examination of a biopsy specimen obtained from the right side of the colon were interpreted as consistent with severe active colitis; immunohistochemical staining for cytomegalovirus was negative. Treatment with intravenous glucocorticoids was initiated, with resolution of the bloody bowel movements. Adalimumab was discontinued, and infliximab was initiated. Epigastric pain decreased with the initiation of a bland diet, and on the seventh hospital day, the patient was discharged home with a plan to complete a 14-day course of empirical ciprofloxacin and metronidazole and a 6-week tapering course of oral prednisone. During the last week of the prednisone course, fever and diaphoresis developed and abdominal pain worsened. The patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evalu-ation. She reported 6 days of increased bloating and 1 day of sharp abdominal pain on the right side; she rated the pain at 9 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. She reported that her stools did not contain blood or mucus and had not changed in consistency and her bowel movements had not changed in frequency. There was no joint pain, rash, or eye redness or pain. Other history included Clostridium difficile colitis (which had been treated with oral vancomycin 29 months before presentation), polycystic ovarian syndrome, dysmenorrhea, infertility (which had led to in vitro fertilization), and piriformis syndrome. Surgical history included appendectomy 20 years before presentation, right inguinal hernia repair 2 years before presentation, and right knee arthroscopic chon-droplasty 3 months before presentation. There were no known drug allergies.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2008,22,nejm-case-2008-22,A 52-Year-Old Woman with Fever and Confusion,"Dr. Marylyn M. Addo (Infectious Disease): A 52-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital in late summer because of fever and confusion. The patient had been well until 9 days earlier, when she told family members that she felt unwell. During the next 4 days, fatigue, lethargy, tenderness over the mastoid, tingling of the tongue, myalgias of the legs, and headache developed. Five days before admission, she saw her primary care physician; results of routine laboratory tests were said to be normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the mastoid was scheduled. Two days before admission, the patient returned home from work feeling more tired and went directly to bed. The next morning, she appeared listless and would not arise; her husband noted that her skin was hot and her temperature was 39.7°C. He administered acetaminophen. Later that day, a neighbor noted that the patient appeared to be confused. Emergency medical services were called, and she was transported to another hospital by ambulance. In the emergency department, the patient was lethargic and disoriented, with slow and inappropriate responses to questions. Her temperature was 37.4°C, and her pulse 112 beats per minute; respirations were 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation was 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Her pupils were equal and reactive to light and accommodation. Mucous membranes were dry and pink. The neck was supple. She moved all limbs; reflexes and gait were not tested. Results of the remainder of the examination were normal. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and was otherwise normal. Tests of renal and liver function were normal. The results of other laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Specimens of blood were obtained for culture. A chest radiograph revealed a small amount of atelectasis in the right lung, and CT of the head without the administration of contrast material showed clear sinuses, with no evidence of bleeding, mass effect, or focal lesion. A lumbar puncture was performed; the results of an analysis of ce-rebrospinal fluid are shown in Table 2. Samples were sent for viral and bacterial cultures, polymerase-chain-reaction testing for herpes simplex virus (HSV) and West Nile virus, and testing for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi, West Nile virus, and eastern equine encephalitis virus. On reexamination by a consultant in infectious dis-eases, the patient’s neck was stiff, and there was pain on bending of the neck. Droplet precautions were instituted, and ceftriaxone (2 g), vancomycin (1 g), ampicillin (2 g), acyclovir (750 mg), and dexamethasone (12 mg) were administered intravenously. Approximately 31∕2 hours after the patient’s arrival at the hospital, a tonic–clonic seizure occurred and lasted for 20 seconds. The temperature was 39.4°C on a reading from the rectum. Fos-phenytoin (1 g) and lorazepam (2 mg) were administered intravenously, and acetaminophen (1000 mg) was given through the rectum. After the seizure, the patient became increasingly somnolent and did not respond to painful stimuli. The trachea was intubated for airway protection. Approximately 5 hours after arrival, she was transferred by ambulance to this hospital. On arrival, additional history was obtained from her husband and other relatives. She had been well and worked in an office. She was married, had no children, and lived with her husband in a rural, wooded area with a moderate amount of wetlands in southeastern Massachusetts. She had not traveled outside the state during the preceding 10 months, and she had not traveled internationally in more than 5 years. She had no allergies or recent exposures to tuberculosis or ill persons. She had no pets and no exposures to ticks, rodents, wild game, or birds. She may have eaten unpasteurized cheese in the past; she drank alcohol socially but did not smoke or use illicit drugs. She swam in a chlorinated swimming pool, spent time outdoors, and had been bitten by mosquitoes. Seven days before admission, her community was sprayed aerially because three isolates of mammal-biting mosquitoes had been identified as carrying eastern equine encephalitis virus. Her parents were deceased; she had a sister who was well. On examination, the patient was sedated, and the trachea intubated. The temperature was 37.7°C, the blood pressure 113/57 mm Hg, and the pulse 100 beats per minute. The pupils were 2 mm in diameter; the lungs were clear. There were two papules that appeared to be insect bites on the right lateral malleolus and left medial calcaneus; the results of the remainder of the examination were unchanged. Screening of serum and urine specimens for toxins was negative; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Analysis of a urine specimen revealed glucose (2+) and was otherwise normal. Specimens of blood and urine were obtained for culture. A chest radiograph showed an endotra-cheal tube in the trachea, with the tip at the level of the carina; low lung volumes with bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis; and a nasogastric tube in the stomach. The patient intermittently attempted to sit up; propofol was administered as needed for sedation. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit. Blood specimens were sent to the Massachusetts State Laboratory Institute for testing for evidence of infection with eastern equine encephalitis virus and West Nile virus. Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, dexametha-sone, acyclovir, and phenytoin were continued; insulin for hyperglycemia was administered on a sliding scale; dalteparin and esomeprazole were begun. Acetaminophen was administered as needed for fever, and potassium chloride, magnesium sulfate, and calcium gluconate were given intravenously. During the first hospital day, the maximum temperature was 38.7°C. The pupils were 1 mm in diameter and minimally reactive to light; the neck was supple. There were 2+ deep-tendon reflexes in the arms; other reflexes were absent, and the plantar responses were flexor; the remainder of the examination was normal. When propofol was transiently withheld, the patient moved all limbs and appeared agitated. Another lumbar puncture was performed (Table 2). On the second hospital day, continuous electroencephalographic monitoring revealed epilep-tiform activity that resolved after propofol was discontinued, and boluses of lorazepam and fos-phenytoin, followed by levetiracetam, were administered. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, performed without the administration of contrast material, showed areas of hyperintensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images, with mild mass effect in both cerebellar hemispheres, the left thalamus, the left insula, and the left basal ganglia. Most of the lesions had normal-to-decreased diffusion. There was no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. Swabs of the throat and rectum were obtained for viral cultures, and droplet precautions were discontinued. Examination revealed extensor posturing of the arms, purposeful withdrawal of the legs in response to painful stimuli, brisk reflexes, and clo-nus of 8 to 12 beats in the feet; the Babinski sign was present, with an extensor plantar reflex. An insulin infusion was initiated, and the use of hy-potonic intravenous solutions was discontinued. The temperature rose to 39.2°C, and a cooling blanket was applied. On the third hospital day, there was extensor posturing of all limbs, corneal reflexes were decreased, and cold caloric testing of the left ear revealed a minimal horizontal movement of the eyes. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Hypertonic saline and mannitol were infused, and an intracranial-pressure monitoring bolt was inserted. Another MRI scan of the brain showed no change. The maximum temperature was 39.9°C. On the fourth hospital day, the result of a diagnostic test was received.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2011,38,nejm-case-2011-38,A 34-Year-Old Man with Diarrhea and Weakness,"Dr. Andrew Courtwright (Medicine): A 34-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of diarrhea and weakness. Three days before admission, weakness developed in the patient’s right hand, followed by increasing weakness in the left hand. During the next 2 days, weakness progressively involved the whole body, limiting the patient’s ability to walk, and was associated with diffuse muscle pain, episodic vomiting, and multiple episodes of diarrhea. He became bedridden and required assistance with activities of daily living. He was brought to the emergency department at this hospital. The patient had had diarrhea for 6 months, which had reportedly begun after he drank “dirty water” when snowbound in northern New England. Stools were foul-smelling and intermittently watery or soft, without blood or mucus, and were associated with transient midepigastric pain; stool frequency had increased since the onset of symptoms to up to 10 times per day. Episodes of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis had occurred once or twice daily for the previous month. He reported losing 27 kg of weight during that time, from his usual weight of 82 kg. He did not have fever, chills, night sweats, headache, chest pain, visual changes, shortness of breath, cough, urinary symptoms, numbness, or tingling. Four years earlier, he had had a prolonged period of recurrent diarrhea, which had resolved spontaneously and was not as severe as the present illness. He had fractured his arm in the past and his nose after a motor vehicle accident 5 months previously. He did not take any medications, had not sought medical attention for his illness because of religious beliefs, and had no known drug allergies. He was born in Brazil, had moved to the northeastern United States 8 years earlier, and lived with friends in coastal New England. He was sexually active with men and women, including a partner who was positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The patient had a history of alcohol abuse and occasional illicit drug use (cocaine and marijuana); he reported stopping alcohol consumption 6 months earlier and stopping smoking 1.5 years before moving to the United States. He had consumed unpasteurized milk and dairy products and raw fish and meat approximately 6 months before presentation. There was no exposure to sick contacts or animals. He traveled in Brazil and the northeastern United States only. It is not known when he last visited Brazil. Several relatives had had cancer; there was no family history of diarrheal illnesses. On examination, the patient was alert and appeared ill and emaciated. The temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg, the pulse 148 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. The mucous membranes were dry. There was a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur. Bowel sounds were hyperactive, and the abdomen was soft, with su-prapubic tenderness and no organomegaly or rebound. Grasp strength was 1 out of 5, and strength of the biceps, wrist and finger flexors and extensors, arm abductors, and leg muscles was 0 out of 5. Deep-tendon reflexes were absent, and the plantar reflexes were flexor; the remainder of the examination was normal. An electrocardiogram revealed supraventricular tachycardia with atrial and ventricular rates of 131 beats per minute, with diffuse, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities; the QT interval was 276 msec, with a QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) of 407 msec. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. A stool specimen was guaiac-negative, and a chest radiograph was normal. Continuous cardiac monitoring was begun. Intravenous crystalloid and supplements of potassium chloride, magnesium sulfate, and sodium phosphate were administered; oral potassium chloride was also given. The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU), and oral intake was restricted to medications only. The level of serum thyrotropin was 6.7 μU per milliliter (reference range, 0.0 to 5.0) and free thyroxine 0.9 ng per deciliter (11.6 pmol per liter) (reference range, 0.9 to 1.8 ng per deciliter [11.6 to 23.2 pmol per liter]). Testing for hepatitis B and C viruses was negative, and levels of methemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin were normal. During the day of admission, laboratory tests were repeated every 2 to 3 hours; additional test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed a pH of 6.0 (reference range, 5.0 to 9.0), 2+ occult blood, trace albumin, and mucin; it was otherwise normal. Radiographs of the abdomen showed a mild dilatation of the small bowel, probably representative of a small-bowel ileus, with a suggestion of free air in the right upper quadrant. Cumulative stool output was 1600 ml during the first 11 hours, and urine output was 1600 ml; cumulative intravenous and oral intake was 2900 ml. On the morning of the second day, analysis of a stool specimen revealed a sodium level of 87 mmol per liter, a potassium level of 50.6 mmol per liter, osmolality of 271 mOsm per kilogram of water, and 33% fat (reference range, <20). The CD4+ T-cell count was 125 per cubic millimeter of blood. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2008,02,nejm-case-2008-02,"A 38-Year-Old Woman with Postpartum Visual Loss, Shortness of Breath, and Renal Failure","Dr. Esperance A. Schaefer (Medicine): A 38-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital, because of blurred vision and shortness of breath, 2 weeks after a cesarean section had been performed because of preeclampsia during pregnancy. The patient had been well until approximately 6 weeks before admission, at approximately 22 weeks’ gestation, when a diagnosis of preeclampsia was made at another hospital. Seventeen days before admission, at approximately 25 weeks’ gestation, acute shortness of breath and chest tightness developed, and she was admitted to the other hospital. The blood pressure was 175/105 mm Hg. Aminotransferase and uric acid levels were normal; the results of other laboratory tests are shown in Tables 1 and 2. A chest radiograph revealed increased interstitial markings and perihilar haziness, findings that were consistent with pulmonary edema. A cesarean section was performed on the third hospital day. Pathological examination of the placenta revealed an immature placenta, weighing 130 g, with infarcts, a trivessel cord, and chronic active chorionitis. The systolic blood pressure improved after the cesarean section and treatment with nifedipine and atenolol. The day after delivery, blurred vision and scotomata developed. The next day, the patient was awakened from sleep by occipital and left-temporal headaches. On examination of the eyes in an undilated state, an ophthalmologist found uveitis and placoid lesions in the choroid. Treatment with enoxaparin was begun. The patient was discharged on the 11th hospital day, with a plan for follow-up with an ophthalmologist. Five days later, 2 days before the current admission, the patient saw an ophthalmologist at another facility. Visual acuity was 20/300 in the right eye and 20/200 in the left. There were bilateral blepharoconjunctivitis, anterior nongranulomatous uveitis, scleritis, retinal vasculitis with intraretinal hemorrhages and exudates, and placoid areas of hypopigmentation in the choroids; areas of nonperfusion were seen on fluorescein angiography. For the next 2 days, daily intravenous infusions of meth-ylprednisolone (1000 mg each) were administered on an outpatient basis at the other facility; the vision in her left eye improved after the first infusion. The results of laboratory tests are shown in Tables 1 and 2. On the evening before admission, shortness of breath and a dry cough developed. On the day of admission, intravenous cyclophosphamide was added to the methylprednisolone; during the infusion, shortness of breath suddenly worsened. Auscultation of the lungs revealed bilateral rales extending from the lung bases to the midlung; oxygen was administered, and the infusion was discontinued, but intravenous access was maintained. Emergency medical services were called and were on site within 10 minutes; on examination, the blood pressure was 120/100 mm Hg; the respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute while the patient was receiving 15 liters of oxygen per minute by means of a nonrebreather mask, and respirations were labored and shallow. The lungs had diminished breath sounds, and diffuse crackles were heard. Furosemide (40 mg given intravenously) and two sublingual tablets of nitroglycerin were administered; the patient felt better, and the respiratory rate decreased. She was brought to the emergency department of this hospital. Inflammatory polyarthritis had developed in the patient at the age of 14 years, and a test for antinuclear antibody was positive; a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus was made. She received an unknown treatment for approximately 3 years, after which her symptoms resolved and medications were discontinued; she had no further symptoms or treatment. Four years before admission, deep venous thrombosis developed in the left leg, and she was treated with anticoagulants thereafter, most recently with low-molecular-weight heparin. She was gravida 1, para 1, and had no allergies. She lived with her husband; her newborn infant remained in the neonatal intensive care unit of another hospital. She was not employed, was a former smoker, and owned a dog and a cat. She did not drink alcohol and had not traveled recently. She was white. The patient’s mother was alive, in her 80s, and had had breast cancer and glaucoma; the patient’s father had died at 68 years of age, and a sibling had Ray-naud’s phenomenon. Medications on admission were nifedipine, atenolol, enoxaparin, ranitidine, polymyxin B sulfate, neomycin, and dexametha-sone ophthalmic ointment. On examination in the emergency department, the temperature was 36.4°C, the blood pressure 116/70 mm Hg, the pulse 104 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 40 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 85% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The left conjunctiva was injected; there were crackles at both lung bases, extending to the top third of the lung. Heart sounds were regular, with an S4 gallop; the jugular venous pulsations were 8 cm above the sternal angle while the patient was lying at 30 degrees; pedal edema was present. The abdominal surgical incision was not inflamed. The results of the remainder of the examination were normal. Serum electrolyte, bilirubin, aminotransferase, calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium levels were normal. Other laboratory-test results are shown in Tables 1, 2, and 3. An electrocardiogram revealed minor, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities and mild prolongation of the QT interval. A chest radiograph revealed patchy opacities at the bases of both lungs, slightly more on the right than on the left. Dalteparin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, a second dose of furosemide, and oxygen (through a nonrebreather mask) were administered; her symptoms improved, and the oxygen saturation rose to 98%. The patient was admitted to this hospital. On the second hospital day, the oxygen saturation was 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air; laboratory data are shown in Tables 1, 2, and 3. Renal ultrasonography showed no structural or vascular abnormalities. Intravenous methylprednisolone (500 mg) was administered daily for 3 days. Two sets of blood cultures obtained on the second hospital day were negative. The antibiotics and dalteparin were discontinued, and treatment with unfractionated heparin was begun. On the third and fourth hospital days, the urine output decreased. The laboratory-test results are listed in Tables 1, 2, and 3. Visual acuity was 20/400 in both eyes. On the fifth hospital day, nausea, arthralgias, and generalized edema developed. A transtho-racic echocardiogram showed left ventricular dilatation and diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis, with an ejection fraction of 44%. There was moderate mitral regurgitation, mild aortic insufficiency, and mild elevation of the estimated right ventricular systolic pressure (47 mm Hg). Sero-logic testing for hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus infections was negative. Methylprednisolone was discontinued, and prednisone was given orally. On the sixth hospital day, the iron-binding capacity and the iron, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein levels were normal; other laboratory-test results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Visual acuity was 20/200 bilaterally. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2011,18,nejm-case-2011-18,A 35-Year-Old HIV-Positive Woman with Headache and Altered Mental Status,"Dr. Mikael Rinne (Neurology): A 35-year-old right-handed woman with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was admitted to this hospital because of headache and altered mental status after a motor vehicle accident. Earlier that day, while driving without a seatbelt, the patient was involved in a head-on collision at low speed. She did not lose consciousness but was noted by witnesses to behave strangely. On evaluation at another hospital, she was disoriented. There were no external signs of trauma, and the vital signs were normal. Results of routine laboratory studies were normal. Computed tomography of the head, without the administration of contrast material, revealed prominent areas of low attenuation in both hemispheres, without contusions or hemorrhage. Dexamethasone was administered intravenously, and the patient was transferred to this hospital. In the emergency department, the patient reported a mild headache but no other symptoms. She had no recollection of the accident. Four years before admission, a diagnosis of HIV infection had been made on HIV testing performed after a gynecologic examination had revealed high-grade cervical dysplasia. The CD4 T-lymphocyte count was 211 cells per cubic millimeter, and the plasma HIV RNA level was 476,000 viral copies per milliliter. There was no evidence of active coinfection with hepatitis B or C, syphilis, or Mycobacteriumtuberculosis. Antibodies to cytomegalovirus (CMV) were detected in the patient’s serum; antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii were not detected. Antiretroviral treatment was begun; subsequently, CD4 T-cell counts remained consistently above 200 cells per cubic millimeter, and there was a fall in the plasma HIV load to less than 400 RNA copies per milliliter. Two years before admission, daily headaches developed, which gradually worsened during a period of several weeks. The patient was admitted to another hospital, where cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed a lymphocytic pleocytosis. She was treated with intravenous acyclovir, and the headaches gradually resolved during a 2-month period. Six months later, the headaches returned. She was admitted to this hospital because of severe daily headaches, general malaise, photophobia, vomiting, and gait instability. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain after the administration of intravenous gadolinium revealed diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement, with extensive asymmetric hyperintensity on T2 -weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images of the subcortical and deep white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, basal ganglia, and dorsal pons. IgG antibodies to herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) were present in the serum; results of analysis of the CSF that was obtained by lumbar puncture are shown in Table 1. A diagnosis of Mollaret’s meningitis (recurrent aseptic meningitis usually caused by members of the family Herpesviridae) was made, and acyclovir was administered intravenously for 10 days. The patient was discharged while she was taking prophylactic oral valacyclovir and was referred to the neurology clinic. When the patient was seen in the neurology clinic 1 year before this admission, the headaches had improved somewhat and she had no other symptoms. She described the headaches as dull, mild, constant, holocephalic, and without focal features. Funduscopic examination revealed bilateral optic-disk swelling. The neurologic examination, which included a basic screening cognitive assessment, was otherwise normal. Two weeks later, lumbar puncture revealed an opening pressure of 38 cm of water. Results of laboratory studies performed at that time are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Acetazolamide was prescribed, but the patient did not take it. On follow-up 1 month later, the headaches had improved further and the optic-disk swelling had resolved. Results of CSF analysis performed when she was asymptomatic are shown in Table 1. Follow-up MRI of the head (when the patient was asymptomatic) revealed resolution of the pachymeningeal enhancement but persistence of the extensive confluent signal abnormalities in the white matter of both hemispheres. During the ensuing months, she remained well except for a brief recurrence of headache that was associated with mild forgetfulness 5 months before admission, which resolved without intervention. The patient had a history of bacterial pneumonia, mild depression, and a hysterectomy performed because of cervical dysplasia. On admission, her medications included lopinavir boosted by ritonavir, emtricitabine–tenofovir, valacyclovir, and paroxetine. She had no known allergies to medications. She was born in sub-Saharan Africa and had immigrated to the United States 6 years earlier. She was a divorced health care worker. She did not have children. She drank alcohol occasionally. She did not smoke or use illicit drugs. She had had five sexual partners in her lifetime but was not currently sexually active. One sister had died of HIV and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in Africa. Her parents and other siblings were healthy. There was no family history of neurologic disease. On examination, she was alert but bewildered and fearful, oriented to self only, with limited insight into her situation. She was inattentive and distractible and was unable to articulate concerns coherently. Her level of activity varied from severe psychomotor retardation to agitation. She followed two-step commands but was unable to perform more complex tasks. Her language seemed normal, although she spoke little. Testing of other cognitive domains was precluded by marked inattention. The vital signs were normal. The pupils were symmetric, 3 mm in diameter, and briskly reactive to light stimuli. The deep-tendon reflexes were diffusely brisk, and the plantar responses were extensor bilaterally. The remainder of the neurologic and general physical examination was normal. MRI of the head, after the administration of gadolinium, revealed extensive diffuse signal abnormality within the white matter, in a distribution that was different from that of the most recent study 4 months earlier, with some areas of improvement but with new abnormalities in other areas. Meningeal enhancement was not evident. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck was unremarkable. The patient was admitted to the neurology service, where her regular medications were continued. Urinary incontinence was noted on the first day. On the second day, a lumbar puncture revealed an opening pressure of 20 cm of water; results of CSF analysis are shown in Table 1. An electroencephalogram showed diffuse theta-range slowing and intermittent and more prominent delta-range slowing over the anterior regions. During the next several days, her neurologic examination remained unchanged. On the sixth day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,35,nejm-case-2010-35,"A 56-Year-Old Man with Cough, Hypoxemia, and Rash","A 56-year-old man was admitted to the hospital in the autumn because of cough, hypoxemia, and a rash. The patient had been well until 9 days earlier, when light-headedness, diffuse myalgias, chills, sweats, and extreme fatigue developed, which he thought were related to influenza. The next day, a rash, which he described as red and pimply, “like the beginning of poison ivy,” developed over his chest and axillae; it gradually improved but did not resolve. A dry cough developed, which prevented him from finishing sentences. There was no pruritus, rhinorrhea, or sore throat. Five days before admission, the cough worsened and was associated with sharp substernal chest pain on inspiration, dry mouth, anorexia, malaise, and light-headedness that improved with lying down. The next day, he saw his physician. The physical examination was normal. Azithromycin was prescribed. The cough persisted, worsened, and remained nonproductive; it was improved at rest and was worse with exertion and while the patient was lying on his right side. Fatigue increased and night sweats continued; dyspnea while climbing one flight of stairs developed, and he was unable to take a deep breath without discomfort or coughing. On the day of admission, the patient returned to the doctor’s office. The temperature was 36.7°C, the blood pressure 124/70 mm Hg while he was standing, the pulse 76 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 88 to 90% while he was breathing ambient air. He was sent to the emergency department at this hospital. He reported no weight loss, wheezing, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or urinary symptoms. He had a history of hyper-lipidemia, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and depression. He was born in Spain and immigrated to the United States as an infant; he had lived in Florida, the Caribbean, and, most recently, the Northeast. Three weeks earlier, he had returned from a 2-week trip to Arizona, where he had stayed in hotels, eaten well-cooked meals, and gone horseback riding in the desert and mountains approximately 4 hours per day, including participating in a cattle roundup over a windswept plain. He had also traveled to Wyoming for a horseback-riding trip 5 months earlier, and he had been to Spain and England in the past. He was married, monogamous with his wife, and self-employed in construction. He owned cats, was not aware of any tick or flea bites, and had not been swimming. He drank alcohol moderately and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. His mother had died of esophageal cancer, and his father had a history of alcohol abuse. Medications included simvastatin, extended-release venlafaxine, and buspirone hydrochloride. He had no known allergies. On examination, the temperature was 36.1°C, the blood pressure 130/70 mm Hg, the pulse 72 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 90% while he was breathing ambient air and 96% while he was breathing 4 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula. The oral mucosa was dry. There were crackles in the middle and lower fields of the left lung and in the right lung base, with egophony on the left. A faint morbilliform rash was present on the flanks bilaterally. There was no edema or clubbing. The remainder of the examination was normal. Urinalysis revealed ketones (1+) and was otherwise normal. Levels of electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus and tests of renal function were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram revealed evidence of left atrial enlargement and intraventricular conduction defect. Chest radiographs revealed bilateral patchy opacities, more in the right lung than in the left lung. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed according to the protocol for a pulmonary embolism, revealed multifocal consolidation and ground-glass opacities in all lobes of both lungs, most marked in the right upper lobe, and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (lymph nodes that measured up to 2.3 cm in the short-axis diameter). There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism. The administration of levofloxacin was begun, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. On the second day, testing of a nasal-swab specimen was negative for antigens of adenovirus, influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3. Gram’s staining of a sputum specimen showed squamous epithelial cells, a few polymorphonu-clear leukocytes, and very few mixed gram-positive organisms, and a fungal wet preparation showed no organisms. Cultures of specimens of sputum, blood, and urine were obtained. Additional test results for the second and third days are shown in Table 1. The administration of flu-conazole was begun. On the fifth day, a specimen of peripheral blood analyzed by means of flow cytometry revealed 92.7% T lymphocytes (reference range, 59 to 88) but was otherwise normal. Cultures of the blood and urine were sterile. A urine test for le-gionella antigen and a serum test for antibodies to Legionella pneumophila serogroups were negative, and antibody testing was equivocal for non-pneumophila species. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,08,nejm-case-2012-08,"A 53-Year-Old Man with Crohn’s Disease, Diarrhea, Fever, and Bacteremia","Dr. Jacob Soumerai (Internal Medicine): A 53-year-old man with Crohn’s disease who was receiving immunosuppressive therapy was admitted to this hospital because of diarrhea, fever, and bacteremia. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 days before admission, when he awoke with severe malaise and headache. His symptoms improved transiently until the late afternoon, when sharp, fluctuating abdominal pain and four episodes of urgent, uncontrollable nonbloody diarrhea occurred. That night, malaise worsened, and his temperature rose to 39.8°C. At 5 a.m., he took acetaminophen (500 mg). Later that morning, he called his physician’s office and was advised to go to the walk-in unit at this hospital. On evaluation, he stated that his symptoms had improved and he had no pain. The temperature was 36.1°C, the blood pressure 107/71 mm Hg, and the pulse 85 beats per minute. The remainder of the examination was normal. Levels of platelets and blood amylase, lipase, alkaline phosphatase, and aspartate aminotransferase were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Cultures of the blood were obtained, and the patient returned home. Later that afternoon, his temperature rose to 38.3°C. He called his gastroenterologist, and amoxi-cillin–clavulanate was prescribed. The next day, blood cultures were reported to be positive. He was told to return to the hospital and was admitted. On admission, the patient reported a mild sore throat that he attributed to allergies; he had no neck stiffness, photosensitivity, nausea, vomiting, cough, or urinary symptoms. He had had Crohn’s disease since the age of 15 years, for which a right hemicolectomy and resection of the terminal ileum (including the cecum) had been performed 20 years earlier. His symptomatic flares were occasionally associated with subjective low-grade fevers. Stool frequency had recently increased from 4 to as many as 12 per day. He had been taking adalimumab for approximately 6 years and methotrexate for 3 months. Eight weeks before admission, while the patient was on these medications, examination by means of flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed a diffuse area of moderately erythematous, friable mucosa in the proximal sigmoid colon, with superficial linear ulcerations. Pathological examination of colonic tissue obtained by biopsy revealed severely active chronic colitis with extensive ulceration. Adalimumab and methotrexate were stopped, and a course of prednisone was administered (40 mg daily, tapering to 10 mg daily on the day of admission), accompa-nied by two intravenous infusions of 300 mg of natalizumab (administered 5 weeks and 1 week before admission). This regimen resulted in a marked improvement in symptoms and a reduction in stool frequency, to four or five per day. Previous therapy for Crohn’s disease had included infliximab, intermittent courses of glucocorti-coids (orally and per rectum), and mesalamine tablets and suppositories. The patient also had Parkinson’s disease, osteopenia of the femoral neck, allergic rhinitis, insomnia, and hypertri-glyceridemia. Medications included rasagiline, mupirocin, folic acid, alendronate, pramipexole, carbidopa and levodopa in combination, diphenox-ylate with atropine, and ergocalciferol. He was reportedly allergic to 6-mercaptopurine, which had caused pancreatitis. He was married, had children, and worked in an office. He drank alcohol in moderation and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. He maintained a normal diet and frequently ate cantaloupe and other fruit, some of which was purchased at farm stands. He reported that his wife was feeling some malaise but did not have fever or diarrhea. There was no family history of inflammatory bowel disease. On examination, the blood pressure was 120/65 mm Hg, the pulse 88 beats per minute, the temperature 37.2°C, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Bowel sounds were normal; the abdomen was slightly tender in the right lower quadrant, without rebound, guarding, or organomegaly, and there was brown stool in the rectum. The remainder of the examination was normal. Levels of blood electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were tests of renal function and an electrocardiogram; other test results are shown in Table 1.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,23,nejm-case-2010-23,"A 49-Year-Old Man with Erythrocytosis, Perinephric Fluid Collections, and Renal Failure","Dr. David B. Sykes (Hematology–Oncology): A 49-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of erythrocytosis, perinephric collections of fluid, and acute renal failure. The patient had been well until 7 years earlier, when routine testing at another facility revealed a hematocrit of 58.1%; the level of erythropoietin was 16.2 mIU per milliliter (reference range, 4.1 to 19.5). Ultrasonography of the abdomen reportedly revealed normal-size kidneys, with no hydronephrosis or cysts, and several hepatic lesions (approximately 1 cm in diameter) that were consistent with hemangiomas. A presumptive diagnosis of polycythemia vera was made, and therapeutic phleboto-my was performed every 6 to 8 weeks thereafter. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen 8 months later showed no abnormalities. Thirteen months and 16 months later, the erythropoietin level was 977 and 1747 mIU per milliliter, respectively. A small IgG kappa paraprotein was detected; testing for urinary Bence Jones protein was negative. Ten months before admission, shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion developed. During the next 3 months, the patient was evaluated at another facility. CT of the chest was performed according to a protocol for detection of pulmonary emboli; the scans showed moderate bilateral pleural effusions, without evidence of pulmonary embolism. Sampling of the pleural fluid by thoracentesis revealed a tran-sudative fluid; no organisms were seen on Gram’s staining, and the culture was sterile. Ultrasonography of the abdomen reportedly revealed multiple new bilateral perinephric cysts and a small amount of ascites. The results of echocardiography were normal. Levels of albumin, bilirubin, lipase, and amylase and tests of liver function were normal; tests for antibodies to double-stranded DNA, viral hepatitis (hepatitis A, B, and C viruses), and human immunodeficiency virus were negative; other results are shown in Table 1. Analysis of a 24-hour urine collection showed normal levels of protein and creatinine clearance. Six months before admission, pathological examination of a bone marrow–biop-sy specimen showed a mildly hypercellular marrow with trilineage hematopoiesis; kappa-restricted plasma cells made up approximately 5% of the marrow cellularity. The karyo-type was normal. Renal ultrasonography revealed small clusters of cysts (≤1.9 cm in diameter), which were larger than previously reported, along the periphery of both kidneys, as well as bilateral, small pleural effusions. Testing for rheumatoid factor was negative; other results are shown in Table 1. Five months before admission, the mean corpuscular volume was 64 μm3 (reference range, 80 to 100), and levels of iron and ferritin were low. Tests for BCR-ABL translocation and the V617F mutation in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene were negative. Other results are shown in Table 1. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis reportedly showed bilateral pleural effusions, hypodense lesions in the liver, and minimal ascites. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen revealed hepatic hemangiomas, cystic lesions along the periphery of both kidneys, minimal ascites, and no lymph-adenopathy. Laparoscopic examination of the peritoneal cavity was normal; examination of the as-citic fluid and biopsy specimens of the liver and peritoneal fat pad showed no evidence of hepatic fibrosis, excess iron, amyloid, or malignant cells. One month before admission, the patient was awakened from sleep by a sensation of “popping,” followed by acute pain and bulging in the left flank. CT of the abdomen revealed a dramatic increase in the left perinephric collection of fluid, which encompassed the entire kidney, and a larger left pleural effusion. Aspiration of the perinephric collection was performed; cytopathological examination of the fluid was negative for malignant cells. Pathological examination of tissue from CT-guided biopsies of the right kidney reportedly showed findings suspicious for immunoglobulin-light-chain–deposition disease. Cytologic examination of fluid from the left pleural effusion and examination of a needle-biopsy specimen of the pleura revealed no malignant cells. The fluid around the left kidney rapidly reaccumulated and was aspirated three more times, each time involving the removal of approximately 1 liter. Six days before admission, the patient was seen in the cancer center of this hospital. The patient reported gradually increasing pain in the left flank. During the previous 5 years, telangiectasias had developed on the skin and in the oropharynx. A diagnosis of non–insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus had been made when the patient was 38 years of age. Seventeen months before this evaluation, thrombosis of the right internal jugular vein had occurred; an evaluation for hypercoagulability was negative, and warfarin was administered for 6 months. Bilateral laparo-scopic inguinal herniorrhaphies had been performed 3 years earlier. The patient lived in the southeastern United States with his wife and children. He worked in an office and reported no occupational exposures to toxins or recent foreign travel. He drank minimal alcohol and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. He was of Eastern European ancestry; his parents had had diabetes mellitus in their 70s, his siblings and children were healthy, and his maternal grandfather and one cousin had poly-cystic kidney disease. His only medication was glimepiride; he had no known allergies. On examination, the patient appeared comfortable. The vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. There were decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion over both lung bases, more on the left side than on the right side. There were multiple small telangiectasias (<5 mm in diameter) on the oropharyngeal mucosa and the skin of the hands, arms, and trunk. The remainder of the examination was normal. The level of carboxyhemoglobin and tests of liver function were normal; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. MRI and magnetic resonance angiography of the brain and MRI of the spine were normal. MRI scans of the abdomen after the administration of gadolinium showed a small left pleural effusion; unchanged lesions in the liver; a large fluid collection (18.2 cm by 11.1 cm) surrounding the left kidney, which was displaced anteriorly; a small amount of perinephric fluid on the right side; and ascites. CT with positron-emission tomography revealed a nodule (5 mm in diameter) in the upper lobe of the left lung (without the uptake of tracer), hepatic heman-giomas, a large left perinephric collection of fluid with mass effect on the left renal vessels, a small right perinephric collection of fluid, and ascites. Testing for mutations in the von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) gene was negative. Two days later, a drain was placed in the peri-nephric area on the left side with the use of ul-trasonographic guidance, and clear, yellow fluid (750 ml) was aspirated. During the next 3 days, the catheter drained between 1900 and 2700 ml of fluid daily, and the patient reported decreased urination. Analysis of the fluid revealed levels of lactate dehydrogenase of 5 U per liter, cholesterol of less than 25 mg per deciliter (0.6 mmol per liter), and triglycerides of 4 mg per deciliter (0.05 mmol per liter). One day before admission, arterial blood gas analysis while the patient was breathing ambient air revealed a pH of 7.36 and partial pressures of carbon dioxide of 32 mm Hg (reference range, 35 to 42) and of oxygen of 78 mm Hg (reference range, 80 to 100); the white-cell count, the differential count, and the results of hemoglobin electrophoresis were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. On the day of admission, angiographic sampling of the superior vena cava, the inferior vena cava, and the hepatic and renal veins revealed similarly elevated levels of erythropoietin. The patient was admitted to this hospital. The results of an ophthalmologic examination were normal. On the third day, the drain was clamped. Testing for tumor markers and for human herpes-virus 8 (HHV-8) DNA by means of polymerase chain reaction was negative; no Bence Jones protein was found in a concentrated urine specimen. Other test results are shown in Table 1. On the sixth day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,39,nejm-case-2019-39,A 57-Year-Old Woman with Hypotension and Trauma after a Motorcycle Accident,"Dr. Jordan P. Bloom (Surgery): A 57-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital after a motorcycle accident. The patient was the helmeted operator of a motorcycle traveling at 64 km per hour that collided head on with a car coming from the opposite direction. The patient’s body was launched over the motorcycle handlebars; her helmet remained intact. Emergency medical services personnel and an advanced response team found the patient lying in the prone position, where she was noted to be confused and to have repetitive speech. She reported pain in the left hip, weakness in the left leg, and difficulty breathing. The heart rate was 118 beats per minute, the blood pressure 78/48 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 46 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was receiving oxygen through a nonrebreath-er face mask at a rate of 15 liters per minute. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 8 (on a scale of 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating greater alteration of consciousness), and the pupils were unequal (the left was 3 mm in diameter, and the right was 4 mm) but reactive. The hands and feet were cool with weak pulses. The pelvis appeared grossly deformed; the patient was immobilized with a pelvic binder, a cervical collar, and a backboard. Intraosseous access was established in the left humerus, and two peripheral intravenous catheters were inserted in the right arm; intravenous fluid and phenylephrine boluses were administered. Owing to the patient’s altered mental status and the development of hypopnea, the trachea was intubated after rapid-sequence induction with etomidate and succinylcholine. The patient was transported by helicopter directly to the emergency department of this hospital. During transport, 2 liters of normal saline, 2 units of packed red cells, fentanyl, ketamine, rocuronium, and phenylephrine were administered intravenously; an intravenous bolus of 3% hypertonic saline was also administered because of concerns about intracranial injury. On the patient’s arrival at this hospital, the temperature was 35.6°C, the heart rate 101 beats per minute, and the blood pressure in the left arm 60/40 mm Hg. The height was 165 cm and the weight 80 kg. The oxygen saturation was 100% while the patient was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator (respiratory rate, 18 breaths per minute; tidal volume, 370 ml; positive end-expiratory pressure, 5 cm of water; fraction of inspired oxygen, 1.0). The neu-rologic examination was limited owing to the administration of an anesthetic agent; the GCS score was 3T (the suffix “T” indicates that the trachea was intubated). There was palpable deformity of the left clavicle, but there was no evidence of trauma to the head, arms, or back. The neck was supple, and the trachea was positioned in the midline. Carotid and femoral pulses were symmetric and weakly palpable. Breath sounds were slightly diminished at the base of the left lung, and there was no evidence of rib fractures or flail chest. The abdomen was soft but was not distended. A 5-cm laceration with active bleeding extended from the pubic symphysis to the left labium majus. The pelvis was grossly unstable, with a pelvic binder in place. There were marked ecchymoses and gross deformity of the left thigh; on the upper medial left thigh, there was a circular wound measuring 2 cm in diameter, with active bleeding. The lengths of the right and left legs appeared equal, and the compartments of both legs were soft. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) did not reveal fluid in the pericardial, hepatorenal, splenorenal, or suprapubic recesses. Because the patient had persistent hypotension, a catheter was inserted in the left subclavian vein, and 8 units of packed red cells and one dose of tranexamic acid were prepared for intravenous infusion. Emergency management decisions were made, and therapeutic procedures were performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2009,39,nejm-case-2009-39,A 28-Year-Old Pregnant Woman with Acute Cardiac Failure,"Dr. Brad W. Butcher (Medicine): A 28-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital 2 days post partum because of cardiac failure. The patient had been well, except for gestational diabetes mellitus, until 4 weeks earlier (approximately 29 weeks’ gestation), when retrosternal chest discomfort developed, followed by shortness of breath, myalgias, and fatigue. One week later, she went to the emergency department of another hospital. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Cephalexin and a proton-pump inhibitor were prescribed. Two days later, she returned to the hospital because of persistent symptoms. She had no fevers, night sweats, upper respiratory symptoms, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, arthralgias, or urinary tract symptoms. The temperature was 35.9°C, the blood pressure 117/69 mm Hg, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while she was breathing ambient air. Breath sounds were decreased at both lung bases, with bronchial breath sounds and egophony on the right. The size of the uterus was consistent with the gestational age, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. She was admitted to the hospital. The next day, ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant revealed a right pleural effusion, trace ascites, and sludge in the gallbladder, with no evidence of cholecys-titis. Tests for antinuclear antibody and antibodies to smooth muscle and mito-chondria were negative; tests for viral hepatitis were consistent with previous hepatitis B vaccination. During the next 2 days, dyspnea increased and orthopnea developed. On the fourth day, the systolic blood pressure decreased to 80 to 90 mm Hg. A chest radiograph showed a widened mediastinum, an enlarged cardio-pericardial silhouette, and a large right-sided pleural effusion. Ultrasonography of the legs showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with right-axis deviation and low voltage in the limb leads. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a large, circumferential pericardial effusion with evidence of tamponade, a right-sided pleural effusion, and an edematous-appearing aortic root. A pericardial window was created using a subxiphoid approach, with placement of a right chest tube and pericardial drain. Serosanguineous pericardial fluid (700 ml) was drained. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), estimated at 40% before the procedure, rose to 65 to 70% after the procedure. Pathological examination of a biopsy specimen of the pericardium reportedly showed a lymphocytic infiltrate with scattered eosinophils. Cytologic analysis of the pericardial fluid showed inflammatory and reactive mesothelial cells. Microbio-logic studies for bacteria, acid-fast bacteria, fungus, and adenovirus were negative. Testing of serum for antibodies to Epstein–Barr viral antigens reportedly showed evidence of recent infection. Testing for IgG antibody against myco-plasma was positive, and testing for infection with coxsackie A virus, echovirus, adenovirus, herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, parvovi-rus B19, toxoplasma, chlamydia species, coxiella species, borrelia species, and syphilis was negative, as were results for antistreptolysin antibodies, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies. Levels of thyrotropin, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and complement were normal. After the procedure, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Dyspnea persisted, and the blood pressure reportedly rose. Continuous nicardipine infusion and high-flow oxygen were administered. On the 10th day, there was a pulsus paradoxus of 25 mm Hg, and the jugular veins were distended to the jawline while the patient sat upright. Administration of methyl-prednisolone, furosemide, and enoxaparin were begun. Oliguria and anasarca developed, and the pleural effusions increased. On the 13th day, an echocardiogram reportedly revealed a thickened pericardium (1.5 to 2.0 cm) tethered to the left ventricular apex, a severely hypokinetic right ventricular apex, a dilated inferior vena cava, and a small, circumferential pericardial effusion. Results of laboratory tests from the 15th day are shown in Table 1. On the 15th day, at 32 weeks 4 days of gestation, a cesarean section was performed, and a 1.8-kg male infant was delivered. Hemodynamic findings from right heart catheterization were consistent with low cardiac output and elevated filling pressures in the left and right sides of the heart. Dobutamine was begun. High filling pressures were necessary to maintain adequate cardiac output, and anasarca increased. Serial echo-cardiograms showed a persistent pericardial effusion, akinesis of both ventricular apexes, and biventricular hypertrophy. On the 17th day, the patient was transferred to this hospital. Medications on transfer included methylprednisolone, famotidine, midazolam, morphine, fentanyl drip, dobutamine, furosemide, and inhalation therapy with budesonide–formoterol and albuterol. The patient had received regular prenatal care; an episode of genital herpes simplex had resolved with treatment. Testing for the human immunodeficiency virus was negative. Two previous pregnancies had been electively terminated. She had asthma and used an albuterol inhaler. Skin tests for tuberculosis had been negative. She was single, in a monogamous relationship, and employed. She owned a dog, had stopped smoking after learning of her pregnancy, and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. She lived in another state in the northeastern United States, had not traveled recently, and had no exposures to sick persons, toxins, irritants, tick or insect bites, or other animals. On examination, the patient was sedated and the trachea intubated. The blood pressure was 132/93 mm Hg, the pulse 121 beats per minute, the temperature 36.9°C, the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute while she was ventilated, and the oxygen saturation 94% on 100% inspired oxygen. The pulmonary-artery pressure was 58/34 mm Hg (mean, 42), the mean pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure 36 mm Hg, the central venous pressure 41 mm Hg, the cardiac output 5 liters per minute, the cardiac index 2.4 liters per minute per square meter of body-surface area, and the systemic vascular resistance 943 dyn·sec·cm−5. The breath sounds were coarse and obscured by ventilator sounds; the first and second heart sounds were normal with no murmurs. The abdominal wall was edematous, and there was evidence of ascites. The limbs were cool and edematous, and there were ecchymoses at the sites of injections, with no rash or stigmata of embolic disease. Tests of coagulation, levels of serum electrolytes and free light chains, serum and urine protein electrophoresis, and analysis of the urine were normal. Other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph revealed a widened mediastinum, enlarged hila and cardiac silhouette, and pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy and a diffusely hypo-kinetic left ventricle (ejection fraction, 38%). The right ventricle was diffusely hypokinetic but not dilated. Right ventricular systolic pressure was estimated at 52 mm Hg. The pericardium was thickened with deposition of fibrin or clot on the visceral pericardium, without tamponade. The mixed venous oxygen saturation was 49%. Furo-semide, dobutamine, vasopressors, and stress doses of corticosteroids were administered. The tip of the pulmonary-artery catheter, the site of the chest tube, the nares, and specimens of blood, urine, and sputum were cultured; administration of van-comycin, cefepime, and metronidazole was begun. On the second day, pathological examination of a fine-needle aspiration sample of the abdominal fat pad showed no evidence of amyloidosis. On the third day, the temperature rose to 39.4°C. Testing of the blood for heparin–platelet factor 4 antibody was positive; enoxaparin was stopped and lepirudin was begun and later changed to argatroban. During the next 3 days, the cardiac output and systemic blood pressure fell and profound hypoxemia developed, which was treated with milrinone and increasing doses of vasopres-sors. Episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response occurred, and amiodarone was administered. Low-volume ventilation was initiated, and chlorothiazide and inhaled nitric oxide were administered. The patient was considered to be too ill to leave the ICU for imaging studies. On the sixth day, bedside transesophageal echocardiography showed prominent thickening of the walls of the ascending aorta and the main pulmonary artery and its branches and narrowing of the pulmonary veins. Thrombus was present in the left atrial appendage and in the right atrium. There was no atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale. Ultrasonographic examination revealed thrombosis of the right internal jugular vein. Testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic auto-antibodies (ANCA) was negative. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration was initiated. On the seventh day, venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was begun. Portable ultra-sonographic examination of the chest showed a well-circumscribed, ovoid, hypoechoic lesion (2.8 cm by 1.1 cm by 1.6 cm) in the left upper medi-astinum and diminished flow in the right sub-clavian vein. Pathological examination of a biopsy specimen of the femoral artery showed no evidence of vasculitis. Flow-cytometric examination of a specimen of peripheral blood revealed normal lymphocytes. On the eighth day, echocardiography showed an LVEF of 26%. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain, performed at the bedside without the administration of contrast material, revealed normal brain parenchyma and swelling of the soft tissues of the head and neck. On the ninth day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2011,22,nejm-case-2011-22,"A 79-Year-Old Man with a Rash, Arthritis, and Ocular Erythema","Dr. Sebastian Unizony (Rheumatology): A 79-year-old man was seen in the rheumatol-ogy clinic at this hospital because of a rash, joint swelling and pain in the hands, and ocular erythema. The patient had been in his usual health until approximately 2.5 months earlier, when pain developed in his elbows, knees, hips, and wrists shortly after he returned from a rafting trip in Montana. He took ibuprofen and naproxen, with minimal improvement. After several days, he went to the emergency department at another hospital. Doxycycline was prescribed for 3 weeks. Serologic testing for Lyme disease was reportedly negative, but he completed the antibiotic course. Nine weeks before the current evaluation, the patient returned to the other hospital with weakness and diaphoresis. On examination, the pulse was 140 beats per minute and irregular, and the systolic blood pressure was 80 mm Hg. A diagnosis of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was made. Diltiazem and intravenous fluids were administered, and normal sinus rhythm resumed. The patient was discharged home, taking lisinopril and acetylsalicylic acid. One week after discharge, swelling of the tongue, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath developed, and an urticarial rash appeared on his arms, trunk, and hips. He was admitted to a second hospital, where a diagnosis of angioedema, possibly due to lisinopril allergy, was made. Atrial fibrillation had recurred. Lisinopril was stopped, and metoprolol tartrate was administered. Cardioversion was performed, with restoration of sinus rhythm. Approximately 7 weeks before the current evaluation, he was seen in the outpatient clinic at this hospital. The vital signs were normal. Urticarial lesions were present on the arms, trunk, and hips, and petechial lesions were present on the legs. The serum level of sodium was 131 mmol per liter (reference range, 135 to 146), and the level of chloride was 96 mmol per liter (reference range, 99 to 111). Measurements of other electrolytes, calcium, glucose, iron, total iron-binding capacity, thyrotropin, and cortisol (measured in the afternoon) were normal. Testing for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi was negative; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were sterile. Six weeks before the current evaluation, the patient saw a dermatologist. He reported having an influenza-like illness with cough and congestion for 4 weeks. Mildly pruritic wheals were scattered on the abdomen and arms; a faint morbilliform rash was present on the arms, trunk, back, and thighs; there was palpable purpura on both shins; and there was scleral injection (greater in the right eye than in the left eye). A biopsy specimen of a skin lesion on the right calf was obtained; pathological examination revealed findings consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Cetirizine, hydroxyzine, and topical triamcinolone were prescribed. Five weeks before the current evaluation, the patient went to a third hospital because of right lower abdominal pain. He rated the pain at 6 to 7 on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain; it was neither precipitated nor relieved by eating, and he had no nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or hematochezia. Serum levels of electrolytes, alkaline phosphatase, amylase, and lipase were normal, as were tests of renal and liver function; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis was normal, and a blood culture was sterile. Computed tomography reportedly ruled out appendicitis. The symptoms improved with hydration, and the patient was discharged the next day. The following day, the patient returned to the dermatologist. The cutaneous examination was unchanged. A tapering 12-day course of predni-sone (starting dose, 60 mg per day) and azithro-mycin (5-day course) were prescribed. At a followup appointment 16 days later, the patient reported persistent fatigue. On examination, persistent pur-pura was present on the legs; the truncal rash had decreased. The use of triamcinolone cream was continued. Six days later, he saw an ophthalmologist because of red eyes. Examination reportedly showed diffuse bilateral scleral injection, worse in the right eye, chemosis, and decreased tears. Glucocorticoid ophthalmic drops and a lubricant ophthalmic solution were prescribed. Eight days before the current evaluation, atrial fibrillation recurred, and the patient was admitted again to the third hospital. During that admission, pain and swelling in the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints of both hands developed. Serologic tests for hepatitis A, B, and C viruses, and tests for B. burgdorferi, Babesia microti, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, ehrlichia species, cryo-globulins, and antibodies to proteinase 3 and my-eloperoxidase were negative. The levels of thyrotropin, troponin I, and cholesterol were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. The ad-ministration of warfarin was begun, and the patient was discharged the next day. Six days later, the patient returned to the dermatologist. He reported continued pain and swelling in his hands, which interfered with sleep, and worsening rash. On examination, the meta-carpophalangeal joints of the hands were tender and swollen. There were palpable purpura on the legs, which appeared to have improved since the last visit; the urticarial lesions on the hands and morbilliform papules that coalesced to plaques on his thighs, arms, and trunk had all increased in number since the previous examination. The remainder of the musculoskeletal examination was normal. Radiographs of the hands showed diffuse osteopenia and degenerative changes, predominantly involving the first carpometacarpal joint and the right proximal interphalangeal joint of the fifth digit, but no erosions. The administration of prednisone, 20 mg twice daily, was begun. Two days later, the patient was seen in the rheumatology clinic at this hospital. The patient had a history of hypertension, osteoarthritis of the knees, macular degeneration, actinic and seborrheic keratoses, basal-cell carcinomas, a benign arachnoid cyst, an abdominal venous malformation, benign prostatic hypertrophy, and lower-extremity thrombophlebitis; he was heterozygous for the factor V Leiden mutation. He was married, lived in a suburb, and was retired from an office position. He drank alcohol rarely and did not smoke. Medications included predni-sone, zolpidem, aspirin, digoxin, metoprolol, and omeprazole. He was thought to be allergic to lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide had caused hy-ponatremia. His father had died of complications of Parkinson’s disease at 76 years of age, and his mother and uncle had died of colon cancer (his mother at 69 years of age); his children were well. On examination, the patient appeared well. The sclerae were injected and were a deep purplish hue in some areas (Fig. 1A). There were scattered nonpruritic urticarial plaques on the neck and anterior trunk and palpable purpuric macules extending from the dorsal surfaces of both feet to the groin (Fig. 1B, 1C, and 1D). The metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalan-geal joints were swollen and tender, and the patient was unable to make a fist. The results of a test for antibodies to parvovirus were consistent with past infection; assays for antibodies to lep-tospira, Ro (SSA), La (SSB), Sm, RNP, and cyclic citrullinated peptides (CCP) were negative, as were assays for cryoglobulins and C3d immune complex. No Bence Jones protein was detected in the urine. Other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,32,nejm-case-2012-32,A 35-Year-Old Man with Respiratory and Renal Failure,"Dr. Omar H. Maarouf (Nephrology): A 35-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of dyspnea, anemia, and renal failure. The patient had been well until several weeks before admission, when fatigue developed. Two days before admission, dyspnea developed and worsened, without fever, cough, or chest pain. Early on the day of admission, he went to an urgent care clinic affiliated with this hospital. On examination, the patient was in respiratory distress; the temperature was 37.1°C, the blood pressure 152/79 mm Hg, the pulse 102 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 36 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 91% while he was breathing ambient air. The conjunctivae were pale. Auscultation of the chest revealed no rales or wheezing. Oxygen (15 liters per minute) was administered by face mask; the oxygen saturation initially rose to 95%, fell to 81% with oxygen (6 liters per minute), and rose to 100% with oxygen (15 liters per minute). He was transferred by ambulance to the emergency department at this hospital, arriving 50 minutes after his initial presentation. The patient reported fatigue, shortness of breath, and, during the previous 2 days, decreased urination. He did not have cough, chest pain, a change in symptoms with position, hemoptysis, fevers, chills, night sweats, headaches, visual loss, dry eyes, dry mouth, or joint pain. His wife reported that during the previous 6 months, the patient had had episodes of bilateral finger, ankle, and facial swelling, without pain or change in color. Four years before admission, he had been evaluated because of back and suprapubic pain, fatigue, and a temperature of 38.6°C. Urinalysis showed hematuria and proteinuria; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Culture of the urine grew 1000 to 10,000 colonies of mixed flora; testing for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae was negative. Ceftriaxone was prescribed, and the patient was advised to follow up with his primary care provider, but he did not. Six years before admission, testing for rapid plasma reagin was positive at a titer of 1:8; testing for antibodies to Treponema pallidum and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was negative, as was a Mantoux tuberculin skin test. The patient took no medications or herbal supplements, and he had no allergies. He was born in Central America, had immigrated to the United States 6 years before admission, was married with no children, and was physically active in his job. He had no history of recent travel, exposure to sick persons, blood transfusions, or previous surgery. He did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. On examination, the temperature was 36.9°C, the blood pressure 173/89 mm Hg, the pulse 95 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 36 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 88% while he was breathing ambient air and 100% while he was breathing high-flow oxygen through a nonrebreather face mask. The skin and conjunctivae were pale, with slight brownish injections in the conjunctivae, and there were hypopigmented macules on the right temple and both lower cheeks and hyperpigmented macules on the bridge of the nose. There were bibasilar rales in the lungs, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of magnesium, total and direct bilirubin, and lactate were normal, as were results of liver-function tests and red-cell indexes. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed a diffuse increase in the IgG level, and testing for rheumatoid factor and screening of the blood and urine for toxins were negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Testing for hepatitis B and C viruses and autoantibodies against histones was negative, as was parvovirus B19 nucleic acid testing. The stool was brown and positive for blood. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia, counterclockwise rotation, and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Furosemide was administered intravenously, nitroglycerin was administered by continuous infusion, and oxygen supplementation was continued with bilevel positive airway pressure. The ABO blood type was A, Rh positive, with positive antibody screening; a cold autoantibody was identified. A prewarmed antibody screening was negative. A chest radiograph showed bilateral central opacities, which extended peripherally and were confluent in the right lower lobe, and slight cardiomegaly; there were no pleural effusions. Trans-thoracic cardiac ultrasonography revealed normal global cardiac function and right-ventricular size, no evidence of a pericardial effusion, and findings that were consistent with pulmonary edema. After 2 hours, tachypnea developed, the patient appeared to be fatigued, and there had been no urine output. Propofol and fentanyl were administered; the trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was begun. He was admit-ted to the intensive care unit (ICU). A radial arterial catheter, left internal jugular triple-lumen intravenous catheter, and hemodialysis catheter were placed, and hemodialysis was begun. Leukocyte-reduced red cells (8 units during 23 hours) were transfused. Potassium chloride, calcium gluconate, and bicarbonate were administered. Gram’s staining of sputum revealed abundant leukocytes, very few squamous cells, and a few mixed gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed normal renal size, position, and echotexture and normal arterial blood flow. Bronchoscopic examination revealed thick, red mucus in the main-stem and right-lower-lobe bronchi; the carina and airways of the left lung were normal. Bronchoalveolar lavage on the right, with four serial aliquots of normal saline, revealed increasingly red return, with 300 and 24,500 red cells per cubic millimeter and 975 and 1475 white cells per cubic millimeter in the first and fourth tubes, respectively. In the fourth tube, the white-cell differential count revealed 84% polymorphonuclear leukocytes, 1% lymphocytes, 7% monocytes, and 8% macrophages or lining cells. Gram’s staining of the aspirate revealed leukocytes, without organisms; fungal wet preparation, staining for acid-fast and modified acid-fast bacilli, and testing for respiratory viruses were negative. Cytologic examination showed evidence of acute inflammation and pulmonary macrophages, with no malignant cells. Specimens of the sputum and swabs of the nasal mucosa and rectum were cultured. Methylpred-nisolone (1 g daily for 3 days) was administered. On the second day, the sputum culture grew very few klebsiella; vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin were administered. Testing was negative for Pneumocystis jiroveci, heterophile antibodies, and antibodies to streptolysin O, streptococcal DNase B, T. pallidum, and HIV. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed according to the protocol for a pulmonary embolus, revealed bilateral perihilar ground-glass opacities (more prominent on the right side than on the left side), mild interlobular septal thickening, a small right pleural effusion, and no pulmonary emboli.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2020,06,nejm-case-2020-06,A 34-Year-Old Woman with Hyperglycemia,"Dr. Max C. Petersen (Medicine): A 34-year-old woman was evaluated in the diabetes clinic of this hospital for hyperglycemia. Eleven years before this presentation, the blood glucose level was 126 mg per deciliter (7.0 mmol per liter) on routine laboratory evaluation, which was performed as part of an annual well visit. The patient could not recall whether she had been fasting at the time the test had been performed. One year later, the fasting blood glucose level was 112 mg per deciliter (6.2 mmol per liter; reference range, <100 mg per deciliter [<5.6 mmol per liter]). Nine years before this presentation, a randomly obtained blood glucose level was 217 mg per deciliter (12.0 mmol per liter), and the patient reported polyuria. At that time, the glycated hemoglobin level was 5.8% (reference range, 4.3 to 5.6); the hemoglobin level was normal. One year later, the glycated hemoglobin level was 5.9%. The height was 165.1 cm, the weight 72.6 kg, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 26.6. The patient received a diagnosis of prediabetes and was referred to a nutritionist. She made changes to her diet and lost 4.5 kg of body weight over a 6-month period; the glycated hemoglobin level was 5.5%. Six years before this presentation, the patient became pregnant with her first child. Her prepregnancy BMI was 24.5. At 26 weeks of gestation, the result of a 1-hour oral glucose challenge test (i.e., the blood glucose level obtained 1 hour after the oral administration of a 50-g glucose load in the nonfasting state) was 186 mg per deciliter (10.3 mmol per liter; reference range, <140 mg per deciliter [<7.8 mmol per liter]). She declined a 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test; a presumptive diagnosis of gestational diabetes was made. She was asked to follow a meal plan for gestational diabetes and was treated with insulin during the pregnancy. Serial ultrasound examinations for fetal growth and monitoring were performed. At 34 weeks of gestation, the fetal abdominal circumference was in the 76th percentile for gestational age. Polyhydramnios developed at 37 weeks of gestation. The child was born at 39 weeks 3 days of gestation, weighed 3.9 kg at birth, and had hypoglycemia after birth, which subsequently resolved. Six weeks post partum, the patient’s fasting blood glucose level was 120 mg per deciliter (6.7 mmol per liter), and the result of a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (i.e., the blood glucose level obtained 2 hours after the oral administration of a 75-g glucose load in the fasting state) was 131 mg per deciliter (7.3 mmol per liter; reference range, <140 mg per deciliter). Three months post partum, the glycated hemoglobin level was 6.1%. Lifestyle modification for diabetes prevention was recommended. Four and a half years before this presentation, the patient became pregnant with her second child. Her prepregnancy BMI was 25.1. At 5 weeks of gestation, she had an elevated blood glucose level. Insulin therapy was started at 6 weeks of gestation, and episodes of hypoglycemia occurred during the pregnancy. Serial ultrasound examinations for fetal growth and monitoring were performed. At 28 weeks of gestation, the fetal abdominal circumference was in the 35th percentile for gestational age, and the amniotic fluid level was normal. Labor was induced at 38 weeks of gestation; the child weighed 2.6 kg at birth. Neonatal blood glucose levels were reported as stable after birth. Six weeks post partum, the patient’s fasting blood glucose level was 133 mg per deciliter (7.4 mmol per liter), and the result of a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test was 236 mg per deciliter (13.1 mmol per liter). The patient received a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus; lifestyle modification was recommended. Three months post partum, the glycated hemoglobin level was 5.9% and the BMI was 30.0. Over the next 2 years, she followed a low-carbohydrate diet and regular exercise plan and self-monitored the blood glucose level. Two years before this presentation, the patient became pregnant with her third child. Blood glucose levels were again elevated, and insulin therapy was started early in gestation. She had episodes of hypoglycemia that led to adjustment of her insulin regimen. The child was born at 38 weeks 5 days of gestation, weighed 3.0 kg at birth, and had hypoglycemia that resolved 48 hours after birth. After the birth of her third child, the patient started to receive metfor-min, which had no effect on the glycated hemoglobin level, despite adjustment of the therapy to the maximal dose. One year before this presentation, the patient became pregnant with her fourth child. Insulin therapy was again started early in gestation. The patient reported that episodes of hypoglycemia occurred. Polyhydramnios developed. The child was born at 38 weeks 6 days of gestation and weighed 3.5 kg. The patient sought care at the diabetes clinic of this hospital for clarification of her diagnosis. The patient reported following a low-carbohydrate diet and exercising 5 days per week. There was no fatigue, change in appetite, change in vision, chest pain, shortness of breath, polydipsia, or polyuria. There was no history of anemia, pancreatitis, hirsutism, proximal muscle weakness, easy bruising, headache, sweating, tachycardia, gallstones, or diarrhea. Her menstrual periods were normal. She had not noticed any changes in her facial features or the size of her hands or feet. The patient had a history of acne and low-back pain. Her only medication was metformin. She had no known medication allergies. She lived with her husband and four children in a suburban community in New England and worked as an administrator. She did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs, and she rarely drank alcohol. She identified as non-Hispanic white. Both of her grandmothers had type 2 diabetes mellitus. Her father had hypertension, was overweight, and had received a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes at 50 years of age. Her mother was not overweight and had received a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes at 48 years of age. The patient had two sisters, neither of whom had a history of diabetes or gestational diabetes. There was no family history of hemo-chromatosis. On examination, the patient appeared well. The blood pressure was 126/76 mm Hg, and the heart rate 76 beats per minute. The BMI was 25.4. The physical examination was normal. The glycated hemoglobin level was 6.2%. A diagnostic test was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,15,nejm-case-2019-15,A 55-Year-Old Man with Jaundice,"Dr. Joseph D. Planer (Medicine): A 55-year-old man with a history of opioid use disorder and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection presented to this hospital with jaundice. Four months before the current presentation, the patient was released from prison after a 2-year incarceration. After he left prison, he resumed injecting heroin and had three episodes of overdose. He was evaluated at another hospital for symptoms of depression and was admitted for psychiatric treatment. During that admission, sublingual buprenorphine–naloxone therapy was initiated, and the patient was discharged. One day after discharge and 5 weeks before the current presentation, headache, body aches, sweats, diarrhea, and nausea developed. The patient presented to a clinic for substance use disorder that is affiliated with the other hospital and reported that he had been unable to obtain sublingual buprenorphine–naloxone from a pharmacy after discharge. The temperature was 36.6°C, the pulse 70 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 100/68 mm Hg. The weight was 72 kg. He appeared to be restless, but the remainder of the physical examination was normal. Urine toxicologic screening was positive for buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine, and norfentanyl; buprenorphine–naloxone therapy was resumed. Three weeks before the current presentation, dark urine and light-headedness developed and did not improve with increased fluid consumption. The patient also noticed slow thinking and arthralgias in the hands, wrists, and elbows. He was evaluated by a new primary care provider. The temperature was 36.7°C, the pulse 53 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 104/66 mm Hg. The joints of the hands, wrists, and elbows were normal. The neurologic examination was normal, as was the remainder of the physical examination. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the complete blood count, differential count, and results of renal-function tests. Urinalysis revealed clear, dark-yellow urine, with a specific gravity of 1.020 (reference range, 1.00 to 1.030), a pH of 7.5 (reference range, 5.0 to 9.0), trace ketones (reference value, negative), and 2+ urobilinogen (reference value, negative). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. One week before the current presentation, the patient noticed yellowing of the eyes and skin. One week later, he was seen by his primary care provider and was immediately transported by ambulance to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. On evaluation, the patient reported 2 weeks of anorexia, malaise, nausea with dark-brown emesis, profuse nonbloody watery diarrhea, intermittent abdominal cramping, poor sleep, blurry vision, and episodes of forgetfulness and loss of concentration. He had no fevers, chills, bleeding, or pulmonary or genitourinary symptoms and had no sick contacts. There was a history of osteoarthritis, depression, and anxiety. HCV infection had been diagnosed but not treated while the patient was incarcerated. He reported that when he used intravenous heroin, he did not reuse, share, or lick needles. Allergies included penicillin, aspirin, and sulfonamide-containing antibiotic agents. The only medication was sub-lingual buprenorphine–naloxone. The patient was divorced and had no children. He had not been sexually active in 2 years. He was born in the northeastern United States and had not traveled outside the country. Since his release from prison, he was unemployed, homeless, and sleeping in a shelter. He had no known exposure to rodents or rodent excreta. He smoked cigarettes daily and had done so for 20 years. He had previously consumed 2 liters of vodka daily but had quit 6 years earlier. His parents were deceased; he was estranged from his siblings, and their medical history was unknown. On physical examination, the temperature was 36.3°C, the pulse 57 beats per minute, the blood pressure 113/72 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 68 kg. The patient appeared jaundiced and had marked scleral icterus. The mucous membranes were moist, and there was no cervical lymphadenopathy. The abdomen was soft and nondistended, with no evidence of ascites. There was mild tenderness on palpation of the upper right quadrant of the abdomen, with no hepatosplenomegaly. The patient had no gynecomastia, caput medusae, or spider angio-mas. He was alert and fully oriented and had no asterixis. There was no rash or leg edema. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and lipase were normal, as were the complete blood count, differential count, and results of renal-function tests. Serum toxicologic screening did not detect acetaminophen, salicylates, tricyclics, or ethanol. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Mark A. Anderson: Limited ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant (Fig. 1) revealed no bile-duct dilatation, a patent main portal vein with hepatopetal flow, and normal hepatic pa-renchymal echotexture. Diffuse, hypoechoic gallbladder-wall thickening was present, without gallbladder distention, cholelithiasis, or perichole-cystic fluid. Murphy’s sign was negative. There was trace perihepatic ascites. Dr. Planer: Additional diagnostic tests were performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2018,38,nejm-case-2018-38,A 54-Year-Old Man with New Heart Failure,"Dr. Amy A. Sarma: A 54-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of new heart failure. One month before this evaluation, a nonproductive cough developed after the patient took a business trip to Tennessee. During the next week, the cough became productive of intermittent yellowish-brown sputum and was associated with fatigue and dyspnea. The patient thought he had bronchitis and stopped smoking. During the subsequent 3 weeks, he had progressive debilitating fatigue, anorexia, 10 kg of weight gain, difficulty sleeping while lying flat, and swelling in both legs. The patient’s dyspnea worsened, was provoked by any amount of exertion, and then started to occur at rest. He presented to the emergency department of another hospital. He could not sleep while lying flat owing to severe dyspnea; he had slept in a recliner for a few nights and had awakened several times with paroxysmal dyspnea. The temperature was 36.6°C, the heart rate 107 beats per minute, the blood pressure 155/73 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. Examination was notable for crackles in the lungs and edema in the legs. Levels of amylase and lipase were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 101 beats per minute, first-degree atrioventricular delay, poor R-wave progression, left atrial enlargement, left ventricular hypertrophy, and nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities that were most notable in the apical leads. Chest radiography was performed. Dr. Nandini M. Meyersohn: On posteroanterior and lateral radiographs of the chest (Fig. 1), pulmonary vascular markings were increased in number and more prominent than typically seen, a finding suggestive of pulmonary edema, and there was a small left pleural effusion. The cardiac silhouette was markedly enlarged, which could represent cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion. The aorta appeared ectatic. There was no evidence of hilar lymphadenopathy. Dr. Sarma: Furosemide was administered intravenously, and the patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital. During the initial evaluation at this hospital, he reported a history of untreated systemic hypertension. A review of systems was notable for the presence of occasional streaks of blood in the sputum during the previous weeks and dysgeusia; the patient had no fever, chills, night sweats, chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, light-headed-ness, dizziness, leg pain, claudication, rash, or focal neurologic symptoms. He had received regular dental care. He took no medications and had no known allergies to medications. He lived alone and worked in sales. He had smoked six cigars daily for 30 years; he had stopped smoking 1 month earlier. He occasionally smoked marijuana and drank one or two beers or glasses of wine daily. His father had died of a myocardial infarction at 67 years of age. On examination, the temperature was 36.4°C, the heart rate 102 beats per minute, the blood pressure 142/75 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. He was middle-aged and of normal stature, without dysmorphic features, and he appeared to be anxious, fatigued, diaphoretic, and in mild respiratory distress. His dentition was normal. The jugular venous pulse was elevated to 12 cm of water, and the carotid pulse was described as “collapsing.” The point of maximum cardiac impulse was shifted laterally to the anterior axillary line. The heart rate was tachycardic; a decrescendo murmur (grade 2 of 4) was heard nearly throughout diastole and was most prominent at the right upper sternal border, and there was no S3  gallop. There were bibasilar lung crackles. The abdomen was mildly distended. The arms and legs had robust, symmetric pulses and were warm; there was symmetric 3+ leg edema to the midthighs. Examination of the fingernails revealed alternating reddening and blanching pallor that was synchronized with the heart rate. The stool was guaiac-negative. There was no rash or lymphadenopathy, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Levels of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, total protein, globulin, and glycated hemoglobin were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Findings on an electrocardiogram were similar to those seen on the previous tracing (Fig. 1). Additional diagnostic tests were performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,03,nejm-case-2019-03,"A 70-Year-Old Woman with Fever, Headache, and Progressive Encephalopathy","Dr. John I. Hogan (Medicine): A 70-year-old woman with a history of migraines was admitted to this hospital in the fall because of fever, headache, and progressive encephalopathy. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 12 days before this admission, when fevers with temperatures as high as 39.7°C developed, along with chills, fatigue, weakness, and headache. The patient also had nausea and intermittent episodes of vomiting. She took acetaminophen and sumatriptan, but the symptoms persisted. On the sixth day of illness, she was seen by her primary care physician. A rapid influenza test was negative, and the results of urinalysis were reportedly normal; a blood sample was sent to the laboratory for testing for Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies. The following day, the patient was seen in the emergency department at another hospital for further evaluation. On examination, she was febrile and appeared ill. The platelet count, prothrombin-time international normalized ratio, anion gap, and blood levels of electrolytes and lactate were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests and urinalysis; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood and urine specimens were sent for culture. A chest radio-graph was normal. A lumbar puncture was performed; the results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis are shown in Table 1. Vancomycin and piperacillin–tazobactam were administered intravenously, and admission to the hospital was recommended. The patient declined admission and was discharged home with a prescription for oral doxycycline. During the next 2 days, fevers persisted, and the patient became progressively less interactive. She got out of bed infrequently; she had an unsteady gait and needed assistance to walk. Oral intake decreased, frequency of urination increased, and tremulousness of the arms and jaw developed. On the ninth day of illness (4 days before this admission), the patient’s family again took her to the emergency department at the other hospital. On examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable and ill and was trembling. She was alert and oriented, followed commands, and responded to questions with single-word answers. The temperature was 39.4°C; the other vital signs were normal. The oral mucous membranes appeared dry. The platelet count, anion gap, venous blood gas measurements, and blood levels of electrolytes, lactate, and ammonia were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests, liver-function tests, and urinalysis; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The test for B. burgdorferi antibodies (for which a sample had been sent 3 days earlier) was negative, as were the blood and urine cultures (for which samples had been sent 2 days earlier). Blood specimens were obtained, and imaging studies were performed. Results of computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, were normal. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed trace bilateral pleural effusions, four indeterminate lesions (8 to 20 mm in diameter) in the liver, a nonobstructive calculus (2 mm in diameter) in the lower pole of the left kidney, subcentimeter hypodensities in both kidneys, trace free fluid in the pelvis, diffuse atheroscle-rotic calcifications in the aorta and its visualized branches, colonic diverticula, and degenerative changes of the bony skeleton. A bolus of normal saline was administered intravenously, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. Acyclovir, ceftriaxone, vanco-mycin, ampicillin, acetaminophen, and intravenous fluids were administered. During the next 3 days, intermittent fevers with temperatures as high as 38.4°C continued, and the patient became disoriented and then mute. She was no longer able to follow commands. Urinary retention, lead-pipe muscular rigidity in the arms and legs, increased deep-tendon reflexes, and nuchal rigidity with passive flexion developed. Polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assays for herpes simplex virus DNA and enterovirus RNA, performed on the CSF sample obtained during the first emergency department visit, were negative. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and blood levels of C3, C4, thyrotropin, folate, and vitamin B12 were normal, and blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus antibodies, Treponema pallidum antibodies, cryptococcal antigen, Anaplasma phagocytophilum DNA, babesia species DNA, antinuclear antibodies, and β2-glycoprotein antibodies were negative. An electrocardiogram and transthoracic echo-cardiogram were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, reportedly revealed diffuse abnormal meningeal enhancement that was most notable in the cerebellum. Acyclovir was discontinued. On the fourth hospital day, the patient had a 2-minute episode during which the eyes rolled upward and the arms and legs stiffened. Loraze-pam and levetiracetam were administered. Electroencephalography that was performed after the event revealed generalized slowing. The patient was transferred to this hospital for further treatment. On admission, additional history was obtained from the patient’s family. The patient had had mild cognitive decline during the past year, and her son had begun assisting with management of her finances. Approximately 3 weeks before the onset of illness, the patient had noticed a dime-sized erythematous lesion on the right shoulder and thought it might have resulted from an insect bite. During the week before the onset of illness, she had been seen by a dentist for an unspecified treatment and had taken clindamycin for 2 days. She had a history of migraines, fibromyalgia, depression, and anxiety, and in the remote past she had undergone chole-cystectomy, hysterectomy, and treatment for Lyme disease. Her medications included citalopram and sumatriptan; she had no known allergies. She lived with her husband, two adult children, and pet dogs and cats near a horse farm in a wooded area of northern New England. She enjoyed spending time outdoors and frequently removed ticks from her pets. She did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs, and she drank alcohol rarely. There was a family history of Alzheimer’s disease and stroke. On examination, the vital signs were normal. The patient was somnolent, nonverbal, and unable to follow commands. She intermittently opened her eyes in response to a loud voice and tracked the examiner with conjugate gaze. There was no movement of the arms after application of pressure to the beds of the fingernails; triple flexion occurred after application of pressure to the beds of the toenails. Deep-tendon reflexes in the arms and legs were brisk. Nuchal rigidity was present. There was a systolic ejection murmur (grade 2/6) at the left sternal border. The remainder of the general physical examination was normal. The red-cell indexes, platelet count, prothrombin time, partial-thromboplastin time, anion gap, and blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the results of renal-function and liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A lumbar puncture was performed, with an opening pressure of 18 cm of water; the results of CSF analysis are shown in Table 1. Dr. R. Gilberto Gonzalez: MRI of the head (Fig. 1) revealed findings consistent with progressive meningoencephalitis. The findings were most prominent in the cerebellar hemispheres and were more severe on the left side than on the right side. There was associated edema in the cerebellar hemispheres. As compared with the previous MRI study, this study showed an increase in effacement involving the fourth ventricle and an increase in the size of the lateral and third ventricles, findings suggestive of early obstructive hydrocephalus. Results of magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck were normal. Dr. Hogan: A diagnostic test was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2009,03,nejm-case-2009-03,A 9-Month-Old Boy with Seizures,"Dr. Bronwen C. Carroll (Pediatrics): A 9-month-old boy was admitted to this hospital because of a generalized seizure and a bulging fontanelle. The patient was reportedly well until 3 days before admission, when nasal congestion developed, and he was thought to have a low-grade fever. On the day of admission, two episodes of watery diarrhea occurred. His mother noted that his skin felt warm and the fontanelle was bulging. He was sleeping when jerking movements of the arms and legs began, lasting approximately 2 minutes, that were associated with fecal incontinence but no vomiting. After the seizure, he was limp, unresponsive, and apparently not breathing. Emergency medical services were called; on arrival, rapid spontaneous respirations were noted. The patient was transported by ambulance to another hospital. En route, generalized tonic–clonic activity occurred, and diazepam was administered per rectum. Seizure activity abated for a few minutes and then recurred. He arrived in the emergency department approximately 40 minutes after the initial onset of seizure activity. On examination, tonic–clonic movements were present. The temperature was 39.9°C, the blood pressure 116/52 mm Hg, the pulse 160 to 170 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 60 to 80 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation more than 95% while he was receiving 100% inspired oxygen by means of a nonrebreath-er mask. The patient was intermittently responsive to pain. The anterior fontanelle was large and bulging but not tense. The pupils were 2 mm in diameter and constricted slightly on exposure to illumination. There was conjugate gaze, and intermittently the eyes deviated to the left. There was green-liquid stool in the diaper. An analysis of arterial blood revealed a pH of 7.37, a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 29 mm Hg (reference range, 35 to 45), a partial pressure of oxygen of 164 mm Hg (reference range, 70 to 95), and a bicarbonate level of 16 mmol per liter (reference range, 22 to 27). Urinalysis revealed a pH of 5.0, a urobilinogen level of 0.2 Ehrlich unit per deciliter, and rare white cells; the urine was positive for ketones (+), protein (+), and bacteria (3+) and was otherwise normal. Other laboratory-test results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Lorazepam, fosphenytoin, and additional diaze-pam were administered; tonic–clonic movements continued, with grunting and chest retractions. Fentanyl and rocuronium were administered, the trachea was intubated, and then ceftriaxone was administered. A bolus of normal saline with calcium gluconate was given intravenously. Seizure activity ceased. A chest radiograph revealed opacification in the right upper lobe, thought to represent atelectasis. Specimens of blood and stool were cultured. The patient was transferred to this hospital by helicopter. En route, calcium gluconate, fentanyl, and lorazepam were administered, and a nasogastric tube was inserted. No seizure activity was observed. The patient arrived approximately 3 hours after the onset of seizures. The patient was born at 36 weeks of gestation; his parents had immigrated to the United States from East Africa 2 years earlier. At birth, the weight (3515 g), length (50.5 cm), and head circumference (35.5 cm) were at the 50th percentile; at 6 months, the weight (7.6 kg) and length (66 cm) remained at the 50th percentile. Results of newborn screening tests were normal, except for the presence of hemoglobins F, A, and S, consistent with sickle cell trait. The patient had met developmental milestones, including crawling, pulling himself to stand, speaking “mama,” and demonstrating adequate pincer grasp for his age. He was reported to have been exclusively breastfed, with no vitamin supplementation, until approximately 3 weeks before admission, when breast-feeding was discontinued and milk-based formula reconstituted with water and rice cereal were begun. There was no recent trauma, unusual ingestion, travel, exposure to animals, or contact with sick persons. Liquid multivitamins had been prescribed; he had no allergies to medications. The child had attended well-child visits and received routine immunizations. He lived with his parents and four siblings and was cared for at home by his mother. There was no family history of seizures or other known hereditary disorders. On examination, the patient was sedated, unresponsive, and intubated. The temperature was 37.6°C, the blood pressure 113/58 mm Hg, the pulse 123 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, the length 71 cm (50th percentile), the estimated weight 8 kg (10th per-centile), and the head circumference 48 cm (97th percentile). There was frontal bossing with no dys-morphic features; the fontanelles were wide open and full. There was a reducible umbilical hernia; the remainder of the examination was normal. An analysis of arterial blood revealed a pH of 7.29, a partial pressure of oxygen of 156 mm Hg, and a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 36 mm Hg while the patient was breathing 40% inspired oxygen; other test results are shown in Table 1. A central venous catheter was placed in the right femoral vein. Electrocardiography revealed sinus tachycardia but was otherwise normal. A chest radiograph revealed atelectasis of the right upper lobe and perihilar interstitial opacities. Vancomycin, dexamethasone, acyclovir, ceftri-axone, calcium gluconate, fosphenytoin, midazo-lam, fentanyl, and ranitidine were administered, and a feeding tube was placed. A radiograph of the abdomen revealed mildly distended loops of small bowel, a gas-containing nondilated colon, and no evidence of bowel obstruction or masses. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain was normal. Additional diagnostic tests were performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2011,34,nejm-case-2011-34,A 75-Year-Old Man with Memory Loss and Partial Seizures,"A 75-year-old physician was seen in an outpatient office at this hospital because of memory loss and episodes of near-syncope. The patient had been generally well, except for mild and gradual memory loss, until 7 months earlier, when episodes of diffuse tingling and a sensation of flushing began to occur intermittently, lasting about a minute. Light-headedness and difficulties with word finding developed 4 months before presentation in association with the episodes and progressed to near-syncope 4 weeks before presentation. The patient reported an intermittently irregular pulse but no other speech, vision, other sensory, or motor symptoms. The patient had borderline hypertension, lumbar disk disease, pseudogout, and decreased hearing. Four months earlier, he had slipped on ice, with no light-headedness or loss of consciousness, and ruptured his right quadriceps tendon. Medications included ibuprofen or naproxen, acetaminophen with codeine, and diazepam. He used hearing aids. He was allergic to penicillin. He lived with his wife and had retired from his medical practice 1 year earlier because of memory loss. He reported anxiety and mild depression after retirement. He drank 30 to 60 ml of alcohol daily and had stopped smoking years earlier. His father had died at 94 years of age from cerebrovascular disease, his mother had died at 76 years of age from a brain tumor, and two of his sisters had died in their 50s or 60s from strokes. Another sister and her children were healthy. On examination, the blood pressure was 130/84 mm Hg, and the pulse 64 beats per minute. The temperature, respiratory rate, and general physical examination were normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate, results of testing for antinuclear antibodies, and urinalysis were normal. An electrocardiogram showed nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes and was otherwise normal. Two days later, the blood pressure was 188/96 mm Hg. Noninvasive carotid testing revealed bilateral minimal stenosis (1 to 19%) of the internal carotid arteries. Echocardiography revealed a mildly dilated left atrium, an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 63%, thickened aortic leaflets, trace aortic and tricuspid insufficiency, and a thickened interatrial septum thought to be consistent with lipomatous hypertrophy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain without the administration of contrast material revealed scattered T2-weighted hyperintense foci in the deep and subcortical cerebral white matter bilaterally, suggestive of mild microangiopathic changes, and no associated restricted diffusion. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head showed no hemodynamically significant intracranial arterial stenosis. Twelve days after his initial visit, the patient saw a neurologist. The patient, who was right-handed, reported that he had spells that lasted up to 1 minute that were preceded or followed by olfactory hallucinations of food and occasionally abnormal tastes. During the spells, he noted abnormal movements of the right arm, with tightening of the right shoulder and elbow, involuntary supina-tion of the right hand, flexion of the right fingers, and jerking of the right hand when writing, in addition to slowed speech and word-finding difficulties, facial paresthesias (greater on the right side), and facial twitching on the right side. There was no impairment of consciousness or disturbance of speech, but he described feeling faint, light-headed, generally weak, and sometimes dia-phoretic. His sleep became irregular, with awakening after 2 hours, occasionally in the midst of a spell. The symptoms were especially likely to recur when he was tense or worried. He reported short-term memory loss, fatigue, anorexia, erectile dysfunction, and night sweats. On examination, the blood pressure was 140/90 mm Hg while the patient was sitting, and the pulse 84 beats per minute with 1 premature beat. He had decreased hearing bilaterally and 1+ ankle reflexes; the remainder of the neurologic examination was normal. The hematocrit was 40.7% (reference range, 42 to 52), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 22 mm per hour (reference range, <15); the remainder of the complete blood count was normal, as were the serum levels of electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and glucose and tests of renal function. Results of timed (24-hour) urine collections for vanillyl-mandelic acid, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, and metanephrine, performed 5 and 7 weeks after presentation, were normal. An ambulatory electroencephalogram (48-hour duration, with nine symptomatic episodes) showed no seizure activity. The administration of levetiracetam (500 mg twice daily) was begun, and diazepam was stopped. Episodes of speaking difficulties continued daily, and fatigue and anxiety increased. The administration of fluoxetine was begun. Seven weeks after the initial presentation, the patient returned to the neurologist for follow-up. The hematocrit was stable. The serum chloride level was 98 mmol per liter (reference range, 100 to 108), the calcium level 11.0 mg per deciliter (2.8 mmol per liter) (reference range, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter [2.1 to 2.6 mmol per liter]), and the albumin level 5.1 g per deciliter (reference range, 3.3 to 5.0); testing for syphilis was negative. The complete blood count and measurements of serum electrolytes, glucose, total protein, globulin, and thyrotropin were normal, as were tests of renal and liver function. MRI of the brain after the administration of contrast material revealed features that were the same as those seen in the previous study, including increased T2-weighted signal intensity and mild expansion of the left amygdala and hippocampus without enhancement. There was also a mild, nonspecific change in the white matter. The dose of levetiracetam was increased to 1500 mg per day. The patient was referred to the Memory Disorders Unit. He reported increasing difficulty managing his finances. His wife reported that he had increasing memory loss, with difficulty remembering familiar telephone numbers, and increased irritability. The blood pressure was 110/60 mm Hg, and the pulse was 64 beats per minute and occasionally irregular. The results of the examination were unchanged. Neuropsychological testing revealed variability in the patient’s performances across domains and across 2 days of testing. There were declines in attention, executive functioning, and memory relative to his estimated premorbid functioning, although many of his performances were within the average range. His only impaired performances were copying a complex figure, recalling a list of words, and naming pictured objects with and without cueing. Twitching of the right side of the face, dysarthria, and posturing of the right hand were observed during testing. A paraneoplastic antibody panel was negative and included testing for acetylcholine receptor binding antibody, acetyl-choline receptor ganglionic neuronal antibody, striated muscle antibody, N-type and P/Q-type calcium-channel antibodies, amphiphysin antibodies, CRMP-5 (IgG), and anti–neuronal nuclear and anti–Purkinje-cell antibodies. Two weeks later, approximately 11 weeks after the initial presentation, MRI of the brain after the administration of contrast material, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and perfusion imaging revealed no definite spectroscopic or perfusion abnormality and no change in the previously described findings in the left temporal lobe. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen revealed multiple renal cysts, a small infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 3.3 cm in the greatest dimension, and no evidence of cancer in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis. The patient was referred to the neuro-oncology clinic. During the examination, two paroxysmal episodes of speech arrest were witnessed that lasted 10 to 15 seconds and were accompanied by subtle twitching on the right side of the face and transient emotional outbursts with rapid recovery. Persistent periorbital twitching occurred, more on the right side than on the left, and there was a postural tremor, slight weakness (5−) in the right arm, and slow fine movements of the fingers on the right hand. The patient had minor weakness of the dorsiflexors of the right foot and patchy loss of sensation to pin prick in the lower legs and feet bilaterally. The remainder of the examination was normal. A lumbar puncture was performed; results of analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are shown in Table 1. The administration of phenytoin was begun. A diagnostic test was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,24,nejm-case-2012-24,A 38-Year-Old Man with Abdominal Pain and Altered Mental Status,"Dr. Gabriel A. Brooks (Medical Oncology): A 38-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain, altered mental status, hypercalcemia, and thrombocytopenia. The patient had been well until 11 days before admission, when weakness developed. The next day, nausea, abdominal pain, and fatigue developed and he had multiple episodes of nonbilious, nonbloody emesis. Nine days before admission, he went to another hospital. He reported being in distress because of nausea; the vital signs were reportedly normal, the epigastrium was mildly tender, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Results of laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. The electrocardiogram reportedly showed sinus rhythm at 46 beats per minute and early repolarization. The patient was admitted to the other hospital, and normal saline and pamidronate were administered intravenously, with improvement in the symptoms and blood calcium level. Results of urinalysis were normal. Ultrasonog-raphy of the kidneys revealed normal size, a slight increase in the echotexture, and mild ascites. He was discharged on the fourth day, taking potassium phosphate tablets, with plans for additional outpatient evaluation. That evening after dinner, dull and constant lower abdominal pain developed and prevented the patient from sleeping. The next morning, he returned to the other hospital because of the pain, which he rated at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He reported no fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, chest pain, or dyspnea. On examination, the vital signs were normal. There was moderate cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy (≤1.5 cm in diameter) and mild abdominal tenderness in the right lower quadrant, without rebound or guarding; the remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, with the administration of contrast material, reportedly showed diffuse heterogeneous attenuation in the liver, borderline splenomegaly (span, 14 cm), and a small amount of ascites, without masses or evidence of appendicitis. Intravenous fluids, potassium phosphate, pantoprazole, ibuprofen, tramadol, and morphine were administered. On the second day, testing for hepatitis B surface antigen and antibodies to hepatitis C virus was negative; Western blot testing for the human immunodeficiency virus was initially indeterminate; follow-up testing was negative. CT of the chest and neck, with the administration of contrast material, reportedly revealed changes consistent with a large right pulmonary embolism, as well as moderate bilateral pleural effusions and lymphadenopathy in the cervical, supraclavicular, hilar, and axillary regions. An electrocardiogram was unchanged. An echocardiogram was normal. Intravenous heparin and oral prednisone (80 mg daily) were administered. On the third day, the blood level of amylase was normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Ultrasonography of the legs revealed thrombi in the right popliteal and posterior tibial veins. The abdominal pain diminished. Analysis of the peripheral blood by means of flow cytometry reportedly revealed 10% T lymphocytes, which had an abnormal immunophenotype. Test results from the fifth hospital day are shown in Table 1; other test results were pending. The patient was transferred to this hospital. Shortly before transfer, confusion, somnolence, and intermittent agitation developed. The patient had had hemorrhoid surgery and a right ankle sprain in the past and was otherwise well and took no medications. The calcium level 3 years earlier was reportedly normal (9.3 mg per deciliter [2.3 mmol per liter]). He had no known allergies. He was born in Haiti and had moved to the United States 6 years earlier. He lived with his wife, was physically active, and had recently lost a job in transportation. He drank alcohol rarely, smoked cigarettes occasionally, and did not use illicit drugs. He visited Haiti frequently. On examination, the patient appeared well; he was alert but oriented to person only. The temperature was 36.4°C, the blood pressure 135/89 mm Hg, the pulse 73 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. Lymph nodes (1 cm in diameter) were palpable in the supraclavicular and cervical regions. The abdomen was soft and diffusely tender, with bowel sounds and without masses or distention. Neurologic examination revealed psy-chomotor slowing. The patient’s behavior ranged from passive to aggressive; multiple requests in English or Creole were needed before he followed simple commands. Motor strength was 4 to 5 out of 5 throughout and symmetric. The remainder of the examination, within the limitations of decreased cooperation, was normal. The red-cell indexes were normal, as were levels of fibrinogen, glucose, direct bilirubin, and amylase. Tests of renal function were also normal; additional test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram was unchanged. Intravenous hydration with normal saline and sodium bicarbonate was initiated, and allopurinol, rasburicase, and lactulose were administered. Cip-rofloxacin, cefepime, and vancomycin were given, and platelets (irradiated and leukocyte-reduced) and fresh-frozen plasma were transfused. Testing for antibodies against platelet factor 4–heparin complexes was negative. During the first 12 hours after admission, increasing somnolence alternating with episodes of agitation developed. CT of the head, without the administration of contrast material, revealed effacement of the cerebral sulci (a finding thought to represent cerebral swelling) and no evidence of hemorrhage or masses. CT of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, after the administration of oral and intravenous contrast material, revealed bilateral prominent cervical lymph nodes, a change consistent with emboli in the right pulmonary arterial system; atelectasis in the right middle and lower lobes and the lingula; mediastinal and axillary lymphadenopathy and bilateral small pleural effusions; enlargement and heterogeneous attenuation of the liver and spleen, with wedge-shaped hypodense lesions in the spleen; free fluid throughout the abdomen; and multiple enlarged nodes (≤1.3 cm in diameter) in the abdomen and both inguinal regions. On the second day, a lumbar puncture was performed. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed colorless clear fluid, with no red cells and 1 white cell per cubic millimeter in tube 4 (50% lymphocytes and 50% monocytes); normal glucose and protein levels; and no organisms on Gram’s staining. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,25,nejm-case-2012-25,"A 15-Year-Old Boy with Abdominal Pain, Hematochezia, and Anemia","A 15-year-old boy was admitted to this hospital because of recurrent abdominal pain and diarrhea. The patient had been well until approximately 8 months earlier, when episodes of midline low back pain developed, which were worse in the morning and improved with activity and flexion. During the next few months, intermittent, stabbing periumbilical and left upper abdominal pain occurred, associated with nausea and diarrhea. The pain occurred once or twice a week, developed suddenly, and lasted from a few hours to a week, but typically 1 to 2 days. The pain had no relationship to eating, was unaffected by position or the passing of stool, and was not associated with nausea or vomiting. Acetaminophen provided slight relief. Six weeks before admission, the patient saw his pediatrician for a follow-up examination related to obesity. The patient rated the abdominal pain at 6 to 7 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He reported that between 8 months and 6 months before admission he had had decreased appetite and had lost 4.5 kg while following a weight-loss diet; during the next 4 months, his appetite had improved, and he had gained approximately 1.8 kg. On examination, the blood pressure was 136/82 mm Hg, the pulse 85 beats per minute, the weight 88.4 kg, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 28.1. The abdomen was obese and soft, with normal bowel sounds and mild tenderness in the left upper quadrant and periumbilical areas, without rebound or guarding. The blood level of carbon dioxide was 31.4 mmol per liter (reference range, 23 to 29), and the white-cell count was normal, as were the levels of other electrolytes, glucose, calcium, total protein, albumin, and globulin and tests of renal and liver function. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Three stool specimens were positive for blood; stool culture showed no enteric pathogens, and examination for ova and parasites was negative. A radiograph of the thoracic spine was normal. Referral to a gastroenter-ologist was made, and computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis was scheduled. Episodes of abdominal pain and diarrhea continued during the next several weeks. On the morning of admission, CT of the abdomen and pelvis performed with the administration of oral and intravenous contrast material revealed an ileoco-lonic intussusception extending approximately 8 cm cranially from the ileocecal valve, without a soft-tissue mass or cystic lesion. There was no bowel obstruction and no abnormal-appearing bowel loops. Later that day, abdominal pain recurred, and the patient came to the emergency department at this hospital. In the emergency department, the patient reported left upper quadrant pain, headache, and diarrhea and no fever, nausea, or vomiting. Six years before admission, he had been evaluated at this hospital for an episode of painless rectal bleeding (bright red blood in the toilet bowl twice in 1 day), without constipation or diarrhea. On examination at that time, the vital signs and abdominal examination were normal, there were no hemorrhoids, and the stool was guaiac-positive; laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Culture of the stool for enteric pathogens, analysis of the stool for ova and parasites, and a technetium-99m pertechnetate scan of the abdomen for Meckel’s diverticulum were negative, and colo-noscopic examination showed no bleeding or mucosal abnormality. Ferrous sulfate was prescribed. A few episodes of periumbilical pain occurred subsequently and resolved spontaneously; no further bleeding occurred. The patient had iron-deficiency anemia, β-thalassemia minor, obesity, borderline hypertension, mild asthma, allergic rhinitis with a nasal polyp for which he underwent a polypectomy, and eczema. Medications included ferrous sulfate (daily) and an albuterol metered-dose inhaler (as needed for asthma); immunizations were up to date. He had no known allergies. He was born in the United States, attended school, and lived with his mother, who had emigrated from Southeast Asia, and a sibling. He had not traveled recently and had had no contact with ill persons. On examination, the blood pressure was 140/64 mm Hg, the pulse 74 beats per minute, and the weight 91 kg; the temperature, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation (while the patient was breathing ambient air) were normal. The abdomen was soft, with normal bowel sounds, and without distention or tenderness; the remainder of the examination was normal. The white-cell count, differential count, and platelet count were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, total protein, globulin, albumin, and lipase and tests of coagulation and renal and liver function; other test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to this hospital. Oral intake was stopped, and intravenous crystalloid was administered. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,18,nejm-case-2010-18,A 7-Year-Old Boy with Elevated HIV RNA Levels despite Antiretroviral Medications,"Dr. Brian C. Zanoni (the Ragon Institute of the MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Charlestown, MA, and McCord Hospital, Durban, South Africa): A 7-year-old boy with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection was seen in the outpatient pediatric HIV clinic of a hospital in Durban, South Africa, that is affiliated with Massachusetts General Hospital. The patient had been born by normal vaginal delivery, without complications, after a full-term gestation. His mother had received prenatal care, without testing for HIV infection. At birth, the patient’s weight was 3.4 kg. He was breast-fed for the first 3 months, and then he was fed formula. At the age of 3 years, he was admitted to another hospital because of pneumonia. A presumptive diagnosis of tuberculosis was made, and a 6-month course of antituberculosis medications thought to include rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide was administered. Twenty-six months before this evaluation, an episode of suppurative otitis media occurred that responded to antibiotics. Approximately 18 months before this evaluation, the patient was readmitted to the other hospital because of cough, fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain. He appeared ill, with wasting, respiratory distress, and bilateral crackles on auscultation of the lungs. A skin test for tuberculosis was nonreactive, and tests for antibodies to HIV were positive. His weight and laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Ceftriaxone, clarithromycin, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, albuterol, and hydro-cortisone were administered. Five days later, rifampin (180 mg), isoniazid (90 mg), and pyrazinamide (450 mg) daily and antiretroviral medications (Table 1) were begun. He was discharged on the 11th day while continuing to receive trimetho-prim–sulfamethoxazole and the antimycobacterial and antiretroviral medications. The following month, the patient’s condition reportedly had improved. Four months later (13 months before this evaluation), a supraclavicular abscess developed, which did not improve after the administration of antibiotics. He was admitted to the other hospital for biopsy, incision, and drainage of the abscess. Microscopical examination of the biopsy specimen showed numerous leukocytes and no organisms, including no mycobacteria. Routine and mycobacterial cultures were sterile. Pathological examination reportedly showed granulo-mas with necrosis resembling caseation that were thought to be consistent with active tuberculosis. The next month, he returned to the doctor’s office; weight and height, test results, and antiretroviral medications are shown in Table 1. The supraclavicular abscess had resolved. The antituberculosis medications were stopped after approximately 6 months (12 months before this evaluation). Four months later, the patient was seen in follow-up, and he was well. Eight months later, the patient was referred to the outpatient pediatric HIV clinic at this hospital for evaluation and renewal of antiretroviral medications. The mother reported good adherence to the antiretroviral medications and tri-methoprim–sulfamethoxazole. The patient was reportedly not aware of his HIV diagnosis. He had received all routine childhood immunizations, including bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine in infancy, and he had no known allergies. He lived with his mother, an older sibling, and his maternal grandparents in a house with electricity and running water. His mother and grandmother were involved in his care. He was a student who did well in school. His father had died of an unknown cause when the patient was an infant, and his mother and older sibling were well. There was no known exposure to tuberculosis. After the diagnosis of HIV infection in the patient, his mother also tested positive for HIV infection. On examination, he appeared well. The weight and height (Table 1) were below the fifth percentile for age, according to growth charts of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There was bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy, but the examination was otherwise normal. The patient’s antiretroviral regimen was changed (Table 1): the solution of ritonavir alone was replaced with lopinavir–ritonavir combination therapy, doses of zidovudine and lamivudine were increased, the administration of multivitamins was begun, and the administration of trimethoprim–sulfamethox-azole was continued. Results of tests performed the following week included normal white-cell and platelet counts, a hemoglobin level of 10.3 g per deciliter (reference range for children, 11.5 to 15.5), a mean corpuscular volume of 96 femto-liters (reference range, 76 to 94), and normal renal and liver function; other results are shown in Table 1. Three weeks later, the patient returned to the clinic for follow-up. His mother reported that he was adhering to the medication schedule, without any unacceptable adverse events. His mother participated in formal training related to antiretroviral therapy, which she had not previ-ously attended. The patient returned to the clinic monthly thereafter for follow-up and medication adjustments, as shown in Table 1. He reported feeling well. Five months after presentation, the grandmother reported that a mild cough had developed in the patient and that his adherence to the medication was good. The examination was normal. A diagnostic test was performed, and a management decision was made.

Huang (Obstetrics and Gynecology): A 33-year-old woman was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at this hospital 16.5 hours post partum because of leukocytosis and gram-positive rods in the blood. The patient had received routine prenatal care at this hospital. At 5 and 7 weeks of gestation, ultrasonography performed because of intermittent vaginal bleeding was reported to reveal an arcuate uterus with findings suggestive of a cornual ectopic pregnancy. At that time, diagnostic laparoscopy revealed no evidence of an ectopic pregnancy. Repeat ultrasound examinations at 8 and 9 weeks showed a normal uterus and fetus, with a subchorionic hematoma that appeared to be resolving. Ultrasound examination at 18 weeks was normal. Screening for syphilis and the human immunodeficiency virus and a urine culture were negative. Two weeks before admission, the patient noted increased fatigue and dizziness. One week later, at 36 weeks of gestation, the blood pressure at a routine prenatal examination was 132/80 mm Hg (increased from 108/80 mm Hg 2 weeks earlier); a spot urine sample revealed 2+ protein. One week later, at 37.1 weeks of gestation, the blood pressure was 140/84 mm Hg, with 1+ pedal edema. The fundal height was consistent with the gestational date, fetal activity and heart tones were present, and the fetus was in the cephalic presentation. The remainder of the examination was normal. Urinalysis revealed 4+ proteinuria. The patient was admitted to the hospital for induction of labor. A previous pregnancy had ended at an unknown gestational age; the reason was not determined. The patient’s history included seasonal allergies, occasional migraine headaches, and no sexually transmitted diseases. Her only medication was prenatal vitamins; she had received the seasonal influenza vaccine at 20 weeks of gestation and the influenza A (H1N1) vaccination at 28 weeks of gestation. She had no known medication allergies. She lived with her husband and had immigrated to the United States from northeast Africa, which she had last visited 10 years earlier. Her mother had a history of hypertension and headaches, a maternal aunt had hypertension, and her father had died of an unknown cause. The patient did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. On examination, the blood pressure was 153/98 mm Hg, the pulse 84 beats per minute, and the temperature 37.3°C. The fundus was firm; the height was consis-tent with the gestational age, and the cervix was 1 cm dilated and 50% effaced. The fetal heart-rate tracing showed a rate of 130 to 139 beats per minute. Screening of the patient for hepatitis B virus surface antigen was negative, and the platelet count, the red-cell indexes, and tests of renal function were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Labor was induced with a single dose of miso-prostol followed by oxytocin and magnesium sulfate. During labor, the patient’s blood pressure ranged from 121 to 159 mm Hg systolic and 69 to 111 mm Hg diastolic, and the temperature from 36.4 to 37.3°C. Rupture of the membranes occurred 28.5 hours after admission. Forty-seven hours after admission, spontaneous vertex vaginal delivery of a healthy boy occurred (weight, 2910 g; 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores, 8 and 9, respectively). The patient had received an epidural injection of an anesthetic agent and did not undergo an episi-otomy. The amniotic fluid was clear and copious. Approximately 90 minutes post partum, the patient reported blurred vision and appeared fatigued. The temperature was 36.7°C, and the blood pressure 131/85 mm Hg. There was copious vaginal bleeding with clots; misoprostol was administered, and magnesium was continued.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,02,nejm-case-2019-02,"A 36-Year-Old Man with Rash, Abdominal Pain, and Lymphadenopathy","Dr. Katherine H. Schiavoni (Medicine): A 36-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain, rash, and lymphadenopathy. The patient had been well until 4 years before admission, when swelling developed in the right side of the neck. One year later, he was evaluated at this hospital and reported that the neck swelling had persisted but had not changed in size. He also reported that he had had no fevers, night sweats, or weight loss. On examination, there was an enlarged posterior cervical lymph node (2 cm in diameter) on the right side. The node was mildly tender and freely mobile, with a rubbery texture and slightly irregular shape. Results of liver-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of iron, ferritin, and total iron-binding capacity. A test for hetero-phile antibodies and a fourth-generation combination assay for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and type 2 (HIV-2) antibodies and HIV-1 p24 antigen were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Chest radiography revealed a normal cardiac silhouette and clear lungs. Biopsy of the lymph node was recommended, but the patient elected not to undergo the procedure. Two years before admission, a diffuse, painless, erythematous, papular rash developed on the trunk and then spread to the arms, legs, scalp, and face. The papules appeared in separate crops, and over a period of 1 to 2 months, a small amount of purulent material drained from each papule, after which the lesions evolved into hyperpigmented nodules. The rash persisted, and 6 months later, the patient was evaluated at another hospital. A biopsy of the skin of the left arm was performed, and histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed findings consistent with acute folliculitis. Treatment with doxycycline was initiated, but the rash persisted, with a waxing and waning pattern, during the next 8 months. Doxycycline was discontinued. Subsequent treatment with topical clobetasol resulted in only a mild decrease in the rash. Six weeks before admission, a biopsy of the skin of the right thigh was performed. Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed acute neutrophilic folliculitis, with follicular rupture in the middle dermis and associated acute and chronic inflammation. Surface bacteria and yeast were present, but there were no bacterial or fungal organisms in the dermis. Treatment with oral clindamycin and rifampin was begun, and the patient was instructed to wash twice daily with chlorhexidine and apply mupirocin to open papules. One day before admission, abdominal pain developed in the right upper quadrant. The pain was sharp, constant, worsened by movement and deep breathing, and unchanged with eating. There was no nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. The pain progressively worsened during the next 24 hours, and the patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing abdominal pain, as well as weight loss of 4.5 kg during the past year, which he attributed to increased regular exercise at a gym. Four weeks before admission, he had stopped exercising because of increased fatigue with exertion. The patient reported that he had not had fevers but had occasionally changed his pajamas at night because of sweating. He had microcytic anemia that had been attributed to β-thalassemia minor. The only medications were clindamycin and rifampin, and there were no known drug allergies. The patient was born in Morocco and had moved to the United States 10 years before admission. He visited his family in a rural village in Morocco every few years, with the last visit occurring 5 months earlier. He had never smoked tobacco, and he did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. He did not consume unpasteurized dairy products. His father had died of complications of emphysema. On examination, the temperature was 37.6°C, the pulse 66 beats per minute, the blood pressure 132/82 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 76.2 kg; the last recorded weight, which had been obtained 4 years earlier, was 81.8 kg. The patient did not appear to be ill but was in mild distress because of abdominal pain. Erythematous, follicular papules and hyperpig-mented nodules, some with central erosion and ulceration, were distributed on the trunk, arms, legs, face, and scalp (Fig. 1). Examination of the heart and lungs was normal. Bowel sounds were present, and the abdomen was soft, with tenderness on palpation of the right upper quadrant, but was not distended. There was right axillary lymphadenopathy but no submandibular, cervical, supraclavicular, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, as were results of renal-function and liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Tests for antibodies to hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen and antibodies to HBV core antigen were positive. Tests for HBV surface antigen, hepatitis C virus antibodies, and Treponema pallidum antibodies were negative, as was a fourth-generation combination assay for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies and HIV-1 p24 antigen. Urinalysis revealed normal findings, and blood cultures were negative. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Alexis M. Cahalane: Abdominal ultrasonogra-phy revealed an ill-defined mass (9.0 cm by 5.6 cm) in the right lobe of the liver, with no evidence of dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material (Fig. 2A and 2B), revealed multiple prominent cardiophrenic lymph nodes (≤1 cm in maximal short-axis diameter) predominantly on the right side. There were also multiple enlarged axillary lymph nodes (≤3.4 cm in maximal short-axis diameter) on the right side, including some with central necrosis. CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Fig. 2C) revealed multiple ill-defined hypoden-sities throughout the right lobe and in the fourth segment of the liver, with the largest measuring 2.7 cm by 2.0 cm. Trace perihepatic ascites and mild splenomegaly were present, with the spleen measuring 13.5 cm in craniocaudal dimension. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material (Fig. 2D, 2E, and 2F), revealed multiple areas of abnormality in the right lobe that corresponded to the lesions seen on CT, with the largest measuring 3.1 cm by 6.3 cm by 3.5 cm. The lesions had mild peripheral hyper-intensity on T2-weighted images and restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted images. On images obtained during the portal venous phase, the lesions had peripheral enhancement with central hypoenhancement. On images obtained 4 minutes after the administration of contrast material, the lesions had a “cluster of grapes” appearance. Mild splenomegaly was also detected. Dr. Schiavoni: The patient was admitted to the hospital, and fine-needle aspiration and core biopsy of a right axillary lymph node were performed. Dr. Ruth K. Foreman: Examination of the aspirate and biopsy specimen (Fig. 3) revealed benign-appearing lymph-node tissue with normal architecture and associated necroinflammatory debris. There was no histologic evidence of cancer. Acid-fast, Gomori methenamine–silver, periodic acid– Schiff, Brown–Hopps, and Steiner stains for microorganisms were negative, as was an immuno-histochemical stain for spirochetes. Tissue from the biopsy was sent to the microbiology laboratory for culture. Dr. Schiavoni: Additional diagnostic tests were performed, and a diagnosis was made.

Binder (Emergency Services): A 25-year-old man was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital because of pain and swelling of the right hand and hypotension. The patient had been well until 2 days earlier, when he noticed a lesion on the dorsum of his right hand, which he thought was an insect bite. The next day, the hand became swollen and painful, and he felt ill. In the evening, he had difficulty using his hand while working on a computer. The next morning, he had chills, and his temperature rose to 38.6°C. At 5 p.m., the patient’s mother returned home and found him obtunded, vomiting, and incontinent of feces and urine. His temperature was 38.6°C. He was taken by emergency medical services to the emergency department of another hospital. The patient appeared acutely ill and confused. The blood pressure was 73/25 mm Hg, the temperature 37.9°C, the pulse 145 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing 6 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula. The skin appeared cyanotic and was cool. The right hand was mottled and swollen, with a black eschar, 1 cm in diameter, on the dorsum; the swelling extended up the proximal forearm. Capillary refill occurred in 4 seconds. The patient was able to move his fingers, but the range of motion was limited. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. The right arm was immobilized on pillows. Specimens of blood were sent for culture. Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes. Two peripheral intravenous lines, a triple-lumen internal jugular line, and a urethral catheter were inserted. There was little urinary output, and the stool was heme-positive. During 3.6 hours in the emergency department, 10 liters of crystalloid solution were infused intravenously, as were ceftriaxone, methylprednisolone, diphenhydramine, piperacillin and tazobactam sodium, pantoprazole, naloxone, potassium chloride, and magnesium sulfate. One dose each of acetaminophen and tetanus toxoid was given, and norepinephrine was administered, with the dose adjusted to maintain a mean arterial pressure of more than 65 mm Hg. The skin became less cyanotic, and a flushed, deep-red color developed; blue discoloration persisted over the fingers of the right hand distally. Urinary output improved. Computed tomography (CT) of the right hand, performed without contrast material, showed soft-tissue swelling along the dorsum of the hand, with extension to the level of the extensor tendons. There was no subcutaneous air, loculated fluid collection, intramuscular abscess, or destruction of bone. The patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital, arriving 1.4 hours later. Medications administered during transfer included norepinephrine (for blood pressure) and morphine (as needed, for pain). The patient had seasonal allergies. As a child, he had undergone myringotomies and an inguinal herniorrhaphy, and his wisdom teeth had been extracted. He was allergic to sulfamethoxazole, which had caused desquamation. He lived with his family on a farm in New England, had worked in the construction industry, and was exposed to horses, dogs, and cats. He hunted, most recently 7 months earlier, and had not traveled recently. His mother reported that the patient had recently had abscesses on his left chin and buttocks, which he had treated with warm compresses. He had also recently taken a course of prednisone for a per-sistent cough and took cetirizine, as needed, for allergies. He smoked cigarettes and drank alcohol socially; he did not use intravenous drugs. His parents were well; other family members had diabetes, hypertension, and thyroid disease. On examination in the emergency department, the patient appeared ill and lethargic but was easily aroused and became oriented. The temperature was 37.3°C and rose to 37.9°C within 20 minutes. The blood pressure was 92/50 mm Hg, the pulse 129 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation was 96% while he was breathing 100% oxygen ",{},Necrotizing fasciitis with resulting septic shock. ,,Necrotizing fasciitis with resulting septic shock. ,0
NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2008,39,nejm-case-2008-39,A 51-Year-Old Woman with Splenomegaly and Anemia,"Dr. Jeffrey A. Barnes (Hematology–Oncology): A 51-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of anemia and splenomegaly. The patient was in her usual state of health until approximately 2 months before admission, when fatigue developed, followed by night sweats, left-upper-quadrant fullness, early satiety, edema of the legs, and dyspnea on exertion. Furosemide was prescribed, but symptoms persisted. One month before admission, she was admitted to another hospital. On examination, the spleen extended to the pelvic brim and the legs were edematous. A direct Coombs’ test was negative for IgG and complement. Other laboratory-test results are shown in Tables 1, 2, and 3. Two units of red cells were transfused. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the intravenous and oral administration of contrast material, revealed an enlarged spleen (30 cm by 10 cm), ascites, and enlarged lymph nodes at multiple sites, including the left base of the neck, the splenic hilum, and the periaortic region. A test for human immunodeficiency virus was negative. On the fifth hospital day, the partial-throm-boplastin time did not correct with mixing with normal plasma in a 1:1 ratio, and it remained prolonged after 2 hours. Three units of fresh-frozen plasma were given, as were 2 additional units of red cells. A bone marrow biopsy was performed, and the patient was discharged from the hospital. Pathological examination of the biopsy specimen of the bone marrow revealed lymphoid aggregates that made up approximately 10% of the marrow cellularity and increased interstitial lymphoid cells. Flow cytometry showed kappa light chain– restricted B cells that expressed CD19 but not CD5, CD23, CD10, and CD103. Three weeks before admission, the patient saw a hematologist at the oncology clinic of the other hospital. Laboratory-test results are shown in Tables 1, 2, and 3. Referral to the Cancer Center of this hospital was scheduled, but the day before admission, she was readmitted to the other hospital because of increasing malaise, edema of the legs, a temperature of 38.6°C, and night sweats. Laboratory-test results are shown in Tables 1, 2, and 3. Two units of packed red cells were transfused. On the second day, she was transferred to this hospital. Follicular carcinoma of the thyroid had been diagnosed many years earlier and had been treated with thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine. The patient had mi-graine headaches, tremor, depression, and anxiety. She had smoked in the past and did not use alcohol or illicit drugs. Her mother had had systemic lupus erythematosus, coronary artery disease, and stroke and died at the age of 55 years. Her father was in his 80s and had a tremor; he had had a stroke, a myocardial infarction, and a cerebral aneurysm. Her three siblings were healthy. She lived with her husband and child and did not work outside the home. Medications included citalopram, ziprasidone, clonazepam, lamo-trigine, furosemide, zolpidem tartrate, levothy-roxine, ferrous sulfate supplements, and eletriptan as needed for headaches. She had no allergies to medications. On examination, the patient appeared anxious. The temperature was 38.3°C, the blood pressure 110/68 mm Hg, the pulse 105 beats per minute, the respiration rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while she was breathing ambient air. There was mild scleral icterus. The abdomen was soft, without tenderness or distention. The spleen was firm and nontender and extended below the pelvic brim. There was no peripheral lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood type was A Rh-positive; the antibody screen was negative. Levels of serum glucose, electrolytes, phosphorus, magnesium, and alkaline phosphatase and results of renal-function tests were normal; Coombs’ direct test and tests for cold agglutinins were negative. Urinalysis showed 1+ bilirubin. An electrocardiogram was normal. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed an IgM kappa paraprotein and a marked decrease in normal immunoglobulin. Tests for hepatitis B virus surface antibody and antigen and hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody were negative. Levels of vitamin B12 and folate were normal. Results of other laboratory tests are shown in Tables 1, 2, and 3. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed unchanged sple-nomegaly and lymphadenopathy. Two units of red cells were transfused. Zolpidem and eletrip-tan were stopped, and the other medications were continued. Folic acid was begun, and vitamin K was given subcutaneously. On the third hospital day, 3 more units of red cells and 4 units of fresh-frozen plasma were transfused; no correction of the partial-thrombo-plastin time occurred, and a mixing study revealed that the partial-thromboplastin time did not cor-rect with the addition of normal plasma. Levels of coagulation factors II, V, VII, and X were in the normal range. IgM antibody to hepatitis A virus was positive; total antibody to hepatitis A virus was negative. On the fourth hospital day, a procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2018,39,nejm-case-2018-39,An 18-Year-Old Man with Diplopia and Proptosis of the Left Eye,"Dr. Mark A. Matza (Medicine): An 18-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of diplopia and proptosis of the left eye. The patient had been well until approximately 33 months before this evaluation, when eye pain and periorbital swelling developed on the right side. The pain was constant, and the use of ophthalmic ketotifen fumarate did not provide relief. On the eighth day of illness, the patient was seen in the ophthalmology clinic at another hospital. Examination revealed visual acuity of 20/25 in the right eye and 20/30 in the left eye, along with 3 mm of proptosis of the right eye and swelling, erythema, and ptosis of the right eyelid. Ophthalmic fluorometholone and oral doxycycline were prescribed. Five days later, the patient returned to the ophthalmology clinic and reported a 1-day history of fuzzy vision in the right eye. He had persistent proptosis, ptosis, and eyelid swelling. On examination of the right eye, visual acuity was 20/50 and there was a new superior visual-field defect in response to confrontation. Extra-ocular motility was normal. Three days after this visit, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed mild-to-moderate enlargement of the inferior, medial, and superior rectus muscles in the right orbit, which had resulted in narrowing of the posterior orbital apex. There was enhancement of the enlarged extraocular muscles, as well as abnormal hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images. Concurrent MRI of the head was normal, as were blood levels of thyrotropin and free thyroxine. Prednisone (40 mg per day) was prescribed. During the next 2 weeks, the pain and eyelid swelling diminished and the visual acuity normalized, but the proptosis and visual-field restriction persisted. The patient also had decreased color vision in the right eye, without a relative afferent pupillary defect. The dose of prednisone was decreased to 20 mg per day; after 2 weeks of this dosing regimen, the proptosis and ptosis persisted but the remainder of the ophthalmologic examination was normal. The dose of prednisone was gradually decreased over a period of 7.5 months and then stopped; symptoms resolved and the ophthal-mologic examination was normal. Seven months after discontinuation of pred-nisone (17 months before this evaluation), the patient returned to the ophthalmology clinic because of a 1-week history of recurrent eye pain and periorbital swelling on the right side. Pred-nisone was administered for 5 days at a dose of 40 mg per day and then was continued at a dose of 20 mg per day. During the next 2.5 weeks, the pain persisted and the swelling worsened. The dose of prednisone was increased to 60 mg per day, and oral methotrexate and folic acid were prescribed; the pain and swelling diminished. The dose of prednisone was gradually decreased during the next 2.5 months and then stopped. One month later (13 months before this evaluation), the pain in the right eye recurred and the patient returned to the ophthalmology clinic. Prednisone (40 mg per day) was prescribed, and the dose of methotrexate was increased. During the next 3 months, pain recurred each time the dose of prednisone was decreased to 20 mg per day; naproxen was prescribed. Ten months before this evaluation, the patient was seen in the rheumatology clinic at the other hospital. He reported weight gain but no fever, fatigue, eye pain, vision problems, dry eyes, dry mouth, oral or nasal ulcerations, shortness of breath, arthralgias, or rash. On examination, he had a cushingoid appearance and was in no apparent distress. The vital signs were normal. The body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 29.7. There was no conjunctival injection, and extraocular motility was normal. He did not have thyromegaly, lymphadenopathy, rash, or syno-vitis; the remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Prednisone and folic acid were continued, and oral methotrexate was changed to subcutaneous methotrexate. During the next 4 months, the dose of prednisone was gradually decreased to 2.5 mg per day, without recurrence of pain. The alanine aminotransferase level increased to 81 U per liter (reference range, 0 to 50); the dose of methotrexate was decreased, and the level normalized. Four months before this evaluation, pressure-type pain developed in the left eye. On examination at the rheumatology clinic, the blood pressure was 129/77 mm Hg and the other vital signs were normal. The BMI was 30.7. The patient had a cushingoid body habitus and facial acne. He did not have proptosis or eyelid edema. Extra-ocular motility was normal, as was the remainder of the examination. The dose of subcutaneous methotrexate was increased, and the dose of prednisone was increased to 20 mg per day. During the next 6 weeks, the pain in the left eye persisted, and periorbital swelling and proptosis developed on the left side. The dose of predni-sone was increased to 40 mg per day, without improvement, and then to 60 mg per day. During this time, cellulitis of the right lower abdominal wall developed. A course of oral doxycycline was administered, followed by a course of oral cepha-lexin and topical mupirocin; methotrexate was discontinued. Eight weeks before this evaluation, the proptosis persisted. Mycophenolate mofetil was prescribed, and the dose of prednisone was decreased to 40 mg per day. The patient was referred to a rheumatologist and ophthalmologist at this hospital for further evaluation. On evaluation in the ophthalmology and rheu-matology clinics at this hospital, the patient reported proptosis and a 2-week history of diplo-pia in all directions of gaze, without pain. He had seasonal allergic rhinitis and a remote history of esotropia, asthma, tonsillectomy, adenoid-ectomy, and myringotomy. Nine months earlier, he had had an episode of bilateral submandibu-lar sialadenitis; a test for mumps virus infection had been negative. Medications included predni-sone, mycophenolate mofetil, cholecalciferol, and Saccharomyces boulardii. Ibuprofen had caused itching. The patient was a college student and lived in the southern central United States. He did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. His grandmother had Graves’ disease. On examination, the patient had a cushingoid appearance. He had exotropia and minimal pro-ptosis of the left eye, pallor of the right optic disk, and a right inferior central defect on visual-field testing. Examination of the skin revealed striae and acne (Fig. 1). The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis was normal; the urine protein level was 15.7 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0.0 to 13.5), and the urine protein:creatinine ratio was 0.05 (reference range, <0.15). Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Katherine L. Reinshagen: MRI of the orbits was performed (Fig. 2). Contrast-enhanced T1 -weighted images, obtained with and without fat suppression, showed abnormal fusiform enlargement and increased enhancement of the left medial and inferior rectus muscles, with a central area of hypoenhancement of the left medial rectus muscle. There was relative sparing of the muscu-lotendinous insertions and no substantial surrounding fat stranding. In addition, T2-weighted images showed hyperintense signal in the left medial and inferior rectus muscles, a finding suggestive of edema. There was mild proptosis of the left globe. The right orbit and paranasal sinuses were essentially unremarkable. Dr. Matza: A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2023,40,nejm-case-2023-40,A 70-Year-Old Woman with Cough and Shortness of Breath,"Dr. Alison C. Castle: A 70-year-old woman with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was evaluated in a clinic in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, because of cough, shortness of breath, and malaise. Fifteen years before the current presentation, the patient received a diagnosis of HIV infection after she had presented with substantial weight loss and fatigue. The initial CD4 cell count obtained at the time of diagnosis was 29 cells per micro-liter (reference range, 332 to 1642). Antiretroviral therapy (ART) with stavudine, lamivudine, and efavirenz was started. During the subsequent year, the symptoms resolved, the HIV RNA level became undetectable, and the patient reported adherence to her medications. Ten years before the current presentation, additional ART became accessible within South Africa, and the ART regimen was changed to teno-fovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and efavirenz. Five years before the current presentation, the patient was admitted to a local hospital because of diarrhea and diffuse myalgias, and she was found to have virologic failure. The ART regimen was changed to zidovudine, lamivudine, and lopinavir– ritonavir. During the subsequent 4 years, the patient reported adherence to these medications without a lapse in treatment. The HIV RNA level ranged from 68 to 594,000 copies per milliliter of plasma (reference value, undetectable). Twelve months before the current presentation, the patient had new shortness of breath, cough, anorexia, and weight loss. During the subsequent 4 weeks, the symptoms progressively increased in severity. When the shortness of breath worsened to the extent that she was unable to walk, she sought evaluation at the clinic. The temporal temperature was 36.8°C, the blood pressure 104/64 mm Hg, and the pulse 87 beats per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 16.9. On examination, the patient appeared ill but was able to speak in full sentences. Auscultation of the chest was limited because of frequent coughing; diffuse crackles were present in both lungs. Nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Examination of an acid-fast bacilli smear of the sputum was positive for mycobac-teria, and subsequent nucleic acid testing and culture of the sputum was positive for Mycobac-terium tuberculosis. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. In accordance with recommendations from the South African Department of Health, the patient was instructed to isolate at home and complete a course of treatment for tuberculosis, which included rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. During the subsequent 6 months, the patient took the antimycobacterial medications, and the shortness of breath and cough decreased but still persisted. Her weight decreased by 8 kg, even though the anorexia had resolved. Four months before the current presentation, new headaches and mouth ulcers developed, and the patient sought evaluation at the clinic. A sputum specimen was obtained for examination of an acid-fast bacilli smear and mycobacterial nucleic acid testing and culture, all of which were negative. The HIV RNA level was 151,000 copies per milliliter of plasma. The patient was scheduled for a follow-up appointment. Twelve days before the current presentation, the patient presented to the clinic for follow-up, and the ART regimen was changed to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine, and dolutegra-vir. When the symptoms did not abate, the patient presented to the clinic for additional evaluation. She described persistent shortness of breath and dry cough, as well as headaches on the right side and mouth ulcers. The review of systems was notable for fatigue and weakness during the past 12 months, as well as fever, night sweats, chest pain, mouth ulcers, and odynophagia. She had no ageusia, anosmia, vision changes, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, or joint pain. Radiography of the chest had not been performed. The patient had not received vaccines for coro-navirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). She took tenofo-vir disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine, and dolute-gravir, as well as acetaminophen for muscle pain as needed. There were no known drug allergies. She did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs; she did not take any remedies from traditional healers. The patient lived with her daughter in a rural farming community in a coastal region of South Africa, and she had not traveled recently. She commuted by foot within her community and had regular exposure to cattle, goats, chickens, and dogs. Her household water supply originated from a borehole and was untreated. On examination, the patient was alert but appeared ill and cachectic. She coughed throughout the interview. The blood pressure was 97/71 mm Hg, the pulse 91 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute. The body-mass index was 13.7. The mucous membranes were dry. She had thrush on the tongue, as well as superficial ulcers on the buccal mucosa. On auscultation of the chest, diffuse crackles were present in both lungs and were worst in the right lower lobe. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate amino-transferase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnostic test was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,*,0*,nejm-case-*-0*,A 34-Year-Old Woman with Episodic Paresthesias and Altered Mental Status after Childbirth,"Dr. Kimberly G. Blumenthal (Medicine): A 34-year-old woman, 2.5 months post partum, was admitted to this hospital because of episodes of altered mental status. The patient had been well until approximately 3 months before admission, near the end of her pregnancy, when periodic numbness of the lower lip occurred, which resolved after approximately 30 minutes. She gave birth to a healthy baby by normal spontaneous vaginal delivery 2.5 months before admission and had been breastfeeding since then. After delivery, the patient began to have intermittent numbness in the pelvis and thighs while walking, without pain or burning. Seven weeks before admission, she began to have episodes of unusual behavior in the morning after she awakened, including pouring cereal from one container to another and making growling noises; these resolved after approximately 30 minutes, and she had minimal recollection of the episodes. She also began to have panic attacks, insomnia, episodes of crying, and increasing feelings of anxiety and hopelessness; diagnoses of anxiety and postpartum depression were made. Clonidine was administered briefly, followed by clonazepam and, 2 weeks before admission, sertraline, without improvement. Three weeks before this admission, intermittent blurring of her vision developed, associated with “wooziness” and feeling “out of it.” She had periods of numbness of the lower lip, arms, and legs and had difficulty performing routine activities, such as typing. Ten days before admission, during a 2-hour period, she had trouble conversing, folding a stroller, and fastening her seatbelt; she later had difficulty recalling the events. Similar symptoms occurred the next day, lasting approximately 1 hour. Eight days before this admission, she saw a neurologist. She was asymptomatic, and the examination was normal; additional testing and follow-up were scheduled. During the next 4 days, darkening of vision, occasionally associated with horizontal diplopia, occurred both before and after breakfast. She began to have episodes of fatigue, diminished hearing, and slowed thought processes during which she became nonverbal and unresponsive although she appeared awake; these lasted for several hours, followed by amnesia for the events. Her mother reported that during episodes, the patient lay on the couch, moving her arms slowly in front of her, occasionally tremulous and diaphoretic, without nausea, vomiting, chest pain, pal-pitations, loss of consciousness, head trauma, urinary incontinence, tongue-biting, or convulsions. Four days before admission, the patient was taken to the emergency department at another hospital because of a prolonged episode of confusion and lethargy, during which she became nonverbal. On examination, the vital signs were normal. She was minimally verbal and not oriented to person, place, or time, and she had a flat affect, poor insight, and poor concentration. On the Glasgow Coma Scale (on which scores range from 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating reduced levels of consciousness), the patient’s score was 14 (eye response, 4; verbal response, 4; and motor response, 6); the remainder of the neurologic and general examination was normal. The blood glucose level was 30 mg per deciliter (1.7 mmol per liter; reference range, 74 to 106 mg per deciliter [4.1 to 5.9 mmol per liter]); levels of electrolytes, calcium, total protein, albumin, amylase, lipase, and C-reactive protein were normal, as were a complete blood count and the results of tests of liver and renal function. A solution of 50% dextrose in water was administered intravenously, with improvement in the patient’s level of consciousness. She was admitted to that hospital. Testing for Borrelia burgdorferi, Babesia microti, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and ehrlichia species was negative. An electrocardiogram was normal. Urinalysis revealed glucose (70 mg per deciliter) and was otherwise normal; culture was negative. A 24-hour electroencephalogram was normal; no symptoms were reported during monitoring. On the morning of the third day, while she was asymptomatic, the blood glucose level was 28 mg per deciliter (1.6 mmol per liter); 28 minutes later, on a second specimen of blood, the level of insulin was 17.3 μU per milliliter (120.1 pmol per liter; reference range, 0 to 29.1 μU per milliliter [202.1 pmol per liter]). On the fourth day, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen revealed a lesion, 10 mm in diameter, in the pancreatic body, which had low signal on T1 -weighted imaging and increased signal on T2 -weighted imaging and briskly enhanced in the arterial phase and beyond. A corticotropin-stimulation test was performed; 79 minutes and 153 minutes after the administration of cosyntropin, the level of cortisol was 27.3 µg per deciliter (753.2 nmol per liter) and 30.4 µg per deciliter (838.7 nmol per liter), respectively. The next day, the patient was transferred to this hospital. Results of additional tests were pending. The patient reported recent heat intolerance and increased thirst, without polyuria. She was breast-feeding. Hemorrhoids with hematochezia had developed during her two pregnancies, which were otherwise uncomplicated, without hypertension or gestational diabetes mellitus. Medications on transfer included enoxaparin, clonazepam, ser-traline, n–3 fatty acids, S-adenosylmethionine, and prenatal vitamins. She had no known allergies. She lived with her husband and children, and she worked with children. She drank wine with dinner until the onset of these episodes, whereupon she stopped, and she did not smoke or use illicit drugs. Her father had had renal cancer (at 45 years of age; nephrectomy was performed) and prostate cancer (when he was in his 50s; prosta-tectomy was performed); her uncle had depression; and her mother, sibling, and children were healthy. There was no family history of endocrine problems, including parathyroid, pancreatic, or pituitary tumors. On examination, the blood pressure was 94/52 mm Hg, the pulse 62 beats per minute, the weight 62.6 kg, the height 172.7 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 21.0; other vital signs and the remainder of the examination were normal. The level of glucose, obtained by finger-stick testing, was 86 mg per deciliter (4.8 mmol per liter). In the evening on the day of admission, when the patient was asymptomatic, the blood glucose level was 45 mg per deciliter (2.5 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]); the blood levels of electrolytes, total protein, albumin, globulin, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus were normal, as were a complete blood count and results of renal- and liver-function tests. An infusion of 10% dextrose in water was administered overnight, and a high-caloric diet was encouraged throughout the day. The next day, the blood level of folate was greater than 20.0 ng per milliliter (45.3 nmol per liter; reference range, 3.1 to 17.5 ng per milliliter [7.0 to 39.7 nmol per liter]), and the levels of thyrotropin and vitamin B12 were normal. A diagnostic test was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2011,23,nejm-case-2011-23,A 40-Year-Old Pregnant Woman with Placenta Accreta Who Declined Blood Products,"Dr. Britta Panda (Obstetrics and Gynecology): A 40-year-old woman was seen by the maternal–fetal medicine service at this hospital at 22 weeks 2 days’ gestation because of placenta previa and placenta accreta. Beginning at 12 weeks 1 day’s gestation, the patient had received routine prenatal care at a health center affiliated with this hospital. She was gravida 5, para 4, and had had normal vaginal deliveries at term with her first two pregnancies, 16 and 9 years earlier. Seven years earlier, a cesarean section had been performed at term for a breech presentation during labor. An initial low transverse uterine incision was extended into a high vertical incision because of difficulty extracting the fetus. The patient’s hematocrit had decreased from 33.6% to 17.6% post par-tum (reference range for nonpregnant women, 36.0 to 46.0). Five years before this admission, a cesarean section, with a low transverse incision, was performed electively at term; the postpartum hematocrit was 28.9%. A skin test for tuberculosis had reportedly been positive 8 years earlier, with a normal chest radiograph; isoniazid had been administered for 6 months. The patient had iron-deficiency anemia for which iron supplements had been prescribed but discontinued because of gastrointestinal intolerance. She had had varicella–zoster virus infection, and screening for rubella antibody had been positive. She was taking only prenatal multivitamins and had no known allergies. She was born in a Caribbean country, lived with her husband and children, and worked in a health care field. She declined transfusions of all blood products because of her religious beliefs. Her husband, also a health care worker, did not share these beliefs. She did not drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had hypertension; her father had had hypertension and epilepsy and had died at the age of 70 years. Her sister had sickle cell trait, and the patient’s children and half-siblings were well. On examination at the initial prenatal visit, the weight was 60.3 kg and the blood pressure 100/58 mm Hg; the remainder of the examination was consistent with the gestational stage and was otherwise normal. The hematocrit was 29.1% (reference range for nonpregnant women, 36.0 to 46.0), and the hemoglobin level 10.1 g per deciliter (reference range for nonpregnant women, 12.0 to 16.0). Other test results, including the remainder of the complete blood count, hemoglobin electrophoresis, and tests of renal and liver function, were normal. All prenatal screening tests were negative, and results of cytopatho-logical examination of a smear of the cervix were normal. The ABO blood type was O, Rh positive, with negative antibody screening. The patient was informed that a repeat cesarean section was advisable, and iron supplementation was prescribed. Eight days later, ultrasonographic examination of the pelvis revealed a normal-appearing single fetus, with biometry consistent with 13 weeks 2 days’ gestation, and a normal fetal heart rate. The placenta was forming posteriorly, and the amniotic-fluid volume and adnexa were normal. At 20 weeks 6 days’ gestation, repeat ultrasound examination of the uterus revealed a single active fetus, as well as a right lateral complete placenta previa, large echolucencies in the placenta, loss of the myometrial echolucent stripe near the bladder, and increased venous structures and flow in the anterior lower uterine segment, features suggestive of placenta accreta. The cervix was more than 3 cm long, without funneling, and the fetal anatomy, amniotic-fluid volume, and umbilical cord appeared normal. At 21 weeks 2 days’ gestation, the patient’s weight was 63.5 kg, the blood pressure 80/64 mm Hg, and the fundal height consistent with 21 weeks’ gestation. The fetal heart rate was 140 beats per minute. Seven days later, the patient was seen at the maternal–fetal medicine service. Management decisions were made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2018,15,nejm-case-2018-15,"An 83-Year-Old Woman with Nausea, Vomiting, and Confusion","Dr. Andrew S. Hoekzema (Medicine): An 83-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital in the winter because of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and confusion. One week before admission, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and nonproductive cough developed. The patient felt feverish but did not measure her temperature at home. No family members or recent contacts had been ill. Two days before admission, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea developed. One day before admission, the patient asked her daughter repetitive questions and appeared to not recognize family members. On the day of admission, the patient reported global weakness and was brought by her daughter to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported no headache, changes in vision, chest pain, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain. She had a history of rheumatic heart disease, with mitral-valve stenosis and regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction of 60%. Other medical history included osteoporosis, compression fracture of thoracic vertebrae, and chronic kidney disease with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg per deciliter (106 μmol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.5 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 μmol per liter]) and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 50 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area (reference range, >60) according to the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula. Fifteen years earlier, she had undergone open mitral-valve commissurotomy and ring annuloplasty, procedures that were complicated by the development of recurrent severe mitral-valve regurgitation, which led to pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular dilatation and hypokinesis, and severe tricuspid-valve regurgitation. Nine years earlier, she had undergone bioprosthetic mitral-valve replacement and tricuspid-valve reconstruction with annuloplasty, with placement of a permanent pacemaker for persistent atrial fibrillation with bradycardia. Eight years earlier, transthoracic echocardiography had revealed a well-seated prosthetic mitral valve, an annular ring in the tricuspid position, mild tricuspid-valve regurgitation, and normal right ventricular size and function. In addition, 10 years earlier, a cholecystectomy had been performed. The patient lived at home with one of her grown children, was independent in activities of daily living, and walked for 30 minutes daily. Medications included furosemide, spironolactone, metoprolol, digoxin, and warfarin. She took her daily medications from a pillbox organizer that her daughter filled on a weekly basis. Warfarin therapy was monitored monthly with measurement of the prothrombin time and international normalized ratio; almost all results had been in the therapeutic range. The patient was born in Uganda but had moved to New England when she was 64 years of age to live with her children. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. On examination, the temperature was 36.9°C, the blood pressure 153/60 mm Hg, the pulse 64 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 39.2 kg, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 18.7. The patient was cachectic and appeared ill. She was awake but lethargic, and she responded to questions with nonsensical answers in her native language. She intermittently followed simple one-step commands and could move her arms and legs. Results of cranial-nerve examinations were normal (although the function of the first cranial nerve was not tested). The mucous membranes were dry. Bowel sounds were present, and the abdomen was nondistended, soft, and nontender on palpation. The cardiac rhythm was irregularly irregular, with a loud S2  heart sound and a systolic murmur throughout the precor-dium; the jugular vein was nondistended. Crackles were present in the lower lung fields. There was no leg edema. The complete blood count was normal, as were results of liver-function tests and blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, and lipase. Urinalysis was normal, except for the presence of 1+ ketones (reference range, negative). Nucleic acid testing of a nasal-swab specimen for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Victorine V. Muse: Chest radiography (Fig. 1) revealed wires associated with median sternot-omy, a single-lead pacemaker on the left side of the heart, and evidence of mitral-valve and tricus-pid-valve repairs. There was evidence of stable, massive, global cardiomegaly and mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed prominent ventricles and sulci, as well as nonspecific, scattered periventricular white-matter hypodensities; there was no evidence of intracra-nial hemorrhage, large territorial infarction, or intracranial mass lesion. Dr. Hoekzema: The patient was admitted to the hospital, and a diagnostic test was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,38,nejm-case-2019-38,A 20-Year-Old Man with Dyspnea and Abnormalities on Chest Imaging,"Dr. Michael B. Feldman: A 20-year-old man with a history of electronic-cigarette (e-cigarette) use, also known as vaping, was evaluated in the pulmonary clinic of this hospital because of progressive dyspnea and abnormal findings on chest imaging. The patient had been well until approximately 6.5 months before this presentation, when fatigue, fever, chills, and cough productive of rust-colored sputum developed; there was no hemoptysis. He was evaluated by a physician at another hospital. The patient reported that he had started using e-cigarettes approximately 8 weeks earlier. He was advised to discontinue use of e-cigarettes, and a course of azithromycin was prescribed. Despite the empirical antibiotic treatment, the symptoms persisted. A chest radiograph obtained approximately 5.5 months before this presentation showed a nodular consolidation in the right lower lung that was suggestive of pneumonia. Another course of azithromycin was prescribed; when symptoms did not abate, the patient received levofloxacin, and follow-up chest imaging was scheduled. Dr. Brent P. Little: Approximately 4 weeks later, repeat chest radiography at the other hospital revealed persistent, nodular opacities in the right mid lung; new hazy pulmonary opacities had also developed in both lungs. Two weeks later, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed faint ground-glass nodular opacities that were most prominent in the lower lungs. No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopa-thy was present, the heart size was normal, and the pulmonary arteries were normal in caliber (Fig. 1A). The patient was referred to a pulmonologist. Dr. Feldman: Three weeks later, the patient was evaluated in the pulmonary clinic of the other hospital. He reported ongoing cough productive of clear and yellow secretions, malaise, and intermittent fever. He had had no weight loss, night sweats, hemoptysis, or chest discomfort. On examination, he was described as appearing well. The pulse was 88 beats per minute, the blood pressure 110/80 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. Breath sounds were normal in both lungs, and no clubbing or cyanosis of the hands or feet was noted. The patient was advised again to discontinue use of e-cigarettes and to undergo follow-up chest CT in 3 months. Nine weeks later (approximately 6 weeks before this presentation), the patient returned to the pulmonary clinic of the other hospital. He reported resolution of cough and sputum production but had noticed mild, intermittent dys-pnea on exertion; he had no chest pain, fever, chills, or weight loss. The pulse was 87 beats per minute, the blood pressure 110/78 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The physical examination was unchanged. The complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel (including results of renal- and liver-function tests), and urinalysis were normal. Blood tests for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) (including antibodies to myeloperoxidase and proteinase 3) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM antibodies were negative, as was a nucleic acid test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the sputum. Follow-up imaging studies were scheduled. Dr. Little: Six weeks before this presentation, CT of the chest, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed an increase in the size, attenuation, and number of ground-glass nodular opacities that were most prominent in the lower lungs. Areas of confluence had developed in a peribroncho-vascular distribution (Fig. 1B). Tests of pulmonary function were performed (Table 1), and the patient was referred to the pulmonary clinic of this hospital. Dr. Feldman: On presentation to this hospital, the patient reported rhinorrhea with yellow-white mucus, postnasal drip, and sinus headaches. He reported that dyspnea occurred on exertion, including when he climbed the stairs in his dormitory; the dyspnea had increased progressively during the past 3 months. He had mild morning stiffness in his hands that would resolve after a few minutes of activity. He had a history of anxiety, attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder, childhood asthma, and allergies. His medications were sertraline and extended-release dextroam-phetamine and amphetamine. He had no known medication allergies. He lived with roommates in a dormitory in New England, where he attend-ed college and studied landscape architecture. As part of his course work and practical work in college, he had exposures to grasses, fertilizers, and pesticides; however, he had had no contact with these in the previous 5 months, during the winter. He reported no regular exposures to pets or birds and had not traveled outside of New England. He had no history of tobacco use, but he had begun daily use of e-cigarettes, with inhalation of a mango-flavored, nicotine-containing vapor, 8 months before this presentation. He reportedly drank 12 beers every weekend. He occasionally smoked marijuana but reported no use of illicit drugs. His father had obstructive sleep apnea, his paternal grandfather had chronic ob-structive pulmonary disease, his maternal grandfather had rheumatoid arthritis and possible pulmonary fibrosis, and three maternal cousins had multiple sclerosis. On examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 36.3°C, the pulse 70 beats per minute, the blood pressure 143/58 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The oropharynx appeared normal, with no ulcers; the heart sounds were regular, and the lung sounds were clear. The remainder of the examination was normal. Screening tests for hypersensitivity pneumo-nitis, antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies, and antibodies to Lyme disease were all negative. The levels of electrolytes, glucose, total protein, and globulin were normal, as were the results of renal-function and liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 2. Tests of pulmonary function were performed (Table 1). The patient was again advised to discontinue e-cigarette use, and plans were made for close followup to assess the trajectory of his lung disease. Two months later, the patient reported that he had discontinued regular use of e-cigarettes; however, after he had used e-cigarettes 2 weeks earlier, he had started to have transient chest tightness. He continued to have persistent exer-tional dyspnea after climbing several flights of stairs, and he had nasal congestion. The oxygen saturation was 97% while he was breathing ambient air; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. Tests of pulmonary function were again performed (Table 1), and additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Little: High-resolution CT images of the chest, obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed a marked increase in ground-glass nodular opacities that were most prominent in the lower lungs (Fig. 2). There was no evidence of bronchiectasis, bronchial-wall thickening, or other primary airway disease. Findings of fibrosis, such as honeycombing, reticulation, traction bronchiectasis, and architectural distortion, were also absent. Dr. Feldman: Blood tests for antibodies to the alpha-3 chain of type IV collagen, Ro (SSA), La (SSB), Scl-70, and Jo-1 were negative. A urinalysis was normal. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,22,nejm-case-2010-22,An 87-Year-Old Woman with Dementia and a Seizure,"An 87-year-old woman with a history of dementia was admitted to this hospital because of a seizure. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 2 days before admission, when she appeared to be fatigued, sleeping later each morning than usual. One hour before admission, at midday, her husband heard her fall, and he found her on the floor. She was awake, lying on her left side, with her right arm shaking; there was no apparent head trauma. She was confused but able to speak. Emergency medical services were called. On examination at the scene, the patient was confused and did not follow commands; her speech was normal. The blood pressure was 220/100 mm Hg, the pulse regular at 60 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. The pupils were the size of pinpoints; the lungs were clear. The left-hand grip was weak. Oxygen was administered by means of a nonre-breather mask. During transport to this hospital by ambulance, generalized tonic– clonic movements occurred, which resolved spontaneously in less than 1 minute and were followed by somnolence and snoring. A diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment had been made 5 years earlier when, on initial evaluation by a neurologist at this hospital, the patient made 6 errors (out of 37 possible) on the Information–Memory–Concentration subscale of the Blessed Dementia Scale. During the next 4 years, her memory gradually became more impaired. A diagnosis of possible Alzheimer’s disease was made 1 year after her initial evaluation. On repeat testing 5 months before admission, she made 19 errors. Before this acute illness, she recognized only her husband and children. The patient had had a stroke in the past, with language abnormalities and a decrease in the visual field, which resolved. Sixteen months before admission, an episode of expressive aphasia and weakness occurred, which resolved spontaneously. At that time, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) with angiography of the head and neck revealed nonspecific white-matter abnormalities that were consistent with small-vessel ischemic changes. The scans also showed a small, chronic infarct in the left occipital lobe, lacunar infarcts bilaterally in the caudate heads, mild loss of parenchymal volume, and an aneu-rysm of the right cavernous internal carotid artery (1.1 cm in diameter), all of which were unchanged from 1 year earlier; there was no evidence of acute infarction. The patient had chronic ptosis and strabismus (medial deviation) of the right eye. Twelve days before admission, MRI scans of the orbit and brain, performed at another hospital because of increasing ptosis, showed the previously observed aneurysm of the right cavernous internal carotid artery, with an apparent mass effect on the adjacent sixth cranial nerve, and stable white-matter changes. The patient had hypertension, hypercholester-olemia, and a pituitary adenoma. She had had an appendectomy, a cholecystectomy, and cataract surgery. Medications included dipyridamole and acetylsalicylic acid, triamterene, simvastatin, galan-tamine, cimetidine, alendronate, folic acid, cyano-cobalamin, and pyridoxine. She had no known allergies. She lived with her husband and had required 24-hour care in recent months. She had previously worked in health care. She had smoked cigarettes for 50 years and had minimal consumption of alcohol. Her mother had died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 80 years, her father of a stroke in his eighth decade, and her sister of lung cancer at 79 years of age; her children were well. On examination, the patient was unresponsive to sternal rub, withdrew her extremities to painful stimuli, and was unable to swallow secretions. The blood pressure was 220/120 mm Hg, the pulse 60 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing supplemental oxygen with a nonrebreather mask. The head was turned to the left, the face was symmetric, and the eyes were closed; when the eyes were open, the pupils were the size of pinpoints. Breath sounds were coarse. She did not speak or move purposefully. The plantar responses were extensor. The remainder of the examination was normal. The trachea was intubated for airway protection, and mechanical ventilation was begun. The level of serum sodium was 139 mmol per liter (reference range, 135 to 145), potassium 3.3 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.4 to 4.8), chloride 94 mmol per liter (reference range, 100 to 108), carbon dioxide 21.2 mmol per liter (reference range, 23.0 to 31.9), urea nitrogen 32 mg per deciliter (11.4 mmol per liter) (reference range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter [2.9 to 8.9 mmol per liter]), creatinine 1.5 mg per deciliter (132.6 μmol per liter) (reference range, 0.6 to 1.5 mg per deciliter [53.0 to 132.6 μmol per liter]), glucose 136 mg per deciliter (7.5 mmol per liter) (reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]), and amylase 153 U per liter (reference range, 3 to 100). Results of other laboratory tests were normal, including a complete blood count; measurements of serum calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, total protein, albumin, globulin, direct and total bilirubin, and lipase; and tests of liver function. Testing for myocardial infarction was negative. An electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia, with borderline first-degree atrioventricular block and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes. A chest radiograph showed a rounded opacity in the right apex (approximately 1.0 cm by 0.6 cm) that had not been well visualized on earlier studies. CT angiography of the brain showed more extensive patchy white-matter hypoattenuation in the cerebral hemispheres than did previous examinations, most pronounced within the temporal lobes (in the left more than in the right). In the left temporal lobe, there was expansion of the deep and subcortical white matter, a feature consistent with vasogenic edema, without midline shift. There was a small hemorrhage in the inferior right precentral sulcus. Other findings were unchanged. MRI scans of the brain revealed extensive T2-weighted hyperintensity of the white matter involving both cerebral hemispheres, most pronounced within the temporal lobes and scattered in the frontal, occipital, and parietal lobes. There was diffuse nonspecific sulcal hyperinten-sity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. At the cortical–subcortical junction, there were innumerable small foci of susceptibility artifact, features compatible with microhemorrhag-es. There was no acute infarct, midline shift, or hydrocephalus. The patient was admitted to the neurologic intensive care unit. Lumbar puncture was performed, and analysis revealed clear cerebrospi-nal fluid; the level of glucose was 65 mg per deciliter (3.6 mmol per liter) (reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]) and protein 58 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55), and there were no white cells. Fosphen-ytoin was administered, and no further seizure activity occurred. The next day, the trachea was extubated, and oxygen supplementation gradually weaned. Nicardipine was administered intravenously, followed by hydralazine, amlodipine, and prazosin and a 5-day course of methylpredniso-lone, followed by a slow taper of oral prednisone; phenytoin replaced fosphenytoin. The patient became more alert, oriented, conversant, and interactive. Repeat MRI scans on the eighth hospital day showed no evidence of acute infarct or new hemorrhage. She was discharged on the 17th day to a rehabilitation facility and then to home; medications included labetalol, amlodipine, pra-zosin, quetiapine, metoprolol, hydralazine, cloni-dine, omeprazole, atorvastatin, phenytoin, minoxidil, ondansetron hydrochloride, folic acid, thiamine, prednisone, enoxaparin, acetylsalicylic acid, nicotine patch, and insulin on a sliding scale as needed for hyperglycemia. Twelve days after discharge, she was readmitted with lethargy and respiratory distress. Chest radiography showed pleural effusions and atelec-tasis, and underlying pneumonia could not be ruled out. MRI scans of the brain showed new punctate acute infarcts in the right temporal and left occipital lobes and partial resolution of the previously described extensive abnormalities seen on T2-weighted imaging. Despite mechanical ventilation and antibiotic therapy, her condition did not improve. On the ninth day, the hemat-ocrit suddenly fell. Her family decided to institute comfort measures only, and she died shortly after extubation. An autopsy was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,09,nejm-case-2012-09,A 67-Year-Old Man with a Persistently Elevated PSA Level,"A 67-year-old man was seen in the cancer center at this hospital because of a persistently elevated serum level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Seven and a half years earlier, the patient’s serum level of PSA was elevated on routine testing at another institution (Table 1). A biopsy specimen of the prostate gland was obtained; pathological examinations of the tissue reportedly showed no evidence of tumor. During the next 6 years, serum levels of PSA remained elevated (Table 1); examination of three additional biopsy specimens, including one obtained approximately 7 months before this presentation, reportedly showed no tumor cells. A fifth prostatic biopsy was performed with the use of transrectal ultrasound guidance, with inclusion of transition zones and the anterior horn (the far lateral regions of the peripheral zone), 3.5 months before this presentation. Pathological examination of the tissue revealed a tiny focus of adenocarcinoma (Gleason score, 6 out of 10 [grade 3 plus grade 3]; the Gleason score is the sum of the two most common histologic grades in a prostate-gland tumor, each of which is rated on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the most cytologically aggressive1). The adenocarcinoma involved less than 5% of 1 of 3 cores of tissue obtained from the left transition zone (of a total of 25 cores obtained, 1 was positive). Twelve days later, physical examination reportedly revealed a nontender and smooth prostate gland (45 ml in volume), without palpable nodules. Two weeks later, a bone scan reportedly showed uptake in a rib posteriorly on the right side, in the left side of the skull, and in the maxilla on the left side (thought to be caused by dental disease), as well as questionable lesions in the lumbar spine, all of which were indeterminate for cancer. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis reportedly revealed hyperdense lesions in the left acetabulum, the sacrum, the third lumbar vertebral body on the left, and the 9th and 10th ribs on the right posteriorly. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed no evidence of metastatic disease. Two months before this evaluation, radiographs of the ribs and lumbosacral spine showed no evidence of metastases. Bicalutamide was administered for 10 days. The day after the initiation of therapy, biopsy of the third lumbar vertebra was performed with CT guidance; the specimen was reportedly negative for cancer. After bicalutamide therapy, leuprolide acetate was administered parenterally in two 1-month depot doses (8 weeks and 11 days before this presentation). Three weeks before this evaluation, MRI of the lumbar spine revealed no enhancement of the lesion in the L3 vertebral body, a probable bone island at the pedicle of the third lumbar vertebra, and a hemangioma at the second lumbar vertebra. Thirteen days before this evaluation, the testing of the PSA level was repeated (Table 1). The patient sought a second opinion at the cancer center at this hospital. The patient reported hot flashes approximately two or three times per week and nocturia once nightly. He reported no other genitourinary symptoms (including urgency, incomplete bladder emptying, weak stream, intermittency, hesitancy, dysuria, hematuria, incontinence, or erectile dysfunction), gastrointestinal symptoms, rectal bleeding, or other symptoms. The score on the American Urological Association Symptom Index was 3 on a scale of 0 to 35 (with 0 indicating no symptoms and 35 indicating the most severe symptoms). The patient had hypertension, hyperlipid-emia, and diverticulitis. He had had a partial colectomy for a ruptured diverticulum 14 years earlier; an incisional hernia at the site required the placement of mesh. Medications included simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, aspirin (325 mg daily), and a multivitamin. He had no known al-lergies. He was married and had retired from an office position. He stopped smoking 30 years earlier after approximately 10 years, stopped drinking alcohol 10 years earlier after moderate use, and did not use illicit drugs. His father had prostate cancer in his 60s that was untreated, and he died 20 years later with metastatic prostate cancer; his mother had had breast cancer and died at 88 years of age of a stroke; and a sister had had breast cancer at 39 years of age and died 10 years later of metastatic disease. His children and grandchildren were healthy. On examination, the vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 32.7. The prostate was slightly enlarged (30 ml in volume), without nodules; the remainder of the examination was normal, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 indicating that the patient is fully active and 5 indicating death. A bone scan obtained after the administration of technetium-99m–labeled methylene diphospho-nate showed a focus of intense uptake in the left lateral frontoparietal region of the skull, which was worrisome for metastatic disease, and multiple foci of additional uptake that were unchanged from the previous study; the findings were thought to be probably benign. The platelet count was 112,000 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000); the blood level of urea nitrogen was 26 mg per deciliter (reference range, 8 to 24) and of IgM was 29 mg per deciliter (reference range, 50 to 200). Other test results were normal, including the remainder of the complete blood count, serum protein electrophoresis, white-cell differential count, tests of liver function, and blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, creatinine, total protein, albumin, and globulin. Testing for hepatitis A, B, and C viruses and monoclonal immunoglobulin was negative. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,34,nejm-case-2010-34,A 65-Year-Old Woman with an Incorrect Operation on the Left Hand,"A 65-year-old woman was admitted to the day-surgery unit at this hospital for release of a trigger finger of the left ring finger. Approximately 3 months earlier, the patient was seen in the orthopedic clinic at this hospital because of pain and stiffness in the ring finger of the left hand. She reported that the finger intermittently “got stuck” in flexion. She had a history of coronary-artery and carotid-artery atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes melli-tus, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. She had had a cholecystectomy in the past. Medications included nitroglycerin and nitrate preparations, metformin, levothy-roxine, simvastatin, acetylsalicylic acid, and vitamins. She had no known allergies. She had been born in a Caribbean country and spoke only Spanish. She lived with her son. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. On examination, there was tenderness in the palm at the base of the left ring finger over the A1 pulley of the flexor tendon sheath and a slight flexion contrac-ture of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the left ring finger. There was snapping of the left ring finger with flexion and extension. Motor and sensory function and tendon balance were normal, and there was no angular or rotational deformity. A diagnosis of idiopathic trigger finger (stenosing tenosynovitis) was made. The patient elected a trial of dexamethasone, which was injected locally. At follow-up 8 weeks later, she reported no improvement in the joint symptoms. The examination was unchanged. The risks, benefits, limitations, and alternatives of operative and nonoperative treatment were discussed. The patient decided to proceed with surgery. Ten days later, the patient was admitted to the day-surgery unit, and carpal-tunnel-release surgery was performed without complications. Immediately after completing the procedure, the surgeon realized that he had performed the incorrect operation.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2011,19,nejm-case-2011-19,A 4-Year-Old Haitian Boy with Vomiting and Diarrhea,"Dr. Ana A. Weil (Medicine): A 4-year-old Haitian boy was admitted to a hospital in Haiti affiliated with this hospital because of vomiting and diarrhea of 10 hours’ duration. The patient had been well until approximately midnight the night before admission, when vomiting and diarrhea developed. After approximately 6 hours of symptoms, his parents brought him to the hospital by motorcycle taxi, traveling for 4 hours. On arrival, 10 hours after the onset of symptoms, episodes of vomiting and diarrhea were too numerous to count. The patient’s parents said that he had not urinated for hours. He had reportedly previously been healthy. He lived in a small village in Haiti with his parents and sibling. His 8-year-old brother had had mild diarrhea the previous day. On examination, the patient seemed irritable and was rapidly drinking offered liquids. The pulse was low volume, at a rate of 150 beats per minute; the respirations were shallow, without retractions, at a rate of 45 breaths per minute; and the skin was not hot to the touch. The blood pressure and temperature were not obtained because of lack of equipment. The weight was estimated at 15 kg. The eyes were sunken, skin recoil was less than 1 second but not instantaneous, capillary refill was 2 seconds, and the skin and mucous membranes were dry. The lungs were clear, and there was mild abdominal tenderness. During the examination, the patient passed a clear, watery stool. He was admitted to the hospital, where he shared a cot with a pediatric patient who had similar symptoms, including diarrhea. A reduced-osmolarity oral rehydration solution (ORS) consisting of glucose, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and trisodium citrate dihydrate (with 75 mmol of glucose per liter, 75 mmol of sodium per liter, 20 mmol of potassium per liter, 65 mmol of chloride per liter, and 10 mmol of citrate per liter), with a total osmolar-ity of 245 mmol per liter, was administered. During the next hour, two episodes of vomiting and numerous episodes of diarrhea occurred. On reexamination 1 hour after the initiation of treatment, the patient had ingested less than 200 ml. He was combative and pushed away the ORS. The pulse was weak, and the hands and feet were cool and clammy. Simultaneous attempts at insertion of intravenous catheters in the antecubital region and the hand were unsuccessful; the patient became increasingly obtunded. On the third attempt at intravenous access, a catheter was inserted into the saphe-nous vein of the foot. A bolus (500 ml) of isotonic crystalloid solution containing sodium chloride, sodium lactate, potassium chloride, and calcium chloride was administered, with manual pressure applied to the bag. The patient remained lethargic. Dextrose (30 ml of a 20% solution) was administered rapidly into the intravenous catheter, without improvement in mental status. A second intravenous catheter was placed in the right antecubital region. Another bolus (500 ml) of crystalloid solution was infused during a 30-minute period, with improvement in the level of consciousness, followed by a second liter of the solution during the next 2 hours. Approximately 4 hours after presentation, episodes of diarrhea were occurring too often to count, the frequency of vomiting had decreased, and no urine output had occurred. On examination, the patient was eagerly drinking ORS, and his mental status was markedly improved. The eyes remained sunken, and skin turgor was slightly decreased from normal. Azithromycin (300 mg) was administered orally. His family was encouraged to have the patient consume 200 ml of ORS per stool produced. During the next 4 hours, he had at least six episodes of diarrhea and drank approximately 400 ml of ORS; 1 liter of the crys-talloid solution was administered intravenously. Eight hours after presentation, the total intravenous intake was 3 liters, or approximately 200 ml per estimated kilogram of body weight. He had urinated twice. On examination, there were no signs of dehydration, the pulse was 100 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute, without rales or cough. During the remainder of the first day, an additional liter of intravenous solution was administered (a total of 4 liters during 24 hours, or approximately 267 ml per kilogram). Overnight, the frequency of diarrhea decreased, with an estimated 10 stools and no vomiting. Oral intake included less than 200 ml of ORS and some broth. On the morning of the second day, the patient’s parents reported that he had cramping in his legs. On examination, signs of dehydration were present, including sunken eyes and slightly decreased skin turgor, with mild abdominal distention and tenderness. A bolus (500 ml) of crystal-loid was administered intravenously over a period of 4 hours, and an educator was assigned to assist his parents in understanding the importance of ORS intake. During the next 4 hours, he consumed approximately 800 ml of ORS without vomiting. Signs of dehydration resolved, and abdominal distention decreased. Infusions of intravenous fluid were decreased to minimal flow. His parents were instructed again to match stool output by administering approximately 200 ml of ORS per stool, and his diet was increased to include meals of chicken broth and mashed bananas. During the second night, three episodes of diarrhea occurred, and another episode between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m. On the third morning, the patient successfully consumed meals of solid food and ORS. He was discharged after 2.5 days, with instructions to the parents about oral hydration, point-of-use water sterilization, and hand sanitation with soap. One week after discharge, a diagnostic test result was received.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2008,03,nejm-case-2008-03,An 80-Year-Old Woman with Cutaneous Basal-Cell Carcinomas and Cysts of the Jaws,"Dr. Gabriela Rolz-Cruz (Dermatology): An 80-year-old woman was seen in the outpatient clinic of this hospital for management of recurrent ulcerated skin lesions on the scalp. When the patient was approximately 34 years old, 40 to 50 lesions, which were red and slightly elevated, developed on her back. The lesions were fulgurated at another hospital and resolved. Two years later, lesions on her back recurred and increased in number during the next several years, and similar lesions developed on her scalp. At the age of 40 years, the patient was admitted to this hospital. There were multiple lesions on the scalp: one in the right frontoparietal region (3 by 2 cm), another in the right temporal area, and others in both preauricular areas. There were four lesions over the sternum, one of which was pigmented and 1.0 cm in diameter, and there were approximately 40 lesions on the back, which were red and slightly raised. A full-thickness excision of the largest scalp lesion and split-thickness skin grafting and electrodessication and curettage of the other lesions were performed. Pathological examination of the excised tissue revealed basal-cell carcinoma; the resection margins were close at one edge. During the next 40 years, the patient was followed in the dermatology tumor clinic of this hospital. Basal-cell carcinoma recurred in the periphery of the previous graft, and additional lesions developed on the scalp, face, neck, chest, and central portion of the back (Fig. 1). She was treated with 5% fluorouracil in propylene-glycol solution applied to the face and torso two or three times a day and sunblock applied to exposed skin. Persistent lesions were treated with electrodessication and curettage or cryosurgery, and other lesions were excised. When the patient was 50 years of age, the lesions included multiple red and pearly telangiectatic papules on the middle and lateral portions of the back (Fig. 2A), a papule (3 by 2 mm) behind the right ear with telangiectasia, and multiple superficial erythematous papular lesions on the lower portion of the back and scalp. Pseudopits with keratotic lesions and slight depressions in the center, 1 to 2 mm in diameter, were present on both palms (Fig. 2B). When the patient was 54 years old, biparietal frontal bossing with flattening over the frontal area was noted. A radiograph of the skull revealed thickening over the left cal-varia, rarefaction of bone over the right calvaria, and extensive calcification of the falx cerebri. Lesions on the temporal–occipital and parietal scalp, ranging from 0.5 to 11.0 cm in diameter, When the patient was 55 yearsAUTHOR PLEASE NOTE:of age, several Figure has been redrawn and type has been reset of the scalp lesions were excised and covered with Please check carefully Issue date               1/24/08 a partial-thickness skin graft harvested from the left thigh.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2011,39,nejm-case-2011-39,A Woman in Her 90s with Unilateral Ptosis,"Dr.Xuemei Cai (Medicine): A woman in her 90s was seen in the emergency department at this hospital because of ptosis of the left eyelid. The patient had been in her usual health until 4 days earlier when, on awakening, she was unable to open her left eye. She reported no periorbital swelling, discharge, pruritus, blurred or double vision, or weakness of her limbs. She was right-handed and had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, kyphosis due to degenerative spinal disease, and complete heart block, for which a permanent pacemaker had been inserted 5 years earlier. She had had herpes zoster and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the past. Medications included doxazosin, furo-semide, simvastatin, lisinopril, alendronate sodium, a multivitamin, calcium, and vitamin D. She was allergic to acetylsalicylic acid, penicillin, sulfa drugs, and codeine. Hydrochlorothiazide had caused hyponatremia. She was single and retired and lived independently, performing all activities of daily living, shopping with friends, and walking 50 to 60 minutes per day. She drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. On examination, the vital signs were normal. There was ptosis of the left upper eyelid, and the patient was unable to elevate the left eyelid. Visual acuity was 20/40 in the left eye and 20/30 in the right eye. Extraocular movements were intact, with two to three beats of nystagmus on leftward gaze. There was 2+ bilateral pedal edema. A tremor of the hands was present at rest, which increased when the patient raised her arms. There was some past pointing on finger–nose–finger testing. The remainder of the examination was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 18 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 17); serum levels of glucose, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were tests of renal and liver function. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed 3 to 5 white cells and 2+ squamous cells per high-power field, 0 to 2 granular casts per low-power field, and mucin. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was unchanged from 3.5 years earlier, with a paced rhythm and left atrial enlargement. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain without the administration of contrast material and CT angiography showed extensive periventricular white-matter hypoden-sities and focal occlusion of the distal right vertebral artery near the vertebrobasilar junction. There was also a rounded soft-tissue mass (1.6 cm in diameter) in the region of the left cavernous sinus with a 4-mm enhancing focus laterally that was thought to be a thrombosed aneurysm. Dysfunction of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, possibly caused by spontaneous disinser-tion of the levator palpebrae tendon, was diagnosed. While preparing for discharge, the patient reported feeling unsteady. On reexamination, she was unable to walk without assistance and her gait was wide-based; the results were otherwise unchanged. She was observed overnight; physical therapy and occupational health consultations were obtained, and she was discharged the following day to a rehabilitation hospital for reconditioning and assistance with ambulation. At the rehabilitation hospital, ptosis of the left eyelid and hypertension persisted. Amlodipine be-sylate was administered. During the first 2 weeks, the patient reported neck stiffness. On examination, the neck was flexed and a change in her voice quality was noted, which transiently improved when she raised her head. A soft cervical collar, a lidocaine patch, and heat were applied. Ten days after admission, the level of serum sodium was 130 mmol per liter. Furosemide was stopped, saline boluses and salt tablets were administered, and fluid restriction was begun. During the next 10 days, the sodium level gradually fell to a nadir of 120 mmol per liter. The level of brain natri-uretic peptide was 113 pg per milliliter (reference range, 5 to 99). The systolic blood pressure rose to 159 mm Hg, and the administration of metoprolol was begun, followed by isosorbide dinitrate, with improvement. On the 14th day, CT of the head showed no change. The serum sodium level gradu-ally rose to 130 to 131 mmol per liter, and the fluid restriction was lifted. Approximately 6 weeks after admission to the rehabilitation hospital, dysphagia, choking, and hoarseness developed, associated with increasing fatigue and difficulty holding up her head. Repeat CT of the head revealed no changes. A modified barium-swallow study reportedly revealed aspiration of thin liquids. She was brought to the emergency department at this hospital. The blood pressure was 124/74 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 92 to 98% while she was breathing ambient air; other vital signs were normal. The neck was supple. There was ptosis of the left eyelid, mild intention tremor, a strong gag reflex, and 1+ deep-tendon reflexes throughout; plantar reflexes were flexor. Gait was not tested, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Results of laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. A repeat ECG was unchanged. A chest radiograph showed a dual-lead cardiac pacemaker, low lung volumes, bilateral small pleural effusions, and bibasilar atelectasis; mild enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette with a tortuous and calcified thoracic aorta and diffuse osteopenia were present, unchanged from earlier studies. Gram’s staining of a sputum specimen revealed polymorphonuclear leukocytes, squamous cells, and mixed gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. The administration of clopidogrel bisulfate was begun. The next morning, the patient returned to the rehabilitation hospital; a diet of pureed food and thick fluids was instituted. Further evaluation of the mass in the cavernous sinus was planned. The next day, the patient was noted to be coughing and choking on her food and she reported difficulty breathing. The temperature was 37.8°C and the oxygen saturation 89 to 90% while she was breathing ambient air; supplemental oxygen (1 liter by nasal cannula) was administered. A chest radiograph reportedly showed an infiltrate in the lower lobe of the right lung. She was transferred to this hospital. The patient stated that she did not wish to be intubated or resuscitated in the event of respiratory failure or cardiac arrest. On examination, she was wearing a soft cervical collar and appeared frail. The blood pressure was 147/74 mm Hg, the pulse 72 beats per minute, the temperature 36.1°C, and the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, with accessory muscle use. Oxygen saturation was 96% while she was breathing oxygen (4 liters) by nasal cannula and fell to 83% when she was breathing ambient air. The neck was supple, with decreased muscle tone. She was unable to extend her neck (i.e., raise her head) against gravity. Jugular venous pressure was 7 to 8 cm above the right atrium. There were heavy secretions in the oropharynx and diffuse coarse rhonchi. Reflexes were 2+ and symmetric, and the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Levels of platelets, calcium, magnesium, glucose, total protein, amylase, and lipase were normal, as were tests of liver and renal function. Other test results are shown in Table 1. An ECG was unchanged. A chest radiograph showed bilateral basilar opacities consistent with atelectasis, aspiration pneumonia, or both. There were changes that were consistent with mild interstitial edema. Vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, furose-mide, and methylprednisolone were administered intravenously, and albuterol and ipratropium by nebulizer. Bilevel positive airway pressure was administered intermittently, complicated by episodic hypotension (systolic pressure, 70 to 80 mm Hg); the partial pressure of carbon dioxide fell to 82 mm Hg. An ice-pack test (placing ice on the affected eyelid to determine whether ptosis is reduced) was performed, with equivocal results. Laboratory-test results on the third day are shown in Table 1. In consultation with the family, and according to the previously expressed wishes of the patient, comfort measures only were administered, and the patient died on the third day. An autopsy was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2013,04,nejm-case-2013-04,A 50-Year-Old Man with Acute Flank Pain,"Dr. Emily A. Kendall (Medicine): A 50-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of acute pain in the left flank. The patient had been well, with a history of Hodgkin’s lymphoma 15 years earlier, until approximately 6 a.m. on the day of admission, when pain in the left flank occurred while he was bicycling. The pain was localized, without radiation, and increased during the next 7 hours from 3 to 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He came to the emergency department of this hospital. At a routine annual visit 4 days before admission, the patient reported feeling well. Examination revealed nontender varicoceles and prostatic hypertrophy; the remainder of the examination was normal. A tetanus–diphtheria–pertussis vaccine booster was administered. During the next 4 nights, he noted mild nausea and temperatures to 38.1°C, without chills, which he attributed to the vaccination. Fifteen years earlier, a diagnosis of Hodgkin’s lymphoma had been made, and the patient had received six courses of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacar-bazine, as well as radiation therapy and splenectomy; hypothyroidism had developed after treatment. He also had migraines, hyperlipidemia (type IIA), biapical pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary sarcoidosis. A stress echocardiogram 21 months before admission showed normal left ventricular function at rest, a mildly thickened tricuspid aortic valve, mild aortic insufficiency, mild aortic-root dilatation, and trivial regurgitation of the other valves; the stress echocardiogram was negative for ischemia. Medications included calcium citrate, enteric-coated aspirin, simvastatin, levothyroxine, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (ergocalciferol), and he had received immunization against Haemophilus influenzae, pneumococcus, and meningococcus in the past. He was married and worked in an office. He maintained a high-fiber, low-fat diet, and he exercised, drank alcohol in moderation, and did not smoke. His mother had had breast cancer, and she and a maternal aunt had had coronary artery disease. On examination, the patient was alert and oriented and appeared uncomfortable. The temperature was 37.3°C, the blood pressure 158/72 mm Hg, the pulse 76 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. A holosystolic soft murmur, grade 2/6, was heard at the apex, with radiation to the ax-illa, and a crescendo–decrescendo systolic murmur, grade 2/6, also was heard at the base, especially at the left upper sternal border. The abdomen was nondistended, with normal bowel sounds and moderate tenderness to palpation in the left flank below the costophrenic angle, without guarding. Examination for Murphy’s sign was negative. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, amylase, and lipase were normal, as were the hematocrit, the hemoglobin level, the platelet count, and urinalysis; tests of coagulation, renal function, and liver function were negative. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Cultures of blood and urine were obtained. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 78 beats per minute, with probable left ventricular hypertrophy. Intravenous fluids, ondansetron, and narcotic analgesia were administered, as were the patient’s usual doses of levothyroxine and simvastatin. There was symptomatic improvement. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis after the administration of oral and intravenous contrast material showed layered hyperdense material in the gallbladder, a feature suggestive of gallstones, and a focal wedge-shaped defect in the left inferolateral kidney, with patent renal arteries and veins (Fig. 1). CT of the thorax, performed according to a protocol for the assessment of pulmonary embolism, revealed bilateral posteromedial fibrosis and pulmonary nodules, 2 to 3 mm in diameter, in the right lung, which were stable as compared with previous studies. There was no evidence of filling defects in the pulmonary arteries or of me-diastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy. Seven hours after presentation, the patient’s temperature rose to 37.8°C. He was admitted to the hospital. Diagnostic tests were performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,14,nejm-case-2010-14,A 54-Year-Old Woman with Dizziness and Falls,"Dr. Emily P. Zeitler (Medicine): A 54-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of episodes of dizziness resulting in falls. Approximately 2 months earlier, while walking to work, the patient had the sudden onset of dizziness and the sensation of falling to the left, associated with dia-phoresis and palpitations. She sat down, and the symptoms improved, although she continued to feel as though she would fall to the left. She was taken by ambulance to another hospital and admitted. She had a history of borderline hypertension and intermittent atrial fibrillation but had been otherwise well. Medications included metoprolol (25 mg three times daily), furosemide, and propafenone. On examination, the vital signs reportedly showed orthostatic changes in the pulse and blood pressure, and the neurologic evaluation was normal. Fluids were administered intravenously. Furosemide and propafenone were discontinued, the dose of metoprolol was decreased (25 mg twice daily), and she was discharged. During the next 6 weeks, additional episodes of dizziness occurred and increased in frequency; the patient fell several times. She consulted a neurologist and was admitted twice to the other hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and carotid ultrasonography were reportedly normal. Treatment with meclizine was begun, without improvement, and a 5-day course of levofloxacin was administered. On the day of admission, an episode of dizziness occurred, with the sensation of almost passing out. The patient was brought to the emergency department of this hospital by a friend. On arrival, she reported continued dizziness as well as a generalized headache. She reported that the episodes of dizziness occurred only when standing, never when sitting or supine, and were associated with a sensation of falling, diaphoresis, weakness in the legs, and occasionally, palpitations. During the episodes, she could hear coworkers speak but did not feel fully alert, and she had to hold on to a support to avoid staggering or falling. She did not sense the room spinning, and she did not have visual changes, loss of consciousness, fever, chills, urinary retention, or a change in bowel habits. Fifteen years earlier, the patient had had several episodes of vertigo, with a sensation that the room was spinning, which lasted up to 3 to 4 days, were not related to position or associated with tinnitus or hearing loss, and were different from her current symptoms. The symptoms resolved without treatment and did not recur. A diagnosis of atrial fibrillation had been made 2 years before admission, after an episode of palpitations. One year before admission, transtho-racic echocardiography and a cardiac stress test had reportedly been normal. She had chronic pto-sis of the left eyelid and mild peripheral edema. She had had three cesarean sections. She was widowed, worked as a waitress, and had been unable to work for 3 weeks because of her symptoms. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had had hypertension and cardiac arrhythmia and had died at 76 years of age, a sister had occasional supraventricular tachycardia, and a son had epilepsy; her other children and grandchildren were healthy. Her paternal family history was not known. Medications on admission included metoprolol, meclizine, and acetylsalicylic acid. She was allergic to penicillin and sulfa drugs. On examination, the temperature was 36.7°C, the blood pressure 145/63 mm Hg, the pulse 60 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while she was breathing ambient air. There was slight ptosis of the left eye, with no nystagmus, and no dysmetria on finger-to-nose or heel-to-shin testing. There was a mild intention tremor in the right arm. There were no symptoms or signs of vertigo on head-turning maneuvers. The gait was slightly ataxic, more prominently so with tandem gait, and she reported feeling as if she were falling forward and to the left. There was nonpitting edema (+) of the legs; the remainder of the general physical and detailed neurologic examination was normal. The complete blood count, the white-cell differential count, urinalysis, tests of coagulation and renal function, and serum levels of sodium, potassium, chloride, glucose, calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium were normal. Toxicologic screening of urine was negative. An electrocardiogram revealed a sinus rhythm of 53 beats per minute, with evidence of clockwise rotation, left-axis deviation, left anterior hemiblock, left atrial enlargement, and minor nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. MRI and magnetic resonance an-giographic (MRA) scans of the head and neck obtained after the administration of gadolinium revealed a few nonspecific ovoid foci of hyperin-tensity, 5 to 6 mm in diameter, on T2-weighted imaging and on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences in the subcortical white matter in the right frontal lobe and both parietal lobes, without associated abnormal enhancement or decreased diffusion on diffusion-weighted imaging; these were thought to represent old subcortical infarcts. No intracranial mass, hemorrhage, or midline shift was identified. MRA showed no evidence of aneurysm or hemodynamically significant stenosis. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Initial measurement of orthostatic vital signs revealed changes in blood pressure and pulse (Table 1) that were associated with light-headed-ness. Normal saline (a total of 1500 ml) was administered intravenously; the level of plasma urea nitrogen decreased from 20 mg per deciliter (7 mmol per liter) to 11 mg per deciliter (4 mmol per liter), but light-headedness and unsteadiness on standing persisted. Cardiac monitoring showed sinus tachycardia during the episodes of light-headedness. Repeated measurements of ortho-static vital signs on the second day are shown in Table 1. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 76%, without wall-motion abnormalities, and mild tricus-pid insufficiency. Cardiac monitoring for 24 hours revealed sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia, with rates ranging from 77 to 144 beats per minute; there were 83 isolated premature ventricular contractions, 147 atrial premature contractions, and one run of su-praventricular tachycardia (7 beats at a rate of 158 beats per minute) that coincided with symptoms of dizziness and palpitations. Meclizine and me-toprolol were discontinued. The levels of electrolytes, vitamin B1, vitamin B12, and folate were normal, and testing for thyroid peroxidase antibodies and screening for syphilis were negative. Serial testing of cardiac enzymes showed no evidence of myocardial infarction. Enoxaparin and aspirin were begun. On the fourth day, the patient reported the sudden onset of palpitations, without chest pain or shortness of breath. Measurements of the pulse and blood pressure are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram showed a supraventricular tachycardia with a ventricular rate of 150 beats per minute and a 2:1 conduction block, consistent with atrial flutter, and left-axis deviation. Meto-prolol was administered intravenously (10 mg) and orally (25 mg), with a return of sinus rhythm at 80 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 140/50 mm Hg. The plasma cortisol level at 4 a.m. was 3.6 μg per deciliter (99 nmol per liter) (reference range, <10 μg per deciliter [<276 nmol per liter]), and levels of free thyroxine, thyrotropin, and total triiodothyronine were normal. The administration of fludrocortisone (0.1 mg daily) and metoprolol (25 mg daily) was begun, and a high-salt diet was instituted. When she was evaluated by the physical therapy staff, she had difficulty standing (necessitating posterior support), was unable to stand with her feet together and eyes open for more than 10 seconds, and used a stepping strategy to avoid falling. Vital signs are shown in Table 1. She was given a cane for stability, and exercises were prescribed to improve balance. On the sixth day, no further ectopy was seen on cardiac telemetry, and she was discharged. At follow-up 5 days after discharge, she reported frequent episodes of light-headedness, dizziness, and unsteadiness, associated with palpitations. A diagnostic test result was received.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,18,nejm-case-2019-18,A 24-Year-Old Woman with a Pelvic Mass,"Dr. Alexander Melamed: A 24-year-old woman was seen in the emergency department of this hospital because of a pelvic mass. The patient had been well until 4 weeks before this presentation, when she began to notice an increased frequency of vaginal bleeding. At that time, an episode of vaginal bleeding occurred that lasted for 4 days and resembled her usual menstrual period. Ten days after the end of that bleeding episode, a second episode of similar duration and intensity occurred. On the morning of this presentation, the patient was evaluated in a local obstetrics and gynecology clinic. The blood human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level was 172 IU per liter (reference range in nonpregnant adults, <6). Transab-dominal and transvaginal ultrasonography was performed and reportedly revealed a normal-sized uterus, a 17-mm endometrial stripe, and no evidence of an intrauterine pregnancy. There was a complex cyst, measuring 13.1 cm by 8.3 cm by 11.7 cm, around the left adnexa; the cyst contained thickened septa and was composed mainly of large cystic areas with visible motion in the debris. The ovaries were not visualized. The patient was referred to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department, she reported constipation associated with bowel urgency and mild pelvic pressure. She had generalized anxiety disorder. Menarche had occurred at 16 years of age, and menstrual cycles were irregular, with bleeding typically occurring every 3 months and lasting for 4 days. The patient had never been pregnant and had no known history of sexually transmitted infections or abnormal results on screening tests for cervical cancer. She was monogamous with a long-term partner and used barrier contraception consistently. She took lorazepam as needed and had no known allergies to medications. The patient lived with her parents and sister in an urban area of New England and worked in an office. She drank alcohol twice weekly and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. Her paternal grandmother had received a diagnosis of uterine cancer as a young adult, her paternal grandfather had had gastric and prostate cancer, a paternal aunt had had breast cancer, a paternal uncle had had prostate cancer, and her maternal grandmother had died of liver cancer associated with hepatitis C virus. Her parents and sister were healthy. On examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 35.4°C, the pulse 92 beats per minute, the blood pressure 109/63 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while she was breathing ambient air. The weight was 52.2 kg, the height 155.6 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 21.6. The abdomen was soft, without distention or tenderness. Pelvic examination revealed normal female external genitalia and a normal vagina and cervix with scant white discharge; there was a large, mobile pelvic mass extending to the level of the umbilicus. The remainder of the examination was normal. The hemoglobin level, hematocrit, red-cell indexes, platelet count, anion gap, and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes and glucose; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed clear, yellow urine, with a specific gravity of 1.006, a pH of 7.0, and 1+ ketones on dipstick examination. Dr. Weier Li: A transabdominal ultrasound im-age of the pelvis (Fig. 1A) showed a complex left adnexal mass, measuring 13.4 cm by 9.3 cm by 12.9 cm. The mass had cystic components with posterior acoustic enhancement, as well as thickened hypervascular internal septa. The left ovary could not be visualized. There was a small amount of pelvic free fluid. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material, confirmed that the large pelvic mass was probably arising in the left ovary (Fig. 1B). The right ovary was normal. An enlarged lymph node, measuring 1.0 cm in diameter, was noted in the left paraaortic area (Fig. 1C). Dr. Melamed: Blood tests for lactate dehydroge-nase, CA 19-9, carcinoembryonic antigen, CA-125, inhibin A, inhibin B, and alpha-fetoprotein were performed. A follow-up appointment with a gynecologic oncologist was arranged, and the patient was discharged home. Seven days later, the patient was seen in the gynecologic oncology clinic at this hospital. She reported increased abdominal girth and mild pelvic discomfort that was relieved by ibuprofen. On examination, the patient appeared well, and the vital signs were normal. The abdomen was soft, moderately distended, and mildly tender. There was a large, palpable pelvic mass with limited mobility. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Laboratory test results that had become available after the patient had been discharged from the emergency department were reviewed (Table 1). A urine test for hCG was positive; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Management decisions were made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2018,35,nejm-case-2018-35,A 68-Year-Old Woman with Back Pain and a Remote History of Breast Cancer,"Ms. Diane P. Doyle, M.S.N. (Medicine): A 68-year-old woman with a history of bilateral breast cancer was evaluated at the oncology clinic of this hospital for back and pelvic pain. Twenty-five years before the current evaluation, the patient was noted to have a small lump in her left breast during a routine gynecologic examination. A mammogram showed no abnormality. A biopsy of the breast mass was performed, and examination of the biopsy specimen revealed evidence of invasive carcinoma that was estrogen receptor (ER)–positive and progesterone receptor (PR)–positive. Partial mastectomy of the left breast and dissection of axillary lymph nodes were performed, and examination of the specimens revealed the presence of two separate and distinct primary tumors. Histopathological analysis revealed ER-positive invasive ductal carcinoma (first primary tumor, 3 cm in diameter) and invasive lobular carcinoma (second primary tumor, 3 cm in diameter). Of the 10 dissected axillary lymph nodes, 2 were positive for carcinoma. A bone scan and chest radio-graph did not show evidence of metastatic disease, and blood electrolyte levels and results of liver- and renal-function tests were normal. The patient participated in a clinical trial,1 in which she was randomly assigned to receive initial treatment with four cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and fluorouracil followed by radiation therapy of the breast. In accordance with the clinical trial protocol, she did not receive tamoxifen but was monitored regularly with active surveillance. Twelve years after the initial diagnosis (13 years before the current evaluation), routine surveillance mammography revealed a cluster of calcifications in the right breast. An excisional biopsy was performed, and examination of the biopsy specimen revealed evidence of ductal carcinoma in situ and lobular neoplasia, with positive margins. The tumor was 1.2 cm in diameter, ER-positive, and moderately differentiated (grade 2 of 3). Genetic testing for a BRCA mutation was negative. The patient underwent partial mastectomy of the right breast followed by adjuvant radiation therapy, with a plan to complete 5 years of adjuvant anastrozole therapy. Four years later (9 years before this evaluation), the patient had exertional dys-pnea for 3 weeks. A ventilation–perfusion scan showed that there was a high probability of pulmonary embolism, and a d-dimer test was positive; the patient received a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Lupus anticoagulant was detected, although testing for cardiolipin IgG and IgM antibodies was negative. The patient was treated with low-molecular-weight heparin followed by warfarin therapy. During that time, she lost 22.7 kg, and anastrozole therapy was discontinued. Eighteen months after anastrozole was discontinued (7.5 years before this evaluation), pulmonary embolism recurred bilaterally, and the patient was again treated with warfarin therapy. Eight months before the current evaluation, pleuritic chest pain and axillary pain developed, and recurrent pulmonary embolism was again suspected. Dr. Meline D. Hovnanian: Computed tomography (CT), performed according to a pulmonary embolism protocol, revealed that the pulmonary emboli had resolved. In addition, CT incidentally revealed enlargement of a left axillary lymph node (11 mm in the short axis) and of a left subpec-toral lymph node (9 mm in the short axis) (Fig. 1). Repeat mammography and breast ultra-sonography were performed and revealed an enlarged left axillary lymph node (13 mm by 11 mm) that corresponded to one of the nodes seen on chest CT. Ms. Doyle: Given the depth of the lymph node, biopsy with ultrasonographic guidance was considered to be too technically difficult to perform, particularly since the patient was receiving war-farin therapy and had an increased risk of bleeding. After the patient’s surgical oncologist was consulted, a plan for short-term surveillance with imaging studies was implemented. Dr. Hovnanian: Two months before this evaluation, repeat imaging studies, including chest CT, mammography, and breast ultrasonography, were performed. Findings on ultrasonography and mammography had not changed from the studies obtained 6 months earlier. However, chest CT revealed multiple mixed lytic and blastic lesions in the thoracic vertebrae, ribs, and sternum that had not been present on the previous study, along with a mild compression deformity in the thoracic spine with an extradural enhancing focus at T10. The left axillary and subpectoral lymph nodes had not changed. There were multiple enhancing lesions in the spleen that measured up to 12 mm in diameter.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2008,35,nejm-case-2008-35,A 65-Year-Old Man with Confusion and Memory Loss,"Dr. Roy N. Alcalay (Neurology): A 65-year-old right-handed man was transferred to this hospital because of confusion and memory loss. He had been well until approximately 4 weeks before admission, when he began to have decreased energy and a change in mood. He told his family that he felt as if he was “living in a fog.”  Three weeks before admission, he lost his way while driving to his sister’s house; 9 days before admission, he did not arrive for his weekly visit with his aunt. When reached by telephone at home, the patient stated that he did not know where he was. He was taken by relatives to a local hospital. On admission to the hospital, a neurology consultant found that the patient was alert but unable to recall the events of that day and reported word-finding difficulty. The physical and neurologic examinations were otherwise normal. The serum level of vitamin B12 was 222 pg per milliliter (164 pmol per liter) (reference range, >250 pg per milliliter [>185 pmol per liter]), and Lyme antibody testing was negative. Results of other laboratory tests, including a complete blood count and tests for renal and hepatic function and levels of electrolytes, thyrotropin, and folate, were normal. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was normal, and a chest radiograph showed hyperinflation of the lungs. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain without the administration of contrast material showed minimal atrophic changes. On the second hospital day, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed changes in the medial temporal lobe bilaterally that did not enhance, with no evidence of a mass, infarct, or ischemia. A lumbar puncture was performed; results of an analysis of cerebrospinal fluid are shown in Table 1. On the eighth hospital day, CT of the chest and abdomen revealed an anterior mediastinal mass, 4.1 cm by 2.0 cm; calcified pleural plaques in the left middle chest; a tiny subpleu-ral nodule in the posterior right middle lung; three hepatic cysts; calcified gallstones; and a round nodule, 2.0 cm in diameter, of low density (10 to 20 Hounsfield units) in the right adrenal gland. A culture of the cerebrospinal fluid was sterile. Treatment with daily intravenous acyclovir was begun; other medications included thiamine, administered intramuscularly, as well as donepezil, lorazepam, and multivitamins. The patient’s condition did not improve, and on the 10th hospital day, he was transferred to this hospital. The patient had always lived in northern New England. He was a high school graduate and had been a good student. He never married and had worked as a supervisor in the shipbuilding industry until retirement. He was a camping enthusiast. He had no allergies, did not take any medications regularly, did not smoke, and rarely drank alcohol. His parents died late in life, an aunt had Alzheimer’s disease, and three sisters were alive and well. On neurologic examination, the patient was alert and interactive, with a mildly depressed and anxious affect and intermittent agitation during neurologic testing. The vital signs were normal. He was oriented to his name and to the season but not to the day, date, month, or year. He did not know he was in a hospital in Massachusetts. He was able to recite the months backward, and his speech was fluent with no paraphasic errors. Reading and writing were intact. He could register and repeat the names of three objects, but he recalled none after 3 minutes. He recognized his family members without difficulty. The first cranial nerve was not tested; other cranial nerves and motor, sensory, and coordination examinations were normal. The patellar reflexes were brisk bilaterally; other reflexes were normal. There was enlargement of the right scrotum. The remainder of the examination was normal. Acyclovir and thiamine were continued paren-terally, and multivitamins were continued orally. On the second hospital day, intravenous methyl-prednisolone and oral vitamin B12 were begun. Ultrasonography of the scrotum revealed normal testes and a large right hydrocele. T2 -weighted images and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images from the MRI examination of the brain, obtained after the administration of gado-linium, showed symmetric hyperintensity involving the medial temporal lobes, left basal fore-brain, and bilateral insular regions, on the left side more than on the right. There was no abnormal contrast enhancement or hemorrhage. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed an anterior mediastinal mass, 4 cm by 2 cm; sub-pleural nodules in the right middle lobe, 2 mm in diameter; and calcifications in the left pleura. A lumbar puncture was repeated (Table 1). The results of additional laboratory tests were pending. On the sixth hospital day, neuropsychological testing revealed profound anterograde amnesia and mild retrograde amnesia, as well as mild difficulty with phonemic fluency and visuospatial processing and construction (although the patient reported having blurred vision). His performance on neuropsychological tests was otherwise intact, with findings indicating preserved word finding, visual and verbal attention and working memory, cognitive flexibility, abstract reasoning, and processing speed. Later that day, a 4-day course of intravenous immune globulin (2 g per kilogram of body weight) was begun. On the seventh hospital day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2013,12,nejm-case-2013-12,An 18-Year-Old Woman with Pulmonary Infiltrates and Respiratory Failure,"Dr. James Sawalla Guseh (Medicine): An 18-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of pulmonary infiltrates and respiratory failure. The patient had been well until 3 weeks before admission, when fever and a cough productive of white, nonbloody sputum developed. During the next week, night sweats, extremely painful pharyngitis, pleuritic chest pain, increasing shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea occurred. She self-administered doses from an inhaler obtained from a relative, with transient improvement in dyspnea. Thirteen days before admission, she went to the emergency department at another hospital. On examination, the temperature was reportedly 39.4°C. Erythro-mycin and an albuterol inhaler were prescribed, and she returned home. Two days later, the patient went to a second hospital because of increasing cough productive of thick white sputum, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, shortness of breath, and anorexia. She reported chest pain that she rated at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. She had removed a tick from her abdomen approximately 1 week earlier. On examination, she was in mild respiratory distress. The blood pressure was 140/74 mm Hg, the pulse 127 beats per minute, the temperature 37.3°C, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while she was breathing ambient air. Her lips were dry, and coughing and scattered wheezing were heard. There was mild tenderness at the costo-vertebral angles and in all quadrants of the abdomen, without rebound; the rest of the examination was reportedly normal. Within 3 hours after arrival, the temperature rose to 38.9°C. Blood levels of lipase and amylase and results of tests of renal and liver function were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed trace protein, leukocytes, and bacteria and was otherwise normal. Dr. Victorine V. Muse: A chest radiograph obtained at the second hospital showed patchy opacities in the left middle and lower lung zones and in the right lung base, a finding suggestive of pneumonia. The cardiomediastinal silhouette was normal (Fig. 1A). Dr. Guseh: The patient was admitted to the second hospital, and azithromycin, ceftriaxone, doxycycline, levalbuterol, hydromorphone, and acetaminophen were administered. Testing for serum antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), as well as for legionella urinary antigen, was negative; doxycycline was stopped. During the first 4 days, respiratory distress worsened and fevers persisted. Dr. Muse: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed peribronchial thickening, patchy alveolar consolidation with geographic ground-glass opacities and air bronchograms, and adjacent small bilateral pleural effusions (Fig. 1B and 1C). A small pericardial effusion, a right para-tracheal lymph node that was 1.5 cm in diameter, and precarinal lymph nodes were the only notable findings in the mediastinum. The visualized portions of the upper abdomen were normal. Dr. Guseh: Ceftriaxone was stopped; vancomy-cin, cefepime, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, and methylprednisolone were begun, and azithro-mycin was continued. On the fifth day, dyspnea increased, and the trachea was intubated in an emergency procedure. Test results are shown in Table 1. Bronchoscopy revealed clear airways, without endobronchial lesions. Bronchoalveolar aspirate from the right upper lobe was hypocel-lular, with a few polymorphonuclear leukocytes, a few epithelial cells, and no organisms. Testing for Pneumocystis jirovecii and mycobacteria was negative; specimen quantity was limited, and viral studies could not be performed. Cultures of the bronchial washing grew normal respiratory flora; fungal and mycobacterial cultures were negative. A sputum specimen showed no eosino-phils. Cultures of the blood were sterile. Insulin, furosemide, albuterol, and lorazepam were given. On the sixth day, all antibiotics except azithromycin were stopped. Three days later, the patient was extubated. Increasing dyspnea and tachypnea developed, and the trachea was rein-tubated later that day. The following day, a CT scan of the chest showed persistent patchy, dense consolidation and air bronchograms, greater in the upper lobe of the left lung than in the lower lobe. Transtho-racic echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 65%, a mildly enlarged right ventricle, an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 35 mm Hg, and a pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade. Test results are shown in Table 1. Vancomycin and a combination of piperacillin and tazobactam were administered, and azithromycin was stopped. On the 11th hospital day, the patient was transferred to this hospital and admitted to the medical intensive care unit while receiving mechanical ventilation. Medications on transfer included vancomycin, piperacillin–tazobactam, methylprednisolone, insulin, propofol, omepra-zole, albuterol and ipratropium by nebulizer inhalation, nicotine, nystatin suspension, daltepa-rin, and miconazole powder. The patient had had tonsillitis and hand surgery in the past. She had no known allergies. She lived with her family and a cat and worked outdoors. Her bedroom reportedly was damp and moldy. She had not traveled recently, had a new boyfriend, and had no ill contacts. She smoked cigarettes and marijuana. Relatives had asthma, hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. On examination, the patient was sedated, intubated, and ventilated. She had a crusted lesion on her lip. The blood pressure was 112/64 mm Hg, the pulse 65 beats per minute, the temperature 37.0°C, the mean arterial pressure 78 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 95% while she was breathing 60% oxygen, with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 10 cm of water. Expiratory breath sounds were louder in the right lung than in the left lung; other lung sounds were obscured by ventilation. The first cardiac sound was normal, and there was prominent physiologic splitting of the second cardiac sound, with accentuation of the sound of pulmonic-valve closure. Pulsus para-doxus measured 4 mm Hg. The neurologic examination was limited by sedation; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and angio-tensin-converting enzyme were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests; other test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Muse: A portable chest radiograph obtained on admission to this hospital shows persistent but improved bilateral multifocal pneumonia (Fig. 1D). Dr. Guseh: Cefepime, vancomycin, nicotine, dalteparin, insulin, nystatin suspension, fentanyl, and propofol were administered, and the last two were gradually increased to enhance synchrony with the mechanical ventilator. Four hours after admission, the blood pressure decreased to 86/44 mm Hg, and the patient became diapho-retic; the administration of phenylephrine was begun, with improvement. Bronchoscopic examination revealed irritated mucosa in the airways of the right lung, with inflammation. Examination of bronchoalveolar-lavage aspirate from the right middle lobe and its lateral segment revealed colorless fluid with slight turbidity, 321 nucleated cells (51% neutro-phils, 18% lymphocytes, 16% monocytes, and 15% macrophage-lining cells), and a few clumps of cells. Diagnostic tests were performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2021,26,nejm-case-2021-26,A 49-Year-Old Man with Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia,"CME at NEJM.org Dr. Richard A. Newcomb: A 49-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Fourteen months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated at another hospital because of pain in the right upper quadrant that had begun 4 days earlier and was associated with nausea and vomiting. Abdominal imaging revealed evidence of acute cholecystitis. Initial laboratory test results showed peripheral blasts that were suggestive of acute leukemia. The patient was transferred to a second hospital for additional evaluation. At the second hospital, abdominal imaging confirmed acute cholecystitis, and a calculus was found lodged in the neck of the gallbladder. The white-cell count was 4200 per microliter (reference range, 4200 to 9900), of which 40% were blasts. A peripheral-blood smear was notable for circulating blasts with Auer rods. The hemoglobin level was 11.7 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.0 to 17.4), and the platelet count was 22,000 per micro-liter (reference range, 140,000 to 440,000). A bone marrow biopsy was performed, followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Dr. Andrew M. Crabbe: The bone marrow biopsy performed at the second hospital was inadequate owing to the small size of the specimen; however, intact bone marrow particles showed a cellularity of 95 to 100%. A 300-cell differential count on combined touch-imprint and aspirate smears showed 39% blasts, 3% promy-elocytes, 19% neutrophils and precursors, 5% erythroid precursors, 30% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes, 1% eosinophils, and less than 1% basophils. The blasts were medium in size, with irregular nuclear contours, moderately clumped chromatin, occasional prominent small nucleoli, and scant granular cytoplasm. Auer rods were identified. Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood identified myeloid blasts that were negative for CD34 and HLA-DR and positive for CD117, CD33, CD13, and myeloperoxidase. Cytogenetic analysis of the peripheral blood with the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed a normal karyotype (46,XY) and no evidence of a t(15;17) chromosomal translocation. Molecular testing of the peripheral blood by means of dedicated polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing and next-generation sequencing identified mutations in NPM1, DNMT3A, and NRAS and did not identify mutations in FLT3, IDH1, or IDH2. The overall findings of this testing were consistent with the World Health Organization classification of AML with mutated NPM1. Dr. Newcomb: Induction chemotherapy with 7 days of cytarabine and 3 days of daunorubicin was administered. On day 34 after the initiation of chemotherapy, the absolute neutrophil count was 2.2 per microliter (reference range, 1.5 to 7.5), and the platelet count was 536,000 per micro-liter. A bone marrow biopsy performed on day 37 after initiation of chemotherapy revealed hyper-cellular marrow with maturing trilineage hema-topoiesis. There was no morphologic or pheno-typic evidence of persistent or relapsed AML. A 300-cell sample of the bone marrow aspirate contained less than 1% blasts. Consolidation chemotherapy with four cycles of high-dose cy-tarabine was completed 8 months before the current presentation. Dr. Crabbe: A bone marrow biopsy performed after the final cycle of chemotherapy revealed normocellular marrow with trilineage hemato-poiesis; there was no morphologic or phenotypic evidence of AML. Next-generation sequencing of the bone marrow biopsy specimen revealed no pathogenic mutations. Dr. Newcomb: The patient remained well for 7 months. One month before the current presentation, mild leukopenia developed, and more frequent laboratory monitoring was instituted. One week before the current presentation, the white-cell count was 2600 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 10,000), of which 13% were peripheral blasts. The patient was referred to this hospital for evaluation. On presentation to this hospital, the patient reported a 3-week history of progressive fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, exercise intolerance, widespread muscle aches, and night sweats. He noted that similar symptoms had preceded his initial diagnosis. Medical history included obesity and hypertension. The patient was not taking medications on a regular basis. He was allergic to chlorhexi-dine, which caused rash. He lived in rural New England with his wife and four children. He worked as a software engineer. He did not smoke, and he drank alcohol rarely. His mother had coronary artery disease, and a sister had had a stroke. He had three other siblings who were healthy. There was no family history of leukemia or other hematologic disorders. On examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 35.7°C. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 43. No lymphadenopathy, rashes, or skin lesions were present. The remainder of the examination was normal. The white-cell count was 5830 per micro-liter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), of which 39.6% were blasts. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A bone marrow biopsy was performed, and management decisions were made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,02,nejm-case-2010-02,A 47-Year-Old Man with Abdominal and Flank Pain,"Dr. Rima A. Arnaout (Medicine): A 47-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain. The patient was in his usual state of health until 5 weeks before admission, when diffuse abdominal pain developed, most severe in the lower right quadrant and radiating to the right side and back; it decreased slightly with leaning forward, increased with other movements, including walking, and prevented him from sleeping. He went to an urgent care clinic at a health center affiliated with this hospital. The patient rated the pain between 5 and 10 on a scale of 0 to 10 (where 0 is no pain and 10 is the most severe pain). He reported that the pain was sharp and constant and that it was usually unrelated to eating but occasionally increased within 10 minutes after eating spicy, acidic, or high-fat foods. Neither bismuth nor magnesium hydroxide relieved the pain. His appetite and fluid intake had decreased in the past week. On examination, he appeared anxious. The blood pressure was 167/82 mm Hg, and the pulse 72 beats per minute. The abdomen was soft, with mild-to-moderate tenderness in the right lower quadrant, with no rebound tenderness or guarding. There were no masses or hernias, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Urinalysis revealed trace blood. He was referred to the emergency department of this hospital. The patient had had intermittent abdominal pain and constipation for 15 years. Computed tomographic (CT) scans of the abdomen and pelvis 4.5 years before admission, obtained after the oral and intravenous administration of contrast material, were interpreted as normal. At approximately the same time, endoscopic examinations of the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and colon revealed gastric mucosal atrophy and nonbleeding duodenal ulcers with clean bases. Infection with Helicobacter pylori was diagnosed, a 2-week course of eradication therapy and proton-pump inhibitors was administered, and his symptoms resolved. Three months before admission, an episode of light-headedness occurred that resolved spontaneously after 3 hours. Approximately 1.5 months before admission, an episode of pain in his left arm occurred that radiated to his heart and was associated with palpitations and tachycardia; it resolved spontaneously. The patient was born in Central America and lived in rural and urban areas until immigrating to the United States more than 25 years before admission; thereafter, he visited Central America twice annually. He lived alone and was unemployed, having previously worked in construction. He had smoked cigarettes for 30 years and drank alcohol rarely. His mother had hypercholester-olemia and diabetes mellitus, his father was healthy, his sister reportedly had chronic intermittent constipation alternating with diarrhea, and a maternal uncle had died suddenly at the age of 52 years. There was no family history of kidney or heart disease. The patient was taking no medications and had no known allergies. On examination, the blood pressure was 159/94 mm Hg; other vital signs were normal. The weight was 87.9 kg. The abdomen was soft, with mild, diffuse tenderness on palpation (greatest in the right lower quadrant), and there was bilateral flank pain, greater on the right side. The lungs were clear to auscultation, and the first and second heart sounds were normal, with a regular rhythm and no murmur. In the supine position, the point of maximal impulse was in the mid-clavicular line. The hematocrit was 40.4% (reference range, 41.0 to 53.0 in men), the platelet count 431,000 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000), the lipase level 3.5 U per deciliter (reference range, 1.3 to 6.0), and the amylase level 131 U per liter (reference range, 3 to 100). Other laboratory-test results (including the white-cell count and the differential count; serum levels of electrolytes, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, bilirubin, cholesterol, lipids, creatine ki-nase, creatine kinase isoenzymes, troponin T, and troponin I; and tests of coagulation and renal and liver function) were normal. Urinalysis revealed 3 to 5 red cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 2) and was otherwise normal. Narcotic analgesia and crystalloid solution were administered intravenously, and the pain level decreased to 5. CT of the abdomen and pelvis after the intravenous administration of contrast material revealed foci of cortical irregularity in the midregion of the left kidney, a peripheral wedge-shaped lesion with central low density and capsular enhancement in the midregion of the right kidney, and an ill-defined wedge-shaped hypoden-sity in the lower pole of the right kidney. Electrocardiography (ECG) revealed a sinus rhythm at 57 beats per minute, with T-wave inversions in the inferolateral leads, and was otherwise normal. The patient was admitted to the hospital. On the first hospital day, a chest radiograph was normal. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed segmental apical left ventricular dysfunction with an apical aneurysm, near obliteration of the mid-left ventricular cavity at end systole, and overall normal left ventricular systolic function (estimated ejection fraction, 58%). At the ventricular apex, there was a mobile echodense mass consistent with a thrombus, 1.0 cm by 0.8 cm. The left atrium was dilated 44 mm. The ascending aorta was 33 mm in diameter (normal, <36 mm). There was a patent foramen ovale and trace mi-tral, tricuspid, and pulmonary insufficiency. Tests for hypercoagulability (including a test for lupus anticoagulant; functional tests for antithrombin III, protein C, and protein S; and an assay for resistance to activated protein C) were normal, with no evidence of a factor V Leiden mutation or lupus anticoagulant. Cultures of the blood were sterile. Heparin was begun. On the second day, cardiac telemetry showed intermittent sinus bradycardia, with no ectopy. The abdominal pain decreased. Constipation, with bloating and abdominal cramping, and hypoactive bowel sounds developed. Docusate sodium, bisacodyl, and sennosides were administered, with gradual improvement. On the sixth day, cardiac catheterization revealed a subtle irregularity in the middle of the left anterior descending artery; the cardiac vessels were otherwise normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart showed a left ventricular apical aneurysm (3.6 cm by 3.2 cm by 3.1 cm). In retrospect, the aneurysm was visible on abdominal CT studies performed on admission and 4.5 years earlier and had not changed in size. There was mild, concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with a maximum wall thickness of 14 mm. After the administration of gadolinium, there was hyperintense signal in the thinned apical aneurys-mal wall consistent with abnormal delayed myocardial enhancement; this feature was suggestive of fibrosis, an infarct, or a scar. On the eighth day, a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram showed no evidence of the left ventricular apical mass but was otherwise unchanged. The patient was discharged that day with instructions to take enoxaparin, warfarin sodium, low-dose acetylsalicylic acid, atenolol, and acetaminophen. A diagnostic test result was received.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2009,34,nejm-case-2009-34,"A 20-Year-Old Man with Sore Throat, Fever, and Rash","Dr. Robert W. McGarrah (Medicine): A 20-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of sore throat, fever, and a diffuse rash. The patient had been well until approximately 4 weeks earlier, when sore throat developed. On examination by his internist, vital signs were normal, the temperature was 36.8°C, and there was pharyngeal erythema without cervical lymphadenopa-thy. A rapid streptococcal-antigen test was negative. The next day, he felt better. One week before admission, sore throat and fever recurred, and the patient returned to his internist the next day. The temperature was 37.1°C and the pulse 102 beats per minute; he appeared well. The tonsils were enlarged (3+), with exudate and petechiae, and there was shotty bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. A rapid test for streptococcal pharyngitis and a blood test for mononucleosis were negative. Amox-icillin–clavulanate was prescribed. The next day, 1 day after beginning the antibiotic therapy, a flat, red, even, itchy rash developed on the medial surface of his right arm, which he thought was poison ivy. During the next 3 days, the lesions became raised, enlarged, and painful and spread from his arms to his legs, back, hands, feet, and perioral area, without mucosal involvement. He took ibuprofen for the pain. Two days before admission, the patient returned to his primary care provider, who noted a generalized papular rash and sent him to the emergency department of a hospital near his home. Repeat testing for streptococcal pharyngitis was negative. Results of other tests are shown in Table 1. The administration of antibiotics was stopped, and a prednisone taper (starting dose, 40 mg) was begun. The fevers resolved, but the sore throat and rash persisted and then worsened; he saw his internist, who sent him to the emergency department of this hospital. The patient reported that the rash had evolved to large, painful, hemorrhagic vesicles and bullae that covered most of his body surface; the bullae frequently ruptured, leaking blood and clear fluid. He had odynophagia for solid foods, mild fatigue, swollen lymph nodes in his neck, and loose stools for approximately 4 days. He reported a weight loss of approximately 3 kg, because of pain and difficulty swallowing solids. He did not have headache, stiff neck, confusion, cough, rhinorrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, joint aches or effusions, or difficulty breathing. He had had varicella as a child, and he reported that the lesions had appeared smaller and more diffuse than the current presentation. He had a history of al-lergic rhinitis, a childhood history of otitis media for which he had taken amoxicillin–clavulanate without side effects, and a history of fractures of his right ankle and leg. He was a student and lived with roommates in an apartment in an urban area. He had observed mice in the building, but he had not entered a cellar or crawl space. He had been outdoors golfing recently and had gone to the beach more than 2 months earlier. He had not been hiking and reported no contact with ill persons, recent travel, or tick or other insect bites. He was sexually active, drank beer on the weekends, and did not use intravenous drugs. His father and paternal grandfather had prostate cancer; there was no family history of dermatologic disorders or melanoma. He was allergic to ceph-alosporins, which had caused a rash. He had taken prednisone (20 mg) by mouth earlier that day. His only other medication was fluticasone nasal spray as needed for allergic rhinitis. On examination, the temperature was 36.1°C, the blood pressure 143/85 mm Hg, the pulse 96 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. White plaque and exudate coated the uvula and tonsils, which were erythematous and had no mucosal ulcers. Focal, crusted erosions were present on the lips and ears. Tense vesicles and bullae on an ery-thematous base (ranging from 3 to 15 mm in diameter) diffusely involved the limbs (including the palms and dorsal surfaces of the feet), back, and buttocks. The lesions were tender on palpation. Some had hemorrhagic central crusting; some were denuded, yielding clear, thin fluid despite a clouded surface; and some had a central, dark, necrotic region with a rim of erythema. Patches of crusted vesicles were present in a linear distribution across the upper flank; the chest and abdomen were mostly spared. There were a few scattered smaller crusted vesicles and pustules on the philtrum, upper lip, and near the chin. Slightly enlarged lymph nodes, which were tender, soft, and freely mobile but not warm, were palpated in the anterior cervical region, more on the right side than on the left; no enlarged posterior cervical, inguinal, or axillary lymph nodes were present. There were no lesions involving the eyes, and the remainder of the examination was normal. The plasma levels of electrolytes, glucose, bilirubin, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, amylase, and lipase and tests of liver and renal function were normal; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Another test for streptococcal pharyngitis was negative, and an electrocardiogram was normal. He was admitted to the hospital. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen were administered as needed for pain, and a lidocaine–antacid–diphen-hydramine mouthwash was administered for pharyngitis. On the second day, test results for antibodies to varicella–zoster virus (VZV) IgG were positive. Testing for syphilis; antibodies to Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) IgG and IgM, cryptococcus, rickettsia, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); antigens of cytomegalovirus (CMV); and tests for nucleic acid of CMV and HIV were negative. Testing of a scraping of a lesion for antigens of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and VZV was negative, and specimens were sent for cultures of HSV, VZV, and enterovirus. Cultures of the lesion and specimens of blood were sterile. Cultures of the throat grew Arcanobacterium haemolyticum and were negative for group A β-hemolytic streptococcus, Neisseria gon-orrhoeae, and fungi. Other test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,34,nejm-case-2019-34,A 16-Year-Old Boy with Jaundice,"Dr. Akash Gupta (Pediatrics): A 16-year-old boy was admitted to this hospital in autumn because of jaundice and abnormal results on liver-function tests. The patient had been well until 4 days before admission, when he noted pruri-tus around his ankles. That night, malaise and mild, intermittent, cramping pain in the right upper quadrant developed. The next day, the patient felt fatigued, his appetite was reduced, and the pruritus became diffuse. Two days before admission, he spent much of the day lying on the couch because of fatigue and malaise; he also reported that food tasted “funny,” that his urine appeared darker than usual, and that his mother had told him he appeared pale. The day before admission, the patient continued to feel unwell but went to school, where he was told by a teacher that his skin appeared yellow, which prompted him to present to the school nurse. After a discussion with the patient’s mother and pediatrician, the patient was referred to the emergency department at another hospital for evaluation. At the other hospital, the patient reported that his stool had appeared pale gray that day. On examination, the temperature was 36.7°C, the pulse 102 beats per minute, the blood pressure 139/82 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient did not appear ill but had conjunctival icterus and jaundiced skin. There was no abdominal tenderness, and the remainder of the physical examination was normal. The red-cell indexes and blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, amylase, and lipase were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed clear, amber urine, with a moderate amount of bilirubin, trace albumin, a specific gravity of 1.018, and a pH of 5.5 by dipstick testing. A blood test for heterophile antibodies was negative, as were blood tests for hepatitis A virus IgM antibodies, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, hepatitis B virus core IgM antibodies, and hepatitis C virus anti-bodies. After discussion with a pediatric gastro-enterologist, the patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital. On arrival, the patient rated his abdominal pain at 6 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He had undergone tonsillectomy in the remote past. He had never received a blood transfusion. He took no medications or herbal or dietary supplements and had no known allergies; immunizations were reportedly up to date. The patient lived with his parents and two dogs in a heavily forested, rural area of New England and had not traveled recently. Five days before the onset of illness, he had eaten at a fast-food restaurant. He had had no known exposure to sick persons, was not sexually active, and did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. One year earlier, the patient’s mother had undergone a medical evaluation because of fatigue and jaundice and had been found to have abnormally elevated results of liver-function tests; no specific diagnosis was made, and the illness resolved spontaneously. His maternal grandfather had a history of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and brain cancer. A maternal second cousin had systemic lupus erythematosus. On examination, the patient appeared jaundiced but not ill. The temperature was 36.8°C, the pulse 80 beats per minute, the blood pressure 134/59 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 76.5 kg. There was mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant; evaluation for hepa-tomegaly and splenomegaly was limited because the patient was ticklish. The remainder of the physical examination was unchanged. The red-cell indexes, activated partial-thromboplastin time, anion gap, and blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, lipase, and acetaminophen were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed clear, amber urine, with 1+ bilirubin, 1+ urobilinogen, a specific gravity of 1.010, and a pH of 6.0 by dipstick testing. Blood was tested for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA, as well as for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) antibodies, cytomegalovirus antibodies, Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies, antinuclear antibodies, antimitochondrial antibodies, anti– smooth muscle antibodies, and anti–liver–kidney microsomal type 1 antibodies. Dr. Aoife Kilcoyne: Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed mild, diffuse heterogeneous echotexture of the liver. No intrahepatic or ex-trahepatic biliary ductal dilatation was noted. The gallbladder was contracted, with no peri-cholecystic fluid. There was no ascites. The spleen was enlarged, measuring up to 16.2 cm in the craniocaudal dimension (normal length, <13 cm)1 (Fig. 1). No focal splenic lesions were observed. Doppler evaluation of the upper abdominal vasculature was normal. Dr. Gupta: While the patient was in the emergency department, the abdominal pain decreased. Intravenous fluids were administered, and, early the next morning, the patient was admitted to the hospital. On admission, the patient reported mild, diffuse pruritus, which was most prominent on the upper back, and mild, diffuse abdominal pain. There was no pharyngeal erythema or exudate and no cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy; the remainder of the physical examination was unchanged. The pa-tient received treatment with oral ursodiol and vitamin E and intramuscular vitamin K. Additional diagnostic tests were performed, and a diagnosis was made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2018,19,nejm-case-2018-19,A 15-Year-Old Girl with Acute Kidney Injury,"Dr. Helen I. Healy (Pediatrics): A 15-year-old girl was admitted to this hospital during the summer because of acute kidney injury. The patient had been well until 8 days before admission, when painful cramping in the lower abdomen and bloody diarrhea developed. Bowel movements occurred approximately every hour, and the patient was unable to sleep. She took ibuprofen but had no relief of the abdominal pain. On the third day of illness, two episodes of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis occurred. The following day, the patient was seen by her primary care pediatrician. She reported that she felt fatigued and that the diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and vomiting had persisted; she had not had a fever. The results of a physical examination were normal. Stool samples were obtained for cultures for salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, and Escherichia coli O157:H7, and antigen-detection tests were performed for rotavirus, giardia, and Clostridium difficile toxin. The patient was advised to stop taking ibuprofen, to take loperamide and acetaminophen as needed, and to drink an electrolyte-containing oral rehydration solution. During the next 3 days, the diarrhea resolved, but the patient continued to vomit several times each day and the abdominal cramping became localized to the epi-gastrium. The stool cultures and antigen-detection tests were negative. Her mother called the pediatrician’s office on the seventh day of illness, and ondansetron was prescribed. The following morning, the patient returned to the pediatrician’s office because of persistent painful cramping in the epigastrium. On examination, she appeared mildly ill and slightly pale. The temperature was 36.5°C, and the pulse 98 beats per minute. The abdomen was soft, with normal bowel sounds and mild, diffuse tenderness and with no distention, masses, or guarding. The remainder of the examination was normal. Ranitidine and a probiotic were recommended. Two hours after this appointment, the patient’s mother called the office to report that the patient had vomited again; she was advised to take the patient to the emergency department at a local hospital for further evaluation and treatment. In the emergency department at the other hospital, the patient reported that the volume of urine output had decreased. On examination, she appeared slightly pale. The temperature was 36.9°C, the pulse 80 beats per minute, the blood pressure 111/69 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies of the abdomen were performed. Dr. Pallavi Sagar: An abdominal radiograph was normal. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a large amount of layering sludge in the gallbladder, with no thickening of the gallbladder wall (Fig. 1A). Both kidneys were normal in size (length of the right kidney, 11.5 cm; length of the left kidney, 10.6 cm), with mildly echogenic renal parenchyma (Fig. 1B and 1C). The urinary tract was not dilated, and the bladder was partially distended. A moderate amount of ascites was present in the lower abdomen, and a trace amount was present in Morison’s pouch (Fig. 1D). Dr. Healy: Two liters of normal saline were administered intravenously; afterward, the patient did not have any urine output. After consultation with a pediatric nephrologist, the patient was transferred to the emergency department at this hospital. On arrival, the patient rated her abdominal pain at 3 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. She reported that, during the past week, her weight had decreased by 3 kg and then increased by 1 kg. She had a history of attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and labial adhesions. During the previous 7 months, she had been seen by her pediatrician on three occasions because of intermittent dys-uria; tests for urinary tract infection, chlamydia, and gonorrhea had been negative. Medications included citalopram and methylphenidate; she had an allergy to azithromycin, which had caused a rash. The patient lived with her parents and siblings in New England. Just before the onset of the current illness, she had spent several days in New York City, where she had eaten food purchased from street vendors. She had had no known exposure to sick persons, was not sexually active, and did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her maternal grandfather had the antiphospholipid syndrome, her paternal grandmother had hypothyroidism, and her mother had had gestational hypertension; there was no known family history of kidney disease or inflammatory bowel disease. On examination, the patient appeared tired but otherwise well. The temperature was 36.9°C, the pulse 71 beats per minute, the blood pressure 124/75 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft, with normal bowel sounds and mild tenderness of the upper abdomen and with no distention, masses, or hepatosplenomegaly. There was no pedal or pretibial edema, and the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram was normal. After the intravenous administration of 1 liter of normal saline, the patient voided only 2 ml of urine. Urinalysis revealed turbid, amber urine, with 2+ blood, 3+ albumin, 3+ leukocyte esterase, a specific gravity of 1.012, and a pH of 5.0 by dipstick; microscopic examination of the sediment revealed transitional cells, squamous cells, amorphous crystals, mucin, bacteria, and white-cell clumps, as well as 20 to 50 red cells per high-power field and more than 100 white cells per high-power field. A urine pregnancy test was negative. Ultrasonography of the bladder, performed at the bedside, revealed that the bladder was collapsed. Ondansetron was administered intravenously. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and a diagnosis was made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2023,37,nejm-case-2023-37,A 29-Year-Old Man with Sickle Cell Disease and Right Hip Pain,"CME at NEJM.org Dr. Ya Haddy Sallah (Medicine): A 29-year-old man with sickle cell disease was admitted to this hospital because of pain in the right hip. The patient had received a diagnosis of sickle cell disease in childhood. The sickle cell disease had been complicated by vaso-occlusive events with pain severe enough to lead to hospitalization 3 or 4 times per year. He also had a history of osteonecrosis of the hips that had led to treatment with total hip arthroplasty of both hips 3 years before the current presentation. Seven days before the current presentation, the patient presented to this hospital with pain in the low back, hips, and legs, which had developed 1 day after he had carried boxes up several flights of stairs. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. He was admitted to the hospital, and imaging studies were obtained. Dr. F. Joseph Simeone: Posteroanterior and lateral radiographs of the chest (Fig. 1A) showed normal lungs and a normal cardiac silhouette; superior and inferior end-plate depressions in midthoracic vertebral bodies were noted. Frontal and lateral radiographs of the lumbar spine (Fig. 1B) showed superior and inferior end-plate depressions at multiple vertebral levels and diffuse bony sclerosis, findings consistent with bony changes from sickle cell disease. An anteroposterior radiograph of the pelvis (Fig. 1C) showed evidence of total hip arthroplasty; the findings had not changed from those observed on recently obtained radiographs. Dr. Sallah: A diagnosis of a painful vaso-occlusive event was made, and treatment included intravenous fluids, ketorolac, and hydromorphone. Musculoskeletal strain was considered to be a contributing factor for the pain, given the recent strenuous activity. The pain slowly abated, and on hospital day 5, the patient was discharged home. One day after discharge, and 2 days before the current presentation, pain in the right hip developed while the patient was at rest. Despite treatment with ibuprofen and acetaminophen, the hip pain worsened, and the patient was unable to walk. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported pain in the right hip that felt different in quality from the pain associated with previous vaso-occlusive events. He also reported pleuritic chest pain that felt similar in quality to the pain associated with previous vaso-occlusive events. The tympanic temperature measured at home was 37.8°C. During the 6 months before the current presentation, vaso-occlusive events had increased in frequency and severity. There had been three hospital admissions with a duration of 4 to 8 days, including one admission for acute chest syndrome. The pain associated with vaso-occlusive events typically involved the chest, arms, or thighs. There was a history of automated red-cell exchange, which had been performed before total hip arthroplasty; there was also a history of four blood transfusions. Other history included tinnitus, symmetric high-frequency sensorineu-ral hearing loss in both ears, and cholelithiasis. Medications included voxelotor and folic acid, as well as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and hydro-morphone as needed for pain. The patient had no known allergies. He lived in a suburb of Boston and worked as an engineer. He had traveled to West Africa 1 year before the current presentation and to South Asia 3 weeks before the current presentation. He drank alcohol occasionally, had never smoked tobacco, and did not use illicit drugs. Both of his parents and his brother had sickle cell trait. The temporal temperature was 35.7°C, the blood pressure 121/56 mm Hg, the pulse 67 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.6. He had mild tenderness on palpation of the right hip but no obvious deformity; there was a well-healed incision without overlying erythema. He was able to fully extend and flex the right hip, but such movement caused mild discomfort. There was moderate discomfort with the log-roll test (rolling the thigh internally and externally with the patient in the supine position). The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The white-cell count was 15,680 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), the hemoglobin level 7.5 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5), and the platelet count 581,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). The blood C-reactive protein level was 100.6 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 113 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 14). Nucleic acid amplification testing for influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was negative. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Simeone: Findings on radiographs of the chest, hips, and pelvis were unchanged from those observed 7 days earlier. A diagnostic test was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2011,03,nejm-case-2011-03,A 58-Year-Old Woman with a Mass in the Liver,"Dr. Serguei Melnitchouk (Surgery): A 58-year-old woman was seen in the multidisciplinary gastrointestinal oncology clinic of this hospital because of a mass in the liver. The patient had been well until 2 weeks earlier, when severe, sharp pain developed suddenly in the right upper quadrant. The pain did not radiate, and there was no nausea, vomiting, or food intolerance. During the day, the pain (which she rated at up to 7 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain) was intermittent and increased with moving or coughing. That evening, she went to the emergency department of her local hospital and was admitted. Ultrasonogra-phy of the abdomen showed a mass, 11 cm in diameter, in the right lobe of the liver. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, with the administration of contrast material, revealed subsegmental (discoid) atelectasis in the apical and posterior basal segments of the lower lobe of the right lung. CT of the abdomen revealed an area of hypodensity, 7.8 cm by 5.3 cm by 11 cm, in the right hepatic lobe, abutting the gallbladder. The lesion showed slight heterogeneous enhancement, less than that of the surrounding liver; no neovascularity during the arterial phase; and no discrete central scar. There was a hypodense lesion (4 mm in diameter) in the lateral aspect of the right kidney and a small hiatal hernia. Cytologic examination of a specimen from a fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the liver mass revealed small, malignant cells that expressed pancytokeratin and synaptophysin and had focal positivity for cytokeratin 7 and no expression of chromogranin, cytokeratin 20, or thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1). The findings were thought to be consistent with small-cell carcinoma but did not indicate a site of origin. The patient was discharged home on the fourth day, with pain medications. Two weeks later, the patient was seen at this hospital. She reported pain (rated at 2 out of 10) in her right upper abdomen and back, with no weight loss, night sweats, or change of appetite, and a persistent cough that she had had for years that was unchanged. She had diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, glaucoma, arthritis, scoliosis, irritable bowel symptoms, and multiple episodes of bronchitis and pneumonia; previous operations included a tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, sinus surgery, and a hysterectomy for a prolapsed uterus. Medica-tions included lisinopril and timolol, and loraz-epam and oxycodone as needed for pain. She was allergic to sulfa drugs, penicillin, and cephalo-sporins. She was divorced, lived with relatives, and worked in an office. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had Alzheimer’s disease, her father had died of colon cancer and end-stage renal disease, and a sister had had bilateral breast cancer in her 40s. On examination, the blood pressure was 190/97 mm Hg, and the other vital signs were normal. The abdomen was soft and slightly tender in the right upper quadrant at the liver edge; there was no hepatomegaly, splenomegaly or abdominal distention. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver with the administration of gadolinium revealed a lesion in the right lobe, 9.4 cm by 12.3 cm by 8.5 cm, with heterogeneous enhancement. Another lesion, 5 mm in diameter, in segment seven was consistent with a possible metastasis, and multiple small lesions in the right lobe were thought to be hemangiomata. The plasma cortisol level was 23.5 μg per deciliter (648 nmol per liter) (reference range, 5 to 15 μg per deciliter [138 to 414 nmol per liter], from noon to 8 p.m.) and the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide was 32 pg per milliliter (reference range, <75). Single-photon-emission CT (SPECT), performed 1 day after the administration of 237 MBq of indium-111–labeled pentetreotide, revealed a large region of decreased pentetreotide uptake in the right hepatic lobe that corresponded to the mass seen on the previous MRI; no other areas of abnormal activity were visualized in the liver or spine. Additional diagnostic tests were performed, and a management decision was made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2020,27,nejm-case-2020-27,A 53-Year-Old Woman with Headache and Gait Imbalance,"Dr. Jacob M. Rosenberg: A 53-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of progressive headache, gait instability, and weight loss. Approximately 2 months before the patient’s evaluation at this hospital, vertigo developed and resolved spontaneously. One day before evaluation at this hospital, she sought care at another hospital for recurrent dizziness and difficulty walking. The temperature was 36.4°C, the pulse 86 beats per minute, the blood pressure 170/105 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was breathing ambient air. The patient was alert and oriented, with slow speech, bilateral end-point horizontal nystagmus, and mild dysmetria on the right side on finger–nose–finger testing. Strength and sensory function were normal. She had difficulty maintaining a stable stance; her gait was narrow-based and described as “slow and cautious.” The remainder of the examination was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed an area of ill-defined hypoattenuation that was consistent with vasogenic edema in the right cerebellar hemisphere, as well as regions of white-matter hypoattenuation in both cerebellar hemispheres. Aspirin and atorvastatin were administered. Dr. R. Gilberto Gonzalez: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Fig. 1), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed an enhancing intraaxial lesion, measuring 2.0 cm by 1.8 cm by 1.7 cm, in the right inferior cerebellar hemisphere. The lesion had internal signal hypo-intensity that was indicative of necrosis on T1-weighted imaging, as well as surrounding signal hyperintensity that was suggestive of vasogenic edema on T2weighted imaging. There was local mass effect with effacement of the overlying cerebellar fissures and the fourth ventricle. There was also an enhancing lepto-meningeal lesion, measuring 4 mm in diameter, along the left medial frontal lobe in the left superior frontal gyrus, with possible leptomenin-geal extension. The lesion was characterized by internal and surrounding signal hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging. Dr. Rosenberg: Intravenous dexamethasone, am-lodipine, and labetalol were administered. The patient was transferred to this hospital for specialized neurosurgical consultation. On evaluation at this hospital, review of systems was notable for malaise and lethargy, as well as unintentional weight loss of 15 kg during the past year. The patient also reported an increase in urinary frequency without hematuria, dysuria, or flank pain. She had no fever, chills, sinus pain, dyspnea, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. She had a history of hypertension and hemorrhagic stroke, which had led to a craniotomy on the right side for evacuation of a “blood clot” 13 years before the current evaluation, with no reported neurologic deficits. The patient reported that, during the admission for craniotomy, she was told that she had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and was treated with an unknown antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen; she could not recall the medications included in the regimen. In addition, she reported that, several years later, further testing revealed that an error had been made and she did not have HIV infection. She reported that ART medications were discontinued at least 3 years before the current evaluation. The patient did not have a history of opportunistic infections or cancer. Three years earlier, a Mantoux tuberculin skin test had been negative. One week earlier, a mammogram had been normal. She had never undergone a colonoscopy or a Papanicolaou test. The patient was born in Ivory Coast, West Africa, and had been living in the United States for more than 20 years. She reported no recent travel. She lived with her children and did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She was divorced and not sexually active; in her lifetime, she had had one male sexual partner. Her ex-husband and one of her children reportedly had tested negative for HIV. Her father had had a myocardial infarction in his 60s; her mother and sisters were healthy. The patient had not been taking any medications at home before this illness and had no known allergies to medications. On physical examination, the temperature was 36.9°C, the blood pressure 165/99 mm Hg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 22.5. The patient was comfortable, alert, and oriented. Her speech was clear, with intact naming and repetition. Her pupils were equal and reactive to light, extraocular movements were intact, and visual fields were full in response to confrontation. She had mild right esotropia and no nystagmus. Her face was symmetric, but there was mild deviation of the tongue to the left. Results of other cranial-nerve testing were normal. Finger–nose–finger testing revealed subtle dysmetria that was greater on the right side than on the left side; there was no dysdiadochokinesia or intention tremor. Her stance was approximately shoulder-width. Her balance was impaired, and her gait was unsteady and ataxic. Psychomotor slowing was present, and the Romberg sign was absent. An evaluation of power, bulk, tone, sensation, and deep-tendon reflexes was normal. She had alopecia and oral thrush. The remainder of the examination was normal. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Results of tests of renal, liver, and thyroid function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, vitamin B12, and glycated hemoglobin. An HIV screening test for the detection of antibodies to HIV type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV type 2 (HIV-2) and HIV-1 p24 antigen was reactive. Plasma HIV-1 RNA was not detected. The CD4+ T-cell count was 39 per microliter (reference range, 348 to 1456). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A urine sample was obtained for culture. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a mildly enlarged and multi-nodular left thyroid gland, as well as scattered pulmonary nodules measuring less than 4 mm in diameter. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a hypoattenuating hepatic lesion measuring 1.1 cm in the greatest dimension that was consistent with hemangio-ma, as well as diffuse lytic osseous lesions in the thoracolumbar spine and pelvis. Diagnostic tests were performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,13,nejm-case-2012-13,"A 62-Year-Old Man with Paresthesias, Weight Loss, Jaundice, and Anemia","Dr. Norifumi Kamo (Medicine): A 62-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of paresthesias, weight loss, jaundice, and anemia. The patient had been well until approximately 2 months before admission, when numbness, tingling (“pins and needles”), and burning in his hands developed; the symptoms intermittently radiated proximally to the mid-forearm and gradually progressed to an estimated 40% of his normal sensation. Pain, stiffness, and weakness of the hands occurred; he noted decreased dexterity of his hands, without swelling, and he began to drop objects. He took ibuprofen, with minimal symptomatic improvement. His appetite decreased, and an unintentional weight loss of more than 6.5 kg occurred. Approximately 6 weeks before admission, the patient’s family noted that his eyes and skin (most noticeably his palms) gradually became pale and yellowed. Two weeks before admission, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, and weakness with exertion developed, and episodes of abdominal pain occurred in the lower quadrants. Stiffness in his axillae developed, and it migrated to his shoulders and abdomen. One week before admission, his wife noted a change in his gait, and he appeared unsteady. He was unable to climb four stairs without resting and was unsteady on standing, with resolution after ambulating. Two nights before admission, dyspnea, weakness, and diaphoresis developed. During the day, pressure radiated up his arms; this was associated with diffuse abdominal pain that intermittently radiated to the axillae, and dark urine developed. On the day of admission, he rated the pain in his joints at 7 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. At that time, he came to the emergency department at this hospital. The patient reported increased respiratory secretions, with a cough of 2 weeks’ duration that was productive of white or yellow sputum, without hemoptysis, fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, hematochezia, melena, diarrhea, other changes in bowel function, or symptoms in his legs or feet. He had hypertension and benign prostatic hypertrophy. The patient had been well on routine examination 4 months before admission. Medications included lisinopril (daily) and ibuprofen and acetaminophen as needed for discomfort; he had no known allergies. He lived with his wife and was retired, after working in the food industry and in manufacturing, and he was previously very physically active. He ate chicken, fish, and vegetables regularly and ate red meat rarely. He stopped smoking (after 40 pack-years) and drinking alcohol 26 years before admission, and he had not used illicit drugs. Four years before admission, he had visited his family in Greece. He also had gone fishing and deer hunting in New England. His father was well, and his mother was bedridden; both were in their 90s. A sister had died of breast cancer, and two brothers had died of lung cancer; his children were healthy. On examination, the patient appeared pale. The temperature was 37.5°C, the blood pressure 136/63 mm Hg, the pulse 113 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. The tongue was swollen and smooth, the conjunctivae were pale and icteric, and the palate, subglossal mucosa, and skin were jaundiced. The abdomen was soft, with mild-to-moderate tenderness in the epigastrium, without rebound, guarding, organomegaly, or masses. On neurologic examination, there was pronator drift bilaterally. Sensation to light touch was decreased by approximately 80% in the hands and feet; sensation to vibration and temperature was decreased in both legs in a “stocking” pattern and was normal in both arms. A Romberg test was positive, with swaying and falling when the patient’s eyes were closed; toe, heel, and heel-to-toe gaits were normal. Muscle strength, reflexes, and the remainder of the examination were normal. The blood level of potassium was 3.2 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.4 to 4.8) and globulin 2.1 g per deciliter (reference range, 2.3 to 4.1). Blood levels of the other electrolytes, glucose, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransfer-ase, amylase, lipase, total protein, and albumin were normal, as were tests of renal function; tests for creatine kinase isoenzymes and troponin I were negative, and other test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram was normal. A chest radiograph showed degenerative changes of the thoracic spine and was otherwise normal. A stool specimen was negative for occult blood. One liter of crystalloid solution was administered intravenously, with improvement in the tachycar-dia. Three hours after presentation, the patient was admitted to this hospital; 2 units of red cells were transfused. Diagnostic test results were received.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2011,15,nejm-case-2011-15,"A 19-Year-Old South African Woman with Headache, Fatigue, and Vaginal Discharge","Dr. Fundisiwe Chonco (Department of Virology, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa): A 19-year-old woman was seen in a clinic at McCord Hospital in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa (which is affiliated with Massachusetts General Hospital), because of headache, fatigue, and vaginal discharge. The patient had been well until approximately 18 days earlier, when she began to have a vaginal discharge, followed by headache, fatigue, sore throat, and anorexia. On the fifth day of symptoms, she went to an outpatient clinic in an urban area. On examination, she had a vaginal discharge; the temperature and the remainder of the examination were reportedly normal. Two different rapid screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) performed on a finger-stick blood sample were negative. Doxycycline, metronidazole, and ceftriaxone were administered according to South African guidelines for sexually transmitted diseases. The patient was invited to participate in a South African clinical research study; she accepted, and additional blood specimens were obtained. She was referred to the study clinic at McCord Hospital for follow-up, where she was seen 13 days later. The patient reported persistent headache, fatigue, sore throat, and vaginal discharge. She was nulliparous and had a history of developmental delay after an accident during childhood; she was otherwise well. She was on no medications and had no known allergies. She was born in South Africa, lived with relatives in a house in an urban area of KwaZulu-Natal Province, and attended school. She had no history of sexually transmitted diseases and reported having had sexual intercourse four times with her 25-year-old boyfriend of 6 months, who had been her only partner. He reportedly had refused her request to use condoms. On examination, the weight was 73 kg, the temperature 36.0°C, the blood pressure 93/59 mm Hg, and the pulse 82 beats per minute. There was a white, malodorous vaginal discharge; the remainder of the examination was normal except for findings consistent with the patient’s chronic developmental delay. Additional blood specimens were obtained, and both these and specimens from the first clinic were sent to a reference laboratory for testing. During the next 14 days, headache, fatigue, anorexia, sore throat, and vaginal discharge resolved, but a painful genital ulcer developed. The patient returned to the McCord Hospital clinic. She had no history of oral or genital ulcers and had not been sexually active since her visit to the first clinic. She was aware of HIV and that it is sexually transmitted. On examination, the vital signs were normal. There was a painful pink ulcer, 5 mm by 10 mm, on the left labium majus, with undermined borders and without surrounding induration. There were palpable lymph nodes, 1 cm or smaller in diameter, in the submental, posterior cervical, and epitrochlear regions. The remainder of the examination was normal. Penicillin G benzathine and erythromycin were administered according to South African guidelines for genital ulcers. A rapid plasma reagin test was negative. Diagnostic test results were reviewed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,38,nejm-case-2010-38,A 13-Year-Old Girl with an Enlarging Neck Mass,"Dr. Michelle L. Katz (Pediatrics): A 13-year-old girl was seen in the pediatric endocrinology clinic of this hospital because of an enlarging neck mass. Eight days earlier, the patient noted swelling of her neck and pain on swallowing. Two days later, her primary care provider noted that the patient had an enlarged thyroid gland. The level of serum thyrotropin was 5.59 µIU per milliliter (reference range, 0.28 to 3.89), free thyroxine 0.88 ng per deciliter (reference range, 0.58 to 1.64), and total triiodothyronine 159 ng per deciliter (reference range, 87 to 178). The anti–thyroid peroxidase antibody level was 244 IU per milliliter (reference range, <35), and the antithyroglobulin antibody level was greater than 3000 IU per milliliter (reference range, <40); complete blood count and electrolyte levels were normal. The patient was referred to the pediatric endocrinology unit at this hospital, where she was seen 5 days later. The patient reported tightness in her neck and occasional nausea but no difficulty breathing or swallowing. She did not have a sensation of feeling hot or cold; changes in weight, appetite, degree of thirst, energy level, hair, or skin; palpitations; diarrhea; constipation; abdominal pain; vomiting; urinary frequency; skin lesions; or musculoskeletal symptoms. The patient was born after a full-term gestation, without complications. Menarche occurred at 9 years of age, and her menstrual cycles had recently become regular, lasting about 5 days. Her most recent menses had begun 16 days earlier. She reported migraines approximately once a month and other headaches once or twice weekly that did not awaken her from sleep or occur in the early morning. She took over-the-counter analgesics as needed for headaches and had no known allergies. She lived with her parents and two younger siblings and did well in school. Her mother, maternal grandmother, maternal aunt, and cousin had hypothyroidism, and a thyroid nodule that had recently developed in her mother was being evaluated. On examination, the patient appeared well. The height was 162 cm (77th percentile for age), the weight 59.4 kg (88th percentile), and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 22.6 (86th percentile). The blood pressure was 126/66 mm Hg, and the pulse 79 beats per minute. There was no exophthalmos, and extraocular movements were normal. The thyroid was firm and possibly had an ill-defined mass on the left. The right lobe measured 4.5 cm and the left lobe 6.5 cm in greatest dimension; the left lobe was rotated laterally more than the right. There were no enlarged cervical lymph nodes. The patient was fully pubertal and the remainder of the physical and neuro-logic examination was normal. The administration of levothyroxine (50 µg daily) was begun, and ultrasonography of the thyroid gland was scheduled. Fifteen days after the patient’s initial evaluation, her mother called to report that the thyroid gland was increasing in size. The next day, ultra-sonography of the thyroid revealed a diffusely enlarged thyroid, with the left lobe (5.9 cm by 3.6 cm by 2.7 cm) larger than the right (5.1 cm by 2.1 cm by 1.9 cm). The parenchyma was heterogeneous. A predominantly cystic lesion in the right isthmus had a hyperechoic component and showed minimal Doppler flow. Multiple punctate, hyperechoic foci were present diffusely in the thyroid gland. Numerous lymph nodes lay on either side of the thyroid gland, lateral to both common carotid arteries and posterior to the left clavicular head. Lateral to the left common carotid artery, there was an enlarged lymph node (1.2 cm by 1.9 cm by 0.5 cm), with echotexture resembling that of the thyroid. Nine days later, on a repeat physical examination, the thyroid had increased in greatest dimension to 6 cm on the right and 7 cm on the left and was firm to palpation. Small cervical lymph nodes were palpable. The patient had pain during swallowing but reported no weight change, hoarseness, or difficulty breathing. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,05,nejm-case-2012-05,A 39-Year-Old Man with a Recent Diagnosis of HIV Infection and Acute Psychosis,"Dr. Carlos Fernandez-Robles: A 39-year-old man with a recent diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was transferred to this hospital from another hospital because of fever, sweats, and psychosis. The patient had been well until 4 months before admission, when fevers with temperatures up to 40.6°C, night sweats, and chills developed. During the next 3 months, anorexia, nonproductive cough, and unintentional weight loss (7 to 14 kg) occurred, associated with early satiety, epigastric burning that improved with eating, and abdominal pain that was intermittent, mild, and crampy. Two courses of antibiotics were reportedly administered, without improvement. Six days before admission, the patient was seen in the emergency department at the other hospital. The evaluation was reportedly negative; a skin test for tuberculosis was administered, and he was discharged. The next day, he saw his internist. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, after the administration of contrast material, revealed a thick-walled mass near the duodenum (7 cm by 2.2 cm, with air in its center), scattered lymph nodes near the porta hepatis, a thickened gallbladder wall, and mild splenomegaly (13.5 cm). The patient was admitted to the other hospital. On examination, the patient was alert, oriented, cooperative, and thin, with shaking chills. The temperature was 38.5°C, the blood pressure 135/76 mm Hg, the pulse 106 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while he was breathing ambient air. There was mild epigastric and right-upper-quadrant tenderness, with no induration at the site of the skin test for tuberculosis. The hematocrit was reportedly 31.9%, the white-cell count 4600 per cubic millimeter (with 75% neutrophils and 14% lymphocytes), the blood level of alkaline phosphatase 233 U per liter, and the level of aspartate aminotransferase 47 U per liter. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and intravenous pantoprazole were administered. During the next 2 days, the temperature rose to 39.4°C and the stools became black and tarry; the hematocrit was 28.3%. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen, after the administration of contrast material, revealed a thick-walled lesion that was contiguous with the posterome-dial wall of the duodenum, mild distention of the gallbladder, and a small amount of fluid adjacent to the gallbladder wall. A unit of red cells was transfused. On the fourth day, esophagogastro-duodenoscopy revealed a duodenal ulcer and gastritis. Testing for antibody to HIV was positive. During that night, the patient became agitated, reporting a nightmare in which he was dying. On the fifth day, he appeared tense, speaking with his teeth and fists clenched and his eyes staring ahead; religious delusions developed. Psychiatric consultation was obtained, and olanzapine was prescribed. The patient was transferred to this hospital. The patient had had herpes zoster of the thoracic dermatome 4 years before admission and again 3 months before admission. He had no known allergies. He had immigrated to the United States from a Caribbean country more than a decade earlier. Testing for HIV and syphilis had reportedly been negative 11 years before admission. He had a history of alcohol abuse and did not smoke or use intravenous drugs. He lived with his partner and her children. He had biologic children who lived in his native country. A bird and a turtle were in the home. His parents and siblings were healthy, with no family history of psychiatric illness. On admission, the patient was awake but initially unresponsive. The temperature was 37.6°C and the blood pressure 148/81 mm Hg; other vital signs and the remainder of the physical examination were normal. He became agitated and continued to have bizarre delusions. Olanzapine and haloperidol were administered. On psychiatric examination later that day, the agitation had resolved. He was not oriented to date and was found not to have the capacity to sign out against medical advice. Twenty-four-hour accompaniment was begun. Blood levels of platelets, bilirubin, amylase, lipase, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, vitamin B12, folic acid, thyrotropin, and ammonia were normal, as were the results of tests of renal function and urinalysis; tests for toxic drugs and hepatitis B and C viruses were negative. Other test results are shown in Table 1. On formal psychiatric examination on the second day, the patient had disorganized and guarded behavior, flat affect, thought blocking, and bizarre nihilistic delusions, including statements that he had died and was dead. Although the cog-nitive examination was limited in scope because of the patient’s lack of cooperation, it revealed deficits in attention (inability to name months of the year backward), anterograde memory (inability to orally recall three objects), and the performance of visuospatial tasks (Fig. 1) in the absence of fluctuations in the level of consciousness. On the third day, the patient appeared lucid and somber and had appropriate speech content. The maximum temperature was 40.3°C. There were white plaques on the tongue, scars from zos-ter on the right thorax, and small, rubbery lymph-adenopathy in the left axilla. Blood tests for IgG antibodies to toxoplasma and cytomegalovirus (CMV) was positive, and testing for syphilis, CMV antigen, strongyloides antibody, cryptococcal antigen, and urine histoplasma antigen was negative. The aspartate aminotransferase level increased to 155 U per liter. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were stopped, and nystatin was begun orally. Respiratory-isolation measures were instituted. A portable chest radiograph was normal; CT of the abdomen and pelvis obtained after the administration of contrast material showed upper abdominal, retroperitoneal, and pelvic lymphade-nopathy; splenomegaly; a duodenal diverticulum; and gallbladder-wall thickening. During the next 9 days, psychiatric symptoms persisted. Fevers occurred daily, with temperatures up to 40.1°C, and extrapyramidal side effects developed. CT of the brain showed no clinically significant abnormality. CT of the chest without contrast material revealed a few nonspecific nodules and multiple supraclavicular, mediastinal, and upper abdominal lymph nodes, up to 12 mm in diameter. MRI scans of the brain obtained before and after the administration of contrast material showed multiple punctate foci of enhancement, up to 4 mm in diameter, in the right and left cerebral hemispheres, with mild surrounding hyper-intensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. The distribution of the lesions was predominantly intraaxial and involved white matter and the junction of the gray and white matter, although one lesion appeared extraaxial and another lesion appeared to involve cortical gray matter. The results of portable electroencephalography were normal, with overlying beta activity and no evidence of epileptiform activity. Three induced-sputum specimens showed hyphae on fungal wet preparation and were negative for acid-fast bacilli. Cultures of sputum grew Candida albicans and normal respiratory flora. Cultures of sputum, urine, and blood for mycobacteria and fungi remained negative. Lumbar puncture was performed, and analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was normal. The HIV RNA level was 3010 copies per milliliter of CSF, with no malignant cells on cytologic examination. On the ninth day, fine-needle aspiration of the peripancreatic lymph node showed no malignant cells, and flow cytometry revealed T lymphocytes with an inverted ratio of CD4 T cells to CD8 T cells and no monoclonal B cells. Ophthalmologic examination showed retinal lesions, including superficial whitening and fluffy white infiltrate, findings consistent with retinopathy from CMV or HIV. Transthoracic echocardiography was normal. Haloperidol was stopped, and olanzapine and lorazepam were administered as needed for agitation. Treatment with antiretroviral medications (emtricitabine, tenofovir, atazanavir, and ritonavir) and prophylactic trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole was begun. On the 12th day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,22,nejm-case-2019-22,"A 65-Year-Old Woman with Weakness, Dark Urine, and Dysphagia","Dr. Doll L. Golden (Medicine): A 65-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of falls, weakness, dark urine, and difficulty swallowing. Approximately 35 years before the current admission, the patient underwent staged male-to-female sex reassignment surgery at another hospital, with orchiec-tomy, penectomy, and urethral fixation, followed by scrotoplasty and vaginal construction. Estrogen therapy was prescribed. Seventeen months before the current admission, a friend found the patient on the floor of her apartment, unable to speak or to move her face, arm, or leg on the left side. Emergency medical services took the patient to a second hospital, where computed tomographic (CT) angiography reportedly revealed changes consistent with ischemic stroke in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery. Six hours later, the patient was transferred to this hospital. Examination revealed aphasia and weakness of the face, arm, and leg on the left side. Dr. Ajay K. Singh: CT angiography performed at the second hospital had shown a lack of opacification of the right middle cerebral artery. On the same day, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and magnetic resonance angiography performed at this hospital (Fig. 1A) confirmed the presence of acute ischemic stroke in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery. There was occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery, which had caused acute infarction of the right supramarginal gyrus, angular gyrus, insula, corona radiata, and putamen, with small hemorrhages in the corona radiata and putamen. Diffusion-weighted MRI (Fig. 1B) revealed restricted diffusion in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery. Dr. Golden: Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 32% and dilatation of the left atrium and left ventricle, without intra-cardiac thrombus, valvular disease, or intracardiac shunting. Cardiac MRI revealed late gadolinium enhancement in a linear pattern in the subepicardial and midwall areas, spanning multiple coronary distributions, a finding that is most consistent with previous myocarditis. A cardioembolic mechanism of stroke was suspected; estrogen therapy was stopped, and aspirin, atorvastatin, and furosemide were started. Six weeks later, residual weakness of the left bicep and hip flexor persisted; warfarin was started. Six months before the current admission, the patient presented to this hospital with a fall and worsening of weakness on the left side, which followed 2 weeks of coryza, nonproductive cough, dyspnea on exertion, and edema of the legs. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Singh: Magnetic resonance angiography and CT angiography revealed changes consistent with chronic infarcts in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery but no acute infarction. Ultrasonography of the legs and CT performed with a pulmonary-embolism protocol after the administration of intravenous contrast material were negative for thrombus. Dr. Golden: Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 31%, and coronary angiography revealed normal coronary arteries. A device for cardiac resynchronization therapy was implanted. The dyspnea on exertion improved, but then 3 months before the current admission, insidious progressive generalized weakness and fatigue developed. The patient noted that basic daily activities, such as getting dressed, were “burdensome” and caused “exhaustion.” Two weeks before the current admission, she had difficulty swallowing a communion wafer at church, and later that night, she had difficulty swallowing solids and liquids. Dysphagia persisted; she ate soft foods such as bread and peanut butter and would cough after sipping liquids. Weakness increased, and she had muscle pains; she had difficulty hanging up coats, standing up from a seated position (which led her to use her arms to pull herself up), putting on shoes and socks, and lifting her leg to get into a car. One week before the current admission, she had a mechanical fall in which her legs felt weak and “gave out.” She fell onto her left side and was on the ground for approximately 15 minutes. She was evaluated by emergency medical services but was not taken to the hospital. Four days later, she noted darkening of her urine, and a friend thought she had a transient episode of slurred speech. After friends noticed other episodes of slurred speech and the patient had further progression of weakness, she was brought to the emergency department of this hospital. A review of systems revealed urinary urgency, bowel movements with soft stool every 2 to 3 days, and chronic mild pruritus on the back. The patient reported that she had had early satiety and overall disinterest in food since the stroke, and she had lost 24 kg. She reported no fevers, chills, night sweats, vision changes, diplopia, difficulty hearing, ataxia, numbness, headache, dyspnea, wheezing, orthopnea, odynophagia, dysuria, nausea, vomiting, new rash, or bruising. The patient’s medical history included hypertension, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, glaucoma, ileus (which had led to sigmoidoscopy and intestinal decompression), colonic polyps (which had led to polypectomy), and degenerative disease of the cervical spine. Medications included aspirin, apixaban, atorvastatin, furosemide, hydralazine, isosorbide dinitrate, metoprolol succinate, spirono-lactone, docusate, and omeprazole, as well as latanoprost and timolol eye drops. Angiotensin-converting–enzyme inhibitors had caused angio-edema, and heparin had caused immune throm-bocytopenia. The patient had not recently traveled outside New England; she lived alone and worked as an administrator. She walked with a cane at baseline. She did not use alcohol, tobacco, over-the-counter or herbal medications, or illicit substances. Her father had died of myocardial infarction at 79 years of age, her mother had hypertension and osteoarthritis that had led to a hip replacement, her brother had received a diagnosis of prostate cancer when he was in his 50s, and her sister had sarcoidosis. The patient appeared thin and had mild dysar-thria. The temperature was 37.4°C, the pulse 67 beats per minute, the blood pressure 98/54 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was protuberant but soft and nontender. Neurologic examination was notable for reduced strength in the upper arms, with 4/5 strength in the left deltoid, triceps, and biceps and 4+/5 strength in the same muscle groups on the right side. Grip strength was 4+/5 bilaterally. There was reduced strength in the legs, with 5−/5 hip flexion bilaterally and 5−/5 knee extension and flexion on the left side. Ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion were normal bilaterally. There was slight pronator drift on the left side. Reflexes were 1+ and symmetric throughout. The gait was wide-based and described as “cautious”; the Romberg sign was absent. There was 1+ edema of the lower legs, which was slightly greater on the left side than on the right side. Results of the remainder of the examination — including tests of cranial-nerve function, sensation to light touch and pinprick, and coordination and evaluations of the neck, chest, and abdomen — were normal and consistent with results obtained during previous gender-affirmation procedures. The white-cell, differential, and platelet counts and levels of hemoglobin, magnesium, globulin, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, thyrotropin, and antinuclear antibodies were normal, as were the results of urine and blood toxicology screenings. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Singh: CT of the head performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material (Fig. 1C and 1D) revealed no new infarction or hemorrhage. Ultrasonography of the lower legs was negative for thrombus. Dr. Golden: Intravenous normal saline was administered, and the patient was admitted to this hospital. Diagnostic tests were performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2009,22,nejm-case-2009-22,A 59-Year-Old Man with Skin and Pulmonary Lesions after Chemotherapy for Leukemia,"Dr. Deborah L. Cummins (Dermatology): A 59-year-old man was seen by consultants in infectious disease and dermatology because of cutaneous and pulmonary lesions that developed after induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia. A diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome had been made 13 months earlier at another hospital. Since that time, the patient had been hospitalized repeatedly elsewhere for pancytopenia and had received transfusions of red cells and platelets. (The results of laboratory tests obtained 12 weeks before admission to this hospital are shown in Table 1.) Six weeks before admission to this hospital, the patient received azacitidine subcutaneously, followed 15 days later by pegfilgrastim. Nine days before this admission, the patient presented to the outpatient cancer center of this hospital with chills and fever of 2 to 3 days’ duration. The temperature was 38.9°C; the remainder of the examination was normal. He was admitted to this hospital. Electrolyte levels and tests of renal function were normal; the results of other laboratory tests obtained on this admission are shown in Table 1. Analysis of the urine revealed 1+ albumin. Specimens of blood and urine were obtained for culture, and cefepime, vancomycin, and prednisone were administered. Filtered red cells (4 units) and platelets were transfused. Pathological examination of a biopsy specimen of the bone marrow disclosed the presence of acute myeloid leukemia. The blood cultures remained sterile. The patient was discharged on the fourth hospital day; his medications included levofloxacin, prednisone, and omeprazole daily. Six days later, he was readmitted to the hospital for induction chemotherapy. A diagnosis of hepatitis C virus infection had been made approximately 20 years earlier. A 48-week course of treatment with ribavirin and interferon had been initiated 27 months earlier. Ten weeks before admission, a plasma sample showed no detectable hepatitis C viral ribonucleic acid. The patient had been depressed, a condition thought to be related to interferon therapy. He was single and had worked in the construction industry before retirement. He had traveled to the Southwest 30 years earlier but had never traveled internationally. He smoked cigarettes for 30 years, had a history of alcohol abuse decades earlier but reported no recent use, and did not use illicit drugs. His father had died of a brain abscess at the age of 41 years, and his mother had died of congestive heart failure at the age of 75 years. On examination, the temperature was 36.5°C, the blood pressure 118/70 mm Hg, the pulse 77 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, with 98% oxygen saturation while the patient was breathing ambient air. Physical examination showed petechiae in the oropharynx, gingival bleeding, and several cutaneous ecchymoses; the remainder of the examination was normal. Tests of renal and liver function and levels of protein, albumin, and globulin were normal; the results of other laboratory tests obtained on the second hospital admission are shown in Table 1. A triple-lumen intravenous catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein, and a 3-day course of idarubicin and a 7-day continuous infusion of cytarabine were begun. Transfusions of filtered red cells and platelets were given as needed. White plaques developed on the tongue, which were consistent with thrush, and fluconazole was added to the regimen. On the seventh hospital day, neutropenia, nausea, and diarrhea developed, followed by abdominal pain and fever, with a temperature as high as 38.4°C. Specimens of blood and urine were obtained for culture and remained sterile. The stool was negative for ova, parasites, bacterial pathogens, and Clostridium difficile toxin. Treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, and met-ronidazole was begun intravenously. On the 10th day, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed evidence of acute appendicitis. Total parenteral nutrition was begun. CT of the pelvis performed 2 days later showed thickening of the sigmoid and descending colon, which was consistent with colitis; an unchanged appearance of the appendix, with no evidence of perforation; and multiple prominent retroperitoneal lymph nodes, up to 1.1 cm in diameter. The abdominal pain gradually resolved, and oral intake was resumed 1 week later. A red, raised rash developed on the upper arms and groin, and nystatin powder was administered. On the 15th hospital day, a biopsy specimen of bone marrow revealed residual leukemia. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. The next day, petechiae were noted on the shins and knees. On the 17th day, a second course of chemotherapy with cytarabine and idarubicin was begun. During the next week, nonpruritic, red, raised lesions developed on the chest and arms. The patient reported severe pain (rated 10 on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most severe) in both heels; the heels were erythematous and were tender on palpation. Heel protectors were provided. Blood cultures remained sterile. Treatment with vancomy-cin and fluconazole was continued; levofloxacin, cefepime, and metronidazole were withdrawn, and famciclovir and meropenem were added. On the 27th day, a hemorrhagic blister developed on the left heel. Diarrhea recurred; a test for C. difficile toxin was negative, and treatment with metroni-dazole was resumed. On the 29th day, the temperature rose to 38.4°C. Pathological examination of a biopsy specimen of the bone marrow showed hypocellular marrow with no evidence of leukemia. Treatment with filgrastim was begun. On the 31st day, the temperature rose to 38.6°C. CT of the chest showed bilateral pulmonary nodules, 2 to 4 mm in diameter. CT of the abdomen showed resolution of both the appendiceal changes and the colonic-wall thickening. On examination, the blood pressure was 110/60 mm Hg, the pulse 112 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Crackles were heard in both lung bases, and there was 3+ edema of the legs. Numerous erythema-tous, firm cutaneous nodules, 1 to 4 cm in diameter, were present on the abdomen, chest, head, upper arms, and legs. There were scattered pete-chiae on the legs and trunk. On the right foot, erythema of the fourth toe and a papule on the third metatarsal were noted; there was a necrotic plaque, 2 cm in diameter, on the left heel. There was no lymphadenopathy, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Specimens of blood and urine were cultured. Tests of serum for ga-lactomannan and 1,3-β-D-glucan were negative. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Metro-nidazole and fluconazole were discontinued, and amphotericin B and atovaquone were added. On the 32nd hospital day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2013,07,nejm-case-2013-07,A 77-Year-Old Woman with Long-Standing Unilateral Thoracic Pain and Incontinence,"A 77-year-old woman was seen in the outpatient neurology clinic at this hospital because of chronic thoracic pain. The patient had had constant pain under her left breast for as long as she could remember, probably since adolescence, which worsened over time and spread horizontally to involve a band on the entire left side of the chest. Multiple evaluations performed at other hospitals throughout her adult life had been unrevealing. Eight years before this evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine was reported as normal, with an incidental finding of small cysts associated with neural foramina on the right side. One thoracic injection and three lumbar epidural injections of local anesthetic agents and glucocorticoids administered 2 years before this evaluation had only transiently improved the pain. Four months after the injections, MRI reportedly revealed a lesion (10 mm in the greatest dimension) in the left T7–T8 neural foramen, causing mild expansion and remodeling of the foramen; these findings were consistent with a perineurial cyst. One month later, a second MRI of the thoracic spine, performed with contrast material, reportedly revealed bilateral T7–T8 neural foraminal cysts measuring up to 8 mm in the greatest dimension and smaller foraminal lesions, suspected to be bilateral, at T10–T11, T11–T12, T12–L1, and low cervical levels. A radiograph of the chest revealed slight aortic dilatation. Twenty months before evaluation at this hospital, computed tomography (CT) after the intrathecal administration of contrast material (CT myelography) performed at a second hospital reportedly revealed a perineurial cyst (10 mm by 8 mm) at the T7–T8 level on the left side that became filled with contrast material. Eight months before this evaluation, repeat MRI reportedly revealed a perineurial cystic lesion at the T7–T8 level on the left side, with 10 or more additional cysts between T2 and T10. Four months before this evaluation, the patient sought consultation at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. The patient rated the thoracic pain as ranging in severity from 4 to 9 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the worst pain. She reported that it improved when she was lying down and was not altered by coughing, straining, or palpation. It had not been relieved by physical therapy, chiropractic management, or medications, including gabapentin and transder-mal lidocaine. She also reported occasional left groin and sacral pain (the pain did not radiate and was associated with normal pudendal sensation), intermittent numbness in the left leg, bilateral foot pain, and episodic fecal and urinary incontinencethatrequiredprotectiveundergarments. She had severe bilateral hearing loss for which she wore hearing aids, mild hypoproliferative anemia, hypertension, hypothyroidism, hyper-cholesterolemia, gastritis, attention deficit–hyper-activity disorder, mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dysthymia, and severe fatigue. During childhood, she had had a prolonged illness with streptococcal pharyngitis. She had had three fractures of her arms after falling, repair of a rectal fistula, and additional minor surgical procedures. Medications included metoprolol, levothyroxine, lisinopril, omeprazole, dextroam-phetamine–amphetamine, desvenlafaxine, clonaz-epam, atorvastatin, aspirin, and multiple vitamins (including vitamin D and numerous daily doses of vitamin B complex), as well as acetaminophen for pain. She had no known allergies. The patient was a retired nurse practitioner who lived with her husband in Massachusetts. She had smoked cigarettes for decades and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her mother died at 75 years of age of multiple myeloma, her father at 81 years of age of congestive heart failure and dementia, and a brother of pulmonary fibrosis. Among her four children, a son had been born prematurely at 31 weeks of gestation, a daughter had colon cancer and iliac-artery dissection and required surgical mitral-valve repair at 49 years of age, another son had survived testicular cancer in youth, and another son had Asperger’s syndrome and mental retardation. A grandson was 206 cm tall and had a thyroid cyst. There was no family history of neurologic or pain conditions. On examination, the patient was alert and oriented. The height was 178 cm and the weight 67 kg. She had arachnodactyly and normal joint flexibility. She ambulated slowly without assistance and was unable to walk with a tandem gait. She had mild allodynia over the left thorax that was provoked by touch, and sensation on pin-prick testing was normal. Achilles’ tendon reflexes were not present; other reflexes were normal. The remainder of a detailed neurologic examination was normal. A diagnostic and therapeutic procedure was performed, after which the patient was referred to the neurology clinic at this hospital.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,17,nejm-case-2010-17,A 29-Year-Old Woman with Flexion of the Left Hand and Foot and Difficulty Speaking,"Dr. Nutan Sharma (Neurology): A 29-year-old right-handed woman was seen in the neurology clinic of this hospital because of involuntary flexion of the left hand and increasing difficulty moving the left foot. The patient had been well until 3 years earlier, when she noted that her left index finger was bent. During the subsequent 2.5 years, the fingers of the left hand began to flex, and the hand gradually curled into a tight fist. Approximately 1.5 years before this evaluation, she noted difficulty moving the left foot, and inversion at the ankle gradually developed. During the following year, flexion of her left elbow developed, and she was seen at another hospital, where brain imaging, an electroencephalogram, and electromyographic and nerve-conduction studies were reportedly normal. She was referred to the neurology clinic of this hospital. The patient reported weakness and flexion of the left hand and ankle. She had had normal growth and development. She had occasional migraine headaches (approximately every 2 to 3 months), without aura, for which she took ibuprofen. She was of African-Caribbean descent. She worked in education and did not smoke or drink alcohol. Her parents and daughter were well; there was no family history of neurologic illness. On examination, the patient appeared well. The muscle bulk of the left biceps was increased as compared with the right. The left fingers, wrist, and elbow were flexed, with rigidity that was worse with activation. The left arm occasionally extended at the elbow when her attention was directed elsewhere. Dorsiflexion, inversion and eversion of the left ankle, and muscle strength were normal. Deep-tendon reflexes were 3+ in the left biceps and the left patella and 2+ elsewhere. Plantar reflexes were neutral, neither extensor nor flexor. The left arm extended at the elbow during tandem gait; coordination was otherwise normal, with negative Romberg testing. The remainder of the neurologic examination was normal. During the next 4 months, additional testing was performed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine were unremarkable. A complete blood count was normal, as were levels of electrolytes, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, calcium, and ceruloplasmin and tests of liver and renal function. Antinuclear-antibody testing was negative. Nerve-conduction studies of both legs and needle electromyographic examination of the left leg and lumbosacral paraspinal muscles were normal. Two months after presentation, the administration of trihexyphenidyl (2 mg twice daily) was begun orally. When the patient’s supply of trihexyphenidyl was depleted after 3 months, she noted that her left wrist felt tighter; trihexyphenidyl was increased to 6 mg per day in divided doses. A 2-week trial of carbidopa–levodo-pa resulted in no improvement. Six months after her initial evaluation, the patient was seen in the movement disorders clinic of this hospital. She reported performing all activities of daily living, despite having limited use of the left hand. On examination, she appeared well nourished and well groomed. Cognition was normal. She was mildly clumsy during personal hygienic and dressing activities, ate independently with the aid of sensory tricks, and had no difficulty swallowing. There was occasional pulling of the neck and severe dystonia of the left arm, with no useful grasp. The left leg was mildly dys-tonic; she walked briskly and unaided, with a slight abnormality in gait. There were intermittent movements of her left arm at rest. MRI of the brain performed after the administration of gadolinium revealed slightly low-lying cerebellar tonsils but was otherwise normal. The dose of tri-hexyphenidyl was increased from 6 mg daily to 10 mg daily (in divided doses). During the next 9 months, she received physical therapy, splinting of the left hand and wrist, and injections of Clostridium botulinum toxin type A to the wrist, with some improvement. Fourteen months after the patient’s initial evaluation, the administration of trihexyphenidyl was stopped transiently when she ran out of the medication but was resumed 3 weeks later. Shortly thereafter, upper respiratory symptoms developed, followed by episodes of difficulty speaking, moving facial muscles, and swallowing and an increase in gait disturbance, including falling. On examination in the emergency department of this hospital, the blood pressure was 136/91 mm Hg; other vital signs were normal. Speech was halting but clear, and facial movements were slow but intact. Dystonia of the left arm and leg was present, and the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Blood tests, an electrocardiogram, and computed tomography of the head, without the administration of contrast material, were normal. Pyuria was noted, and ciprofloxacin was prescribed for a possible urinary tract infection. Trihexyphenidyl was stopped pending follow-up with her neurologist. During the next week, the patient became unable to speak; dysphagia to solids, and intermittently to liquids, developed. Six weeks later, the patient was seen in the oto-laryngology clinic of an affiliated hospital because of difficulty speaking. On examination, vocalization was irregular in pitch, and great effort was required to generate minimal sound. She was able to follow commands, answer yes-or-no questions, and intermittently utter single words, with great effort. Cranial nerves II through XII were intact, and the tongue was mobile. Flexible nasolaryngo-scopic evaluation revealed that the arytenoid mobility was intact, the vocal-cord edges were smooth bilaterally, and there were no masses or ulcerations in the hypopharynx or larynx. During phonation, the vocal cords had incomplete adduction and multiple irregular and nonvolitional movements. There was no evidence of inappropriate motion during vegetative tasks such as breathing, coughing, and throat clearing. The administration of carbidopa–levodopa (25 mg and 100 mg, respectively), three times daily, was begun, without improvement. One month later, MRI of the brain after the administration of gadolinium was unchanged. The following month (19 months after initial presentation), she returned to the movement disorders clinic for follow-up. The patient communicated by writing and reported difficulty swallowing, with weight loss, and increasing difficulty with walking, with frequent falls. She was able to open her mouth for examination, but was unable to open her mouth to vocalize clearly. The total score on the Burke– Fahn–Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale was 30 out of a possible 120 (where 0 is normal and 120 is the most severe), with severe dystonia of the left arm, no useful grasp, and mild dystonia of the left leg. The gait was wide-based. Testing for Lyme disease was negative. The next day, she was seen in the speech, language, and swallowing-disorders clinic. Vocalizations varied in intensity, pitch, and degree of strained or strangled voice quality. When she smiled and chewed reflexively, her combined jaw, lip, and mouth range of motion increased. Pathologic reflexes (snout, suck, and jaw jerk) were absent. The administration of trihexyphenidyl was resumed and was gradually increased to 30 mg daily in divided doses. An examination 1 month later revealed mildly decreased facial expression and a markedly abnormal gait with en bloc turns. Her postural stability as measured by the pull test was 2 (on a scale of 1 to 4, where 0 is normal and 4 is unable to stand without assistance). During the ensuing months, in addition to trihexypheni-dyl, intermittent trials of carbidopa–levodopa, clonazepam, and mirtazapine were conducted, with some improvement in gait and the ability to verbalize “yes” and “no.” Positron-emission tomographic (PET) scans of the brain revealed mildly decreased metabolism in the bilateral thalamus and cerebellum. A barium-swallow examination and fluoroscopy with videography showed significant oropharyngeal dysmotility. One year after the onset of anarthria, genetic testing for PARK8 (the LRRK2 gene encoding leucine-rich repeat kinase 2) was normal, and testing for PARK2 (the PARK2 gene encoding parkin) revealed one silent mutation in a coding region, three known single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and three additional heterozygous changes, all in noncoding regions. A diagnostic test was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,40,nejm-case-2010-40,A 68-Year-Old Woman with Chest Pain during an Airplane Flight,"Dr. Shveta Raju (Medicine): A 68-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia was admitted to the hospital because of substernal chest pain. The patient had been well until approximately 24 hours before admission, when substernal chest pain and pressure developed gradually during an international airplane flight from the Middle East to Europe. The pain did not radiate, and it fluctuated in intensity and resolved spontaneously after several hours. Chest pain recurred during the subsequent flight to the United States; the patient fell asleep, and on arrival in Boston, the pain had resolved. Late that evening, approximately 3 hours before admission, substernal chest pain recurred, associated with diaphoresis and weakness. The blood pressure, measured by the patient’s daughter, a physician, was 250/140 mm Hg. The patient took amlodipine and atenolol, which she had not taken while traveling. The chest pain improved but recurred 1 hour later. Her daughter took her to the emergency department at another hospital. On arrival, the patient reported that the pain was moderately severe and not associated with nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, or palpitations. The blood pressure was 156/77 mm Hg, the pulse 58 beats per minute, the oral temperature 36.1°C, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was lethargic and appeared to be in pain. The jugular veins were not distended, and the remainder of the examination was normal. The complete blood count was normal; other specimens could not be analyzed because of hemolysis. An electrocardiogram (ECG) reportedly showed sinus rhythm at 60 beats per minute, with ST-segment elevation of 2 mm in leads V2 through V6, I, and aVL. A chest radiograph showed perihilar fullness with indistinct pulmonary vasculature suggestive of interstitial pulmonary edema. Meto-prolol, morphine sulfate, eptifibatide, heparin, and nitroglycerin were administered intravenously, and acetylsalicylic acid was given orally. Less than 1 hour later, the blood pressure was 129/73 mm Hg and the pulse 65 beats per minute. The patient was transferred to this hospital, arriving approximately 3 hours after the onset of the most recent episode of chest pain. On arrival in the emergency department, the patient reported chest discomfort, which she rated at 8 or 9 on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. Five years earlier, results of a cardiac stress test and cardiac computed tomography (CT) were reportedly normal. She was born in Eastern Europe, lived in the Middle East, and did not speak English. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Medications at home included aten-olol, amlodipine, and atorvastatin. She was allergic to penicillin, atropine, and iodine. On examination, the blood pressure was 175/85 mm Hg, the pulse 72 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. The skin was slightly cool. Carotid-artery upstrokes were normal. The jugular veins were moderately distended. The S1 and S2 heart sounds were normal; an S4, with no S3 or murmur, was heard, and the remainder of the examination was normal. A chest radiograph revealed findings that were consistent with mild-to-moderate interstitial pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions. An ECG revealed sinus rhythm at 60 beats per minute, a normal axis, and ST-segment elevation of 2 mm in leads V2 through V6, I, and aVL, with Q waves and T-wave inversions in those leads. Cardiac catheterization was performed 14 minutes after the patient’s arrival. Coronary angiography revealed a right-dominant system; a short left main coronary artery with 20% stenosis; proximal 70% stenosis and complete occlusion of the middle portion of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, with poor collateral flow to the distal LAD artery; and an eccentric lesion in the ostium of second diagonal artery, with 70% stenosis and no thrombus. The right coronary artery was normal. A temporary pacemaker and an intraaortic balloon pump were placed. Thrombec-tomy of the proximal and middle portions of the LAD artery was attempted, followed by the placement of overlapping bare-metal stents, with no residual occlusion. Balloon angioplasty was performed on the ostial diagonal lesion; the residual stenosis decreased to 30%. Flow defined as grade 2 according to the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) scale (ranging from 0 to 3, with 0 indicating no flow and 3 normal flow) was achieved at the areas of intervention. Medications administered in the catheterization laboratory included clopidogrel, heparin, nitroglycerin, eptifib-atide, fentanyl, and vancomycin. The white-cell count, platelet count, and levels of electrolytes, total and direct bilirubin, total protein, albumin, globulin, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase were normal; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. ECG after the procedure revealed persistent, but decreased, ST-segment elevation in the anterolateral leads. The patient was transferred to the coronary care unit 2 hours after admission. Aspirin, clopidogrel, ep-tifibatide, metoprolol, acetylcysteine, omeprazole, ondansetron, and acetaminophen were administered. Seven hours after catheterization, laboratory tests were repeated (Table 1). In the afternoon of the first hospital day, results of arterial blood gas analysis performed while the patient was breathing 2 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula showed a pH of 7.30, with partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen of 33 mm Hg and 127 mm Hg, respectively, and 98% oxygen saturation. Approximately 13 hours after admission, a transthoracic echocardiogram, obtained while the intraaortic balloon pump was providing left ventricular support, showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35% (reference range, >50), a normal-size left ventricular cavity, moderate dysfunction involving the septal and anterior segments of the midportion of the left ventricle, and akinesis of the left ventricular apex. There was compensatory hyperkinesis at the base of the left ventricle and narrowing of the left ventricular outflow tract during systole, with a resting systolic left ventricular outflow tract gradient of 31 mm Hg according to Doppler imaging. There was no left ventricular thrombus. A small pericardial effusion was present, with no evidence of tamponade. On the evening of the first day, chest pain transiently recurred, and an ECG showed increased ST-segment elevation. Repeat coronary angiography 17 hours after admission showed that the stents were patent. ECG after catheterization and 9 hours later showed normal sinus rhythm, with persistent ST-segment elevation. On the second day, oral metoprolol was added. On the third day, the hematocrit decreased to 24.5%; 2 units of red cells were transfused. The intraaortic balloon pump was removed on the morning of the fourth day. At 2:30 p.m. that day, the blood pressure decreased transiently, with a mean arterial pressure of 58 mm Hg, without chest pain or light-headedness, and no change in the heart rate; the ECG was unchanged. Cultures of the blood and urine were obtained, and the metoprolol dose was decreased. That evening, after eating dinner, the patient reported mild dyspepsia. Shortly thereafter, she stated to her daughter that she did not feel well; the pulse decreased to the 50s, with increased ST-segment elevations, followed quickly by the sudden onset of severe chest pain. Within seconds, the blood pressure could not be obtained, and pulseless electrical activity and electromechanical dissociation developed. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation measures were instituted immediately; the trachea was intubated, and epinephrine, glucose, bicarbonate, insulin, calcium chloride, normal saline, packed red cells, and atropine were administered. Echo-cardiography revealed a large pericardial effusion. Pericardiocentesis was performed, and 750 to 800 ml of red, turbid fluid was aspirated, with a hematocrit of 17.5%. Echocardiography showed a decrease in the effusion, but there was no measurable pulse or blood pressure; after 36 minutes, resuscitation efforts were stopped and the patient died, 90 hours after admission. An autopsy was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2008,20,nejm-case-2008-20,A 57-Year-Old Woman with Abdominal Pain and Weakness after Gastric Bypass Surgery,"Dr. Allyson K. Bloom (Medicine): A 57-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain and weakness. One month earlier, a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and cholecystectomy were performed for treatment of obesity and gallstones. Pathological examination of a liver-biopsy specimen revealed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The immediate postoperative course was uncomplicated, and she was discharged 2 days after surgery. At follow-up visits, she reported poor oral intake, episodes of tachycardia (which had occurred intermittently in the past), intermittent passage of watery stool and dark urine, and suprapubic and epigastric pain; on two occasions, fluids were administered intravenously in the emergency department or clinic. Eighteen days before this admission, she returned to the emergency department with diffuse, crampy abdominal pain and was admitted to the surgical service. The patient’s vital signs and the results of a physical examination were normal except for a pulse of 56 beats per minute. Electrocardiography showed sinus brady-cardia, with a rate of 41 beats per minute. Computed tomographic (CT) scanning of the abdomen showed two adrenal nodules: one, 3.2 cm in diameter, on the right side, and the other, 1.7 cm in diameter, on the left. Neither nodule could be further characterized. There was no evidence of bowel obstruction or intra-abdominal fluid collection. Intravenous fluids, acetaminophen, tramadol, and gabapentin were given, and the pain diminished. She was discharged on the 4th hospital day. Eight days before this admission, abdominal pain recurred. The patient was readmitted to the surgical service. A specimen of urine grew Klebsiella pneumoniae. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Levofloxacin and phenazopyridine were administered. After one dose, a tonic–clonic seizure occurred. Treatment with phe-nytoin was begun. CT scanning of the brain showed areas of decreased attenuation in the occipital, posterior temporal, and parietal lobes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed bilateral cortical and subcortical areas of hyperintensity in the occipital, posterior temporal, and parietal lobes on T2-weighted images. These areas were also hyperintense on diffusion-weighted images, with elevated diffusion on apparent diffusion-coefficient maps, suggesting posterior reversible encephalopathy. Changes related to a seizure or encephalitis could not be ruled out. Treatment with trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole was begun. Electroencephalographic findings were normal. CT scanning of the abdomen after the administration of oral and intravenous contrast material showed no new abnormalities. Phenytoin was discontinued, and the patient was discharged home on the 6th hospital day. Three days later, she returned to the emergency department because of persistent lower abdominal and pelvic pain and red urine. She was readmitted to the surgical service. The patient reported that for the previous 2 days she had had poor appetite, lightheadedness, generalized weakness, nausea, cold sweats, mild constipation, and red-tinged urine that was at times “raspberry” in color. She did not have dysuria, headache, localized weakness, or double vision. She had a history of obesity since childhood, with a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 45 before bariatric surgery. She had diabetes melli-tus, which was controlled by diet; intermittent tachycardia; hypertension; hyperlipidemia; gas-troesophageal reflux disease; anxiety; dermatogra-phism with pruritus; facial hyperpigmentation after sun exposure; and facial hirsutism. A total abdominal hysterectomy and oophorectomy had been performed because of leiomyomas and dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Preoperative stress testing had revealed an ejection fraction of 72% with normal perfusion and was nondiagnostic for ischemia because of failure to reach 85% of maximum heart rate. Medications included eso-meprazole, tramadol, lisinopril, nadolol, and tri-methoprim–sulfamethoxazole. The patient was divorced, lived with one of her daughters, worked in an office, and was of Italian ancestry. She had stopped smoking 20 years earlier and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. There was a family history of coronary artery disease, cerebrovascu-lar disease, diabetes mellitus, and cholelithiasis. On examination, the patient appeared to be comfortable. Her height was 157.5 cm, weight 110 kg (body-mass index, 44), blood pressure 193/103 mm Hg, pulse 72 beats per minute, and temperature 35.8°C. Respirations were 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation was 98% while she breathed ambient air. There was hyper-pigmentation of the face and palmar creases. The abdomen was obese, without striae. Motor strength in the arms and legs was 4+ out of 5, with nor-mal reflexes. The remainder of the examination was normal. A culture of the urine grew enterococcus species. A complete blood count and serum levels of glucose, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, total protein, albumin, globulin, bilirubin, creatine ki-nase, creatine kinase MB, troponin T, alkaline phosphatase, amylase, and lipase were normal. The fasting level of plasma cortisol was 37.1 μg per deciliter (1023.6 nmol per liter) (reference range, 5 to 25 μg per deciliter [138.0–689.8 nmol per liter]), the 24-hour urinary free cortisol level 456 μg (reference range, 20 to 70), and the plasma epinephrine level 122 pg per milliliter (665.9 pmol per liter) (normal value, ≤110 pg per milliliter [≤600.4 pmol per liter]). Other tests of adrenal function, including corticotropin-releasing hormone and cosyntropin stimulation testing, were normal. Results of other laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. CT scanning of the abdomen showed no evidence of bowel obstruction, fluid collection, or renal calculi; the adrenal lesions were unchanged. Oxycodone and acetaminophen were given orally, and normal saline and vancomycin were administered intravenously. Oral intake of water was restricted, and sodium chloride tablets and hypertonic saline were administered. On the 2nd hospital day, weakness, numbness, and tingling developed in the patient’s legs; she fell while walking and had an episode of confusion and urinary incontinence. On the 3rd day, for further evaluation of the adrenal glands, CT scanning of the abdomen was performed after the oral and intravenous administration of contrast material. Two small nodules were seen in the left adrenal gland and a single nodule was seen in the right adrenal gland, all probably representing adrenal adenomas. During the next 3 days, the patient became unable to stand or sit independently, became incontinent of stool, and reported numbness and tingling over the lower half of her body; she was transferred to the medical service on the 5th day. A peripherally inserted central catheter was placed. On examination by a neurologist on the 6th day, the cranial nerves were normal; motor strength was 4+ out of 5 in the arms, with rapid fatigue, and 4 out of 5 in the legs. Deep-tendon reflexes were absent in both legs. Sensation was normal with respect to temperature, vibration, propriocep-tion, and light touch, but sensation to pinprick was decreased in the trunk and pelvic girdle. MRI of the spine showed multiple disk extrusions from T5–T6 to T7–T8, with narrowing of the left neural foramen at T5–T6 and slight indentation of the ventral cord at T6–T8 and T7–T8, without compression. There was mild volume loss and hyper-intensity in the cord at T7–T8 on T2-weighted images, findings that were suggestive of chronic myelomalacia. A lumbar puncture on the 7th day showed a glucose level of 98 mg per deciliter (5.4 mmol per liter) (reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]) and a protein level of 40 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55), with 1 white cell per high-power field; no cells or organisms were seen on Gram’s staining. Electromyography and nerve-conduction studies showed changes suggestive of an acute generalized, predominantly motor neuropathy. The patient was transferred to the neurology service. On the 8th day, strength was 1 to 3 out of 5 in the upper portion of the arms, 0 to 4 out of 5 in the fingers, 0 out of 5 in the upper legs, and 2 out of 5 in the lower legs. Levels of folate and vitamin B12 were normal. A 5-day course of immune globulin was begun intravenously. MRI of the brain disclosed no abnormalities of the pituitary and showed resolution of the abnormalities noted on the previous examination. The patient had difficulty breathing, and the respiratory rate increased; the trachea was intubated electively, and mechanical ventilation was begun. She was transferred to the neurologic intensive care unit. Treatment with metyrapone was begun. During the next 4 weeks, fevers, urinary tract infections, line infections, and ventilator-associated pneumonia developed, all of which were treated with antibiotics. Dexamethasone was added on the 14th day. Tracheostomy and gastrosto-my were performed. Repeated lumbar puncture showed a glucose level of 117 mg per deciliter (6.5 mmol per liter) and a protein level of 53 mg per deciliter; neither varicella–zoster virus nor Epstein–Barr virus was detected by polymerase-chain-reaction assay. Tests for Lyme disease and heterophile antibodies and cytomegalovirus antigen were negative; a test for IgG antibodies against cytomegalovirus was positive. Tests for autoantibodies and paraneoplastic antibodies were negative. The urinary cadmium level was 6.0 μg per liter (reference range, 0 to 5.0); screening for other heavy metals was negative. Another electromyographic study performed on the 11th day disclosed worsening sensorimotor polyneuropathy, with no definite evidence of a primary demyelinating polyneuropathy; on the 32nd day, the ulnar and tibial motor responses were no longer recordable, and needle electromyographic examination showed fibrillation potentials with no voluntary motor-unit potentials, findings that were consistent with severe sensorimotor neu-ropathy. A specimen from a sural-nerve biopsy showed severe axonal neuropathy; a specimen from a gastrocnemius-muscle biopsy showed mild neurogenic changes. Hypotension developed, which responded to phenylephrine and stress doses of corticosteroids. Episodes of bradycardia and asystole occurred, which responded to atropine; electrocardiography and measurements of cardiac biomarkers showed no evidence of ischemia. Transcutaneous pacing and treatment with theophylline were begun. A diagnostic test result was reported.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2018,36,nejm-case-2018-36,A 29-Year-Old Man with an Incidentally Discovered Renal Mass,"Dr. Keyan Salari (Urology): A 29-year-old man was seen at this hospital because of an incidentally discovered renal mass. The patient had been well until 6 weeks before this evaluation, when he identified a painless lump above his left testicle during a monthly self-examination. He was evaluated at his primary care physician’s office at another hospital. Examination confirmed a soft, nontender mass, which was described as “boggy,” on the superior aspect of the left testicle, without associated erythema. Laboratory test results (Table 1) and imaging studies of the testes and scrotum were obtained. Dr. Joseph F. Simeone: Ultrasonography of the scrotum and testes (Fig. 1) revealed normal testes, a varicocele on the left side, and a cyst (0.6 cm in diameter) on the right side of the epididymal head. There was an incidental mixed solid and cystic mass (11.8 cm by 10.8 cm by 9.4 cm) arising from the lower aspect of the right kidney. The left kidney was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis (Fig. 2), performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, confirmed the presence of a mixed solid and cystic mass (11 cm in diameter) at the lower pole of the right kidney. Thin mural calcification was noted. There was no evidence of hydrone-phrosis, venous invasion, enlarged lymph nodes, liver or pancreatic lesions, or adrenal nodules. The mass displaced the inferior vena cava to the left. Dr. Salari: The patient was referred to the urology clinic of this hospital. On evaluation, he reported mild discomfort in the right flank and right upper quadrant, along with a small bulge in that area. A review of systems was notable for the left scrotal mass and seasonal allergies. He had no fever, night sweats, weight loss, anorexia, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, pruritus, hematuria, dysuria, or pelvic or back pain. Medications included cetirizine, as needed, for seasonal allergic rhinitis. He had no known allergies to medications. The patient worked as a cook. He had emigrated from South America 11 years before the current evaluation, and he lived in coastal Massachusetts. He had no recent history of travel. He was married and had a healthy 2-year-old son, and his wife was expecting another child. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use any illicit substances. His mother had had gastrointestinal stromal tumor, his father had had skin melanoma and had died of a stroke, and his maternal grandfather had died of gastric cancer. There was no family history of genitourinary cancer, renal disease, or genitourinary disease. On examination, the heart rate was 70 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 127/81 mm Hg. The patient appeared to be well. There was a palpable nontender mass in the right abdomen, inferior to the liver. The genitourinary examination was notable for a varicocele on the left side; the varicocele was grade 2 of 3, indicating that it was palpable without a Valsalva maneuver. The phallus, scrotum, and testes were otherwise normal. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of total protein, globulin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. CT of the chest revealed an intrapulmonary lymph node, but there was no evidence of pulmonary nodules or lymphadenopathy, findings that would suggest metastatic cancer. Diagnostic and management decisions were made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2013,11,nejm-case-2013-11,A 4-Year-Old Boy with Fever and Abdominal Pain,"Dr. Nicolas V. Currier (Pediatrics): A 4-year-old boy was admitted to this hospital because of fever and abdominal pain. The night before admission, the patient awoke in the night, reported pain with urination, and urinated only in small quantities. The temperature was 37.8°C. His mother administered ibuprofen to him, and he returned to sleep. In the morning, he slept 3 hours longer than usual. During the morning, he had two episodes of nonbloody diarrhea. On examination later that day, his pediatrician palpated a mass in the abdomen. The patient was sent to the emergency department at another hospital. The patient rated the pain at 4 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. On examination, he appeared pale. The temperature was 39.1°C, the blood pressure 106/62 mm Hg, the pulse 119 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 17.5 kg. A mass, approximately 4 cm in diameter, was palpated in the right lower quadrant, and there was pain in the genital area on palpation. The remainder of the examination was normal. Urinalysis revealed 2+ ketones and 1+ blood, with 0 to 3 red cells per high-power field, and was otherwise normal. Ibuprofen in an oral suspension was administered. A radiograph of the abdomen showed a nonspecific bowel-gas pattern. Ultrasonography (Fig. 1A) revealed a heterogeneous lobular mass (6 cm in diameter) in the pelvis. The patient was transferred to this hospital. The patient’s mother reported that, on the day of admission, his appetite was decreased and he refused solids. He had had eczema as an infant and had delayed speech. Medications included ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and a multivitamin. His immunizations were current. He had no known drug allergies. He lived with his mother and other relatives and did not attend day care. His brother had hypospa-dias, and his maternal grandfather had lymphoma. On examination, the patient appeared well developed and in no distress. The temperature was 37.2°C, the blood pressure 103/53 mm Hg, the pulse 94 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft, without distention.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2022,35,nejm-case-2022-35,"A 60-Year-Old Man with Progressive Dyspnea, Neck Swelling, and a Lung Mass","Dr. David M. Dudzinski: A 60-year-old man was transferred to this hospital for evaluation of new dyspnea, cough, neck swelling, and a lung mass. Three days before the current admission, the patient was transported to another hospital by ambulance. He had a 5-day history of sore throat, swelling of his neck and both arms, and orthopnea. He reported that he had had progressive dyspnea with walking or lifting items at his job for the past year; the dyspnea had been most prominent during the 4 months before this evaluation and had been accompanied by persistent nonproductive cough. His daughter, a health care worker, called emergency medical services when she noticed that he had facial redness and flushing and learned of the swelling of his neck and arms. On evaluation at the other hospital, the temperature was 35.6°C, the heart rate 78 beats per minute, the blood pressure 121/57 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 19 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The face was flushed, and the neck was swollen. Breath sounds were absent in the right lung fields. The blood levels of troponin I and amylase were normal, as were the results of liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly revealed a new mass in the hilar region of the right upper lobe that measured 9.2 cm in greatest dimension. There was evidence of mass effect on the right main pulmonary artery and right main-stem and right upper-lobe bronchi, encasement of the right bronchus intermedius, occlusion of the superior vena cava (SVC) and narrowing of the right superior pulmonary vein, pulmonary emboli in the pulmonary artery of the left lower lobe, consolidation and atelectasis in the right upper lobe, chest-wall edema and extensive venous collateral vessels, and bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions. The patient was admitted to the other hospital, and intravenous piperacillin–tazobactam and heparin were administered. The next day, thoracentesis was performed, and 500 ml of cloudy yellow fluid was removed. On analysis of the pleural fluid, the fluid glucose level was 98 mg per deciliter (5.4 mmol per liter), the protein level 3.4 g per deciliter, the lactate dehydrogenase level 74 U per liter, and the pH 7.5. Gram’s staining of the pleural fluid revealed no organisms, and no malignant cells were identified on cytologic analysis. Ultrasonog-raphy of the legs showed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis. CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly showed no hemorrhage or stroke, and CT of the abdomen and pelvis reportedly revealed subcentimeter lucent areas in the iliac bones. The next day, the patient was transferred to the oncology unit of this hospital for further evaluation and care. On admission to this hospital, the patient reported that, during the past 3 days, he had had progressive swelling of both upper arms, as well as pain in the right shoulder and arm. He noted weight loss of approximately 10 kg in the past 6 months, anorexia, hoarse voice, dizziness with changes in position (including bending forward), and dyspnea on exertion. A review of systems was negative for hemoptysis, chest pain, palpitations, nausea, changes in bowel habits, vomiting, abdominal pain, night sweats, headache, and diplopia. Medical history included surgery on the shoulder and leg. The patient took no medications, and there were no known adverse reactions to medications. He was self-employed and had worked in plumbing and engineering. He had smoked two packs of cigarettes per day for 40 years and smoked marijuana occasionally. He drank five beers per day two times per week. His family history was notable for pancreatic cancer in his mother. The temperature was 37.1°C, the heart rate 110 beats per minute, the blood pressure 114/66 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 90 kg, the height 172 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 30.6. There was neck swelling and erythema, with no stridor. Jugular venous distention was present. On auscultation, the heart sounds were tachycardic but distant, and the lung sounds were markedly de-creased on the right side. There was edema of the arms, with more pronounced swelling in the right arm than in the left arm, as well as ery-thema on the chest and evidence of engorged veins in the chest wall. The blood level of glucose was normal, as were the results of liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Electrocardiography revealed sinus tachycardia with premature atrial beats, borderline-low pre-cordial lead voltage, and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes. Dr. Subba R. Digumarthy: Chest CT, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a persistent large central mass in the right upper lobe with occlusion of the right upper-lobe bronchus and collapse of the right upper lobe. There were multiple enlarged right mediastinal and right hilar lymph nodes (Fig. 1A). The brachiocephalic veins and the SVC showed no opacification, and the presence of extensive collateral veins in the right chest wall was consistent with venous occlusion and SVC syndrome (Fig. 1B and 1C). An incidental cyst was noted in the upper pole of the left kidney. There was no evidence of pericardial effusion. There was no other evidence of cancer in the abdomen. The diagnostic possibilities included non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small-cell lung cancer, metastasis from extrathoracic cancer, and lymphoma. Granulomatous infection and fibrosing mediastinitis were less likely in this case, given the imaging findings. Angiography performed the next day confirmed that there was no opacification of the subclavian and brachiocephalic veins or the SVC and that extensive collateral veins were present in the arms. After removal of some of the clots, multiple overlapping stents were placed in the internal jugular veins, the brachiocephalic veins, and the SVC (Fig. 1D and 1E and Video 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Dr. Colleen M. Keyes: On the fourth hospital day, rigid bronchoscopy revealed diffusely friable mucosa and dynamic airway narrowing of the right main-stem bronchus. Much of the airway narrowing appeared to be due to extrinsic compression (Fig. 2). Balloon dilation of the airway was performed but did not result in resolution of the airway narrowing; therefore, an endobron-chial stent was not placed. Endobronchial ultra-sonography revealed a 1.5-cm mass near the carina, and transbronchial needle aspiration was subsequently performed. Dr. Daniel Shepherd: During fine-needle aspiration of the subcarinal mass, a rapid on-site evaluation of the specimen was performed. Hema-toxylin and eosin staining (Fig. 3A and 3B) showed clusters of large epithelioid cells with anisonucleosis, irregularly contoured nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and occasional binucleated forms. There was a moderate amount of thin, delicate eosinophilic cytoplasm with occasional intracytoplasmic mucin. These findings are consistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. No morphologic features of small-cell carcinoma were seen, and immunohistochemical staining for neuroendocrine markers and for programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) was negative. Dr. Dudzinski: Radiation and medical oncology management decisions were made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,01,nejm-case-2010-01,"A 75-Year-Old Man with Hypertension, Hyperglycemia, and Edema","Dr. Jennifer L. Lyons (Medicine): A 75-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of the recent onset of hypertension, hyperglycemia, and edema. The patient had been in his usual state of health, with borderline hypertension and glucose intolerance, until 11 days earlier, when at a routine visit to his internist, the blood pressure was 171/75 mm Hg. The pulse was 73 beats per minute and the weight 101 kg. The physical examination was normal. The serum levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, cholesterol, lipids, creatine kinase, iron, iron-binding capacity, ferritin, vitamin B12, free thyroxine (T4), and total triiodothyronine (T3) and tests of liver function were normal; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. He was instructed to check his blood pressure and serum glucose levels at home, and a follow-up appointment was scheduled. During the following week, the patient reported blood pressures from 160 to 186 mm Hg systolic and from 79 to 82 mm Hg diastolic, and a glucose level (according to finger-stick testing after an overnight fast) of 170 to 286 mg per deciliter (9.4 to 15.9 mmol per liter). He noted ankle swelling, weight gain of 4.5 kg, pain in both calves that made it difficult to walk, and intermittent double vision. Two episodes of left-sided epistaxis occurred, which resolved spontaneously. The night before admission, a frontal headache developed (rated 6 of 10 on a scale in which 10 is the most severe). He recorded a systolic blood pressure of 206 mm Hg. He came to the emergency department of this hospital at 1:30 a.m. The patient reported noticing pedal edema intermittently for 1 month, which had increased during the previous week; one episode of hematuria had spontaneously resolved. He did not have shortness of breath, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, fevers, chills, nausea or vomiting, lower abdominal pain, or bowel or urinary symptoms. A diagnosis of hemochromatosis (homozygous C282Y mutation) had been made 8 years earlier, after routine laboratory tests showed elevated levels of serum iron and reduced iron-binding capacity, and was treated with regular phlebotomy. A diagnosis of prostate cancer had been made 22 years earlier and was treated with radical prostatectomy; pathological examination of the tissue reportedly showed no evidence of lymph-node metastases, but the serum level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) did not fall to 0 after the operation. Four years before admission, the serum level of PSA was 21.0 ng per milliliter, and administration of bicalutamide was begun. Six months later, the level of PSA was 2.3 ng per milliliter, and 8 months before admission it was 8.75 ng per milliliter. Bilateral adrenal nodules (2.1 cm by 1.8 cm on the left, and 2.3 cm by 1.1 cm on right) had been present and stable in size on multiple computed tomographic (CT) studies of the abdomen during the previous 6 years and were thought to represent adenomas. Bilateral thyroid adenomas had been present for 15 years; 11 years before admission, a left thy-roidectomy revealed a follicular adenoma. A nodule on the right thyroid had been stable; 2 years earlier, pathological examination of a specimen from a fine-needle aspiration biopsy showed benign follicular cells consistent with follicular adenoma. He had a history of colonic adenomas, and 6 months before admission, a tubular ade-noma with high-grade dysplasia had been removed during colonoscopy, with no evidence of residual adenoma on examination of another biopsy specimen 6 weeks later. He had had hypothyroidism since his thyroidectomy; he also had gastroesophageal reflux disease, osteoporosis, vitamin D deficiency, hyperlipidemia, migraine headaches, allergic rhinitis, and depression related to his wife’s recent illness and death. An episode of nephritis had occurred when he was in his 20s, which had resolved without sequelae. Five years before admission, a cardiac stress test and echocardiogram had been normal. He had had knee and bilateral cataract surgery. His parents had died of congestive heart failure, and a sister of nephritis; a grandfather had had throat cancer, and a first cousin colon cancer; his children and grandchildren were healthy. The patient was retired from an office position and had lived alone since his wife’s death 7 months earlier. He drank alcohol rarely, had smoked cigarettes for 10 years but stopped 40 years earlier, and did not use illicit drugs or herbal supplements. Medications included aspirin, loraze-pam, bicalutamide, celecoxib, chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine, levothyroxine, a multivitamin without iron, cholecalciferol, and oxycodone–aceta-minophen. He was allergic to doxazosin, prami-pexole, and nicotinic acid. On examination, the temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 186/79 mm Hg, the pulse 74 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, the weight 105 kg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The jugular veins were distended to 8 cm when the head was elevated to 30 degrees. There were mild expiratory wheezes diffusely and minimal crackles at the both lung bases. The first and second heart sounds were normal; a soft systolic murmur (grade 1/6) was heard at the right upper sternal border. Pulses were 2+ in the carotid arteries and extremities; no bruits were heard. There was mild bilateral gyneco-mastia. The abdomen was soft, with no distention or rebound tenderness. The liver measured 9 cm in the midclavicular line. There was 2+ pitting edema to the knees bilaterally. Funduscopic examination revealed sharp disks; visual acuity was 20/25 in the right eye and 20/100 in the left eye, with no diplopia. There was a mild left facial droop, and plantar responses were equivocal. The remainder of the examination was normal. Tests of coagulation and serum levels of phosphorus, magnesium, and lipase were normal; other laboratory results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed glucose 3+ and blood 1+ and was otherwise normal. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, with nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. A chest radio-graph was normal. CT of the abdomen after the administration of intravenous contrast material revealed multiple lesions in the liver (up to 2.5 cm in diameter), which were hypodense relative to the hepatic parenchyma after the administration of intravenous contrast material, and a heman-gioma in segment 6, which had not changed from previous studies; bilateral adrenal nodules had increased slightly in size from previous studies (2.8 cm by 2.6 cm on the left, and 2.9 cm by 1.8 cm on the right). The patient was admitted to the hospital. Insulin on a sliding scale, hydralazine, furo-semide, and potassium chloride were administered, and sodium was restricted. Laboratory-test results showed no evidence of myocardial infarction. On the second day, the blood pressures ranged from 138 to 175 mm Hg systolic and from 64 to 79 mm Hg diastolic, and the weight was 99 kg. CT of the chest performed without the administration of contrast material revealed two nodules in each lung, 2 to 4 mm in diameter, and paratracheal and subcarinal lymph nodes, 0.8 to 1.0 cm in diameter, that had not been present on a study 6 years earlier. Results of laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Other test results were pending. On the third day, the blood pressure was 180/91 mm Hg. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,37,nejm-case-2019-37,A 20-Month-Old Boy with Severe Anemia,"Dr. Nicole de Paz (Pediatrics): A 20-month-old boy was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit of this hospital because of severe anemia. The patient was well until 5 days before admission, when his aunt noted that he had begun tugging his ear and suspected that he might be having pain. He did not have fever, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, or cough. His aunt took him to the emergency department at another hospital, where acute otitis media was diagnosed and a course of oral amoxicillin was prescribed. The next day, the patient began vomiting. During the next 3 days, multiple episodes of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis occurred. His aunt fed him an oral electrolyte solution. During this time, the patient did not have a bowel movement. He also appeared pale, was less active than usual, and had a decreased volume of urine output. The day before admission, he drank milk and ate pizza without vomiting, but he seemed tired and increasingly pale. On the morning of admission, the patient’s aunt took him to a primary care pediatric clinic for evaluation. In the clinic, the patient appeared ill; pallor, tachycardia, and tachypnea were present. The hemoglobin level, obtained by fingerstick testing, was reportedly 2.9 g per deciliter, the hematocrit 9.0%, and the white-cell count 33,000 per microliter. The patient was referred to the emergency department of a community hospital affiliated with this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient’s aunt reported that the child seemed to be short of breath. On examination, he appeared listless and pale and had occasional grunting. The temperature was 36.8°C, the pulse 150 beats per minute, the blood pressure 84/59 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 44 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 11.7 kg (61st percentile for age). The mucous membranes were pale. On auscultation of the heart, tachycardia and a gallop rhythm were present. The radial and dorsalis pedis pulses were normal, and the capillary refill time was less than 2 seconds. The lungs were clear. The abdomen was distended, and hepatosplenomegaly was present, with no tenderness or masses and with normal bowel sounds. There was firm stool in the rectal vault; a fecal occult blood test was negative. Multiple café au lait macules were present. The remainder of the examination was normal. A peripheral intravenous catheter was inserted, and supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute. A blood sample was obtained for culture and laboratory testing; the hematocrit was 6.7%, the white-cell count 36,450 per microliter, and the platelet count 995,000 per microliter. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Randheer Shailam: Frontal and lateral chest radiographs showed hyperinflated lungs, cardiomegaly, and enlargement of the central pulmonary vessels (Fig. 1A and 1B). There was no evidence of pleural effusion. These findings are nonspecific and can be present in patients with congenital heart diseases, including those with a left-to-right shunt, cardiomyopathy, or heart failure. Dr. Ana M. Rosales: An electrocardiogram (Fig. 2A) showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 155 beats per minute with left ventricular hypertrophy and nonspecific T-wave abnormalities. The QRS axis of depolarization was 54 degrees. The QRS duration and the remainder of the intervals were normal for the patient’s age. The estimated corrected QT (QTc) interval was 404 msec. Dr. de Paz: After consultation with a pediatric hematologist–oncologist was obtained, the patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit at this hospital. On admission of the patient to this hospital, the aunt reported that the child had not been seen by a pediatrician as frequently as is typically recommended for infants and toddlers because of a complex social situation; she did not think that he had ever undergone any blood testing. He had not received all the recommended routine immunizations; a detailed vaccination history was not immediately available. The patient had been born after 36 weeks 5 days of gestation and had been treated with oral morphine after birth because of neonatal abstinence syndrome. He was receiving amoxicillin and had no known allergies. He lived with his aunt and cousins in an urban area of New England and had not traveled. His diet included a variety of foods, including meats and vegetables, and he typically drank 0.6 liters of cow’s milk each day. His father had multiple café au lait macules, and his mother and father had substance-use disorders. On examination, the patient was whimpering and reaching out to be held by his aunt; he appeared ill and pale. The temperature was 36.2°C, the pulse 155 beats per minute, the blood pressure 98/49 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 66 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute. On auscultation of the heart, tachycardia, a gallop rhythm, and a systolic murmur (grade 4/6) were present; the precordium was hyperdynamic. Tachypnea, nasal flaring, abdominal breathing, and mild sub-costal retractions were present, and soft crackles could be heard occasionally on examination of the lungs. The abdomen was distended, the spleen extended 6 cm below the left costal margin, and the liver extended 5 cm below the right costal margin. The hands and feet were cool, and the capillary refill time was less than 2 seconds. On examination of the skin, multiple café au lait macules were noted, as were inguinal freckling and a hemangioma on the right buttock that measured 1 cm in diameter. The remainder of the examination was normal. Dr. Shailam: An anteroposterior radiograph of the chest showed severe cardiomegaly with mild interstitial pulmonary edema (Fig. 1C). Dr. Rosales: Echocardiography (Fig. 2B through 2E) revealed normal segmental anatomy, with a patent foramen ovale and left-to-right blood flow. No septal defects were identified. The valvular anatomy was normal, and there was mild mitral regurgitation with mild enlargement of both atria. The origin and proximal course of the coronary arteries appeared normal. The pulmonary and systemic venous return appeared normal. The aortic arch had normal branching and was not obstructed. There was no evidence of a ductus arteriosus. The left ventricle was moderately to severely dilated, with preserved systolic function. Dr. de Paz: A diagnostic test result was received, and additional diagnostic tests were performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2009,37,nejm-case-2009-37,"A 46-Year-Old Woman with Chronic Renal Failure, Leg Swelling, and Skin Changes","A 46-year-old woman was referred to a rheumatologist at this hospital because of swelling of the legs and skin changes. The patient had been in her usual state of health until approximately 2 years earlier, when she was admitted to another hospital because of painful swelling of the left leg. She had been using oral contraceptives for 6 months for control of men-orrhagia. She had chronic kidney disease caused by congenital ureteral reflux, which had not required dialysis; she was seen regularly by a nephrologist. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with angiography revealed thrombosis of the left common iliac, internal and external iliac, and common femoral veins. MRI of the chest with angiography showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Laboratory evaluation showed no evidence of hypothyroidism, no abnormalities of coagulation factor II or V, and normal levels of protein C, protein S, and antithrombin 3; tests for anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant were negative. Oral contraceptives were discontinued, and anticoagulation was begun with heparin, followed by warfarin. Approximately 7 weeks later, swelling of the left leg increased, associated with a pruritic rash on the left medial thigh. Imaging studies reportedly showed reca-nalization of the proximal superficial femoral vein and were otherwise unchanged. Doxycycline and azithromycin were administered but discontinued after testing for Lyme disease was negative. Antinuclear-antibody titers were negative, and the level of d-dimer was normal. She saw a dermatologist, and punch-biopsy specimens of the skin of the left thigh and calf were reported to show numerous eosinophils, a feature consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction. Swelling of the left leg persisted. On examination 6 months after the onset of symptoms, there was pitting edema (1+) of the left leg. The right calf was 32 cm in circumference and the left 35 cm. The skin had a bluish discoloration, and peripheral pulses were normal. Noninvasive vascular studies showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. Warfarin was discontinued after approximately 8 months of anticoagulation. One month later, swelling of the left leg worsened. On examination, there was mild edema extending from the left ankle to the mid-thigh, with erythematous discoloration of the skin in a reticular pattern, with atrophie blanche at the edges. Noninvasive vascular studies disclosed recurrent deep venous thromboses in the left popliteal and calf veins, and anticoagulation with enoxaparin and warfarin was begun. Swelling of the left leg and reticular erythema of the skin persisted. Approximately 7 months before evaluation at this hospital, the patient noted a sensation of tightness in both legs after prolonged exercise, followed by thickening of the skin of the left upper thigh that progressed to involve the calf. On examination 6 weeks later, there was diffuse ery-thema and thickening of the skin of the left leg, extending from the lower calf to the thigh; the skin of the right calf was thickened, without ery-thema. The hematocrit was 34%; the remainder of the complete blood count was normal, as were the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, the creatine kinase level, and testing for antinuclear antibodies. Pathological examination of a specimen from a deep-wedge biopsy of the left thigh revealed septal panniculitis with fibrosis and an inflammatory infiltrate including lymphocytes, eosinophils, and histiocytes with occasional giant cells, features thought to be consistent with erythema nodosum, a hypersensitivity reaction, or eosinophilic fascii-tis. Treatment with prednisone (60 mg daily) was begun, and the patient reported decreased erythe-ma and discomfort. Four months later, hemodi-alysis was initiated because of metabolic acidosis. Administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1000 mg daily) was begun, and prednisone was tapered to 10 mg daily. She was referred to a rheumatologist at this hospital. She reported occasional spasms of her fingers during dialysis, mild joint pain, and fatigue but no joint stiffness, morning stiffness, hyperpig-mentation, or woody changes of the skin. She reported difficulty walking, bending to the floor, getting in and out of an automobile, and fatigue after walking 2 miles. She had chronic obstructive nephropathy due to congenital bilateral ure-teral reflux, with tubular acidosis and secondary hyperparathyroidism. A neobladder had been constructed 20 years earlier. She had had a cholecys-tectomy and a cesarean section. She did not recall having been exposed to gadolinium. She had been adopted as a child. Her biologic mother had died in her 50s of vulvar carcinoma; a biologic uncle had died of colon cancer, and maternal grandparents had lived into their 80s. There was no known family history of hematologic, renal, or rheumatic diseases. She lived with her husband and son and worked in an office. She drank alcohol rarely and did not smoke. She was allergic to penicillin, sulfa, nitrofurantoin, and vancomy-cin. Medications included warfarin, levothyroxine, sodium bicarbonate, calcitriol, calcium carbonate, prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, and weekly darbepoetin alfa injections. On examination, she was cushingoid. Vital signs were normal. There was mild erythema over the cheeks. The conjunctivae and sclera were normal. There were no oral or nasal ulcerations. There was slight erythema over an area of swelling on the left lower leg but no hyperpigmentation, tethering of the skin to the underlying fascia, peau d’orange change, or hair loss. A dialysis catheter was present in a right upper intercostal space, and an arteriovenous fistula was present in the left antecubital fossa. There was full motion of all joints, without inflammation or deformity. The remainder of the examination was normal. She was advised to continue immunosuppressive therapy and to avoid radiologic studies with gadolinium. She was placed on a waiting list for a renal transplant. The next month, mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued because of thrombocytopenia. During the next year, the skin lesions were unchanged. Approximately 14 months after presentation, difficulty swallowing (first solid foods, then liquids) developed, and she noted increasing tightness in both legs. On examination by a dermatologist, there was induration of the left leg, extending to the mid-thigh, without brawny discoloration, and prominent telangiectasias over the cheeks. At this time, review of her records disclosed that the patient had received gadolinium contrast material for MRI studies in the past on three occasions; the patient was informed of this. One month later, she returned to the rheumatology clinic. She had recently noted hyperpigmentation of the skin of the left thigh, both lower legs, and left forearm and reported morning stiffness and increased difficulty walking. On examination, there was hyperpigmentation of the skin of both legs (Fig. 1A and 1B) and the left forearm, tethering of the skin to the underlying fascia, and no peau d’orange change. There were bilateral nasal and temporal yellow scleral plaques (Fig. 1C). There were no joint contractures. The remainder of the physical and neurologic examinations was normal. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2023,34,nejm-case-2023-34,A 49-Year-Old Woman with Loss of Consciousness and Thrombocytopenia,"CME at NEJM.org Dr. Joseph B. Stegeman (Emergency Medicine): A 49-year-old woman was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital after being found unconscious at work. At approximately 4:30 p.m. on the day of this evaluation, the patient was found unconscious on the floor next to a copy machine at work. Emergency medical services were activated and found the patient to be confused and aphasic; she could say only “yes” and “no.” There was no evidence of incontinence or trauma. A fingerstick blood glucose level was normal. The patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. On the patient’s arrival at the emergency department, limited additional information was obtained from coworkers and family members. The patient had had coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) 4 weeks earlier and had returned to work after 2 weeks. On the morning before this evaluation, coworkers had observed that she appeared “unwell.” Before 2 p.m., she had participated in a lunchtime conference call and had spoken to family members and colleagues. Her medical history was notable for hypertension, for which she took amlodipine. There was no known family history of neurologic disorders. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.3°C, the heart rate 70 beats per minute, the blood pressure 141/98 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. On examination, she was aphasic; her speech was described as mumbling, and she was able to answer simple questions only intermittently. Strength and sensation appeared to be grossly intact, but she could not perform rapidly alternating movements or tests of coordination. There was no evidence of head or other trauma. The remainder of the examination was normal. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Shahmir Kamalian: Forty minutes after the patient’s arrival, computed tomography (CT) angiography of the head and neck (Fig. 1), performed after the adminis-tration of intravenous contrast material, showed no evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, or intra-cranial or cervical arterial stenosis or occlusion. The dural venous sinuses and deep cerebral veins were patent. A chest radiograph was normal. Dr. Stegeman: Approximately 1 hour after the patient’s arrival, initial laboratory test results were received (Table 1). The blood ethanol level was undetectable, and urine toxicologic screening was negative, as was screening for human chorionic gonadotropin. The blood thyrotropin level was normal. Intravenous normal saline was administered. Within 2 hours after the patient’s arrival, her aphasia abated; her speech was slow but fluent. On a repeat review of systems, she noted that she had felt warm earlier in the day, but she reported no other symptoms and no use of alcohol or drugs. Three hours after the patient’s arrival, additional laboratory test results were received (Table 1). Analysis of a peripheral-blood smear showed numerous schistocytes per high-power field, very few platelets, and reticulocytosis. Diagnostic tests were performed, and management decisions were made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,10,nejm-case-2012-10,A 16-Year-Old Boy with Epigastric Pain and a Mediastinal Mass,"Dr. Jennifer C. Hensley (Pediatrics): A 16-year-old boy was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain and a mediastinal mass. The patient had been well until 4 days before admission, when he began to feel vaguely ill. The next day, nonbloody emesis occurred. Two days before admission, epigastric pain, nausea, decreased appetite, and constipation developed. On the morning of admission, he took laxatives and acetaminophen, without relief. He saw his pediatrician; a tentative diagnosis of pancreatitis was made, and the patient was sent to the emergency department at an affiliated hospital. On arrival, he rated the pain at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). He had not had fever, additional episodes of vomiting, or diarrhea. On examination, the weight was 138.5 kg, the temperature 36.7°C, the blood pressure 155/75 mm Hg, the pulse 88 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 36 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft, with moderate tenderness in the epigastrium and right upper quadrant; the remainder of the examination was normal. Levels of platelets, electrolytes, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, calcium, creatine kinase isoenzymes, and troponin I were normal, as were tests of renal function; other test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen after the administration of intravenous contrast material revealed a cystic mass, 12.4 cm by 6.1 cm by 6.2 cm, in the posterior mediastinum above the gastroesophageal junction, which displaced the inferior vena cava, the heart, and the distal esophagus; hepatic steatosis and trace bilateral pleural effusions were also present. Morphine (5 mg) was administered intravenously with transient improvement (the patient rated the pain at 3 out of 10) within 4 minutes; ranitidine and normal saline were also given. The patient was transferred to this hospital by ambulance for further evaluation; morphine (4 mg) was administered for recurrent pain en route. On arrival, the patient described the pain as sharp; radiating to his back; worsening with movement, deep inspirations, and swallowing; and improving slightly with sitting upright. He reported having the sensation of food sticking in his throat and having a mild cough and sore throat for 2 to 3 days. Blood-pressure recordings and serum levels of glycated hemoglobin and insulin had reportedly been elevated in the recent past. He had no known allergies. He lived with his mother, a sibling, and two dogs, and he attended high school. His father had had type 2 diabetes and hypertension and died at 50 years of age after a stroke; his mother had had gesta-tional diabetes and cholestatic pancreatitis and had hypertension. On examination, the patient was obese, alert, and in distress because of pain. The blood pressure was 159/67 mm Hg, the pulse 95 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute; the temperature and oxygen saturation while he was breathing ambient air were normal. Respirations appeared slightly labored from pain, without crackles, rhonchi, wheezing, or stridor. Bowel sounds were normal; there was epigastric tenderness to palpation, with guarding; there was no rebound, palpable mass, or ecchymoses. The spine was tender to palpation in the midlumbar region, and there was hyperpigmentation of the axillae consistent with acanthosis nigricans. The remainder of the examination was normal. A chest ra-diograph showed retrocardiac opacity. CT of the chest confirmed the presence of a posterior me-diastinal cystic mass. Within the mass, there was a linear area of hyperdensity adjacent to the esophagus that was mobile on images obtained with the patient in the prone position and was thought to represent either calcifications within the mass or extraluminal extravasation of oral contrast material due to communication between the esophagus and the mass. Bilateral pleural effusions were greater than those in the study performed less than 24 hours earlier. Morphine was administered intravenously, and oral intake was withheld. During the first day, the temperature rose to 39.0°C. Thoracentesis of the right pleural effusion was performed (Table 1). The prothrombin time was 14.9 seconds (reference range, 10.8 to 13.4); serum levels of electrolytes, human chorionic go-nadotropin, and alpha-fetoprotein were normal, as were the partial-thromboplastin time and tests of renal function; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. A barium-swallow examination revealed a smooth extrinsic impression of the distal esophagus, without extraluminal leakage of contrast material. During the next 2 days, the temperature rose to 39.6°C. Culture of the blood was sterile. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest was aborted because of the patient’s discomfort; limited imaging was performed. On the third day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,06,nejm-case-2012-06,A 45-Year-Old Man with a History of Alcohol Abuse and Rapid Cognitive Decline,"Dr.ClaytonKnox (Medicine): A 45-year-old man with a history of alcoholism was admitted to this hospital because of rapid cognitive decline and worsening jaundice. During the previous 3 months, increasing fatigue and cough productive of yellow sputum and flecks of blood had developed, with post-tussive vomiting. Eleven days earlier, the patient had traveled to Europe for a week for a family event, during which he had consumed 10 to 20 alcoholic beverages per day. He had stopped drinking alcohol on his return, 3 days before admission, when nausea and vomiting developed. The next day, he called his physician’s office. He reported no recent alcohol use and no fever, headache, diarrhea, or abdominal pain. Azithromycin was prescribed, and fluids and follow-up were advised. During the 36 hours before admission, jaundice developed, his urine darkened, and somnolence, slow and slurred speech, difficulty putting words together, and repetitions of questions and phrases developed. His girth gradually increased and his appetite decreased, without weight loss, tremulousness, or seizure activity. He was taken to the emergency department at a local affiliated hospital. On examination, the patient was lethargic but oriented to person, place, and time and able to follow simple commands. The vital signs and oxygen saturation while he was breathing ambient air were normal. Scleral icterus, bilateral facial telangiec-tasias, and crackles in the right lower lung were evident, as was abdominal distention, with the edge of the liver palpable and slight tenderness in the right upper quadrant. The remainder of the physical and neurologic examination was normal. The blood levels of glucose, alanine aminotransferase, lipase, amylase, troponin I, and ammonia were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests; testing for hepatitis B and C viruses, alcohol, and salicylates was negative. Other results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram was normal. A chest radiograph showed findings consistent with atelectasis in the base of the right lung, unchanged from 5 years earlier, and was otherwise normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the head obtained without the administration of contrast material revealed hypodensity and mass effect in the right temporal lobe and insula, with preservation of the adjacent cortex and without intracranial herniation or hydrocephalus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after the administration of contrast material revealed a solitary lesion (2.6 cm in diameter) in the right insula, with thin, smooth, peripheral enhancement and extensive surrounding edema and mild mass effect. The patient was transferred to this hospital. The patient reported no fever, chills, diarrhea, abdominal pain, chest pain, dyspnea, weakness, numbness, tingling, paresthesias, or altered sensation, taste, or smell. He had a history of elevated results of liver-function tests, anxiety, depression, gout, erectile dysfunction, and bursitis of the right shoulder; he had undergone a hemorrhoidectomy 7 years earlier after an episode of rectal bleeding and iron-deficiency anemia requiring hospitalization. He had a long history of alcohol abuse (up to 1 liter of vodka per day). He had declined detoxification treatment, disulfiram therapy, and referral to support groups for alcoholism. He did not smoke or use illicit drugs. Medications included allopurinol, citalopram, sildenafil, and vitamins; he had taken celecoxib for bursitis for 3 months, stopping 3 months earlier. He had no known allergies. He grew up on a farm in Europe, immigrated to the United States two decades ago, returned to Europe often for family events, lived with his wife and children, and had worked in the food-service industry and with heavy machinery. His mother, 89 years of age, had cancer, and his father died at 84 years of age with bone cancer; a cousin had tuberculosis. On examination, the blood pressure was 142/89 mm Hg; other vital signs were normal. The conjunctivae were icteric, the tongue was smooth and dry, and there was dried blood in the mouth. A systolic murmur, grade 2/6, was heard at the apex, radiating toward the axilla. The abdomen was distended, with periumbilical striae, bulging flanks, and a prominent venous pattern over the upper abdomen, without tenderness, rebound, or guarding. The edge of the liver was four finger-breadths below the right costal margin in the midclavicular line. The skin was jaundiced, and there were petechiae on the legs. The patient followed commands and spoke fluently and spontaneously, without aphasia or dysarthria. The pupils constricted briskly (the right pupil from 5 mm to 4 mm, and the left pupil from 4 mm to 3 mm), and the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of phosphorus, magnesium, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, iron, vitamin B12, and folate were normal. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation showed five small bands (two IgG kappa, one IgG lambda, and two IgM kappa, all <0.25 g per deciliter), features consistent with an oligoclonal immune response. Other test results are shown in Table 1. The urine contained 3+ bilirubin and trace urobilinogen, glucose, and ketones; screening for toxins in the urine revealed lorazepam. Thiamine, folic acid, allopurinol, citalopram, levetiracetam, and multivitamins were administered. During the next 3 days, the patient was intermittently lethargic, with slurred speech. Testing for IgG antibodies to Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) capsid antigen and nuclear antigen was positive; the level of EBV DNA was 1000 copies per milliliter by polymerase chain reaction. Testing for IgM antibodies to EBV; antibodies to cytomegalovirus and smooth muscle; and hepatitis A, B and C viruses was negative, as was a skin test for tuberculosis. Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed hepatic and splenic enlargement and a thickened gallbladder wall. CT of the chest revealed scattered nodules, 2 to 5 mm in diameter, in the middle lobe and a minor fissure of the right lung, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, and trace pleural effusions bilaterally. CT of the abdomen showed hepato-splenomegaly, mild lymphadenopathy, and a small amount of ascites. On the third day, repeat MRI of the brain obtained after the administration of contrast material showed a T2-weighted hyperin-tense lesion (3.4 cm in diameter) with thin, smooth peripheral enhancement and heterogeneous foci of restricted diffusion centrally. Lactu-lose was administered. On the fifth hospital day, the level of total bilirubin was 18.6 mg per deciliter (318 μmol per liter), and the direct bilirubin 11.8 mg per deciliter (202 μmol per liter). A test result was received, and a diagnostic procedure was performed.

She had been well until 2 months earlier, when burning epigastric pain developed, associated with nausea, vomiting, fatigue, anorexia, and a 10-kg weight loss. The pain was constant, radiated to the throat, and was exacerbated by eating. Emesis was green, with no blood; vomiting initially occurred after eating, and later occurred once each morning. Ten days before admission, daily shaking chills, constipation, mild headache, and difficulty sleeping developed. During the 2 days before admission, the epigastric pain increased in severity. She came to the emergency department of this hospital. The patient did not have dysuria, hematuria, a decrease in urine output, or confusion. She had had hypertension for approximately 1 year, had a history of anxiety and depression, and had had a hysterectomy for fibroids. Eight months before admission, analysis of a 24-hour urine collection, total volume 0.85 liter, revealed an albumin level of 3.6 mg per liter (reference range, 0 to 15). Other laboratory-test results from 3 and 8 months earlier, performed in another country on an outpatient basis, are shown in Table 1. The patient was born in Morocco, lived with her family in the United States, and returned often to her homeland to visit. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use herbal remedies or illicit drugs. Her father had had heart disease. Medications included propranolol, paroxetine, bronazepam, and mianserin hydrochloride. She had no known allergies to medications. On examination, she looked pale and tired. The temperature was 35.8°C, the blood pressure 118/74 mm Hg, the pulse 74 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while she was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft and mildly tender to deep palpation in the epigastric and suprapubic regions, with normal bowel sounds and no distention or abdominal bruits. Distal pulses were normal. A manual rectal examination and the remainder of the physical examination were normal. There was no blood in the stool. A complete blood count; serum levels of glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, troponin I, creatine kinase and creatine kinase isoenzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, iron, iron-binding capacity, vitamin B12, folate, and immunoglobulins; and results of liver-function tests and serum protein electrophoresis were normal; no Bence Jones protein was detected. Testing for antinuclear antibody and antibodies to double-stranded DNA was negative, and levels of complement (C3 and C4) were normal. Other test results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. A chest radiograph was normal, with no free air under the diaphragm, and an electrocardiogram was normal. A computed tomographic scan of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed an irregularity in the wall of the rectum but was otherwise normal. Rigid proctoscopic examination to 18 cm, performed at the bedside, was normal. One liter of crystalloid solution was infused intravenously. On the second day, testing for antibodies to Goodpasture’s antigen (NC1 domain of the α3 chain of type IV collagen) and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), including antibodies to proteinase 3 (associated with c-ANCA) and my-eloperoxidase (associated with p-ANCA), was negative. Additional laboratory-test results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. The next day, a radiographic survey of the skeleton showed no lytic or blastic lesions. Ul-trasonographic images of the renal arteries and the proximal superior mesenteric and celiac arteries obtained in the vascular laboratory showed no stenoses. The right kidney was 9.3 cm and the left kidney 10.0 cm in length. The hematocrit was 19.3%, and the hemoglobin level was 6.2 g per deciliter. The serum erythropoietin level was 11.4 mIU per milliliter (reference range, 4.1 to 19.5 for persons with a normal hematocrit and hemoglobin); the haptoglobin and thyrotropin levels were normal, and a cryocrit and tests for antibody to hepatitis C virus were negative. The Heli-cobacter pylori immune ratio was 1.99 (>1.09 is associated with infection). One unit of red cells was transfused, and the hematocrit rose to 22.2%. Ergocalciferol, epoetin alfa, clarithromycin, amox-icillin, omeprazole sodium bicarbonate, and magnesium sulfate were given, and fluids were administered intravenously. During the next 3 days, the abdominal pain improved slightly, and trace edema developed in the legs. On the sixth day, a biopsy specimen of abdominal subcutaneous fat was obtained. Pathological examination with Congo red staining showed no evidence of amyloid. On the eighth day, burning pain in the left eye developed, with ery-thema of the medial sclera and clear discharge.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,21,nejm-case-2019-21,A 31-Year-Old Woman with Vision Loss,"Dr. Priya Srikanth (Neurology): A 31-year-old woman was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital because of vision loss. Three weeks before presentation, blurry vision in the left eye developed gradually, with perception of distant objects most affected; the patient attributed this change to needing new eyeglasses. One week before presentation, the patient reported nearly complete loss of vision in the left eye, with a “dark shadow” located in the center of vision. The peripheral vision was unaffected. Colors were increasingly “washed out,” and images appeared gray. When she covered her left eye, the vision in her right eye was normal. She recalled intermittent floaters in the left eye that had correlated with the onset of vision loss. The patient was evaluated by her local optometrist. Central vision loss was confirmed, and no abnormalities were seen on funduscopic examination. She was referred to a neuro-ophthalmologist. However, her symptoms continued to progress, and she sought care at a hospital that is affiliated with this hospital and specializes in ophthalmology. In the emergency department of the affiliated hospital, the temperature was 36.1°C, the pulse 72 beats per minute, the blood pressure 118/81 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20.4. A central scotoma was noted in the left eye; the visual field was full in the right eye. Visual acuity was 20/30 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left eye. On the Ishihara color test, 8 of 13 color plates were identified correctly in the visual field of the right eye and 0 of 13 color plates were identified correctly in the visual field of the left eye. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light; a relative afferent pupillary defect was noted in the left eye. Slit-lamp examination of the eyes revealed normal adnexa, lids, lashes, conjunctivae, and sclerae and clear corneas. The anterior chambers, irises, lenses, and vitreous bodies were normal in both eyes. The intraocular pressure was 18 mm Hg in the right eye and 17 mm Hg in the left eye. The optic nerves were pink, with normal cups and sharp margins. The vessels appeared normal in both eyes. Extraocular movements were normal bilaterally, without nystagmus. Imaging studies were performed. Dr. Amy F. Juliano: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and orbits was performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material. A T2-weighted image showed increased signal with probable mild hazy enhancement in the left optic nerve; there was no evidence of a mass lesion compressing the optic nerve or cerebral white-matter lesions (Fig. 1). Dr. Srikanth: The patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital for fur-ther evaluation. She reported that her vision was unchanged from 3 weeks earlier and that she had intermittent dull pain under the left eye. There was no double vision, pain with eye movement, or history of ocular trauma. She did not have fevers, chills, numbness, tingling, weakness, lack of coordination, hearing loss, shortness of breath, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash. She had a history of vitamin D and iron deficiencies; she had not undergone any surgeries. She had no known adverse reactions to medications and was taking no medications. The patient lived alone in a suburb in New England. She was in a longterm relationship with a male partner and had no children. She drank alcohol occasionally but did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. There was no history of recent travel, insect or tick bites, or cats in her home. Her grandfather had hyper-lipidemia. Her mother had a history of glaucoma, but no other family members had a history of vision loss. The vital signs and results of the ophthalmo-logic examination were unchanged, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, vitamin B12, C-reactive protein, thyrotropin, and angiotensin-converting enzyme were normal, as were the results of tests of renal and liver function, the complete blood count, the differential count, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was 19 ng per milliliter (47 nmol per liter; reference range, 20 to 80 ng per milliliter [50 to 200 nmol per liter]). An assay for antinuclear antibodies was positive at 1:40 with a speckled pattern; assays for anti– double-stranded DNA, anti–aquaporin-4, and anti–myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies and rheumatoid factor were negative. Antibody-based screening tests for Lyme disease and syphilis were negative, as were blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen and antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2. Admission to the neurology service was recommended for additional evaluation and the administration of empirical intravenous glucocorticoid therapy; however, the patient declined admission and chose instead to have follow-up in the clinic. Nine days later, the patient was evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital. She reported increased blurriness of the nasal visual field of the left eye. The results of the ophthalmologic examination were unchanged. Human chorionic gonadotropin was undetectable in the blood. A 3-day outpatient course of intravenous glucocorti-coids was begun, and a subsequent 14-day tapering course of prednisone was prescribed. Thirty-four days after evaluation in the emergency department and 2 months after blurry vision in the left eye had developed, vision loss in the right eye developed. Three days later, the patient was evaluated in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic of the affiliated hospital. She reported that there had been mild improvement in visual acuity after treatment with glucocorticoids, but it was brief and transient. Visual acuity was 20/200 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left eye. On the Ishihara color test, only the control plate was identified correctly, a finding that indicated complete color blindness in both eyes. There was mild anisocoria and a trace relative afferent pu-pillary defect in the left eye. The results of external and slit-lamp examinations of the eyes were unchanged. The left optic-nerve disk was pallid; funduscopic examination of both eyes was otherwise normal. The patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation and treatment. On admission, the results of the ophthalmo-logic examination were unchanged from those obtained in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic, and the neurologic examination was normal. Blood levels of folate, thiamine, and copper were normal; anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies were not detected in the blood. Additional imaging studies were performed. Dr. Juliano: MRI of the head, orbits, cervical spine, and thoracic spine was performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material. A T2-weighted image showed mild, asymmetric increase in signal with enhancement in the left optic nerve and equivocal increase in signal without definite abnormal enhancement in the retrobulbar segment of the right optic nerve; there was no evidence of cerebral white-matter lesions or spinal-cord abnormalities. Dr. Srikanth: A lumbar puncture was performed, and the opening pressure was 17 cm of water. Gram’s staining of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed a moderate amount of mononuclear cells; no neutrophils or organisms were identified. Other results of CSF analysis are shown in Table 1. Intravenous glucocorticoids were administered for 3 days, but vision loss persisted. Three days after the lumbar puncture, culture of the CSF showed no growth and cytologic examination of the CSF revealed no malignant cells. On the fifth hospital day, the patient was discharged home. Four days after discharge, the patient was evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital. She reported no improvement in her vision, and the results of the examination were unchanged. A diagnostic test was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,26,nejm-case-2012-26,A 70-Year-Old Woman with Fever and Back Pain,"Dr. Deepa Kumaraiah (Medicine): A 70-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of intermittent fevers of 11 weeks’ duration and new-onset back and leg pain. The patient had reportedly been in her usual health, with diabetes and hypertension, until 11 weeks earlier when subjective fevers and chills developed shortly after she received pneumococcal and tetanus–diphtheria–pertussis vaccinations; episodic diarrhea began after a course of antibiotics. Examination of the stool revealed Campylobacter jejuni. No treatment was given; diarrhea and fevers reportedly resolved. Two weeks before presentation, she began to have low back pain that radiated to her left thigh. She reported no associated trauma or injury. The pain gradually increased, without improvement after acetaminophen, and she had difficulty walking. Her family called emergency medical services personnel. On their arrival, she reported pain at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The blood pressure was 140/90 mm Hg, the pulse 76 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute. She was brought to the emergency department at this hospital. She reported no weakness, sensory loss, bowel or bladder dysfunction, fever, or chills. The patient appeared uncomfortable. The temperature was 36.2°C, and the lower thoracic spine, the lumbar spine, and the lumbar paraspinal muscles were tender to palpation; other vital signs and the remainder of the examination were normal. An electrocardiogram was normal. Radiographs of the thoracic and lumbosacral spine revealed mild degenerative changes without evidence of fracture, compression deformity, or subluxation. She was admitted for observation. Ibuprofen, narcotic analgesia, and diazepam were administered, and physical therapy consultation was obtained. The patient reported a decrease in the level of pain to 4 out of 10, and she was able to ambulate without assistance. Oxycodone, ibuprofen, and a muscle relaxant were prescribed, and she was discharged home, with instructions to follow up with her physician. During the next 6 days, the pain in the low back increased to 10 of 10 and radiated to both knees. Approximately 3 days before admission, the temperature rose to 39.4 to 40.6°C each afternoon, associated with chills, sweats, abdominal pain, and decreased appetite. The patient’s family took her to a health center associated with this hospital, where she reported that the fevers were similar to those she had had in the past in association with malaria. On examination, the temperature was 39.2°C, the blood pressure 184/68 mm Hg, the pulse 102 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while she was breathing ambient air. She appeared uncomfortable lying in bed. There was discomfort in the right lower quadrant, without rebound tenderness. Urinalysis revealed 50 to 100 white cells per high-power field with few bacteria and squamous epithelial cells and was otherwise normal. An electrocardiogram was normal. She was transferred to the emergency department at this hospital. On arrival, additional history was obtained. The patient reported that her fevers had never completely resolved since the onset 11 weeks before and were associated with weight loss of 4.5 kg and dysuria during the previous 2 to 3 months. She had had type 2 (non–insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus for more than 10 years, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, headaches, chronic peripheral edema, vitamin D deficiency, osteoarthritis, and exposure to hepatitis B virus. She had had Helicobacter pylori infection 4 months earlier, which was treated with amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and omepra-zole, and she had had malaria in the past. On initial immigration to this country 13 years earlier, a tuberculin skin test was positive; she was asymptomatic and reportedly did not take iso-niazid because of her age. Medications included atenolol, lisinopril, metformin, simvastatin, diaz-epam, ibuprofen, oxycodone, aspirin, ergocalcif-erol, and calcium. She had no known allergies. The patient had been born in East Africa; when she was in her early 50s, she moved to a refugee camp for 5 years and then immigrated to the United States. Approximately 4 years before admission, she moved to the Middle East, where she consumed unpasteurized camel’s milk; she had returned to New England 5 months before admission and lived with relatives. She did not speak English; her relatives interpreted for her. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She had no known exposures to ticks, pets, or sick contacts. Her children were well. On examination, the temperature was 36.8°C and the blood pressure 150/63 mm Hg; other vital signs were normal. There was tenderness over the lower paraspinal muscles on the right side with palpation, tenderness at the costovertebral angle bilaterally, and no tenderness in the midline along the length of the spine. Deep-tendon reflexes and the remainder of the examination, including straight-leg raising, were normal. Levels of platelets and red-cell indexes were normal, as were serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, total and direct bilirubin, total protein, globulin, lipase, and alkaline phosphatase and tests of renal function; other results are shown in Table 1. Chest radiographs revealed elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, which was new in comparison with studies performed 6 days earlier. Morphine and ceftriaxone were administered. The patient was admitted to this hospital, and respiratory precautions were instituted. On the first day, the temperature rose to 40.0°C and a grade 2/6 systolic murmur was heard at the right upper sternal border; the examination was otherwise unchanged. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis showed degenerative changes of the spine, most prominent at the L5– S1 level, and scattered subcutaneous calcifications in the region of the buttocks but was otherwise normal. T2-weighted images from a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the spine revealed hyperintense signal and enhancement involving the end plates adjacent to the L5–S1 disk space, with fluid in the disk space, enhancement in the paravertebral soft tissues with probable extension into the ventral epidural space at this level, and severe right foraminal stenosis with compression of the exiting right L5 nerve roots. There were also milder degenerative changes at other levels of the lumbar spine. Urine culture grew few colonies of mixed bacteria, and the administration of antimicrobial agents was stopped. Examination of thick and thin smears of peripheral blood showed no organisms, and screening tests for respiratory viruses and antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus were negative. On the third day, the temperature rose to 38.2°C. Induration at the site of a tuberculin skin test measured 10 mm in diameter at 48 hours. Three induced-sputum specimens showed no acid-fast bacilli. CT of the chest revealed multiple non-calcified pulmonary nodules (≤4 mm in diameter), as well as calcified subcarinal lymph nodes, features consistent with previous granulomatous infection. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no evidence of valvular vegetations. Results of serum protein electrophoresis and testing for rheumatoid factor were normal; tests for antibodies to hepatitis C virus were negative, and no Bence Jones proteins were detected in the urine. An interferon-γ–release assay (IGRA), a test to detect the release of interferon-γ in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen, was negative. On the fifth day, a diagnostic result was received.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2011,36,nejm-case-2011-36,A 93-Year-Old Woman with Shortness of Breath and Chest Pain,"Dr. Pooja Agrawal (Emergency Medicine): A 93-year-old woman was seen in the emergency department at this hospital because of chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient had been in her usual state of health, with hypertension and chronic renal insufficiency, until the morning of admission, when she was awakened by stabbing substernal chest pain that radiated to the left shoulder and jaw and was associated with shortness of breath. She called emergency medical services; on evaluation, an electrocardiogram reportedly showed ST-segment elevations. Acetylsalicylic acid was administered orally, and nitroglycerin was given sublingually (three doses). She was brought to the emergency department of this hospital, arriving 3 hours after the onset of chest pain. The patient rated the pain at 7 on a scale of 1 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). She had a history of hypertension, renal-artery stenosis (for which a stent had been placed 2.5 years earlier), chronic renal insufficiency, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypercholesterolemia, cholelithiasis, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and dementia involving poor memory and insight. Adenocarcinoma of the colon 4 years earlier had been treated with a sigmoid colectomy; recovery was complicated by a postoperative myocardial infarction. The patient had had a hysterectomy and cataract surgery in the past. Medications included clopidogrel, amlodipine, atorvastatin, omeprazole, labetalol, clonidine, and acetylsalicylic acid. She was allergic to sulfa drugs; hydrochlorothiazide had caused hyponatremia, and irbesartan had caused kidney dysfunction. She was a widow; she lived with a friend and had assistance in the home from elder services. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her sister had hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and adenomatous colonic polyps; other relatives had had congestive heart failure. On examination, the patient appeared alert and frail; she was oriented to person and season but not to date or day. The temperature was normal, the blood pressure 199/108 mm Hg, the pulse 116 beats per minute and regular, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while she was breathing ambient air. The height was 147.3 cm, and the weight 44.6 kg. The heart sounds were rapid, with a regular rhythm and no murmurs, and there was trace ankle edema bilaterally. The remainder of the examination was normal. The level of cre-atine kinase MB isoenzymes was 10.9 ng per milliliter (reference range, 0.0 to 6.9), creatine kinase 89 U per liter (reference range, 40 to 150), creatine kinase isoen-zymes index 12.2% (reference range, 0.0 to 3.5) and troponin T 0.40 ng per milliliter (reference range, 0.00 to 0.09). Results of other laboratory tests were normal, including complete blood count; plasma levels of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium; and tests of renal function and coagulation. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 119 beats per minute, with ST-segment elevations up to 3 mm in leads V1, V2, and V3 (most prominent in V2) with more subtle ST-segment elevation in leads I and aVL. Q waves were present in leads V2 and V3. A chest radiograph showed low lung volumes, with right basilar subsegmental atelectasis, which was unchanged as compared with a study 11 months earlier. Heparin, eptifibatide, and metoprolol were administered intravenously within 5 minutes after arrival. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2009,01,nejm-case-2009-01,A 57-Year-Old Man with Progressive Cognitive Decline,"Dr. Matthew T. Bianchi (Neurology): A 57-year-old man was transferred to this hospital because of progressive cognitive decline. He had a history of recurrent malignant melanoma of the right conjunctiva and eyelid that was treated at this hospital. Nine days before admission, a nurse from the melanoma clinic who contacted him by telephone for a preappointment interview noted that he was incoherent and unable to answer her questions. Four days later, at a clinic visit, his physician noted that the patient had difficulty understanding the conversation. Options for treatment of the malignant melanoma, including orbital exenteration, were discussed with the patient and his wife. The next morning, at 3 a.m., his wife awoke to find the patient having convulsive movements in bed. The seizure lasted less than 5 minutes, after which he remained unresponsive. Emergency medical services providers were called; on their arrival 10 minutes later, he had regained consciousness but was incontinent of urine, disoriented, and unable to follow commands. He was transported to the emergency department of another hospital. On examination, the patient appeared confused. The vital signs were normal, and the oxygen saturation was 97% while he was breathing ambient air. A lumbar puncture was performed; analysis of the fluid revealed no cells and normal levels of protein and glucose, no organisms were detected on Gram’s and acid-fast staining, and polymerase-chain-reaction testing for JC virus was negative. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain revealed generalized atrophy; there was no evidence of hemorrhage. An electroencephalogram showed diffuse theta-range background slowing but no epileptiform activity. He was admitted to the hospital. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain after the administration of gadolinium showed generalized brain atrophy and diffuse white-matter hyperintensity. Lorazepam, haloperidol, phenytoin, levetiracetam, acyclovir, and ceftriaxone were administered. His mental status deteriorated, and he became intermittently agitated. On the fifth day, he was transferred to this hospital. On further questioning at this hospital, the patient’s wife reported that she had noticed occasional episodes of confusion and disorientation during the previous 5 years. During the previous 2 months, she had noticed a change in his behavior, with more frequent episodes of disorientation and progressive impairment in his memory, including forgetting to switch off electrical appliances and having difficulty making out checks and using the computer. A diagnosis of malignant melanoma of the right eyelid had been made approximately 5 years earlier and was treated with excision; recurrent melanomas on the conjunctiva, lower eyelid, and lacrimal caruncle of the right eye were excised during the next 4 years, most recently 2 months before admission. At that time, CT of the head and chest showed no metastatic lesions. The patient had a history of head trauma and extra-dural hematoma in infancy and had had a left frontoparietal craniotomy, with no apparent residual cognitive deficit. He had emphysema, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression and had undergone bilateral lens implantations. He had hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (diagnosed more than 15 years earlier) and had a serum HCV RNA level of 1.6 million IU per milliliter 1 month before admission. The patient was right-handed, lived with his wife, and had one adult daughter. He smoked cigarettes and drank alcohol socially. In the past, he had abused alcohol and taken cocaine, amphetamines, LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), and marijuana, as well as intravenous heroin, but he had not used illicit drugs for at least 10 years. He had been an average student and had left school at the age of 16 years to enter the workforce. At the time of hospital admission, he worked in an office position, but in past employment, he had been exposed to organic solvents, primarily industrial degreasers. His father died of kidney cancer, and his mother of colon cancer; one brother died at the age of 59 years of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and another brother died at the age of 15 years in a motor vehicle accident. There was no known family history of neurologic disease. He had no known allergies. Medications on admission included metoprolol, haloperidol, lorazepam, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, docusate, levetiracetam, and thiamine. On examination, the patient was disheveled, cachectic, and intermittently agitated. The temperature was 36.8°C, the pulse 107 beats per minute, the blood pressure 112/90 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. He was bald, the right eyelid was scarred, pigmented areas were noted on both irises, the mucous membranes were dry, and several teeth were missing. There were no dysmor-phic features. Breath sounds were decreased at both lung bases. There was clubbing of the fingers, and there were multiple tattoos on the skin. Testing of the cranial nerves, motor and sensory systems, coordination, deep-tendon reflexes, plantar responses, and gait disclosed no abnormalities. There were bilateral grasp responses. He recognized his spouse and his caregivers, but he was not oriented to place or time. Simple attention was markedly impaired. He was restless and distracted and needed to be repeatedly redirected to tasks. He spoke continuously and intelligibly but with verbal perseveration. His speech was a fluent, meaningless stream of words, nonwords, and jargon. He could not name common objects, follow simple verbal commands, read, or write. More detailed cognitive testing was impossible because of deficits in attention and language. A complete blood count was normal, as were levels of serum electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, bilirubin, and troponin T. Coagulation and renal-function tests also were normal. The alkaline phosphatase level was 130 U per liter (reference range, 45 to 115), the aspartate aminotransferase level 54 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 40), and the alanine aminotrans-ferase level 67 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 55). Testing of blood for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus, rapid-plasma-reagin testing, and a paraneoplastic antibody panel were negative. A chest radiograph was normal. On the second hospital day, an electroencephalogram revealed generalized low-amplitude theta-range slowing without superimposed epi-leptiform activity. The patient’s agitation decreased, and haloperidol was stopped. Electrocardiography disclosed first-degree atrioventricular block; metoprolol was stopped, and lisinopril was begun. MRI of the brain after the administration of gadolinium revealed generalized cerebral atrophy, more prominent in the left frontal lobe underlying the craniotomy site, with dilatation of the left lateral ventricle. FLAIR and T2-weighted MRI showed asymmetric hyperintensity within the occipitoparietal and posterior temporal sub-cortical deep and periventricular white matter, extending into the lateral aspects of the cerebral peduncles and sparing the corticospinal tracts; patchy enhancement was seen along the subcor-tical U-fibers in both parietal lobes, with relative sparing of the cerebellum and thinning of the corpus callosum. Magnetic resonance angiography showed no vascular occlusions or stenoses. On the fifth hospital day, a lumbar puncture was performed. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed normal cell counts and normal protein and glucose levels; no organisms were evident on Gram’s or acid-fast bacilli staining. Testing for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi, as well as B. burgdorferi DNA and Venereal Disease Research Laboratory tests were negative. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,01,nejm-case-2019-01,A 34-Year-Old Veteran with Multiple Somatic Symptoms,"Dr. Timothy J. Petersen: A 34-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of headaches, cognitive changes, mood symptoms, flashbacks, chest pain, arm tingling, and gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient had served as a special operations combat medic in the U.S. Army Rangers for 8 years. He served in Operation Iraqi Freedom, completing three tours of duty. The patient had had multiple traumatic injuries and experiences during training and deployment. Nine years before the current evaluation, during a parachute-jump training, he had a syncopal episode. Afterward, he could recall only that he had awoken on the ground while a colleague was packing his parachute. He had 3 weeks of headaches, stiffness of the cervical and thoracic spine, and difficulty sleeping. Eight years before the current evaluation, the patient was hit by an explosive blast wave. Afterward, he reported “cloudy” mentation. While he served as the company medic, he was a first responder in two cases in which a soldier had committed suicide. Three years later, during his third deployment, the patient was involved in a motor vehicle accident as a helmeted back-seat passenger. The armored fighting vehicle rolled approximately 9 m into a canal, and the patient was pinned under several men. He had blunt trauma to the head and reportedly lost consciousness for 20 minutes; he had a concussion and traumatic injuries of the head and face, including a hard-palate fracture. He subsequently had headaches and difficulty eating and breathing because of lip and nose swelling. In the years after that accident, two types of headache persisted. The patient described the first type of headache as bitemporal pain, above the ears, that occurred a few times per week and was pounding in quality, triggered by certain noises or emotional conversations, and associated with nausea; he used rizatriptan for relief. He described the second type of headache as a “sharp, electrical” sensation, generally in the posterior occiput, that was constant and associated with neck pain on turning of the head, sonophobia, photo-phobia, and nausea; he received botulinum toxin injections for temporary relief. After the patient’s third deployment ended, his wife noticed that he placed kitchen items in the wrong location, became lost while grocery shopping, and was unable to recall the birth of his first daughter. The patient expressed difficulty adjusting to a postdeployment routine, which included child care. He mentioned that he missed his level of entrusted responsibility in the Army Rangers platoon. He reported having “deep, lingering pain at deaths of friends and exposures to children in dire circumstances” and “thinking philosophically about death” but did not report suicidal or homicidal ideation. He rarely left the house except for appointments with doctors; he expressed difficulty making friends because he felt “frustration with trivial topics,” and he was self-conscious about being forgetful. Mood swings, headaches, emotional distance, personality changes, irritability, fluctuating appetite with intermittent nausea, and insomnia and poor sleep were also reported. He avoided such places as shopping malls because they made him feel dizzy. He started to consume large quantities of whiskey daily. Between 3 and 5 years before the current evaluation, while the patient was still in the military, he sought medical and psychiatric care on three occasions. During the first evaluation, duloxetine was prescribed, but it resulted in a rash and peeling of the skin. Three years before the current evaluation, he received inpatient treatment at a military hospital, which included psychotherapy sessions and muscle relaxation and breathing exercises. Two years before the current evaluation, various medications — including sumatrip-tan, ibuprofen, prednisone, topiramate, and ami-triptyline — were tried, with varying degrees of success. Twenty-two months before the current evaluation, the patient was honorably discharged from the military, and he moved to New England. Thirteen months before the current evaluation, his condition was assessed by a social worker, psychologist, physical therapist, and neurologist at another hospital. He reported being “constantly on guard” and “easily startled,” as well as having anhedonia, detachment, difficulty concentrating, anorexia, and fatigue. He reported us-ing sarcasm, defensiveness, and intellectualization as coping mechanisms. A review of systems was notable for a reduced ability to move the head and neck to the left and “clicking” with motion of the neck, both of which diminished modestly with physical therapy. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient underwent a 3-month course of outpatient psychotherapy but then stopped because of a lack of connection with his provider. Five months before the current evaluation, the patient reported having flashbacks with associated emesis. The next month, he reported that his previous concussion was “acting up.” He described having a “hazy” feeling, verbal stuttering, and severe headaches, which he rated at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). The headaches lasted for days and were associated with sonophobia and photopho-bia; he used ice and ibuprofen for relief. He also began to have panic attacks in association with recall of memories. He described having a “rush of visions” of traumatic memories from childhood and the military and being “not able to turn them off”; lorazepam was prescribed. Recurrent pain and tingling of the left anterior chest and left anterior arm developed in association with these memories and later occurred independently of the memories. The patient treated himself for these symptoms with fans, cold baths, and benzodiazepines. Two months before the current evaluation, multiple gastrointestinal symptoms developed. The patient had nonbloody, nonbilious emesis every morning, as well as persistent nausea, upper abdominal pain that was worse after eating, loose bowel movements alternating with constipation, difficulty initiating bowel movements, and eructation. He unintentionally lost 9 kg. He received prescriptions for tricyclic antidepressants, ondan-setron, simethicone, and omeprazole for presumed irritable bowel syndrome. The next month, he had panic attacks of increased frequency and intensity and progressive symptoms, including atypical chest discomfort, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and arm tingling. He sought attention in a local emergency department for panic attacks and fear that his heart was “feeling weak.” Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was referred to this hospital; additional history was obtained from his wife. He had a history of obstructive sleep apnea, for which nightly continuous positive airway pressure had been prescribed, and he had undergone photo-refractive keratectomy. A review of systems also revealed intrusive thoughts, hypervigilance, irritability, depressed mood, low energy, a feeling of burdening his family, and palpitations that were associated with anxiety and diffuse myalgia. He had no dizziness, ataxia, vision changes, sensory dysfunction, hallucinations, repetitive behaviors, or focal weakness. He did not drive because of feelings of panic. He wore a hearing aid because of difficulty discriminating speech in the presence of background noise. He used a traction device for treatment of neck strain. The patient’s father had depression, and his mother, father, and paternal uncle each had a history of alcohol and drug use disorders. The patient had been raised by his grandparents. A sister had died in her 20s from bone cancer. The patient lived with his wife and two healthy young children. He had not worked outside the home since his honorable discharge from the military, instead performing child care duties while his wife worked. He had completed 3 years of college; he had thought about additional schooling but felt discouraged because of forgetfulness. The patient had used chewing tobacco in the past but had not used any in 2 years. He consumed up to four caffeinated drinks daily and had only three or four alcoholic drinks monthly, which was a reduction from his past alcohol consumption. He smoked marijuana daily but used no illicit drugs. Medications included nortriptyline, omeprazole, pantoprazole, sucralfate, ondansetron, and as needed, simethicone. On examination, the temperature was 37.1°C, the heart rate 94 beats per minute, the blood pressure 109/74 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 86 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 26.4. The patient was well groomed, alert, cooperative, oriented, and lucid, with coherent speech. He was described as fidgeting, anxious, and irritable. The remainder of the cardiovascular, pulmonary, abdominal, and musculoskeletal examination was normal. A urine toxicology screen was positive for cannabinoids and negative for amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, opiates, and phencyclidine. A diagnosis was made.

Traumatic brain injury with secondary neuro-cognitive disorder. Dr. Petersen: In 2013, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5),4 included PTSD as a separate category in trauma- and stressor-related disorders, whereas the manual had previously included PTSD as an anxiety disorder. According to the current definition, this patient meets diagnostic criteria for a primary diagnosis of PTSD (Table 2). A patient must meet eight DSM-5 criteria for the diagnosis of PTSD to be established. The first criterion is direct exposure or indirect exposure (e.g., involving a family member) to a traumatic event, such as the death of another person or threatened death, a serious injury, or sexual violence. In relation to the traumatic event, the patient must have symptoms in the following four clusters: intrusion (with at least one symptom present), persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the traumatic event (at least one symptom), negative alterations in cognition and mood (at least two symptoms), and marked alterations in arousal and reactivity (at least two symptoms). Symptoms in all four clusters must start after the trauma and persist for at least 1 month. In patients with PTSD, the constellation of symptoms must lead to functional impairment or distress. This patient had difficulty connecting with his family, communicating, and performing activities that required organization skills, such as cooking and shopping. In addition, to establish the diagnosis of PTSD, substance use and other medical conditions must be ruled out. This patient’s consumption of alcohol and marijuana was not likely to explain the extent of his functional impairment or its association with trauma.

After 2 months of discomfort, the patient was evaluated by a rheumatologist at another hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the shoulders was reportedly normal. Piroxicam was prescribed, and glucocorticoid injections to the shoulders were administered. During the next 4 months, arthralgias developed in the fingers and knees. A diagnosis of fibromyalgia was made by the rheumatologist. Naproxen was prescribed at a dose of 250 to 500 mg two or three times daily, as needed, and additional glucocorticoid injections to the shoulders were administered. Six weeks before admission, anorexia, odynophagia, and epigastric pain developed. Two weeks later, the patient began to have episodic anterior pleuritic pain, which was characterized as sharp and was worse when he was in the supine position; he also had intermittent dyspnea and nonproductive cough. He had fatigue that was sometimes severe enough to prevent him from getting out of bed. One week before admission, subjective fevers and increased dyspnea occurred. One day before admission, the patient’s sister thought that the patient appeared weak and ill and took him to the emergency department of a second hospital. Laboratory test results were notable for a white-cell count of 2000 per cubic millimeter (normal range, 4500 to 11,000) and a hematocrit of 21% (normal range, 41 to 53). Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Andrew S. Fox: A posteroanterior chest radiograph showed an enlarged cardiac silhouette, changes consistent with small bilateral pleural effusions, and mild interstitial pulmonary edema (Fig. 1A). Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed small-volume ascites with peritoneal enhancement (Fig. 1B), a moderate-to-large circumferential pericardial effusion, and small bilateral pleural effusions (Fig. 1C). Dr. Schoenfeld: The patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation and treatment. A review of systems was notable for fatigue, mild bilateral joint pain, pleuritic pain, intermittent dyspnea, nonproductive cough, anorexia, odynophagia, an unintentional weight loss of 18 kg during the past year, polyuria, and a pruritic rash on the arms that had some sloughing and spared the hands. He had no night sweats, chills, melena, hematochezia, diarrhea, photosensitivity, dry eyes or mouth, Raynaud’s phenomenon, urinary symp-toms, penile lesion or discharge, orthopnea, or edema. The patient’s medical history was notable for malaria and depression. Medications included bupropion and naproxen as needed. Diphenhydra-mine had caused oral and facial swelling and pruritus. The patient was born and raised in sub-Saharan Africa and had immigrated to New England 18 years earlier; he had not traveled outside the United States in 15 years. He was currently unemployed. He was divorced and had been sexually active with women, most recently 7 months before the current presentation. He lived with his sister and his two young children; one son had had symptoms of an upper respiratory infection 2 weeks earlier. The patient reported that he had had a 7-year period of heavy beer drinking but had been abstinent for almost 20 years; he had smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 12 years but had quit 15 years earlier. There was no history of illicit drug use. There was no family history of heart disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, tuberculosis, autoimmune disease, or cancer. On examination, the temperature was 37.7°C, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the blood pressure 93/57 mm Hg (pulsus paradoxus, 12 mm Hg), the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The height was 173 cm, the weight 54.3 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 18.1. The patient had signs of chronic illness, including cachexia and bitemporal wasting. The jugular venous pressure was 14 cm of water. He had a yellow coating on the tongue but no lesions in the mouth. He had scaling and dry skin on the arms and chest but no overt rash. Diffuse subcentimeter lymph nodes in the cervical chain were palpable, as were larger bilateral axillary lymph nodes. The heart rhythm was tachycardic and distant, and the lungs were clear. There was mild epigastric tenderness, without rebound or guarding. Shoulder abduction was limited to 90 degrees bilaterally, and there was pain on external rotation. The knees were warm, with moderate effusions, and there was pain on knee flexion. The patient had synovitis and tenderness of the wrists and proximal inter-phalangeal joints. The rest of the examination was normal. Results of blood tests for phosphorus, magne-sium, bilirubin, amylase, lipase, and thyrotropin were normal; additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis was notable for yellow, slightly cloudy urine, with 1+ urobilino-gen (normal value, negative), 2+ protein (normal value, negative), 0 to 2 erythrocytes per high-power field (normal range, 0 to 2), and 3 to 5 leukocytes per high-power field (normal range, <10). An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 96 beats per minute, subtle PR-segment depression, and borderline low limb-lead voltage. A chest radiograph showed an enlarged cardiac silhouette and small bilateral pleural effusions. Echocardiography was performed. Dr. Varsha K. Tanguturi: Echocardiography revealed normal left ventricular size and function. There was a moderate-sized pericardial effusion with diffuse fibrin deposition. There was brief right ventricular diastolic inversion without substantial respirophasic variation (i.e., variation from expiration to inspiration) in the intracardiac Doppler-flow velocities. The inferior vena cava was not dilated. Dr. Schoenfeld: Intravenous normal saline and esomeprazole were administered, and the patient was admitted to the cardiology unit of this hospital. On the second day, the patient’s temperature reached 39.1°C. Blood specimens were obtained for culture, and an induced-sputum specimen was obtained for microbiologic studies, including mycobacterial smear and culture. Testing of a nasopharyngeal sample was negative for influenza A and B. Screening tests for HIV types 1 and 2 and HIV p24 antigen, antibodies to Lyme disease, and heterophile antibodies were negative. Serologic testing for IgG antibodies to cytomega-lovirus was positive. A purified protein derivative was planted to assess for a response to Mycobacte-rium tuberculosis antigens. The systolic blood pressure remained within a range of 90 to 100 mm Hg, with the heart rate ranging from 100 to 110 beats per minute; runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia occurred, the longest of which was 28 beats. Intravenous magnesium and amioda-rone were administered. On the third day, the patient’s temperature reached 39.7°C. The systolic blood pressure remained within a range of 90 to 100 mm Hg, and runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia persisted. The prothrombin time was 14.5 seconds (normal range, 11.0 to 14.0), the partial-thrombo-plastin time 36.4 seconds (normal range, 22.0 to 35.0), and the prothrombin-time international normalized ratio 1.1 (normal range, 0.9 to 1.1). Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Fox: CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed enlargement of the bilateral pleural effusions to a moderate size, with loculation of pleural effusions on the right side, as well as enlargement of the pericardial effusion (Fig. 1D). There were enlarged bilateral axillary lymph nodes (Fig. 1E). Dr. Schoenfeld: On the fourth day, the patient’s temperature was 38.8°C. The heart rate increased to 120 beats per minute, and the systolic blood pressure was 80 to 90 mm Hg. Dr. Tanguturi: Repeat echocardiography revealed preserved left ventricular function. There was a large circumferential pericardial effusion (measuring 3 cm); the pericardial effusion was larger than it had been on the echocardiogram obtained 3 days earlier and was causing diastolic inversion of the right ventricular free wall and right atrium (Fig. 2). The presence of right ventricular diastolic inversion suggests increased intrapericardial pressure and a 20% decrease in cardiac output, and the presence of right atrial compression during more than one third of the cardiac cycle is nearly 100% sensitive and specific for tamponade.1 There was diffuse fibrin deposition along the visceral pericardium, a finding suggestive of chronicity. There was respiro-phasic variation of 40% in the Doppler-flow velocities across the mitral valve. Respirophasic variation of at least 30% in the Doppler-flow velocities across the mitral valve is considered to be suggestive of cardiac tamponade caused by increased filling of the right ventricle during inspiration, with compression of the right ventricular free wall and subsequent decreased filling of the left ventricle.1 There was new dilatation of the inferior vena cava without compression during inspiration, a finding suggestive of elevated pressures on the right side of the heart. Catheterization of the right side of the heart revealed elevation and equalization of diastolic pressures, with a right atrial pressure of 20 mm Hg, a right ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 24 mm Hg, and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 20 mm Hg; these findings are consistent with cardiac tamponade. Pericardio-centesis was notable for retrieval of 570 ml of bloody fluid, which reduced the intrapericardial pressure from 18 mm Hg to 3 mm Hg. Dr. Schoenfeld: Gram’s staining of the pericar-dial fluid revealed abundant neutrophils and very few mononuclear cells but no organisms. The glucose level was 77 mg per deciliter (4.3 mmol per liter), the lactate dehydrogenase level 1487 U per liter, and the total protein level 4.0 g per deciliter. The red-cell count was 18,000 per cubic millimeter, and the nucleated-cell count 9439 per cubic millimeter, 93% of which were neutro-phils. Microbiologic culture of the pericardial fluid was also performed. Cytologic examination of the pericardial fluid for malignant cells was negative, as were additional blood tests, including an interferon-γ release assay for tuberculosis and tests for rheumatoid factor, antitreponemal antibodies, antibodies to hepatitis B virus, and IgM antibodies to parvovirus. Diagnostic test results were received, and additional diagnostic tests were performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2009,17,nejm-case-2009-17,A 30-Year-Old Man with Progressive Neurologic Deficits,"Dr. Katharina Busl (Neurology): A 30-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of progressive neurologic deficits. Approximately 1 year before this admission, he began to have intermittent headaches and the gradual onset of difficulty with word finding and writing, without changes in cognition, memory or personality, or sensorimotor deficits. Ten months before this admission, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, performed after the administration of gadolinium, showed enhancement of the genu and rostrum of the corpus callosum, and T2-weighted signal abnormality in the white matter and cortex of the left frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes. He was admitted at that time to the neurology service of this hospital. When the patient was 26 years old, fever, fatigue, painful oral and genital ulcers, arthralgias, and erythematous nodular skin lesions on the shins had developed. He had been treated with immunosuppressive agents, including colchicine, mycophe-nolate mofetil, and prednisone. Oral ulcers persisted, and two episodes of scleral injection without ocular symptoms occurred. Biopsy specimens of cutaneous lesions obtained approximately 2 years after his initial presentation revealed a superficial and deep lymphocytic infiltrate, perineural inflammation, mucin deposition, and lymphocytic vasculitis. Testing for antinuclear antibodies and hepatitis B and C virus infection was negative. Approximately 6 months before the onset of neuro-logic symptoms, methotrexate (12.5 mg weekly) was begun and increased to 25 mg weekly over a period of 3 to 4 months; his skin lesions and arthritis improved, and the dose of prednisone was reduced. The patient was of Korean ancestry, had been born in the United States, worked in an office, and was married with no children. He did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. His mother had hypertension and his father and brother were well. There was no family history of neuro-logic or rheumatologic disease. On examination during that admission, his speech was fluent with occasional circumlocution and semantic paraphasic errors, there was flattening of the right nasolabial fold, reflexes were 2 out of 4 throughout, and the plantar responses were flexor; the remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory testing revealed a white-cell count of 13,600 cells per cubic millimeter (96% neutrophils, 3% lympho-cytes, and 1% monocytes). Results of other routine hematologic tests; tests of coagulation, renal function, and liver function; the level of C-reactive protein; electrolyte levels; and a toxicology screen were normal. Lumbar puncture was performed; results of the cerebrospinal fluid analysis are shown in Table 1. No oligoclonal bands or malignant cells were seen, and flow cytometry disclosed no abnormal cells; cultures of the cerebrospinal fluid and blood and testing for infectious agents (including cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, JC virus, and herpes simplex virus [HSV] type 1 and type 2 by polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) and for cryptococcal antigen, Lyme antibody, and syphilis were negative. Computed tomography (CT) of the head with venography showed no evidence of venous obstruction. Treatment with infliximab (5 mg per kilogram of body weight every 4 weeks for three doses, and every 6 weeks thereafter) was begun; within 1 month after the first dose, language difficulties resolved and cerebrospinal fluid findings (Table 1) and the signal abnormalities seen on T2-weighted MRI of the brain improved. However, 4 weeks after the fourth dose and 5.5 months before this admission, a generalized tonic–clonic seizure occurred, followed by status epilepticus and a temperature of 40°C; he was readmitted to this hospital. Anti-epileptic agents and broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents were administered, and the seizure activity abated. CT and MRI of the brain after the administration of contrast material showed new areas of abnormal T2-weighted signal intensity in both temporal lobes and the left frontal lobe that involved white and gray matter. Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed diffuse slowing of delta and theta waves, with no spikes or sharp-wave activity. Tests for the human immunodeficiency virus, antinuclear antibodies, antibodies to double-stranded DNA, and antibodies to the Ro, La, Sm, and U1-RNP nuclear antigens were negative. Results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis are shown in Table 1. All cultures were sterile, and antibiotics were discontinued. Testing of cerebrospinal fluid for varicella–zoster virus, human herpesvirus 6, and enterovirus with the use of PCR was negative. Another dose of infliximab was administered, and the patient was discharged on the seventh day with mild residual aphasia and taking valproic acid and phenytoin. After the patient was discharged, infliximab and methotrexate were discontinued, and therapy with pegylated interferon alfa was initiated. Valproic acid and phenytoin were discontinued because of a skin rash, and oxcarbazepine was begun. Three months before admission, seizures and fevers recurred and right hemiparesis developed. His language, affect, mood, cognitive function, behavior, and ability to interact deteriorated, and he was unable to work. MRI of the brain 3 weeks before admission revealed new white-matter changes in the internal capsule on the right, increased multifocal left hemispheric white-matter changes, stable encephalomalacia of the left frontal and temporal lobes, and diffuse cerebral volume loss. EEG showed slowing in the left cerebral hemisphere and no epileptiform activity. On examination in the neurology clinic 4 days before admission, there was minimal spontaneous speech and interaction, impaired comprehension, generalized hypokinesis, a spastic gait with circumduction of the right leg and absence of normal right arm swing, mild pronator drift with the arms outstretched, and bilateral grasp reflexes. Lumbar puncture was repeated. The opening pressure was 23 cm of water and testing for infectious agents was negative; other results are shown in Table 1. On the day of admission, the patient fell at home and was unable to arise. Emergency medical services found him conscious; he was admitted to another hospital. Later that evening, he was found apneic and unarousable, without visible seizure activity. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was begun and the trachea was intubated; when electrocardiographic leads were placed, a QRS complex was found. He was transferred to this hospital. Medications on admission included oxcarbazepine and prednisone daily, trimetho-prim–sulfamethoxazole every other day, and alen-dronate and interferon alfa weekly. On examination, vital signs were normal, with ventilated respirations. The patient’s eyes opened to sternal rub and tracked to the right and partially to the left, and the oculocephalic reflex was present. There was no spontaneous movement of the limbs. Myoclonus occurred after noxious stimuli to the legs; reflexes were brisk, and the plantar responses were flexor. MRI of the brain and cervical spine after the administration of gadolinium showed progression of previous signal abnormalities seen on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images, new areas of patchy enhancement in the left temporal lobe, and diffuse cord enhancement. Transthoracicechocar-diography showed no valvular vegetations or in-tracardiac thrombus. CT of the chest revealed patchy consolidation of the posterior segment of the right upper lobe and consolidation of the right lower lobe. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents were administered. Therapy with interferon alfa was discontinued. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2020,04,nejm-case-2020-04,A 52-Year-Old Woman with Seizure Disorder and Wide-Complex Tachycardia,"Dr. Nino Mihatov: A 52-year-old woman was evaluated for a new wide-complex tachycardia that developed while she was hospitalized for the management of seizures. Five days before the development of tachycardia, the patient had been admitted to this hospital with tonic–clonic seizure activity. Six days before the current admission, she had been discharged from this hospital after a prolonged hospitalization in the neurosciences intensive care unit (ICU) for refractory status epilepticus. At the time of discharge, she was transferred to a skilled nursing facility for transitional care. Two days after transfer, she had a fall with a reportedly mild head injury; no further evaluation was done. On the morning of the current admission, the patient had a focal seizure at the skilled nursing facility and diazepam was administered intravenously. After she had another seizure, emergency medical services were contacted. She had a total of seven tonic–clonic seizures, each of which lasted up to 90 seconds. On arrival of emergency medical services, the trachea was intubated and then the patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital. After evaluation in the emergency department, the patient was admitted to the neurosciences ICU. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained on admission (Fig. 1A). Propofol, midazolam, and phenobarbital were administered intravenously, and clobazam, felbamate, lacosamide, levetiracetam, and oxcarbazepine were administered through an orogastric tube. Computed tomography of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no intracranial abnormality. Electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring showed ongoing seizure activity; on the second day, boluses of pentobarbital were administered intravenously. Central venous and arterial catheters were placed so that norepinephrine could be administered to maintain the mean arterial pressure. On the third day, a transient junctional cardiac rhythm was noted, and the administration of pentobarbital boluses was stopped. Periods of sinus bradycardia and ventricular bigeminy were subsequently noted. Dr. Karen A. Buch: On the fourth day, positron-emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head were performed. There were ill-defined subcortical and cortical hyperintensities in the left occipital lobe on T2-weighted MRI, which corresponded to an area of 18F-fluorode-oxyglucose avidity seen on previous PET (Fig. 2). Dr. Mihatov: On the fifth day, ECG abnormalities were noted (Fig. 1B). Late that evening, the temperature was 38.4°C and additional norepi-nephrine was given. Four hours later, P waves were thought to be absent on telemetric monitoring (Fig. 1C). In addition, the QRS complex was noted to be wide, and urgent cardiology consultation was obtained (Fig. 1D). The patient’s medical history was notable for seizure disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and bipolar disorder. Her admission to the neurosciences ICU of this hospital for refractory status epilepticus had begun 3 months earlier. During that admission, PET of the head and EEG suggested a causative focus in the left occipital lobe; other evaluation (a paraneoplastic antibody panel, assessment for infection, lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid analysis, toxi-cologic screening, and testing for other antibodies, including antinuclear antibodies) was unrevealing. Tracheostomy and gastrostomy were performed as part of the prolonged ICU stay, during which deep sedation was administered to suppress seizure activity. The patient underwent trials of multiple antiepileptic medications: phe-nytoin caused bradycardia and ventricular bi-geminy, and valproic acid was discontinued because of elevated aminotransferase and ammonia levels. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was performed, and seizures were ultimately controlled with a combination of clobazam, felbamate, lacosamide, levetiracetam, and oxcarbazepine. Medications that the patient had been receiving immediately before the current hospitalization included clobazam, felbamate, fluoxetine, lacosamide, levetiracetam, nortriptyline, oxcar-bazepine, prazosin, and folic acid, as well as diazepam and quetiapine as needed. There were no other known adverse reactions to medications. Medications that the patient was receiving at the time of the cardiology consultation included intravenous infusions of propofol, midazolam, and pentobarbital; intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin–tazobactam; subcutaneous enoxapa-rin injection; and enteral clobazam, felbamate, fluoxetine, lacosamide, levetiracetam, oxcarbaze-pine, folic acid, senna, polyethylene glycol, and multivitamins. The patient had been hospitalized nearly continuously for the previous 4 months. She had two children. She had smoked 1 pack of cigarettes weekly for 20 years and had previously consumed alcohol heavily; she also had previously used nonprescribed benzodiazepines. The family history was negative for neurologic and cardiac disease. On examination, the patient was intubated, sedated, and unresponsive. The temperature was 37.6°C, the heart rate 98 beats per minute, the blood pressure 106/56 mm Hg while she was receiving norepinephrine, and the oxygen saturation 99% while she was receiving pressure-controlled mechanical ventilation at a rate of 18 breaths per minute (fraction of inspired oxygen, 0.60; inspiratory pressure, 12 cm of water; expi-ratory pressure, 10 cm of water). The pupils were symmetric and sluggish. Further assessment of neurologic function was limited. The heart sounds were distant, and there was no detectable murmur. Bowel sounds were present. The arms and legs were cool. Blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, ammonia, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and triglyceride were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Additional ECGs showed a wide-QRS-complex rhythm of uncertain mechanism. A bedside cardiac ultrasound examination showed diffuse global hypokinesis of the left ventricle. A diagnosis and management decisions were made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,30,nejm-case-2012-30,"A 54-Year-Old Woman with HIV Infection, Dyspnea, and Chest Pain","A 54-year-old woman with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was admitted to this hospital because of dyspnea and chest pain. The patient had been in her usual health until approximately 10 days before admission, when episodes of increasing dyspnea on exertion developed. Approximately 1 hour before presentation, substernal chest pain developed during sexual intercourse, associated with dyspnea, nausea, and diaphoresis. She came to the emergency department at this hospital. The patient reported that the pain felt as though someone were sitting on her chest; it also radiated to her neck, and she rated it at 7 to 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. Shortly after arrival, the pain resolved spontaneously. Eighteen years earlier, diagnoses of HIV infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were made. During the intervening years, multiple anti-retroviral medications had been administered. The patient had initially been treated with zidovudine and lamivudine; indinavir was added when it became available. Subsequent antiretroviral agents included stavudine, didanosine, hydroxy-urea, nelfinavir, saquinavir, and for a short time, abacavir and nevirapine. However, she had persistent low-level viremia on these regimens. Approximately 14 months before presentation, the antiretroviral regimen was changed to tenofovir, emtri-citabine, and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir. For the 12 months before this presentation, the patient’s plasma HIV type 1 RNA level had been undetectable. Her CD4+ T-cell count increased from 264 per cubic millimeter 19 months before admission to 614 per cubic millimeter just before admission (reference range, 348 to 1456). The patient had had bacterial pneumonia, thrush, malassezia folliculitis (formerly known as pityrosporum folliculitis), molluscum contagiosum of the face, and herpes zoster, as well as oral hairy leukoplakia, chronic lymphocytic meningitis of unknown origin, pseudotumor cerebri, osteoporosis, and cervical dyspla-sia. She had had peripheral neuropathy and lipodystrophy, including facial lipoat-rophy, in association with the antiretroviral therapy. She also had had dyslipidemia for many years, for which she had declined treatment; 1 year earlier, the cholesterol level had been 217 mg per deciliter (5.61 mmol per liter; desired reference range, <200 mg per deciliter [5.17 mmol per liter]), the triglyceride level 278 mg per deciliter (3.14 mmol per liter; reference range, 40 to 150 mg per deciliter [0.45 to 1.69 mmol per liter]), the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level 29 mg per deciliter (0.75 mmol per liter; reference range, 32 to 100 mg per deciliter [0.83 to 2.59 mmol per liter]), and the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level 132 mg per deciliter (3.41 mmol per liter; desired reference range, <130 mg per deciliter [3.36 mmol per liter]). She also had a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (with an HCV RNA level >700,000 IU per milliliter 2 months before this presentation) and a remote history of the use of illicit injection drugs. Medications included ritonavir-boosted lopinavir, a combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir, acetazolamide, fluconazole, naproxen, gabapentin, nortriptyline, calcium phosphate with cholecalciferol, trazo-done, a transdermal lidocaine patch (5%), and fexofenadine hydrochloride. Sulfa drugs had caused cheilitis. The patient was of Mediterranean ancestry and worked in a service industry. She drank alcohol occasionally, had stopped smoking 4 years earlier, and had discontinued the use of illicit injection drugs more than 15 years earlier. Her mother had hypertension and arthritis and had had a myocardial infarction in her 70s and a stroke; her father and brother had had myocardial infarctions in their 50s; her father, brother, and a sister had hyperlipidemia; and an uncle and cousin had colon cancer. On examination, the patient was in mild distress. The vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. She had facial atrophy. There were mild crackles in the lung bases, and the remainder of the examination was normal. The white-cell count was 12,100 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), with a normal differential count, and the blood potassium level was 3.2 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.4 to 4.8), the carbon dioxide level 21.1 mmol per liter (reference range, 23.0 to 31.9), and the phosphorus level 2.0 mg per deciliter (0.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 2.6 to 4.5 mg per deciliter [0.8 to 1.5 mmol per liter]); screening tests for creatine kinase isoenzymes and troponin I were negative. Results of coagulation and renal-function tests were normal, as were levels of other electrolytes and calcium. A chest radiograph showed minimal atelectasis or scarring at the left lung base, without evidence of focal pneumonia. The heart and mediastinum were normal. The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 60 beats per minute, with premature atrial complexes and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes (Fig. 1A). Within 18 minutes after the ECG had been obtained, severe chest pain recurred; a repeat ECG showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 54 beats per minute, with ST-segment elevation (≤5 mm) in leads II, III, aVF, V5, and V6 and ST-segment depression (≤5 mm) in leads I, aVR, aVL, V1, V2, and V3 (Fig. 1B). The patient’s chest pain resolved spontaneously. Aspirin, heparin, eptifibatide, and metoprolol were administered. Subsequent ECGs showed normalization of ST segments, followed by transient ST-segment elevations in the absence of pain. A diagnostic test was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2009,40,nejm-case-2009-40,A 29-Year-Old Man with Fever and Respiratory Failure,"Dr. Wilson Tak-Yu Kwong (Medicine): A 29-year-old man was admitted in July 2009 to the critical care unit of this hospital because of fever and respiratory failure. The patient had been well until 9 days earlier, when a nonproductive cough and myalgias in his legs developed. One week before admission, he had a temperature of 39.4°C, associated with headache. During the next week, sore throat and nasal congestion developed, the cough became productive of clear sputum, and he noted mild chest pain under his ribs during inspiration. Four days before admission, he was seen at the emergency department of another hospital. He did not have neck pain or photophobia. He reported finding a tick on his scalp 1 month earlier. On examination, he appeared in mild distress. The temperature was 38.2°C and the pulse 106 beats per minute; the remainder of the examination was normal. A rapid test of a specimen from a buccal swab was negative for influenza A and B antigens, and no parasites were seen on a peripheral-blood smear; other test results are shown in Table 1. Acetaminophen, ketorolac, and ceftriaxone were administered, and normal saline was infused. Doxycycline was prescribed, and he was discharged. The patient returned the next afternoon because of persistent fever, cough, myalgias, low back pain, and new scrotal pain. The temperature was 39.0°C, and the other vital signs were normal. There were rhonchi in the left lower lung field, and the remainder of the examination was normal. A test for Lyme disease, sent the day before, was negative. Other test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radio-graph showed incomplete segmental consolidation of the apical posterior segment of the right upper lobe and right hilar prominence, features suggestive of pneumonia and lymphadenopathy, respectively. Levofloxacin was prescribed, and he was sent home. During the next 2 days, nausea and vomiting developed, with blood-tinged emesis. One day before admission to this hospital, the patient returned to the other hospital. The temperature was 38.6°C, the blood pressure 135/70 mm Hg, the pulse 113 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 34 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 88% while he was breathing 4 liters of oxygen by nasal can-nula. A chest radiograph revealed progression of the process in the right upper lobe and patchy air-space disease in the right lower lobe and the middle and lower lobes on the left side. Nucleic acid testing for Babesia mi-croti and Anaplasma phagocytophilum and testing for serum antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi, sent 3 days earlier, were negative. A rapid screening test for pharyngitis due to group A streptococcus and review of a blood smear for parasites were negative; other results are shown in Table 1. He was admitted to the hospital. Doxycycline, levofloxacin, gentamicin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, ondansetron, guaifenesin–codeine cough syrup, and ranitidine were administered. Respiratory distress worsened. Testing for antibodies to Francisella tularensis was negative. Approximately 14 hours after admission, he was transferred to this hospital by helicopter and admitted to the critical care unit. The patient reported transient arthralgias in his ankles and knees, which had resolved; he had not had rash, lymphadenopathy, visual symptoms, diarrhea, dysuria, hematuria, or bruising. He had been well before the illness. He lived with his wife in a rural area in southern New England that has a high rate of tickborne illness. Two weeks earlier, he had been exposed to a child with an upper respiratory infection who had been visiting from the southeastern United States; there were no other exposures to ill persons and no recent travel. He worked indoors and outdoors, and except for the tick, he had no recent history of insect bites or exposure to animals. He had swum in the ocean but not in fresh water, and he had cleaned fish 2 weeks earlier. He did not drink alcohol, smoke, or use illicit drugs. On examination, he appeared ill and dyspneic. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 26.6. The temperature was 37.3°C, the blood pressure 119/68 mm Hg, the mean arterial pressure 93 mm Hg, the pulse 108 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 29 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 92 to 95% while he was breathing 50% inspired oxygen. There were rhonchi in both lung bases and occasional wheezes; the remainder of the examination was normal. Tests for tularemia agglutination, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus, heterophile antibodies, and antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus and B. burgdorferi were negative, as was nucleic acid testing for anaplasma and ehrlichia. Multi-ple tests of nasopharyngeal secretions for influenza viruses, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus and tests of the urine for legionella and histoplasma antigens were negative. Testing for antibodies to toxo-plasma was suggestive of past infection. No malarial or babesial forms were seen on peripheral-blood smears. Cultures of specimens of blood, urine, and sputum were sterile. Other results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Urinalysis revealed clear yellow urine with a pH of 5.5, a specific gravity of 1.005, 1+ ketones, 2+ blood, 1+ albumin, and 0 to 2 red cells and 3 to 5 white cells per high-power field. A chest radiograph showed low lung volumes, with air-space disease in the right upper and middle lung and the left lower lung and elevation of the right minor fissure, features consistent with multifocal pneumonia. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and was otherwise normal. Oral levofloxacin; intravenous vancomycin, gentamicin, and doxy-cycline; and oral oseltamivir (150 mg twice daily) were administered. During the first 6 hours, dyspnea and respiratory distress worsened; the respiratory rate was 24 to 26 breaths per minute, with 85 to 90% oxygen saturation while he was breathing 100% oxygen through a face mask that prevents re-breathing. Nine hours after arrival, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, without the administration of contrast material, showed extensive bilateral multifocal asymmetric consolidation involving all lobes, trace pleural effusion on the right, and multiple enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes (up to 1.3 cm in diameter). Within 18 hours after arrival, tachypnea increased further; the partial pressure of oxygen was 58 mm Hg while he was breathing high-flow oxygen, and the trachea was intubated. The partial pressure of oxygen rose to 83 mm Hg while the patient was being ventilated with 100% oxygen. A central venous catheter was placed, a feeding tube inserted, and parenteral nutrition begun. The maximum temperature was 39.4°C. On the second day, hypoxemia (Table 2) and renal failure (Table 1) developed and urine output fell to 20 to 30 ml per hour. Transthoracic echocardiography showed an ejection fraction of 50% and was otherwise normal. Microscopical examination of the urine sediment revealed white-cell casts and granular casts, with tubular cells and nondysmorphic red cells. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration was begun, complicated by catheter-related thrombosis. Heparin was administered. On the third day, a test for antinuclear antibodies was positive at a dilution of 1:40, in a speckled pattern, and negative at dilutions of 1:80 and 1:160 (reference range, negative at 1:40 and 1:160); a test for antibodies to double-stranded DNA was negative; and levels of lactic acid, complement (C3 and C4), and methemo-globin were normal. Other laboratory data are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Hypotension developed, with a mean systemic arterial pressure between 40 mm Hg and 50 mm Hg; pressors were administered, methylprednisolone was added, and heparin was discontinued. On the evening of the third day, the right pupil became eccentric, irregular, and dilated to 8 mm in diameter, without reactivity to light; the left pupil was round, 5 mm in diameter, and reactive to light to 3 mm, and there was no papilledema on funduscopic examination. The patient was considered too unstable for imaging studies of the brain to be obtained. Hypertonic saline, mannitol, and ceftriaxone were administered. On the sixth day, a diagnostic-test result was received.

Carpenter (Infectious Diseases): A 30-year-old man was seen in the emergency room at this hospital in January 2011 because of diarrhea. The patient had been well 5 days earlier, when he traveled to a resort in the Dominican Republic for a social event. On his fourth day in the Dominican Republic, 2 days before this presentation, he flew back to the United States, arriving at 1 a.m. the day before presentation. Four hours later, he was awakened by the urge to defecate, and he had watery diarrhea. He reported having approximately 12 watery bowel movements during the next 35 hours. He consumed chicken broth and took bismuth solution, without improvement. The night before this presentation, relatives informed him that 13 other attendees of the event had diarrhea. On the day of this presentation, he noted that stool frequency and volume were decreasing. He took a combination of ampicillin and sulbactam (375 mg) orally, which he had obtained in South America. He called the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and was referred to the emergency department at this hospital. The patient reported no fever, nausea, vomiting, or blood in the stool. He had previously been healthy, was taking no other medications, and had no known allergies. He was born in Venezuela and had moved to the United States 18 months earlier. He lived with his wife, with whom he was monogamous, and attended school. He drank alcohol in moderation and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. His wife, who had also attended the event, was well. On examination, the vital signs were normal, with no orthostatic changes, and the mucous membranes were moist; the remainder of the examination was also normal. The stool was bright green and watery.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,40,nejm-case-2019-40,A 26-Year-Old Returning Traveler with Headache,"Dr. Marcus T. Altman (Medicine): A 26-year-old woman with a history of migraines was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital during the winter because of headache. Three weeks before this presentation, the patient had traveled with her family to Europe for vacation. Nineteen days before this presentation, she visited a mountainous region, where she stayed in a mountain cabin and spent time outdoors in the snow. The cabin was located at an altitude above 3400 m. While in the mountains, she struck her head during a low-velocity sledding accident, after which she had a headache that lasted several hours and resolved spontaneously. She also had had mild chills and cough that she had attributed to spending time in cold weather. Eight days before this presentation, a severe headache, which the patient described as the worst headache of her life, developed suddenly while she was eating dinner. The pain, located in the bitemporal regions and the occiput, was associated with fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Unlike the patient’s typical migraine headaches, the headache did not abate with either acetaminophen or naproxen therapy. Five days before this presentation, neck stiffness and decreased range of motion in the neck developed. The patient was evaluated at a local emergency department, where she received a diagnosis of recurrent migraine; intravenous fluid and oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs were administered. She was able to continue traveling with her family, but severe headache persisted, which prompted her to return early to the United States. One day before this presentation, the patient arrived at the Boston airport and was taken to the emergency department of another hospital. She reported ongoing severe headache and sensitivity to light and noise and a 1-week history of intermittent fever, chills, and night sweats, as well as constipation that had lasted several days. On examination, the temperature was 37°C, the pulse 90 beats per minute, the blood pressure 119/83 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was alert, awake, and appeared comfortable. The neck was supple, with full range of motion. No cervical lymphadenopathy or neurologic abnormalities were noted. After intravenous ketorolac, diphenhydramine, and meto-clopramide were administered, there was a moderate decrease in the headache pain. Oral acetaminophen and ibuprofen were subsequently prescribed, and she was discharged home with instructions to contact her primary care physician if her symptoms did not resolve. The next morning, the patient awoke with ongoing severe headache, nausea, and vomiting and presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. There was no weight loss, sore throat, shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, dysuria, rash, or mucocutaneous ulcers. Family members who had traveled with her had not had similar symptoms. The patient had had varicella virus infection in childhood. She was originally from South America but had immigrated to the United States more than 15 years earlier. She was married, lived with her husband in a suburban region of New England, and worked in the health care industry. She was monogamous and reported no history of sexually transmitted illnesses. Vaccinations were up to date, and she had no known medication allergies. She had visited Canada and Mexico the year before presentation but reported no other travel in the preceding 3 years. She had a healthy dog. She had seen evidence of rodents around the mountain cabin where she stayed while traveling in Europe but otherwise had no known animal exposures or tick bites. She drank alcohol in moderation and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. Her mother and father were healthy, and no other family members were ill. On examination, the patient was alert, was able to answer questions, and appeared comfortable. The temperature was 36.4°C, the pulse 91 beats per minute, the blood pressure 133/78 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. There was full range of motion in the neck, although flexion elicited mild pain in the posterior cervical region. No oropharyngeal ulcers or rashes were noted. The remainder of the examination was normal. Levels of electrolytes and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and thyrotropin. Blood tests for antinuclear antibodies and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. Complement levels (C3 and C4) were normal. A urine test for beta human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. A test for heterophile antibodies was negative, as was a screening assay for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and type 2 (HIV-2) antibodies and HIV-1 p24 antigen; HIV-1 RNA was not detected in the blood. Urinalysis revealed 1+ leukocyte esterase, 2+ blood, 1+ ketones, a pH of 7.0, and a specific gravity of 1.019; there were no red cells or white cells. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. McKinley Glover: Computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the head and neck revealed no intracranial hemorrhage, infarction, or mass lesion; arterial and venous vasculature appeared normal, with no stenosis. Multiple cervical lymph nodes were mildly enlarged but otherwise unremarkable in appearance, findings that were suggestive of reactive nodes (Fig. 1). Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed no abnormal parenchymal, leptomeningeal, or pachymenin-geal enhancement or infarction. Radiography of the chest was normal. Dr. Altman: A lumbar puncture was performed. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was cloudy and colorless; Gram’s staining revealed abundant mononuclear cells and no organisms. There were 1422 total nucleated cells per microliter, of which 85% were lymphocytes. Nucleic acid testing for herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA was negative; additional results of the CSF analysis are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were obtained. Intravenous vancomycin, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, and ampicillin were administered, as were intravenous fluid, magnesium, diphenhydramine, magnesium, and metoclopramide. The patient was admitted to this hospital, and additional test results were received. Nucleic acid testing for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus was negative, as were tests of a nasopharyngeal swab for human meta-pneumovirus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus antigens. Blood tests for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi and syphilis were nonreactive, and tests for 1,3-β-d-glucan and serum cryptococcal antigen were negative. Severe headache continued, and intravenous ketorolac and hydromor-phone were administered for pain. A diagnostic test result was received.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2014,35,nejm-case-2014-35,"A 31-Year-Old Woman with Fevers, Chest Pain, and a History of HCV Infection and Substance-Use Disorder","Dr. Dan P. Ly (Medicine): A 31-year-old woman with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and substance-use disorder was admitted to this hospital because of fever, dyspnea, and chest pain. The patient had been in her usual state of health until approximately 10 days before admission, when she reportedly had a high fever that resolved after 2 days. Six days before admission and daily thereafter, her temperature rose as high as 40.3°C, with associated chills, rigors, diffuse urticaria, and pain in the chest, low back, and knees. On the evening before admission, the temperature was reportedly 38.9°C after the administration of ibuprofen. The next afternoon, she came to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. The patient had been using injection drugs, including heroin and cocaine, since 14 years of age and had most recently used them on the day before admission. She had participated in several addiction treatment programs in the past, including a methadone maintenance program. She had a history of HCV infection (diagnosed at 15 years of age), anxiety, axillary hyperhidrosis, cholelithiasis, and vasomotor rhinitis. She had had multiple skin abscesses on her hands, arms, legs, and back, some of which had required incision and drainage; at different times, cultures of the abscesses had grown Enterobacter cloacae and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, and 8 months earlier, a culture had grown methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. She also had had pneumonia, sinusitis, cystitis, pyelonephritis, back pain, and superficial thrombophlebitis of the left leg. Medications were methadone, which she had acquired herself and taken the previous day, and ibuprofen. She had received the hepatitis B vaccine in the past. She reported being allergic to buprenorphine and naloxone in combination, which had caused withdrawal symptoms in the past. She lived with a roommate and had previously been homeless. She worked with animals. She smoked cigarettes and infrequently drank alcohol. She had traveled to Mexico the previous year. Her sister had thyroid disease; her parents were well. On examination, the patient was alert and fully oriented. The temperature was 37.1°C, the blood pressure 105/58 mm Hg, the pulse 111 beats per minute, the re-spiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. There were scattered focal crackles in the lungs. The heart sounds were normal, with an intermittent soft murmur at the left lower sternal border that was not augmented on inspiration. Inguinal lymphadenopathy was noted, as well as marks on the arms, legs, and femoral regions that were consistent with intravenous drug administration, without evidence of abscesses or infection. Both knees were warm, and there was a small effusion on the medial aspect of the right knee, with mild tenderness, normal range of motion, and no erythema. The spine was tender between the T12 and the L3 vertebrae, without paraspinal discomfort. The remainder of the examination was normal. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 109 beats per minute and was otherwise normal. Dr. Brian B. Ghoshhajra: Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs showed low inspiratory volumes and multiple, bilateral, ill-defined nodular opacities, measuring up to approximately 1 cm in greatest dimension, throughout the right lung and left apex (Fig. 1A). The cardiomediastinal silhouette was slightly enlarged, but there were no pleural or pericardial effusions. The findings raised concern about possible septic pulmonary embolism.1 Computed tomography (CT) of the chest was recommended. Dr. Ly: The patient was admitted to this hospital. Multiple attempts at peripheral intravenous access were made, with transient success. Blood specimens were obtained for laboratory analysis. The platelet count and prothrombin-time international normalized ratio were normal, as were levels of sodium, chloride, carbon dioxide, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, urea nitrogen, glucose, total protein, globulin, direct and total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotrans-ferase, and lactic acid and the plasma anion gap. Results of testing for urinary human chorionic gonadotropin were negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed clear yellow urine, with a specific gravity of 1.020, a pH of 6.0, trace ketones and albumin, 2+ urobilino-gen, and 1+ bilirubin. Three sets of blood cultures were obtained over a 46-minute period from different sites. Dr. Ghoshhajra: Ten hours after the patient’s presentation to the emergency department, CT of the chest was performed without the administration of contrast material (because of difficulty obtaining intravenous access). There were multiple thick-walled nodular opacities throughout both lungs, many of which had central cavitation that was suggestive of septic emboli,2 as well as more confluent consolidative opacities in the dependent right lower lobe. The largest opacity measured 3.7 cm by 2.3 cm and was located in the right upper lobe along the major fissure. There was also bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (Fig. 1B). Dr. Ly: Methadone was administered orally. Twelve hours after the patient’s presentation, an intravenous catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein. Cefepime, vancomycin, normal saline, and potassium chloride were administered intravenously. Diagnostic test results were obtained, and management decisions were made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2018,16,nejm-case-2018-16,"A 45-Year-Old Man with Fever, Thrombocytopenia, and Elevated Aminotransferase Levels","Dr. Alyssa Sclafani (Medicine): A 45-year-old man presented to the emergency department of this hospital during the summer with fever, thrombocytopenia, and elevated aminotransferase levels. Three weeks before presentation, fever occurred (with temperatures as high as 40.0°C), along with fatigue and malaise. The patient took acetaminophen and di-phenhydramine to alleviate the symptoms. After approximately 5 days, the fever and fatigue had subsided but an erythematous, maculopapular rash had developed on the scalp. The rash lasted for 3 days and then spontaneously resolved. Three days before presentation, fever recurred, along with chills and malaise. Despite the administration of acetaminophen, the fever persisted. After 2 days, the patient sought medical attention at an urgent care clinic. His temperature was 40.0°C, and laboratory test results were notable for a platelet count of 45,000 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 140,000 to 400,000). He was instructed to return the next day. When he returned, his temperature was 38.9°C, the platelet count was 21,000 per cubic millimeter, and the serum sodium level was 124 mmol per liter (reference range, 135 to 146). Ibuprofen was administered orally, and he was referred to the emergency department of this hospital and was admitted for evaluation. In the emergency department, a review of systems was notable for the presence of anorexia during the previous 3 weeks and the occurrence of loose, nonbloody stools for 3 days. The patient had no weight loss, bleeding, or other gastrointestinal, pulmonary, neurologic, joint, or genitourinary symptoms; he reported no contacts with sick persons. He had no notable events in his medical history, except for an evaluation for mild bilateral gynecomastia 5 years earlier. He took no medications and had no known allergies. He worked as a manager of a craft shop. He lived in a wooded area in Massachusetts with his wife and two healthy daughters, and he ran once or twice weekly in a marshy area near his home. He had a house cat that was permitted to go outdoors. There was no history of use of tobacco or illicit substances; he consumed two alcoholic beverages weekly. He traveled to Mexico annually during the winter. His mother had had atrial fibrillation and heart failure, and his father had had lung cancer. He had one brother and one sister, and they were both healthy. On examination, the temperature was 36.7°C, the blood pressure 117/60 mm Hg, the pulse 113 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Six hours later, the temperature was 39.3°C. The patient was described as appearing well. There was a faint erythematous, macular rash on the chest. Conjunctival erythema was present, with no icter-us. There was no cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Cardiac examination revealed a tachycardic rhythm, with no murmur. Neurologic examination was normal. A circular skin lesion (measuring 1 cm in diameter) with a central scab was noted below the left lateral malleolus. A chest radiograph was normal. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and was otherwise normal. Levels of calcium, magnesium, lactate, total protein, globulin, amylase, and lipase were normal, as were the prothrombin time, partial-thromboplastin time, and white-cell differential count. Tests for hepatitis A virus antibody and hepatitis B virus surface antibody were positive. Screening blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody, hepatitis C virus antibody, and hepatitis B virus IgM antibody and surface antigen were negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Samples of the blood and urine were obtained for culture, and normal saline was administered intravenously. Diagnostic tests were performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2020,28,nejm-case-2020-28,A 64-Year-Old Man with Intrusive Thoughts and Fear of Being Poisoned,"Dr. Rachel A. Meyen (Psychiatry): A 64-year-old Haitian-American man was evaluated at the geriatric psychiatry clinic of this hospital for chronic depression, intrusive thoughts, and fear of being poisoned. During the evaluation, the patient described his mood as “not that good.” He reported depression, which he rated as 4 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe depression). He had been having an ongoing “depressive episode” during the past 3 months, which had led him to call in sick to work frequently. He had passive suicidal ideation, questioning whether life was worth living; however, he had no specific intent or plan and no thoughts of harming other people. The patient had a history of nightmares, but they had not occurred during the past 3 months. In the 3 years before this evaluation, his startle response had been increased and flashbacks frequently occurred; however, at the time of the evaluation, his startle response was reduced and there were no flashbacks. He reported that women had attempted to poison his coffee. There were no auditory or visual hallucinations. He reported limited energy, difficulty initiating sleep, repeated early morning awakenings, and anorexia. There was no weight loss, difficulty concentrating, or history of headaches, seizure, or head trauma. The patient’s medical history included diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, seasonal allergies, mild intermittent asthma, eczema, and chronic lower back pain associated with a motor vehicle accident that had occurred 20 years earlier. Medications included bupropion, quetiapine, aspirin, atorvastatin, ezetimibe, amlodipine, fosinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, and vitamins B12 and D3, as well as fexofenadine, naproxen, sildenafil, and inhaled albuterol as needed. Adverse drug effects included dry and painful mouth with paroxetine, reduced libido with par-oxetine and citalopram, orthostatic hypotension and falls with prazosin, nausea and vomiting with lisinopril, and elevated aminotransferase levels with statins. The patient had a family history of dyslipidemia; his brother had died of premature myocardial infarction, and his father had undergone coronary-artery by-pass grafting. He had an adult child, who was healthy. There was no history of neuropsychiatric disease or substance use disorder in first-degree relatives, but male maternal cousins had major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. He worked full-time as a counselor. He visited a psychic every few weeks and was undergoing training to become a psychic and read tarot cards. He had formerly smoked a few cigarettes daily and had quit smoking when he was 30 years of age. He drank one alcoholic beverage on weekend nights and did not use illicit drugs. The patient grew up in Haiti. His parents were devout Catholics, but many community members and relatives observed Vodou and Santeria beliefs and also practiced tarot card reading; the patient and his siblings began following Vodou and Santeria practices during adolescence. In his early life, the patient witnessed an act of police brutality in which a community member was killed, as well as the poisoning of colleagues of his father, who was a government employee. In his early adulthood, the patient immigrated to the United States. He lived in an urban area of New England, where he completed college and then worked as a counselor. He reported that he had experienced recurrent discrimination by female supervisors during his employment. In his early years of working, he encountered financial difficulties and was evicted from his apartment. During a 2-month period of homelessness, he became a victim of sexual and physical assault and subsequently had depressive symptoms, flashbacks, nightmares, and intrusive thoughts of the assault. He reported that he had not had any psychiatric symptoms before the assault. The patient was married for a brief period and then divorced. He reported that his ex-wife had “put a Vodou curse on me” and that he had traveled to Haiti to have the curse removed but “the damage cannot be undone.” For decades, he feared that female coworkers would try to poison him. For this reason, he did not drink coffee that had been unattended in the office, did not accept offers from coworkers to bring him coffee from a local shop, and avoided eating with colleagues. He felt that people at work did not like him. He described extreme self-consciousness and was concerned that people in either a professional or social setting would see “discoloration” when they looked at his face. In his early adulthood, the patient had sought weekly therapy at another hospital because of depressive symptoms, intrusive thoughts, and nightmares. Four years before the current consultation, and again 1 year later and 18 months after that, he sought care at psychiatry clinics at other hospitals. Meanwhile, he continued to receive care from the same therapist for approximately three decades. Additional history was obtained from the patient’s therapist. The persecutory beliefs had been long-standing, occurring over a period of decades; they became more prominent when depressive symptoms were more active, but they were still present during periods of euthymia. The therapist observed that the patient’s persecutory beliefs affected interpersonal relationships and led to the feeling of isolation at work. The patient had undergone multiple trials of psychopharmacologic medications for the treatment of recurrent major depressive episodes, which would occur approximately two times each year and last for several weeks to months. These medications included nortriptyline, fluox-etine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, citalo-pram, escitalopram, bupropion, and valproic acid. He had tried prazosin, which decreased the frequency of nightmares but was discontinued owing to orthostatic hypotension. He had undergone EMDR (eye movement, desensitization, and reprocessing) therapy, but nightmares occurred up to three times per month and intrusive thoughts of the sexual trauma occurred daily. Olanzapine and aripiprazole did not reduce paranoid thoughts; quetiapine had a modestly beneficial effect. On examination, the patient was a well-groomed older man with no abnormal facial features. His posture and gait were normal. He was calm and cooperative, with normal eye contact and speech of an appropriate rate and volume. He was oriented to time, place, and situation, with intact attentiveness and ability to recall autobiographical and historical information. His mood was described as mildly sad and anxious with a constricted affect. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. On laboratory testing performed at another hospital during the 6 months before the current evaluation, the complete blood count and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were levels of electrolytes, thyrotropin, and folate. The glucose level was 131 mg per deciliter (7.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). The glycated hemoglobin level (7.0%; reference range, 4.3 to 6.4) had increased from a level of 6.4% obtained 6 months earlier. An electrocardiogram obtained 4 months before the current evaluation showed sinus rhythm with a normal corrected QT interval. Diagnostic and management decisions were made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2023,38,nejm-case-2023-38,A 68-Year-Old Woman with Abnormal Movements and Confusion,"Dr. D. Curtis Wegener (Neurology): A 68-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of worsening confusion and abnormal movements of the face, arms, and legs. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 9 weeks before the current presentation, when she presented to another hospital because of intermittent slurred speech and dizziness that had lasted for 1 day. The score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was obtained; the NIHSS is an 11-component tool that assesses the severity of stroke, with scores ranging from 0 to 42 and higher scores indicating more severe neurologic deficits. Her NIHSS score was 1 owing to the presence of mild-to-moderate dysarthria, and she was not considered to be a candidate for treatment with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator. Imaging studies were obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly revealed a punctate focus of restricted diffusion associated with mild signal hyperintensity involving the deep white matter of the left frontal lobe on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging. This finding was consistent with an acute ischemic infarct without hemorrhage or mass effect. There were also findings that had been observed on previous imaging, including foci of encephalomalacia in the right inferior frontal lobe and left occipital lobe that were related to previous trauma, a punctate old lacunar infarct in the inferior left cerebellar hemisphere, and superimposed patchy foci of T2-weighted and FLAIR white-matter hyperintensity most consistent with small-vessel disease. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck reportedly showed no intracranial or cervical occlusion, high-grade ste-nosis, or aneurysm. The patient was admitted to the hospital. The patient had been taking apixaban daily because of a history of two deep venous thromboses, and the treatment was continued. She had also been taking atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia, and the dose was increased. Transthoracic echo-cardiography showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction and no patent CME at NEJM.org foramen ovale. Continuous telemetric monitoring showed no evidence of atrial fibrillation. Mobile cardiac telemetry was planned for the 30-day period after discharge. On the second hospital day, frequent irregular movements of the right leg developed, occurring every few seconds in a nonrhythmic pattern. The next day, similar movements of the right arm developed. The patient described the movements as involuntary and reported no uncontrollable urges or compulsions to move the arm or leg. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was reportedly negative for any new findings. Electroencephalography (EEG) was reportedly normal in the waking, drowsy, and light-sleep states. The dysarthria resolved, but the involuntary movements persisted. The patient was discharged home on the seventh hospital day. During the next 6 weeks, involuntary movements involving the arms, legs, and tongue occurred with increasing frequency. The patient began using a walker. Nine days before the current presentation, the patient was again admitted to the other hospital after multiple falls at home, which she attributed to uncontrolled movements of her arms and legs. On examination, she had nearly constant writhing, nonrhythmic, dancelike movements of the arms, legs, and trunk, as well as rolling movements of the tongue. She could stand up from a chair while holding onto a walker. Scattered bruises were present on the lower legs. Imaging studies were obtained. CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly showed mild scattered parenchymal hypodensities without hemorrhage or evidence of an acute infarct. A presumptive diagnosis of vascular chorea was made, and the patient was treated with oral levetiracetam. On the third hospital day, MRI of the head was attempted but was limited by motion artifacts due to involuntary movements. There were small foci of restricted diffusion in the right frontal and parietal periventricular white matter within the right corona radiata and centrum semiovale, findings consistent with new small acute-to-subacute infarcts without hemorrhage or mass effect. On the fourth hospital day, the dose of leveti-racetam was increased. EEG reportedly showed excessive irregular background slow-wave activity without focal, lateralizing, or epileptiform features; there were no findings that correlated to the movements of the head and body. On the fifth hospital day, the irregular movements had not abated, and treatment with levetiracetam was stopped. Treatment with low-dose clonaze-pam at bedtime was started to help with sleep. On the sixth hospital day, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility. Three days after discharge, a family member observed that the patient was confused and unable to maintain a conversation. The family member brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient was not able to provide additional information. Other medical history, obtained from the family member, included hypothyroidism, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, pulmonary hypertension, and vitiligo. Medications included ambrisentan, apixaban, atorvastatin, cholecalciferol, glipizide, levothy-roxine, metformin, omeprazole, and sitagliptin. Clonazepam had not been administered at the rehabilitation facility. The patient had taken warfarin for many years for her history of two deep venous thromboses; 10 months before the current presentation, treatment had been switched from warfarin to apixaban. Acetylsalicylic acid had caused hives; there were no other known allergies. Before being discharged to the rehabilitation facility, the patient had lived alone in a suburban area and had worked in a school. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and drank alcohol rarely. Her father and brother had diabetes mel-litus; there was no family history of abnormal movements or stroke. The temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 125/60 mm Hg, the pulse 79 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 23.6. The patient was sleepy but arousable with verbal stimuli. She was oriented to self but not to time or place. She could follow simple commands with repeated instructions but could not follow complex commands. She had irregular spontane-ous movements of the face, mouth, and tongue; she also had irregular spontaneous writhing movements of the arms and legs that were partially suppressible. When she was asked to hold her arms outstretched with the palms facing upward while keeping her eyes closed, her right arm drifted downward, and the palm pronated toward the floor. Strength was 4 out of 5 on right shoulder abduction, elbow flexion, elbow extension, wrist flexion, and wrist extension; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, alanine amino-transferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. Urinalysis showed trace ketones and 1+ leukocyte esterase (reference value, negative); the urine sediment showed 0 to 2 white cells per high-power field (reference value, <10). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 44 mm per hour (reference range for women in the patient’s age group, 0 to 40). Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Hillary R. Kelly: CT of the head performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, as well as CT angiography of the head and neck performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed no evidence of an acute territorial infarct and no change in the long-term findings, including the previously described areas of encephalomalacia and periventricular white-matter hypodensity. MRI of the head (Fig. 1), performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed multiple foci of restricted diffusion associated with T2-weighted and FLAIR hyperintensity, findings consistent with acute-to-early subacute infarcts. Foci were scattered throughout the cortex and subcortical white matter of both cerebral hemispheres. The most prominent foci were located along the left tem-poro-occipital junction. Numerous foci involved the cortex of the frontal and parietal lobes along the precentral and postcentral gyri. There was a small punctate focus of restricted diffusion associated with T2-weighted and FLAIR hyperin-tensity in the right superior cerebellar hemisphere, a finding consistent with an additional small infarct. There was no associated hemorrhage or mass effect. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed no intracranial occlusion, high-grade stenosis, or aneurysm. The patient was admitted to this hospital, and diagnostic tests were performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,13­2021,13­2021,nejm-case-13­2021-13­2021,A Newborn Girl with a Neck Mass,"Dr. Katherine A. Sparger: A newborn girl was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of this hospital after a planned delivery by cesarean section because of a neck mass. During pregnancy, the patient’s mother was 41 years old (gravida 3, para 1) and received prenatal care at another hospital. At 7 weeks of gestation, vaginal bleed­ing occurred because of a subchorionic hematoma. At 10 weeks of gestation, the mother’s blood thyrotropin level was 0.01 μU per milliliter (reference range, 0.40 to 5.00); levels of free thyroxine (free T4) and total triiodothyronine (total T3) were not obtained. At 19 weeks of gestation, the thyrotropin level was 0.44 μU per milli­liter and an ultrasonographic survey of the fetal anatomy was normal. During the third trimester, gestational diabetes was diagnosed; glycemic control was main­tained with dietary changes. Four weeks before delivery, at 34 weeks 6 days of gestation, a routine trans­vaginal ultrasonographic survey of fetal growth revealed a new mass on the right side of the fetus’s neck that measured 2.6 cm by 3.4 cm by 3.0 cm. The mother was referred to the obstetrics clinic of this hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Dr. Randheer Shailam: At 35 weeks 6 days of gestation, obstetrical ultrasonogra­phy performed at this hospital (Fig. 1A) confirmed the presence of a 4.6­cm mass on the right side of the neck. The mass was hyperechoic and well circumscribed and had internal vascularity; the remainder of the survey of fetal anatomy was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the fetus, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material (Fig. 1B, 1C, and 1D), revealed displacement of the trachea without compression. Dr. Sparger: For multiple weeks, the fetal biophysical profile score was 8 out of 8, indicating normal breathing motion, movement, tone, and amniotic fluid volume.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2017,33,nejm-case-2017-33,22-Month-Old Conjoined Twins,"Dr. Allan M. Goldstein: A pediatric surgeon at this hospital was contacted by a nonprofit organization to evaluate the possibility of surgical separation of conjoined twin girls. The twins were born by spontaneous vaginal delivery in East Africa. Because of the anticipated marked complexity of separation, the family was advised to seek a surgical opinion in the United States. Through the outreach efforts of the nonprofit organization, arrangements were made for the children to receive care at this hospital, and the family traveled to Boston when the girls were 22 months of age. On arrival, the twins were seen in the pediatric surgery clinic at this hospital. On physical examination, they were noted to be dicephalic, dithoracic, omphalo-ischiopagus twins who were joined from the xiphoid to the pelvis (Fig. 1A). They were unable to stand and remained in a recumbent position, facing each other. Twin B was larger, alert, vigorous, and interactive, whereas Twin A was less active and more difficult to engage. There was one umbilicus, one anus, and one vagina with a vertical septum that extended to the introitus (Fig. 1B). A small opening posterior to the anus suggested anal duplication. There were four arms and three legs, one of which had a duplicated foot, with a prominent, centrally positioned big toe and six lesser toes (three on each side) in a mirrored pattern (Fig. 1C). Imaging studies were performed to further define the anatomy of these patients. Dr. Michael S. Gee: Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis was performed with the use of an electrocardiogram-gated, high-pitch protocol for simultaneous assessment of cardiovascular, visceral-organ, and osseous anatomy. Intravenous contrast material was administered in each twin to depict the overall cardiovascular anatomy. CT revealed a single liver that spanned the shared abdominal cavity (Fig. 2A). Each twin had one dominant kidney with a ureter that drained into a shared bladder in the pelvis (Fig. 2B), as well as a smaller dysplas-tic kidney. The major shared arterial blood supply consisted of a dilated superior mesenteric artery in Twin B that communicated with the abdominal aorta in Twin A (Fig. 2C). The gastrointestinal tracts were partially fused, with a shared distal small intestine and colon. Twin B had an anatomically complete pelvis, whereas Twin A was positioned within the splayed pelvis of Twin B, with the pubic symphy-sis of Twin B interrupted by Twin A (Fig. 2D). Images of the vascular and osseous anatomy of the twins were extracted from the CT scans and saved as stereolithographic files that were then rigidly aligned and exported to a three-dimensional printer for generation of a full-scale model to aid in surgical planning (Fig. 2E). Dr. Oscar J. Benavidez: The twins were also evaluated in the pediatric cardiology clinic. Twin A had cyanosis. In Twin B, oxygen saturation measurements in the arm and the leg were greater than 97% while she was breathing ambient air. In Twin A, oxygen saturation measurements in the arm fluctuated between 60% and 70%, and measurements in the leg fluctuated between 70% and 98%; the oxygen saturation in Twin A increased and reached the highest values when Twin B became agitated. CT (Fig. 2F) and echocardiography revealed that Twin A had complex congenital heart disease. Twin B had dextrocardia and otherwise normal cardiac anatomy. Twin B’s superior mes-enteric artery was large and similar in caliber to the abdominal aorta and was connected to Twin A’s abdominal aorta. Twin A had bidirectional flow in the superior mesenteric artery, and she also appeared to have diastolic retrograde flow into the abdominal aorta (Fig. 3). Dr. Goldstein: Eleven days after the initial evaluation, cough and rhinorrhea developed in Twin A. On the fourth day of illness, the twins returned to this hospital for additional anatomical assessment. Later that day, a temperature of 38.3°C developed in Twin A; her parents also noted that she appeared tired, was less active than usual, and had diminished oral intake and bluish discoloration of the nail beds, symptoms that prompted them to bring the twins to the emergency department of this hospital. On examination in the emergency department, Twin A appeared fatigued and diaphoretic; she cried weakly in response to painful stimuli. Mild intercostal and thoracoabdominal retractions were present, and scattered rhonchi were present throughout both lungs on auscultation. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. The white-cell count was 26,440 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 6000 to 17,500), with 86% neutrophils (reference range, 25 to 49), 8% lymphocytes (reference range, 60 to 67), and 5% monocytes (reference range, 4 to 11). The hemoglobin level was 15.0 g per deciliter (reference range, 10.5 to 13.5), and the hematocrit was 44.2% (reference range, 33.0 to 39.0). The blood level of bicarbonate was 19 mmol per liter (reference range, 23 to 32); the levels of other electrolytes, lactic acid, and glucose were normal, as were the red-cell indexes and the platelet count. A blood culture and tests for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adeno-virus, and metapneumovirus were negative. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula, and intravenous fluids were administered. The twins were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). In the PICU, supplemental oxygen and intravenous fluids were continued and ceftriaxone was administered. In Twin A, during episodes of agitation and suctioning of respiratory secretions, oxygen saturation measurements in the arm fell to between 30% and 40%. Desaturations also occurred, and cough increased during attempts to feed by bottle. Oxygen saturation measurements in the leg fluctuated between 70% and 80% and increased when Twin B became agitated or active. By the 4th hospital day, the requirement for supplemental oxygen had increased. A chest radiograph revealed bibasilar air-space opacities that were more prominent on the left side than on the right side. Intravenous access was difficult to maintain, and a nasogastric tube was placed, through which enteral nutrition, cefpo-doxime, and azithromycin were administered. By the 7th hospital day, the respiratory distress began to dissipate and Twin A was more alert and active; the requirement for supplemental oxygen gradually decreased, the nasogastric tube was removed, and formula, solid food, and antibiotic agents were administered orally. The twins were discharged on the 10th hospital day with a plan for the family to return to the outpatient clinic to discuss the results of the surgical evaluation. Six days later, the twins were brought back to the emergency department of this hospital because of recurrent respiratory distress in Twin A. Her parents reported that she had been doing well until 2 days earlier, when rhinorrhea developed, followed by decreased oral intake, tachypnea, cough, and increased work of breathing. On examination in the emergency department, Twin A appeared ill and was in respiratory distress. The temperature was 36.7°C, the pulse 102 beats per minute, the blood pressure 107/74 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 51 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation measurement in the hand 32% while she was breathing ambient air. Copious nasal secretions were present; her cough was weak and she was unable to clear the secretions. Tachypnea and retractions were present, and the breath sounds were coarse bilaterally, with scattered rhonchi. Continuous positive airway pressure therapy was administered, and the twins were admitted to the PICU. Management decisions were made. ",{},,Conjoined twins. ,Conjoined twins. ,0
NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2018,01,nejm-case-2018-01,A 39-Year-Old Woman with Rapidly Progressive Respiratory Failure,"Dr. Raghu R. Chivukula (Medicine): A 39-year-old woman with a history of leukemia and double-unit cord-blood transplantation was admitted to this hospital because of dyspnea, hypoxemia, and the presence of infiltrates in both lungs. Thirty months before this admission, the patient presented to another hospital with upper respiratory symptoms, throat swelling, and anemia. On the basis of the results of a bone marrow biopsy, a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia was made. Induction chemotherapy with idarubicin and cytarabine was administered, followed by consolidation chemotherapy with three cycles of high-dose cytarabine. Subsequently, the patient was in complete remission. One year later, a relapse of acute myeloid leukemia occurred, and mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine were administered. Two months later, fever, fatigue, pleuritic chest pain, and dry cough developed, and the patient presented to a second hospital. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of contrast material, reportedly revealed multifocal nodular opacities, and the patient was treated with vancomycin. She was transferred to the first hospital, where a CT-guided lung biopsy was performed. Pathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed hyphae with septations, a finding that was consistent with invasive aspergillus infection. Micafungin was administered, followed by voriconazole, for a total of 12 months thereafter. Six weeks after the lung biopsy was performed (approximately 14 months before this admission), the patient was admitted to this hospital for bone marrow transplantation. After she received a conditioning chemotherapy regimen of fludarabine and melphalan, a double-unit cord-blood transplantation was performed. The hospital course after transplantation was complicated by Staphylococcus aureus bac-teremia, respiratory failure that led to mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury that led to temporary hemodialysis, and duodenal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) that was treated with glucocorticoids, sirolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. Results of a bone marrow biopsy that was performed 100 days after the transplantation were consistent with complete remission, with no evidence of recurrent leukemia. Four months before this admission, sore throat, odynophagia, and cough occurred and were thought to be caused by recurrent tonsillitis. Three courses of antimicrobial therapy (including cefuroxime and amoxicillin–clavulanic acid) were administered, and 3 months later, a tonsillectomy was performed at an affiliated hospital. Seven days before this admission, after a 2-day summer camping trip in New England, fatigue, progressive dyspnea, and diffuse myalgias occurred, followed by chills, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, rigors, and fever (to a temperature of 38.7°C). On examination in the emergency department of the second hospital, the patient had hypoxemia, with an oxygen saturation of 85% while she was breathing ambient air. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of contrast material, revealed new bilateral ground-glass opacities and mediastinal and hilar lymphade-nopathy. Levofloxacin and piperacillin–tazobactam were administered intravenously. Approximately 20 hours after presentation, the patient was transferred to this hospital. During the previous week, the patient had had loose, nonbloody stools and abdominal pain, with no other abdominal symptoms, cough, sputum production, headache, rash, or arthralgias. She had hypothyroidism, asthma, hypertension, diabetes, and depression; in the past, she had had a catheter-associated thrombus of the right subclavian vein and had undergone a cesarean section. Medications were acyclovir, trimethoprim– sulfamethoxazole, montelukast, amlodipine, aripi-prazole, sertraline, levothyroxine, and zolpidem, as well as an albuterol inhaler as needed. She was allergic to house dust mites. She reported that she had had no tick bites or animal exposures during the recent camping trip and had had no known sick contacts. The patient worked in a hair salon and lived with her son. She drank alcohol socially, had smoked cigarettes for 3 years in the past, and did not use illicit drugs. Her father had had melanoma, and her paternal grandfather had had rheumatoid arthritis. There was no other family history of cancer. On examination, the patient appeared to be anxious and in moderate respiratory distress. The temperature was 36.8°C, the pulse 91 beats per minute, the blood pressure 123/72 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 90% while she was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute, 92% while she was using a nonrebreather face mask, and 94% while she was breathing high-flow oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 40 liters per minute. She had scattered fine crackles, wheezes, and high-pitched inspiratory “squeaks” and “pops” in both lungs diffusely. There was very mild tenderness in the mid-epigastrium. The remainder of the examination was normal. On admission, vancomycin, piperacillin–tazo-bactam, levofloxacin, furosemide, and methyl-prednisone were administered intravenously, and ipratropium–albuterol was administered by inhalation. The prothrombin time and prothrombin-time international normalized ratio were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Cultures of the sputum, urine, and blood were performed. Testing for legionella and Pneumocystis jirovecii in the sputum and legionella antigen in the urine was negative, as was nucleic-acid testing for influenza A and B and respiratory syncytial virus. Dr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: On admission, chest radiography (Fig. 1A) revealed a faint patchy opacity in the left upper lobe and trace bilateral pleural effusions. Chest CT (Fig. 1B, 1C, and 1D), performed after the administration of contrast material, revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities predominantly in the upper lobes, opacities in small airways of the lower lobes that were consistent with mucous plugging, bronchial-wall thickening, and bilateral pulmonary nodules that had progressed since the previous CT study had been obtained (at the second hospital 2 days earlier). A small nodule in the right upper lobe represented a scar from the previous aspergillus infection. Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes and trace bilateral pleural effusions were also noted. Dr. Chivukula: Eight hours after admission, the patient had a dry cough, progressive dyspnea, increased crackles on lung auscultation, and worsened hypoxemia, with an intermittent decline in the oxygen saturation to 75% despite the delivery of high-flow oxygen. Ceftazidime was administered intravenously, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Twenty-two hours after admission, an endotra-cheal tube was placed and mechanical ventilation was initiated. Bronchoscopic examination revealed thin, foamy secretions in the left and right bronchi, with mild, diffuse airway erythe-ma. Bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid was obtained from the right upper lobe and left upper lobe. Diagnostic test results were received.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2008,01,nejm-case-2008-01,A 45-Year-Old Man with Sudden Onset of Abdominal Pain and Hypotension,"Dr. Megan Fix (Emergency Medicine): A 45-year-old man was transferred on an emergency basis to this hospital from a community health center because of abdominal pain and hypotension. On the day of admission, while lifting an air conditioner, he suddenly experienced severe abdominal pain, along with weakness and diaphoresis. He went to a community health center, arriving approximately 20 minutes later. He rated the pain as 10 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 representing the most severe pain). He had not vomited. On examination, he was pale, profusely diaphoretic, and in extreme discomfort. His blood pressure was 84/49 mm Hg, and his pulse 100 beats per minute; respirations were 20 breaths per minute and shallow; oxygen saturation was 98% while he was breathing ambient air. His neck was supple, and his chest clear. His abdomen was rigid and diffusely tender, with guarding in all quadrants; the point of greatest tenderness was in the periumbilical area. Blood was drawn for laboratory testing, and a peripheral 20-gauge intravenous line was placed. Crystalloid intravenous solution was infused rapidly, and oxygen was administered at a rate of 2 liters per minute by nasal cannula. Emergency medical services were called to transport the patient to this hospital 15 minutes after his arrival at the health center. Approximately 3 months before admission, the patient had been admitted to this hospital because of epigastric pain, nausea, and chills that had gradually developed hours after he had been drinking alcohol heavily. On examination at that time, his temperature was 38.3°C, and his abdomen was slightly distended. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody and HIV RNA was negative. Other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Computed tomographic (CT) scanning of the abdomen, performed after the administration of contrast material, revealed splenomegaly with prominent mesenteric vasculature, stranding of mes-enteric fat, a small amount of ascites, and gallstones without evidence of cholecys-titis or pancreatitis. An ultrasonogram of the abdomen showed a diffusely echo-genic liver, which was consistent with mild fatty infiltration. The patient’s pain resolved; he refused further evaluation and was discharged the next day. The patient had undergone a left inguinal herniorrhaphy and surgical repair of a fracture of the right humeral head; he had a tattoo. He had a history of alcohol abuse and, according to relatives, had been drinking excessively in the previous 2 days. He did not smoke or use illicit drugs. He lived alone and was receiving disability compensation because of the shoulder injury. His parents had died in their 60s from myocardial infarctions. He had no allergies. Medications included cyclobenzaprine and ibuprofen. When the patient arrived in the emergency department (30 minutes after leaving the health center and approximately 60 minutes after the onset of symptoms), his blood pressure was 77/46 mm Hg, and his pulse 118 beats per minute. He appeared to be in severe distress and was incontinent of stool, which was not bloody. His abdomen was tense and tender, without abdominal ecchymosis or palpable masses. Distal pulses were diminished. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. A subclavicular central venous line and another peripheral line were inserted. In addition to crystalloid intravenous solution, uncrossed packed red cells were transfused simultaneously through the second peripheral venous catheter and the central line. A diagnostic procedure was performed. ",{},"Ruptured pancreaticoduodenal-artery aneurysm. Dr. Glenn M. LaMuraglia: Aneurysm of the pancre-aticoduodenal artery is a very unusual problem. Aneurysms of visceral arteries are rare, and only 2% of them occur in the pancreaticoduodenal artery. There are three major clinical presentations of visceral-artery aneurysms: hemorrhagic collapse from rupture, as in the case under discussion; vague abdominal symptoms, with an aneurysm found on imaging; and an incidental finding in an otherwise asymptomatic person. In contrast to the situation with aneurysms of other arteries, the size of pancreaticoduodenal-artery aneurysms does not appear to be related to the risk of rupture. Pancreaticoduodenal aneurysms may be either true aneurysms, resulting from a primary abnormality of the vessel wall, or false aneurysms, resulting from injury and erosion of the vessel wall, most commonly after trauma or inflammation.24 In the absence of a history of abdominal surgery or trauma, this patient probably has a true aneurysm. True aneurysms of the pancre-aticoduodenal artery are more common in men than in women and are associated with a history of alcohol use or pancreatitis. The mean age at presentation is 40 to 50 years, suggesting that the pathophysiology of these aneurysms is different from that of the atherosclerotic aneurysms that occur in the elderly.25,26 The demographic characteristics of this patient are thus consistent with pancreaticoduodenal-artery aneurysm. A CT scan obtained 3 months before admission showed a suggestion of celiac-artery stenosis in this patient. Pancreaticoduodenal-artery aneurysms, both primary and secondary, are associated with celiac-artery stenosis or occlusion in 60 to 75% of cases.26 Obstruction of the celiac artery is thought to contribute to the formation of aneurysms by causing the development of collaterals to fill the hepatic and splenic arteries, creating a low-resistance vascular bed and resulting in high flow through the pancreaticoduodenal artery (Fig. 3).24 This high flow is thought to contribute to the development of an aneurysm. Celiac-artery obstruction is typically caused by pressure from The connections and collaterals between the pan-creaticoduodenal, gastroduodenal, and other visceral arteries are numerous, and the anatomy can be quite variable.27 For these reasons, one of the most important steps in planning treatment, either radiologic or surgical, is to determine which end-organ vessels are involved and what their The treatment options are revascularization of the celiac artery, surgical repair, or percutaneous embolization of the pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm. Revascularization of the celiac artery, which is typically performed as an elective procedure before an acute episode of bleeding has occurred, can be accomplished by incising the arcu-ate ligament or stenting or bypassing the artery. The surgical treatment options for the pancre-aticoduodenal artery aneurysm include ligation of the aneurysm, with or without a bypass, depending on the anatomy, and repair by suture plication. The artery can be excluded or resected by tying the proximal and distal vessels. Before 1980, the majority of patients with bleeding pan-creaticoduodenal-artery aneurysms were either not treated or treated surgically; the mortality was approximately 40%. Since 1980, with better resuscitation methods and the use of catheter embolization, the mortality is as low as 0% in some studies.25,26 In patients with acute bleeding, such as this patient, embolization is the treatment of choice, if it is available; otherwise, surgical intervention should be considered. In this case, we decided to perform catheter embolization. Dr. Kalva: An abdominal aortogram was obtained, which showed high-grade stenosis of the celiac axis, with retrograde filling of the common hepatic and splenic arteries through the pancreati-coduodenal arcade and dorsal pancreatic artery. The superior mesenteric artery, portal vein, and renal arteries were normal. A selective superior mesenteric arteriogram (Fig. 4A) confirmed the findings seen on the aortogram. In addition, the anterior and posterior inferior pancreaticoduode-nal arteries were enlarged, and there were aneurysms in the posterior inferior pancreaticoduo-denal artery and dorsal pancreatic artery. The posterior inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery and the dorsal pancreatic artery were selectively catheterized with a microcatheter, and the aneurysms were embolized with 0.018 microcoils. After em-bolization (Fig. 4B), the aneurysms were occluded, and there was persistent filling of the celiac axis through the pancreaticoduodenal arcade. Dr. de Moya: Unfortunately, despite the successful treatment of the aneurysms, fulminant liver failure developed, complicated by ventilator-associated Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia, the acute respiratory distress syndrome, and the hepatore-nal syndrome, and the patient died about 1 month after admission. Permission for an autopsy was declined. It appeared that the severity of the underlying liver disease impeded recovery from the circulatory compromise that was due to the intraabdominal hemorrhage. Dr. Reisner: Emergency management in a case like this illustrates the value of the electronic medical record.

",,"Ruptured pancreaticoduodenal-artery aneurysm. Dr. Glenn M. LaMuraglia: Aneurysm of the pancre-aticoduodenal artery is a very unusual problem. Aneurysms of visceral arteries are rare, and only 2% of them occur in the pancreaticoduodenal artery. There are three major clinical presentations of visceral-artery aneurysms: hemorrhagic collapse from rupture, as in the case under discussion; vague abdominal symptoms, with an aneurysm found on imaging; and an incidental finding in an otherwise asymptomatic person. In contrast to the situation with aneurysms of other arteries, the size of pancreaticoduodenal-artery aneurysms does not appear to be related to the risk of rupture. Pancreaticoduodenal aneurysms may be either true aneurysms, resulting from a primary abnormality of the vessel wall, or false aneurysms, resulting from injury and erosion of the vessel wall, most commonly after trauma or inflammation.24 In the absence of a history of abdominal surgery or trauma, this patient probably has a true aneurysm. True aneurysms of the pancre-aticoduodenal artery are more common in men than in women and are associated with a history of alcohol use or pancreatitis. The mean age at presentation is 40 to 50 years, suggesting that the pathophysiology of these aneurysms is different from that of the atherosclerotic aneurysms that occur in the elderly.25,26 The demographic characteristics of this patient are thus consistent with pancreaticoduodenal-artery aneurysm. A CT scan obtained 3 months before admission showed a suggestion of celiac-artery stenosis in this patient. Pancreaticoduodenal-artery aneurysms, both primary and secondary, are associated with celiac-artery stenosis or occlusion in 60 to 75% of cases.26 Obstruction of the celiac artery is thought to contribute to the formation of aneurysms by causing the development of collaterals to fill the hepatic and splenic arteries, creating a low-resistance vascular bed and resulting in high flow through the pancreaticoduodenal artery (Fig. 3).24 This high flow is thought to contribute to the development of an aneurysm. Celiac-artery obstruction is typically caused by pressure from The connections and collaterals between the pan-creaticoduodenal, gastroduodenal, and other visceral arteries are numerous, and the anatomy can be quite variable.27 For these reasons, one of the most important steps in planning treatment, either radiologic or surgical, is to determine which end-organ vessels are involved and what their The treatment options are revascularization of the celiac artery, surgical repair, or percutaneous embolization of the pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm. Revascularization of the celiac artery, which is typically performed as an elective procedure before an acute episode of bleeding has occurred, can be accomplished by incising the arcu-ate ligament or stenting or bypassing the artery. The surgical treatment options for the pancre-aticoduodenal artery aneurysm include ligation of the aneurysm, with or without a bypass, depending on the anatomy, and repair by suture plication. The artery can be excluded or resected by tying the proximal and distal vessels. Before 1980, the majority of patients with bleeding pan-creaticoduodenal-artery aneurysms were either not treated or treated surgically; the mortality was approximately 40%. Since 1980, with better resuscitation methods and the use of catheter embolization, the mortality is as low as 0% in some studies.25,26 In patients with acute bleeding, such as this patient, embolization is the treatment of choice, if it is available; otherwise, surgical intervention should be considered. In this case, we decided to perform catheter embolization. Dr. Kalva: An abdominal aortogram was obtained, which showed high-grade stenosis of the celiac axis, with retrograde filling of the common hepatic and splenic arteries through the pancreati-coduodenal arcade and dorsal pancreatic artery. The superior mesenteric artery, portal vein, and renal arteries were normal. A selective superior mesenteric arteriogram (Fig. 4A) confirmed the findings seen on the aortogram. In addition, the anterior and posterior inferior pancreaticoduode-nal arteries were enlarged, and there were aneurysms in the posterior inferior pancreaticoduo-denal artery and dorsal pancreatic artery. The posterior inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery and the dorsal pancreatic artery were selectively catheterized with a microcatheter, and the aneurysms were embolized with 0.018 microcoils. After em-bolization (Fig. 4B), the aneurysms were occluded, and there was persistent filling of the celiac axis through the pancreaticoduodenal arcade. Dr. de Moya: Unfortunately, despite the successful treatment of the aneurysms, fulminant liver failure developed, complicated by ventilator-associated Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia, the acute respiratory distress syndrome, and the hepatore-nal syndrome, and the patient died about 1 month after admission. Permission for an autopsy was declined. It appeared that the severity of the underlying liver disease impeded recovery from the circulatory compromise that was due to the intraabdominal hemorrhage. Dr. Reisner: Emergency management in a case like this illustrates the value of the electronic medical record. This patient had been previously treated in our system, and so his medical history was immediately available to us. A mechanism offering universal access to electronic health records would extend this advantage to all patients.28,29 Despite legitimate concerns of privacy advocates, such information is vital to emergency management.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,36,nejm-case-2010-36,A 50-Year-Old Woman with Pain and Loss of Hearing in the Left Ear,"A 50-year-old woman was seen in the emergency department at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary (MEEI), affiliated with this hospital, because of pain and decreased hearing in the left ear. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 6 weeks earlier, when she noted decreased hearing, discomfort, and a sensation of blockage in her left ear. She saw an otolaryngologist at another hospital. On examination, there was maceration, desquamation, and minute hemorrhages on the left tympanic membrane, without perforation. An audiogram reportedly showed conductive hearing loss in the left ear, with a speech-reception threshold of 20 dB. A tympanogram was flat (indicating decreased mobility of the ear drum, a feature that is consistent with the presence of fluid in the middle ear). The ear canal was irrigated, and a crust was removed from the eardrum. The patient was treated with oral azithromycin and an otic suspension consisting of neomycin, polymyxin B, and hydrocortisone. Symptoms improved briefly but then recurred, with worsening pain, and she came to the emergency department at MEEI. The patient did not have otorrhea, tinnitus, fever, weight loss, cough, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. Tests for tuberculosis and the human immunodeficiency virus had been negative in the past. A diagnosis of essential thrombocythe-mia had been made 18 years earlier; treatment had included interferon alfa and hydroxyurea and had been complicated by anemia that required intermittent transfusions. She had hypertension, anxiety, chronic diarrhea, and mild renal insufficiency. Her medications included anagrelide hydrochloride, darbepoetin alfa, and sertraline. She was allergic to hydroxychloroquine sulfate. She was married, had worked in a health care facility, and currently worked in an office; she had traveled to Europe, the Mediterranean, and in the distant past, to China and the Caribbean. She did not drink alcohol, smoke, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had had diabetes mellitus, hepatic and renal disease, and breast cancer, and her father had had heart disease and hypertension; her siblings and her child were healthy. On examination, the blood pressure was 152/72 mm Hg and the other vital signs were normal. The left auricle was normal. The left ear canal and tympanic membrane were erythematous, and the canal contained white debris; there was a serous effusion in the middle ear. The right ear was normal. The Rinne test revealed better hearing by means of air conduction than by means of bone conduction bilaterally; in the Weber test, sound lateralized to the left. The remainder of the examination was normal. An audiogram showed mixed hearing loss in the left ear: the hearing loss was purely conductive below 4000 Hz and mostly sensorineural above that frequency. The right ear had purely sensorineural hearing loss above 4000 Hz, paralleling the left-sided loss (Fig. 1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Azithromycin, methylprednisolone in a tapering dose, and an otic solution of neomycin, polymyxin B, and hydrocortisone were prescribed, but the patient discontinued the gluco-corticoid because of insomnia. The pain resolved, but blockage persisted; on follow-up by an oto-laryngologist 3 days later, myringotomy with tube placement was performed and ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone drops were prescribed. The patient was advised to keep water out of the ear. On follow-up 3 weeks later (2 months before admission), the patient reported improved hearing and no pain. On examination, abundant debris was found and removed from the left ear canal; dried serous material covered the left tympanic membrane, and granulation tissue obstructed the lumen of the tube. The speech-reception threshold was in the 35-dB range; other findings were unchanged. The tube was removed and the middle ear was aspirated, without evidence of purulence. Acetic acid drops were prescribed. Results of laboratory tests, performed later that week at the other hospital, are shown in Table 1. Two weeks later, the patient fell while jet-skiing on a river, exposing her left ear to the water. Pain in the ear recurred, and she returned to the emergency department at MEEI 5 days later. She rated the pain at 3 to 4 on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 indicating the most severe pain. The left auricle was tender on manipulation, without tra-gal pain. There was wet, white debris in the ear canal, with no perforation, effusion, or drainage. Other findings were unchanged. A 10-day course of amoxicillin–clavulanic acid was begun. On follow-up examination 1 week later, 3.5 months after the onset of symptoms, the pain had resolved. The tympanic membrane was re-tracted, with an effusion but without perforation. A ballottable (mobile when palpated) subcutaneous mass, thought to be a cyst, emerged from the posterior superior quadrant of the external auditory canal and obscured the pars flac-cida. Other findings were unchanged. Computed tomography (CT) of the temporal bone 1 week later revealed a hyperdense soft-tissue mass, 3.2 cm by 2.5 cm by 4 cm, against the lateral aspect of the left mastoid bone and mastoid process, medial to the auricle. The mass extended superiorly to the temporalis muscle and medially into the external auditory canal, narrowing the lumen to approximately 3 mm by 2 mm, without bony erosion. There was opacification of the left mastoid air cells and portions of the middle-ear cavity and retraction of the tympanic membrane. One week later, the patient returned to the emergency department at MEEI because of recurrent otalgia. The left external auditory canal was narrowed by edematous skin; the tympanic membrane appeared normal. Oral amoxicillin– clavulanic acid and eardrops consisting of cipro-floxacin and dexamethasone were prescribed. The otalgia resolved, but at follow-up 1 week later, the patient reported that fullness and decreased hearing persisted. One week later, otalgia recurred. A repeat examination revealed post-auricular swelling of the left ear. There was whitish debris and desquamated epithelium in the external auditory canal; the medial concha was edematous, with prominent capillaries; and the canal was narrowed posteriorly by a hyper-vascular soft-tissue mass, which had enlarged from previous examinations and extended along the posterior wall of the canal to the tympanic membrane. Gram’s staining of a swab from the canal revealed few polymorphonuclear cells, abundant epithelial cells, and no bacteria; routine and fungal cultures were sterile. The administration of levofloxacin was begun, and the otalgia resolved within 48 hours. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and temporal bone 1 week later revealed an enhancing soft-tissue mass, 4.5 cm by 2.8 cm by 4.5 cm, in the periauricular region of the left ear, involving the temporalis muscle and extending into the left external auditory canal, without bony erosion. There was opacification of the left mastoid air cells and middle-ear cavity, with dural enhancement along the floor of the left middle cranial fossa. Serum levels of glucose, electrolytes, albumin, globulin, calcium, and angiotensin-converting enzyme were normal, as were results of liver-function tests. Tests for Lyme disease, antinuclear antigen, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) were negative, as was a skin test for tuberculosis; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Two days later, a diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2023,39,nejm-case-2023-39,"A 43-Year-Old Woman with Chronic Diarrhea, Hair Loss, and Nail and Skin Changes","Dr. W.K. Claudia Wu: A 43-year-old woman was admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital of the Chinese University of Hong Kong because of abdominal pain and diarrhea. The patient had been well until 6 months before this admission, when colicky, diffuse abdominal pain developed. She also had nonbloody diarrhea that occurred up to 10 times daily. During the subsequent 6 months, the patient noticed decreased appetite and weight loss of 5 kg. The symptoms did not abate, and her family encouraged her to seek medical evaluation. On evaluation, the patient reported gradually darkening skin on the face, arms, and legs, as well as hair thinning and changes in the appearance of all the fingernails and toenails during the previous 4 months. There was no nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, hematochezia, fevers, or night sweats. The patient had a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome. Ten months before this admission, she had sought evaluation by a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner because of irregular menses. She was given a “homemade” traditional Chinese medicine that contained unknown ingredients. The patient took the remedy for 4 months and stopped taking it when the abdominal pain and diarrhea developed 6 months before this admission. She did not take other medications and had no known drug allergies. The patient lived with her husband and son in an urban area of Hong Kong, and she did not work outside the home. She did not vape or smoke cigarettes, and she did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her mother and father were healthy; there was no family history of gastroenterologic, autoimmune, or hereditary diseases. On evaluation, the temporal temperature was 37.2°C, the blood pressure 120/65 mm Hg, and the heart rate 85 beats per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20. Examinations CME at NEJM.org of the thyroid, heart, and lungs were normal. The abdomen was soft and nontender. There was no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopa-thy. Moderate pitting edema was observed in the lower legs, up to the mid-calf. Dr. W.S. Agnes Chan: On dermatologic examination, the patient had patchy hair loss, with a large patch of alopecia at the vertex of the scalp; there was no scarring of the scalp (Fig. 1A). A hair-pull test (in which 40 to 60 strands of closely grouped hair are gently pulled, with more than 10% of hairs pulled out indicating a positive result) was negative. There were symmetric brown macules over the lateral lower cheeks and malar regions of the face (Fig. 1B and 1C), and hyperpigmentation and diffuse brown-gray mac-ules were observed over the palms and the pal-mar aspects of the fingers (Fig. 1D and 1E). Onychodystrophy was present on all the fingernails (Fig. 1E) and toenails. There was onycholy-sis with distal separation of the nail plates from the nail beds, thinned nail plates, distal nail-plate crumbling, and onychomadesis with proximal separation of the nail plates from the nail matrices (Fig. 1E and 1F). Dr. Wu: The blood level of hemoglobin was 10.0 g per deciliter (reference range, 11.9 to 15.1) with a low mean corpuscular volume. The white-cell count, C-reactive protein level, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in blood were normal. The blood level of potassium was 2.9 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.5 to 5.0), ionized calcium 0.85 mmol per liter (reference range, 1.13 to 1.32), phosphate 0.52 mmol per liter (reference range, 0.72 to 1.43), and zinc 8.8 μmol per liter (reference range, 10.7 to 18.0). The blood level of albumin was 14 g per liter (reference range, 33 to 48). The protein level in a spot urine sample was normal. A stool culture showed normal enteric flora. Testing of a stool specimen for Clostridium difficile antigen and Shiga toxin was negative, as was a stool examination for ova and parasites. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2018,40,nejm-case-2018-40,"A 47-Year-Old Woman with Recurrent Sinusitis, Cough, and Bronchiectasis","Dr. Christopher J. Richards: A 47-year-old woman was evaluated at the outpatient pulmonary clinic of this hospital because of recurrent sinusitis with progressive cough and bronchiectasis. Since her mid-20s, the patient had had recurrent episodes of sinus congestion, with two or three sinus infections annually, which had prompted treatment with multiple courses of antibiotics. When she was approximately 30 years of age, she was evaluated by an otorhinologist at another hospital, who suggested the possibility of an allergic trigger. Skin testing revealed environmental allergies, to dust, grass, and cats. Blood testing revealed allergies to multiple foods, including milk, yeast, wheat, gluten, rye, and egg white. Elimination of milk, grains, and eggs from her diet resulted in a reduction in sinus symptoms for approximately 5 years. However, sinus congestion and sinus infections recurred in subsequent years. Three years before the current evaluation, a persistent cough developed. The patient was evaluated at a second hospital; she received a diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia and was treated. Thereafter, she was referred to a third hospital for sinus surgery with turbinectomy. Approximately 6 months before the current evaluation, the patient noted the onset of daily production of yellowish-white sputum. The amount of sputum increased, and the sputum occasionally appeared green. Two months later, the patient was evaluated by her primary care physician at the second hospital. Chest radiography was notable for bronchiectasis, predominantly in the upper and middle lung zones. A sputum culture reportedly grew Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Mycobacterium abscessus. A complete blood count and results of kidney- and liver-function tests were normal. The blood level of IgE was normal (5 IU per milliliter; reference range, 0 to 158), as was the alpha1-antitrypsin level (146 mg per deciliter; reference range, 100 to 190). A test for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody was negative, as was radioallergosorbent testing for environmental allergens that are common in the northeastern United States. Pulmonary-function testing report-edly revealed a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of 2.22 liters (80% of the predicted value), a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 2.72 liters (81% of the predicted value), and a ratio of FEV1 to FVC of 82%. The total lung capacity was normal, but the ratio of residual volume to total lung capacity was elevated, at 45% (predicted value, 35%). The diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide was normal. Inhaled flutica-sone propionate–salmeterol and levofloxacin were administered, and the cough diminished temporarily. Additional courses of levofloxacin were prescribed for recurrent cough and sputum production during the next 4 months, until the patient was evaluated in the pulmonary clinic of this hospital. During her evaluation in the pulmonary clinic, the patient reported mild but increasing dyspnea on exertion and progressive fatigue. She had persistent sinus congestion and occasional headaches. She had no history of asthma, heart-failure symptoms, hemoptysis, fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss, myalgias, arthralgias, rash, or gastrointestinal symptoms. She reported no sick contacts and had no known exposure to tuberculosis. The patient had a history of migraines. She had undergone tonsillectomy in the remote past, uterine polypectomy 3 years earlier, bilateral laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis 4 years earlier, and removal of a benign breast mass 8 years earlier. Her medications included inhaled flutica-sone propionate–salmeterol and over-the-counter guaifenesin–phenylephrine. She had no known allergies to medications. She had never smoked and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. She was engaged to be married and had no children. She lived in Massachusetts, and her travel history included trips to Canada and the Caribbean. She worked in an office and had no known occupational or inhalational exposures; she had no animal exposures, although she enjoyed gardening. Her father had had prostate cancer, coronary artery disease, and a stroke, and her mother had had coronary artery disease and had undergone a thyroidectomy for a benign nodule. Her brother had allergic rhinitis, and her sister was healthy. The patient appeared to be well and comfortable. The respiratory rate was 14 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while she was breathing ambient air. The height was 165 cm, the weight 64 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 23.5. There was no tenderness on sinus percussion. Crackles were present at the right apex on lung auscultation. There was no clubbing, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Jad S. Husseini: Posteroanterior and lateral radiographs of the chest showed “tram track” opacities that involved both upper lung zones and the left lower lung zone, a finding consistent with bronchiectasis. The lung volumes were normal. There was no consolidative opacity or evidence of pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy (Fig. 1). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed bronchiectasis that involved all lobes of the lung but was most severe in the right upper lobe. Areas of mucous plugging were present in airways in the upper lobes. There were scattered “tree in bud” opacities, as well as multiple scattered solid pulmonary nodules, measuring up to 1.5 cm in diameter. There was no evidence of pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopa-thy (Fig. 2). Dr. Richards: Examination of a sputum sample revealed 3+ to 4+ acid-fast bacilli, along with occasional polymorphonuclear leukocytes and a few gram-positive bacteria. Diagnostic tests were performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,20,nejm-case-2010-20,A 32-Year-Old Woman with Oligomenorrhea and Infertility,"Dr. Elizabeth Guancial (Medicine): A 32-year-old woman was evaluated because of oli-gomenorrhea and difficulty becoming pregnant. Menarche had occurred at 12 years of age and menses were regular until the patient began taking oral contraceptives at 20 years of age. At 25 years of age, she discontinued oral contraceptives and irregular menstrual cycles developed, ranging from 31 to 51 days, with menstrual flow of 7 days’ duration. Between the ages of 28 and 32 years, she had unprotected coitus with her husband but did not conceive. At 32 years of age, her primary care provider referred her to a gynecologist because of infertility. The patient reported that testing with over-the-counter ovulation-predictor kits did not show evidence of ovulation. Pelvic examination revealed no abnormalities. Clomiphene citrate was administered (100 mg on days 5 through 9 of the menstrual cycle). Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. A hystero-salpingogram was normal. Two months later, the patient was seen in the reproductive endocrine clinic of another hospital. She reported frequent acne and facial hair that she removed manually. She had no pain with menstruation and no intermenstrual bleeding. Papani-colaou smears had been normal, and there was no history of sexually transmitted diseases, use of intrauterine devices, or exposure to diethylstilbestrol. Her only medications were prenatal vitamins and folate, and results of hemoglobin electrophoresis and cystic fibrosis screening tests had reportedly been normal. Clomi-phene citrate (150 mg) was administered (on days 5 through 9 of the cycle). Ultra-sonography of the pelvis revealed that the endometrium was 8.8 mm thick and homogeneously echogenic; fluid and echogenic material that was thought to be blood was present in the cavity, and 5 to 10 simple cysts were present in the right ovary. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. One month later, the serum level of human chorionic gonadotropin was elevated; ultrasonography revealed a single intrauterine fetus. Routine laboratory-test results were normal. The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus, which was diet-controlled. After a 40-week gestation, the patient delivered a healthy infant by means of spontaneous vaginal delivery. She breast-fed her child for 12 months and had one spontaneous episode of menstrual flow during that time. Glu-cose intolerance persisted, but she declined treatment. She had frequent headaches, attributed to sinusitis. When the patient was 34 years of age, computed tomography (CT) of the sinuses, performed because of persistent frontal headaches and nasal discharge, revealed a lesion in the sella. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed 11 days later revealed a lesion (2.8 cm by 2.4 cm by 2.4 cm and isointense to gray matter on T1-weighted and T2-weighted images) that extended into the suprasellar region and abutted the optic chiasm, with mild compression and possible invasion of the right cavernous sinus. With the administration of contrast material, mild patchy enhancement was evident. The skull was diffusely thickened, and the frontal sinuses were prominent. Results of laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. The patient was referred to the neuroendocrinology clinic of this hospital. The patient reported decreased libido after stopping oral contraceptives, intermittent hot flashes accompanied by palpitations, and amenorrhea for almost 1 year. She had occasional “floaters” in her vision but no loss of peripheral vision. She had chronic pain and stiffness in the knees, shoulders, and hands, as well as occasional numbness and tingling in the hands, which had been occurring for approximately 13 years. During the same period, increasing numbers of coarse dark hairs grew on her face; darkening of the skin of the back of her neck, axilla, and groin occurred; her weight had increased 18.1 kg; and snoring, fatigue, and occasional daytime somnolence, suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea, developed. Her shoe size had increased from size 7 (European size 38) medium to size 8 (European size 39) double-wide, her ring size had also increased, and she thought that her nose had become larger. She did not have abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, chest pain, respiratory symptoms, peripheral edema, or excessive thirst or hunger or polyuria. Approximately 2 years earlier, during her pregnancy, a sharp headache, associated with visual changes, had developed during an airplane flight to another city. CT scans of the brain at a local hospital reportedly showed evidence of left frontal sinusitis. After receiving the report of the abnormal CT shortly before the present evaluation, she contacted the other facility and was told that the report of the earlier CT had described expansion of the sella turcica. For the previous 2 years, the patient had had intermittent episodes of acute sinusitis, treated with antibiotics and nasal spray, and seasonal environmental allergies; plantar warts had been excised, and wisdom teeth had been extracted in the past. She lived with her husband and baby, worked in academics, drank alcohol rarely, and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. She was of white and Asian ancestry. Her mother had high cholesterol and osteoporosis; her father was obese, with peripheral edema and prostatic hypertrophy; and a maternal aunt had diabetes mellitus type 2. Medications included vitamins, calcium, n−3 fish oil, topical tretinoin, benzoyl peroxide, and lorata-dine as needed. She had no known allergies to medications. The vital signs were normal. The weight was 74.8 kg, the height 162.6 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 29.2. The face and nose were broad, the brow was prominent, and the teeth and jaw revealed a slight underbite; there was no macroglossia. There was facial acne, multiple skin tags, and acanthosis nigricans. The hands were large, and the fingers were thick. The remainder of the examination was normal. A diagnostic test was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2020,29,nejm-case-2020-29,A 66-Year-Old Man with Fever and Shortness of Breath after Liver Transplantation,"Dr. Matthew B. Roberts: A 66-year-old man who had undergone orthotopic liver transplantation because of end-stage liver disease was admitted to this hospital because of fever and cough during the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Two days before this admission, fever, chills, and diffuse myalgias developed. The patient also noted a dry cough and nausea and that he had reduced his fluid intake. On the day of admission, the patient learned that his sister had received a diagnosis of Covid-19, and he was concerned that his symptoms might also be caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, prompting him to present to a neighborhood health center. At the health center, the patient reported mild dyspnea. He appeared comfortable, with unlabored breathing. The temperature was 37.8°C, the pulse 125 beats per minute, the blood pressure 127/78 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. Auscultation of the lungs revealed normal breath sounds. Further evaluation in the emergency department of this hospital was recommended. On arrival at the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing cough and nausea but no chest pain, abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhea. He had a history of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, obesity, peripheral neuropathy, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage liver disease due to alcohol use disorder and hepatitis B virus infection. Twenty-two months earlier, renal replacement therapy had been initiated for worsening renal function due to the hepatorenal syndrome, and shortly after, the patient had undergone orthotopic liver transplantation. Combined liver and kidney transplantation had been planned, but the donor kidney was unsuitable for transplantation because of extensive dissection of the renal artery. After the liver transplantation, the patient’s renal function improved, and renal replacement therapy was discontinued. Histopathological examination of tissue from the explanted native liver revealed moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma without evidence of intravascular invasion. Current medications included tacrolimus, myco-phenolate, amlodipine, doxazosin, gabapentin, omeprazole, ursodiol, and magnesium oxide. There were no known allergies. The patient was widowed and lived with his sister and several friends in an apartment in an urban area of New England. He was born in Central America and had immigrated to the United States three decades earlier. He had smoked tobacco in the past but had quit 14 years earlier. He had stopped drinking alcohol 3 years earlier; during periods of heavy drinking, he had used cocaine and marijuana occasionally. On examination, the patient appeared comfortable. The temperature was 38.0°C, the pulse 99 beats per minute, the blood pressure 134/73 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while he was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 32.1. The respiratory effort and breath sounds were normal, as was the remainder of the physical examination. Nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for influenza viruses and respiratory syn-cytial virus was negative. A nasopharyngeal swab for nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was obtained. Urinalysis revealed a pH of 5.5, a specific gravity of 1.008, 1+ blood, and 1+ protein. A urine test for legionella antigen was negative. Gram’s staining of a sputum specimen revealed rare polymorphonuclear leukocytes and few mixed gram-positive and gram-negative organisms with no specific type predominating; sputum and blood samples were obtained for culture. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities that were unchanged from a study that had been performed 6 months earlier; the corrected QT interval was 424 msec. Dr. Eric W. Zhang: Chest radiography (Fig. 1A) revealed low lung volumes with patchy, conflu-ent airspace opacities in the mid-to-lower lungs that were more prominent on the left side than on the right side, with peripheral predominance. There were no radiographically significant pleural effusions. Dr. Roberts: Intravenous normal saline, intravenous ceftriaxone, and oral azithromycin were administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. On admission, the oxygen saturation was 88% while he was breathing ambient air, and auscultation of the lungs revealed coarse crackles. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. Amlodipine and doxazosin were discontinued. The next morning, the polymerase-chain-reaction test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA showed a positive result. Atorvastatin, oral prednisone, and hydroxychloroquine were initiated, and the dose of mycophenolate was decreased. During the next 2 days, the temperature increased to 39.2°C. Chills, myalgias, nausea, and cough continued; dyspnea increased; and headache, diarrhea, and occasional vomiting developed. Blood cultures obtained at the time of admission remained negative, and the sputum culture grew normal respiratory flora. Acetaminophen and ondansetron were administered, and the rate of supplemental oxygen was increased to 6 liters per minute. The patient was placed in the prone position in bed. On the fourth hospital day, the serum level of interleukin-6 was 24.6 pg per milliliter (reference value, <1.8); the levels of inflammatory markers and other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. On the morning of the fifth hospital day, the oxygen saturation fell below 90% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute. The patient was unable to speak in full sentences because of dyspnea, and auscultation of the lungs revealed decreased air entry. Dr. Zhang: Chest radiography (Fig. 1B) revealed low lung volumes with increased diffuse multi-focal airspace opacities. There were no radio-graphically significant pleural effusions. Dr. Roberts: Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nonrebreather face mask at a rate of 15 liters per minute. The patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (ICU), the trachea was intubated, and mechan-",{},,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. ,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. ,0
NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2014,34,nejm-case-2014-34,A 7-Year-Old Boy with Focal Seizures and Progressive Weakness,"Dr. Michael Ho (Neurology): A 7-year-old boy was evaluated in an outpatient clinic at this hospital because of focal seizures and progressive right-sided weakness. The patient had been well until 18 months earlier, when intermittent shaking of his right hand developed, which quickly progressed to involve the entire right arm. Evaluation at another hospital included electroencephalography (EEG) that revealed frequent left-sided discharges, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head that revealed no clear atrophy but a lesion in the left motor strip, and a lumbar puncture with normal results on cerebrospinal fluid analysis. A diagnosis of focal motor seizures was made; levetiracetam and glucocorticoids were administered. Approximately 2 months after the onset of symptoms, twitching of the arm and hand became nearly constant and was accompanied by facial twitching; a clinical diagnosis of epilepsia partialis continua was made. Intravenous immune globulin was administered, and the twitching in his face and arm almost completely resolved. Approximately 3 months later, however, the symptoms recurred. During the year before this evaluation, the right arm and the right side of the face began to twitch nearly continuously, with more intense focal clonic activity occurring 2 to 20 times per day; there was associated progressive weakness of the muscles of the right arm (more severe distally than proximally) and the right side of the face, increasing spasticity in the fingers and wrist, and subtle weakness of the right leg. There was no history of loss of consciousness, apnea, cyanosis, or seizure activity involving the left side. MRI studies of the head that were performed between 9 months and 3 months before this evaluation reportedly revealed a T2 -weighted hyperintense lesion in the left motor strip involving the adjacent white matter and, in more recent studies, the parietal region, with no clear evidence of atrophy. A brain biopsy was recommended. The family sought a second opinion at this hospital. The patient was born at 36 weeks of gestation after the onset of preterm labor and had normal or advanced developmental milestones (including reading at 3 years of age). He had reactive airway disease and had undergone tonsillectomy, adenoid-ectomy, and urologic surgery. Medications included levetiracetam (800 mg twice daily), clonazepam (0.5 mg in the morning and 1 mg in the evening), oxcarbazepine (360 mg in the morning and 420 mg in the evening), val-proic acid (375 mg twice daily), lipoic acid, vitamin B6, and coenzyme Q10. Immunizations were current. He had no known drug allergies. He consumed a ketogenic diet (a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet), which helped to control his seizures, and he participated in occupational and physical therapy. He lived with his parents and older sibling, was in second grade, and did well academically. His mother and sibling had attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder, a paternal aunt had bipolar disorder, and other paternal relatives had depression. On examination, the patient was awake, alert, and pleasant. His speech was clear and fluent, with mild dysarthria. He seemed to be intelligent, with good social skills. The pupils and extra-ocular movements were normal. There was weakness on the right side of the face, the palate was elevated symmetrically, and the tongue protruded along the midline. There was nearly continuous twitching of the right lower facial muscles. Muscle bulk, tone, and strength were normal in the left arm and leg. In the right arm, strength was 4/5 proximally, with little movement of the fingers or wrist and distal-muscle spasticity. Strength in the right leg was 4+/5, with slightly increased reflexes. The gait was mildly hemipa-retic. A brain biopsy was recommended, and the family resumed care at the other hospital. During the next 6 months, twitching was constant in the right side of the face and nearly continuous in the right arm. The focal seizures in the right side of the face and right arm and leg (which frequently caused the patient to fall) occurred up to 20 times daily when he was tired or sick or had not adhered to his diet. Weakness of the right leg and arm increased, and his gait became more hemiparetic, despite continued medical therapy with levetiracetam, clonazepam, oxcarbazepine, and valproic acid and general adherence to the ketogenic diet. Six months after the initial evaluation at this hospital, the patient returned to this hospital for care. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) revealed seizure activity in the left frontal lobe, with discharges predominantly in the posterior left frontal cortex, along the frontal operculum of the motor cortex (precentral gyrus) and the area associated with control of the hand, and abnormal somatosensory-evoked magnetic fields in the left hemisphere, findings suggestive of cortical dysfunction. During the MEG recording, there was continuous right facial twitching and some evidence that the right hemisphere was dominant for language. Three months later, the patient was admitted to this hospital. A 24-hour EEG showed that the focus of his continuous right facial twitching was in the left frontal area, with a broad electrical field involving the entire left hemisphere. EEG also recorded six generalized tonic–clonic seizures characterized by spike-and-wave discharges (1 to 2 Hz); the site of maximal amplitude was the midline central region, and the duration was approximately 15 to 40 seconds. The next day, a diagnostic procedure was performed. ",{},"Rasmussen’s encephalitis, possibly with cortical dysplasia. ",,"Rasmussen’s encephalitis, possibly with cortical dysplasia. ",0
NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2008,17,nejm-case-2008-17,A 63-Year-Old Man with Metastatic Renal-Cell Carcinoma,"A 63-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of a mass in the left kidney and pulmonary nodules. The patient had been well until approximately 5 months before admission, when mild nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and constipation developed, followed by fatigue, weight loss of 3.2 kg, and a nonproductive cough. One month before admission, he saw his primary care physician. Examination revealed scrotal varicoceles that were new and varicosities of both legs that were unchanged from previous examinations; results of the remainder of the examination were normal. Laboratory-test results and radiographs of the upper gastrointestinal tract that were obtained after the administration of contrast material were also normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed at another facility, revealed a mass in the lower pole of the left kidney, 9 cm by 10 cm by 13 cm, which extended approximately to the hilum, with no apparent invasion of the renal vein. There were varicosities in Gerota’s fascia surrounding the mass. Another mass, 3.3 cm in diameter, was present in the left adrenal gland. There were no abnormalities in the right kidney or adrenal gland. There were multiple hypodense cysts in the liver. CT scanning of the chest showed multiple pulmonary lesions (14 in the right lung and 11 in the left), ranging from 2 mm to 2 cm in diameter. Eight days before admission, the patient saw a urologist and an oncologist at this hospital. His vital signs were normal, and his abdomen was symmetric and soft, with no tenderness, distention, or palpable masses. The patient had normal descended testes, a large varicocele above the left testicle, and numerous prominent superficial veins over the scrotum. There were no palpable lymph nodes, and the results of the remainder of the examination were normal. Laboratory values, including the hematocrit, white-cell count, results of coagulation tests, levels of serum electrolytes, and results of liver- and renal-function tests, were normal. A bone scan revealed mild dextroscoliosis of the spine and a focal area of radiotracer uptake at the level of the third lumbar vertebra that was thought to be degenerative; the scan was otherwise normal. Five days later, 3 days before admission, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the kidneys showed a heterogeneous solid mass in the lower pole of the left kidney, 9.9 cm by 8.4 cm by 11.3 cm, which enhanced after the administration of gadolinium. There was no involvement of the left renal vein, and the inferior vena cava was patent. There was a mass, 2.8 cm by 2.7 cm by 2.4 cm, in the left adrenal gland, with collateral vessels in the left perinephric region. One day before admission, the hemoglobin level was 13.2 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5). The results of other tests, including the white-cell count, levels of serum electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, and lactate dehydrogenase, tests of renal and liver function, analysis of the urine, and an electrocardiogram, were normal. The next day, the patient was admitted to the hospital. There was no history of fever, night sweats, headache, diplopia, bleeding, ecchymosis, hema-turia, dysuria, urinary frequency, or flank pain. The patient had hypertension and a history of skin cancer. A vasectomy had been performed in the past. He had no allergies; his medications included lisinopril and psyllium. He lived with his wife and one of his children; he was a retired businessman who exercised regularly. He drank alcohol in moderation and had stopped smoking more than 20 years earlier. Two sisters had had uterine cancer, his children were healthy, and there was no family history of genitourinary cancer. On examination, vital signs were normal; the scrotal varicocele appeared to have increased in size, and the remainder of the physical examination was unchanged. A diagnostic procedure was performed, and additional management decisions were made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2009,41,nejm-case-2009-41,A 16-Year-Old Boy with Hypothermia and Frostbite,"Dr. Benjamin Sandefur (Emergency Medicine): A 16-year-old boy was admitted to the hospital after being found unconscious in a snow bank at 6 a.m. on New Year’s Day. He had been well until the night before admission, when he attended a party where alcohol was consumed. He was last seen at approximately 11 p.m. Approximately 2 hours later, his friends and family noticed his absence and notified police; a search was begun. At approximately 6 a.m., he was found unconscious in a snowbank by local firefighters and police officers. The ambient temperature was −15°C (5°F), with a wind-chill factor of approximately −29°C (−20°F). He was partially undressed, with his pants down and his right boot off; his limbs were buried in the snow, and a layer of ice surrounded his right foot. In the ambulance, an intravenous catheter was placed, and 150 ml of crystalloid was infused. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital, arriving at 6:50 a.m. On initial examination, he was drowsy and slow to respond but oriented, with spontaneous respirations and no shivering. The rectal temperature was 31.3°C (88.3°F), the blood pressure 153/62 mm Hg (20 minutes later, 112/56), the pulse 72 beats per minute (20 minutes later, 52), and the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute; a pulse oximeter showed an oxygen saturation of 93% while he was breathing ambient air. There were abrasions on his forehead. The distal right foot was encased in ice, both hands were cold and hard to palpation, and the left foot was cold but soft. The arms, buttocks, and legs (up to the thighs) were purplish-red, and the toes and fingers were blue. There were abrasions on the dorsal surfaces of the hands, legs, and feet. Neurologic examination showed no focal abnormalities. The white-cell count was 14,600 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 4500 to 13,000), with 81% neutrophils (reference range, 40 to 62), 16% lymphocytes (reference range, 27 to 40), and 3% monocytes (reference range, 4 to 11); the level of potassium was 3.2 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.4 to 4.8), carbon dioxide 18.3 mmol per liter (reference range, 23.0 to 31.9), glucose 60 mg per deciliter (3.3 mmol per liter) (reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]), aspartate aminotransferase 58 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 40), lipase 127 U per liter (reference range, 13 to 60), amylase 206 U per liter (reference range, 3 to 100), and creatine kinase 3815 U per liter (reference range, 60 to 400). The remainder of the complete blood count, tests of renal function, and plasma levels of calcium, phosphorus, bilirubin, alanine amino-transferase, alkaline phosphatase, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal. Results of toxicology screening of a specimen of blood revealed an ethanol level of 1172 mg per liter (25.4 mmol per liter) (reference level for toxicity, >1000 mg per liter [>21.7 mmol per liter]) and no other drugs. Electrocardiography revealed sinus bradycardia of 59 beats per minute, with sinus arrhythmia and a small Osborn wave (upward deflection at the junction of the QRS complex and the ST segment), features consistent with hypothermia (Fig. 1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Another intravenous catheter was placed peripherally in the left antecubital fossa, and warm normal saline was infused. The room temperature was increased, and hot blankets and an adjustable forced-air warming system were applied. The hands and right foot were placed in water at 40°C (104°F) for active moist rewarming. Morphine was administered intravenously for pain. The patient aroused after rewarming, and he reported having consumed alcohol at the party. He remembered leaving the party and attempting to walk home, falling repeatedly in the snow; he did not recall being assaulted. He had been healthy and had received all childhood immunizations. He was a high-school student and lived with his parents. He had smoked marijuana in the past and drank alcohol occasionally. He took no medications and had no known allergies. After 3 hours in the emergency department, the rectal temperature was 37.3°C (99.2°F), the blood pressure 143/56 mm Hg, and the pulse 81 beats per minute with sinus arrhythmia. He was awake and alert. Blood-filled bullae had developed on the hands and right foot, which were now soft but remained dusky and mottled (Fig. 1). Left dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses were palpable; right pedal pulses were detected by noninvasive Doppler imaging. There was no detectable blood flow to the fingers or the distal right foot. The hands and feet were anesthetic. Six hours after arrival, a management decision was made. ",{},Stage 3 hypothermia.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2011,21,nejm-case-2011-21,A 31-Year-Old Man with ALK-Positive Adenocarcinoma of the Lung,"A 31-year-old man was seen in the outpatient cancer center at this hospital because of dysphagia and a mediastinal mass. The patient had been well until approximately 3 months before this evaluation, when progressive difficulty swallowing (solid foods but not liquids) developed that was occasionally associated with choking and regurgitation. On examination by his primary care physician 6 weeks before this evaluation, the patient’s blood pressure was 140/90 mm Hg, and the remainder of the examination was normal. A course of omeprazole was prescribed. Symptoms persisted, and 4 weeks later, a barium-swallow examination performed at another hospital showed narrowing of the distal third of the esophagus, which was thought to be caused by extrinsic compression. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed after the administration of oral and intravenous nonionic contrast medium. The images revealed a heterogeneous soft-tissue mass (4.0 cm in diameter) adjacent to the distal esophagus, gastrohepatic and subcarinal lymphadenopathy (including nodes up to 2.5 cm in diameter), and numerous nodules (<1 cm in diameter) in the right lung. The patient was referred to the cancer center at this hospital. At presentation, the patient reported that the dysphagia had not worsened, and he was not aware of having lost weight. He also reported a morning cough (but no persistent coughing or difficulty breathing) and severe anxiety about his current medical problem. There was no odynophagia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, or fatigue. He had had a history of intermittent heartburn for several years, asthma in childhood, and three episodes of palpitations of unknown cause. His only medication was zolpidem, and he had no known allergies. He lived with his wife and child, worked in a technical field, and was physically active, participating in sports and working out regularly. He drank alcohol, had a history of smoking (10 pack-years) but had stopped 2 years earlier, and did not use illicit drugs. A maternal aunt had an unknown type of cancer. On examination, the patient was anxious and pacing but in no acute distress; the weight was 82.7 kg and the height 175 cm; the vital signs, oxygen saturation, and remainder of the physical examination were normal. The level of carcinoembryonic antigen was 6.5 ng per milliliter (reference range, <3.4) and that of human chorionic gonadotropin 1.2 IU per liter (reference range, <0.7). The complete blood count was normal, as were serum measurements of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, and alpha-fetoprotein and tests of coagulation and kidney and liver function.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,31,nejm-case-2012-31,"An 18-Year-Old Man with Blurred Vision, Dysarthria, and Ataxia","Dr. Patricia L. Musolino (Neurology): An 18-year-old man was transferred to this hospital because of blurred vision, dysarthria, and ataxia, which had reportedly progressed to coma. The patient had been well until 6 p.m. the evening before admission, when he had an abrupt onset of weakness, shaking and buckling of his legs, and clumsiness of his right hand. Approximately 20 minutes later, his speech became slurred; his parents transported him to the emergency department at another hospital. While in transit, the dysarthria worsened and the patient reported blurred vision. On arrival at the hospital 1 hour after the onset of symptoms, he required assistance getting into a wheelchair. He reported being off-balance and light-headed, with blurred vision and pain at the base of the right side of the skull. On examination, he was alert and oriented but slow to respond, and he intermittently laughed inappropriately. The vital signs were normal, and the oxygen saturation was 100% while he was breathing ambient air. On neurologic examination, the pupils and extraocular movements were reportedly normal, without nystagmus. The speech was slurred. The first cranial nerve was not tested; results of testing of the other cranial nerves were normal. The deep-tendon reflexes were 1+ and symmetric. Alternating movements of the hands were slow, with some lack of coordination; his performance on finger-to-nose testing was accurate. The white-cell count was 8600 per cubic millimeter, with 80% granulocytes, 14% lymphocytes, and 6% monocytes. The remainder of the complete blood count and the results of renal- and liver-function tests were normal, as were the levels of electrolytes and glucose, measurements of arterial blood gases performed while the patient was breathing ambient air, and other test results. Screening of the blood for alcohol and the urine for toxins and drugs was negative. Computed tomography (CT) of the head was reportedly normal. The patient was admitted to the other hospital. A lumbar puncture was performed; tube 1 of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) appeared bloody, with gradual clearing. Reportedly, the white-cell count was 9 per cubic millimeter in tube 1 and 1 per cubic millimeter in tube 4, and the red-cell count was 10,000 per cubic millimeter in tube 1 and 54 per cubic millimeter in tube 4. The protein level was 58 mg per deciliter, and the glucose level 62 mg per deciliter (3.4 mmol per liter). No organisms were seen on Gram’s staining. Overnight, the patient frequently flailed his arms and legs, according to his mother. On examination the next morning, he was alert, oriented, communicative, and restless, with intermittent movements of the arms; strength was normal, eye movements were full, pupils were reactive, and there was mild ataxia. At approximately 11:30 a.m., difficulty walking developed, violent shaking of his legs and arms began, and he became unable to speak. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed 30 minutes later, after the administration of lorazepam (5 mg in 1-mg increments to decrease motion artifact), reportedly revealed abnormal signal changes in the brain stem. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) at the other hospital. On examination, he was somnolent but arousable to painful stimuli. During the next 3 hours, he appeared to see and hear his mother but was unable to speak. Shortly before transfer to this hospital, extensor posturing with clenched fists and rigid arms developed. On arrival of the transport team, succinylcholine, propofol, rocuronium, and fen-tanyl were administered and the trachea was intubated. The patient was transported by helicopter to this hospital, arriving approximately 23 hours after the onset of symptoms. Lorazepam and additional fentanyl were administered in transit. The patient’s history of birth and development was normal, and he had been previously healthy, with a learning disability. He had been scratched by a neighbor’s dog 3 weeks before admission; the vaccination status of the dog was unknown, but the animal continued to appear well. Approximately 2 days before admission, the patient had removed an embedded tick, which was not engorged, from his skin. He took no medications and had no allergies. He lived with his family, had attended 3 years of high school, and worked in a service position. His grandfather and mother had had transient ischemic symptoms, a maternal aunt had died of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, and a half-sibling had a learning disability. The patient was admitted to the pediatric ICU at this hospital. On examination, he was mechanically ventilated with an endotracheal tube. There was tonic deviation of the head to the left side. The pupils were 3 mm in diameter and weakly reactive, corneal reflexes were present, and there was no oculocephalic reflex. The tone in the arms was slightly increased, and they were held in the extended position. The fingers were firmly flexed but without Hoffmann’s sign (flexion of the terminal phalanx of the thumb and of the second and third phalanges of another finger on tapping the index, middle, or ring finger). The legs were extended and tremulous, with greatly increased extensor tone. There was sustained clonus, and the plantar reflexes were extensor. The patient responded to noxious stimulation with increased extension of the arms and triple flexion (hip, knee, and ankle) of the legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. The white-cell count was 10,900 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 4500 to 13,000), with 85% neutrophils (reference range, 40 to 62), 9% lymphocytes (reference range, 27 to 40), and 6% monocytes (reference range, 6 to 11); the serum level of phosphorus was 0.9 mg per deciliter (0.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 2.6 to 4.5 mg per deciliter [0.8 to 1.5 mmol per liter]); and results of coagulation and renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of hemoglobin, platelets, d-dimer, lactic acid, electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, lipase, amylase, total protein, and albumin.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,16,nejm-case-2019-16,A 53-Year-Old Man with Cough and Eosinophilia,"Dr. David M. Dudzinski: A 53-year-old man was evaluated in an urgent care clinic of this hospital for 3 months of cough. Five years before the current evaluation, the patient began to have exertional dyspnea and received a diagnosis of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, with a resting left ventricular outflow gradient of 110 mm Hg on echocardiography. Although he received medical therapy, symptoms persisted, and percutaneous alcohol septal ablation was performed 1 year before the current evaluation, with resolution of the exertional dyspnea. Nine months later, the patient began to have cough that was intermittently productive of yellow sputum. The cough developed shortly after he had returned from travel to Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Antitussive medications did not provide symptom relief. Three years before this cough developed, three discrete episodes of upper respiratory tract infection and sinusitis had occurred, for which courses of amoxicillin–clavulanic acid, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, and azithro-mycin had been prescribed. During the current episode, the cough waxed and waned in intensity, with no clear relation to other symptoms or the time of day. Ten days before the current evaluation, the patient traveled to the Middle East; the weather was colder than he had expected and he felt chills. During the trip, the cough worsened — with more frequent and copious production of yellow-green sputum and associated coryza, pharyngitis, frontal sinus “heaviness,” malaise, and fatigue — such that he had to miss work after he returned home. He called his cardiologist and was advised to present to an urgent care clinic of this hospital for evaluation. A review of systems was negative for fever, anorexia, unintentional weight loss, night sweats, dyspnea, hemoptysis, chest pressure or discomfort, pleuritic pain, wheezing, light-headedness, palpitations, syncope, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgia, arthralgia, lymphadenopathy, and pruritus. The patient had had multiple contacts with nonspecific illnesses while he had been traveling both 3 months and 10 days before the current evaluation. The most recent tuberculin skin test had been performed 10 years earlier and had been negative. He had not undergone seasonal influenza vaccination. The patient’s medical history was also notable for placement of an implantable cardioverter– defibrillator (ICD) for ventricular tachycardia that had been induced during an electrophysiological study. He had allergic rhinitis, obstructive sleep apnea, gonococcal urethritis, and dyslipidemia. Medications included metoprolol succinate and atorvastatin. He had had no known adverse reactions to medications, except prolongation of the corrected QT interval with disopyramide. The patient was born in South Asia, raised in the Middle East, and educated in the United States, where he had lived for the past 25 years. He was an executive and traveled frequently for work, generally to urban areas and only rarely to rural areas, although he had walked barefoot near beaches in various locations in Southeast Asia. He was divorced and had a child. He smoked cigars occasionally and drank 1 to 2 glasses of wine nightly but did not use illicit substances. He had been sexually active while traveling but had used condoms. Several first-degree relatives had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. His mother had died 3 years earlier from pulmonary tuberculosis, but he had not been in contact with her during her illness. On examination, the patient appeared to be comfortable. The temperature was 37.2°C, the pulse 66 beats per minute, the blood pressure 122/89 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. During the evaluation, the patient coughed twice, and the second cough produced light-green sputum with a bloody streak. The oropharynx had no erythema or exu-dates, but there was a slight yellow discoloration on the tongue. There was no tenderness on percussion of the sinuses or conjunctival hyperemia. There was no cervical, submandibular, supracla-vicular, or axillary lymphadenopathy. Auscultation revealed a clear chest, without rales, wheezing, or egophony. The jugular venous pulse was 6 cm of water. There was a crescendo–decrescendo systolic murmur (grade 3/6) along the left sternal border that increased during a Valsalva maneuver. There was no edema or calf tenderness. The remainder of the examination was normal. Dr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: A posteroanterior chest radiograph (Fig. 1) showed clear lungs and a slightly enlarged heart, findings that had not changed from a study obtained 1 year earlier. There was a dual-lead ICD that terminated in the right atrium and right ventricle. Dr. Dudzinski: An electrocardiogram (Fig. 2) was notable for sinus rhythm, left ventricular hypertrophy, and T-wave inversions in leads I, aVL, V4, V5, and V6, findings that had not changed from previous tracings. A 5-day course of azithromycin was prescribed, along with acetaminophen, oxymetazoline nasal spray, and a phenol-based topical throat spray. A tuberculin skin test was negative for induration. Results of liver-function tests were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A trans-thoracic echocardiogram was notable for a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%, a maximum left ventricular wall thickness of 16 mm, systolic anterior motion of the mitral-valve chordae with trace mitral regurgitation, and a resting left ventricular outflow gradient of 16 mm Hg; these findings had not changed from a study obtained 9 months earlier. Azithromycin therapy resulted in decreased fatigue and malaise and reduced the frequency of the cough but did not eliminate it. A few episodes of hemoptysis with scant blood occurred, and bloody streaks were present in nasal mucus. After the patient completed the course of azithro-mycin, additional laboratory tests were performed (Table 1). Cultures of the stool and sputum were negative, as was examination of the stool and sputum for ova and parasites. A hypersensitivity pneumonitis panel (including a test for antibodies to aspergillus) was also negative, as were tests for galactomannan, 1,3-β-d-glucan, and antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2. Testing for antibodies to para-gonimus was negative, but testing for antibodies to strongyloides was positive. Additional diagnostic tests were performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2009,16,nejm-case-2009-16,A 32-Year-Old Pregnant Woman with an Abnormal Fetal Ultrasound Study,"A 32-year-old pregnant woman was admitted to the hospital at 23.1 weeks of gestation, because of an abnormal fetal ultrasound study. Approximately 15 weeks earlier, a home urine test for human chorionic gonado-tropin confirmed an unplanned but highly desired pregnancy. A sonogram of the pelvis 14.5 weeks before admission revealed a single gestational sac containing an embryo that was consistent with a gestational age of 8 weeks 4 days; the uterus, sac, and embryo appeared normal. The patient came to the outpatient obstetrics office of this hospital at 11.7 weeks of gestation for her first prenatal visit. She felt well. One year earlier, she had delivered a full-term healthy child at this hospital. Hypertension had developed during labor, for which labetalol had been administered transiently postpartum. Testing for the human immunodeficiency virus had been negative 18 months earlier. She was of western European ancestry, and her parents, siblings, and child were healthy. Medications included a multivitamin and folate supplement; she had previously taken oral contraceptives. She had no known drug allergies. The vital signs and physical examination were normal for the stage of pregnancy. The hematocrit was 33.9% (reference range, 36.0 to 46.0) and the mean corpuscular volume 79 μm3 (reference range, 80 to 100); the remainder of the complete blood count was normal. The blood type was A, Rh-positive, and screening for irregular antibodies was negative. A test for rubella antibody was positive, and tests for syphilis and hepatitis B surface antibody were negative, as was a cervical swab for nucleic-acid tests for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. A Papanicolaou smear of the cervix displayed acute inflammation but was otherwise normal. Approximately 7 weeks before admission, at 15.7 weeks of gestation, the blood pressure was 120/80 mm Hg. A second-trimester serum quadruple screening test (for alpha-fetoprotein, unconjugated estriol, human chorionic gonadotropin, and inhibin A) revealed a risk of Down’s syndrome of 1 out of 1700 and a risk of tri-somy 18 of 1 out of 13,000. Nineteen days before admission, a sonogram revealed a single active fetus with a normal heart rate and amniotic-fluid volume. There was a prominent nuchal fold that was at least 8 mm thick, bilateral nuchal cystic hygromas, a trace pericardial effusion, bilateral small pleural effusions, and mild bilateral pyelectasis. The inferior vena cava was large, and the fetal stomach was underfilled. The ca-vum septum pellucidum was not identified, but part of the corpus callosum was seen. The placenta was low and posterior, reaching the cervix, and the cervix was longer than 3 cm and had no funneling. The remainder of the fetal cord and placental anatomy appeared normal. The next day, ultrasonography confirmed the presence of nuchal edema and pleural effusions. The peak systolic velocity in the middle cerebral artery was normal. Amniocentesis was performed, which subsequently revealed a normal male kary-otype. Testing of maternal serum for IgG and IgM antibodies to cytomegalovirus (CMV) and toxoplasma and for syphilis was negative. Testing for parvovirus IgG antibodies was positive, but it was negative for parvovirus IgM antibodies. An echocardiogram showed a left-sided fetal heart with normal segmental anatomy, chamber dimensions, and wall motion. There were bilateral fetal pleural effusions with no evidence of right ventricular dysfunction or elevated systemic venous pressures, and the ventricular outflow tract on the right was slightly smaller than that on the left. Six days later, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed normal fetal brain tissue, moderate bilateral pleural effusions, mild pyelectasis, and diffuse subcutaneous edema of the upper torso, upper thorax, and scalp. Five days before admission, ultrasonography of the uterus revealed an active fetus with a normal heart rate and amniotic fluid volume, persistent pleural effusions, and skin thickening primarily in the upper thorax and scalp. After extensive discussion, the patient elected to proceed with termination of the pregnancy. The pregnancy was terminated by amnioinfu-sion with hypertonic saline and prostaglandins, and a stillborn 850-g male fetus was delivered vaginally. A fetal autopsy was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2015,23,nejm-case-2015-23,"A 51-Year-Old Woman with Headache, Cognitive Impairment, and Weakness","Dr. Martha R. Neagu (Neurology): A 51-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of headache, slowed speech and cognition, weakness on the left side, and a mass in the brain. The patient had been well until several months before the current admission, when she began feeling vaguely ill. Approximately 10 days before this admission, a severe throbbing headache developed that was different from her usual headaches. During the following week, her family noticed inattentiveness and slowing of her thinking and speech; she noted mild weakness on the left side, a tendency to veer to the left while walking or driving, and worsening depression. Two days before this admission, evaluation by her physician revealed anemia. She was referred to another hospital. On examination, the patient’s blood pressure was 142/82 mm Hg; the other vital signs were normal. Her speech was slow but otherwise clear and fluent, and her affect was flat. There was mild weakness of the left arm and leg and a mild pronator drift of the left arm. Plantar reflexes were flexor. Her gait was wide-based, and ambulation was slow, without apparent listing to the left. The remainder of the examination was reportedly normal. The platelet count was normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, vitamin B12, and folate and results of coagulation and liver- and renal-function tests; other test results are shown in Table 1. Two units of packed red cells were transfused, and the hematocrit increased to 31.1%. Computed tomography (CT) of the head (Fig. 1A) revealed an intrinsically hyperdense mass (3.7 cm by 2.6 cm by 3.0 cm) in the medial aspect of the right frontal lobe and adjacent corpus callosum, with associated edema in the surrounding white matter and mild midline shift to the left; the ventricles were normal in size. Intravenous dexamethasone (4 mg every 6 hours) was administered for 1 day. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), performed after the administration of gadolinium, revealed a large, enhancing mass in the medial aspect of the right frontal lobe and corpus callosum, with extensive vasogenic edema in the right frontoparietal white matter and mild midline shift to the left. On the third day, CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no evidence of a primary cancer. CT of the chest was normal. The blood level of carcinoembryonic antigen was normal. The patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation. The patient reported no diplopia, dysarthria, vertigo, dysphagia, numbness or tingling, bowel or bladder incontinence, aphasia, seizure or loss of consciousness, fever, chills, night sweats, fatigue, dyspnea, palpitations, abdominal or urinary symptoms, weight changes, cough, or chest, back, or neck pain. She had hypertension, depression, dysmenorrhea, menometrorrhagia with uterine fibroids, and gastroesophageal reflux disease, and she had had an ankle fracture after a fall. Medications at home included enalapril and fluoxetine, and medications on transfer to this hospital included lorazepam, as needed, for anxiety. She had no known allergies. She lived with her husband and one of her three adult children and did not work outside the home. She had smoked cigarettes (less than 1 pack per week) until 1 week before admission; she drank wine occasionally and did not use illicit drugs. Her father and aunt had lymphoma (the aunt reportedly had involvement of the central nervous system [CNS]), her mother had hyperlipidemia, a sister had thyroid cancer, and a brother had hypertension. On examination, the vital signs were normal, as was the oxygen saturation while the patient was breathing ambient air. The face was symmetric. There was mild weakness of the left arm and leg (with strength rated at 4 to 4+ on a scale of 0 to 5, with 5 indicating normal strength), as well as orbiting (circling of the right arm around the left on a forearm rolling test), slowed movements, and mild pronator drift of the left arm. Reflexes were brisk and symmetric, and Hoffman’s reflex was elicited. Finger-to-nose coordination was imprecise on the left side; the gait was wide-based, tentative, and unsteady, and there was decreased elevation of the left foot when the patient marched in place. Tandem, heel, and toe walking were not tested because of obvious weakness. The remainder of the physical and neurologic examinations was normal. The platelet count, lipid profile, and plasma osmolality were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, magnesium, total protein, albumin, globulin, glycated hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, vitamin B12, folate, CA 19-9, CA-125, carcinoembryonic antigen, and thyrotropin and results of coagulation and renal- and liver-function tests; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed white cells and 1+ albumin, with 3 to 5 red cells, 10 to 20 white cells, few bacteria, few squamous cells, and mu-cin per high-power field. Urine osmolality was 971 mOsm per kilogram of water. A chest radio-graph was normal. An electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 53 beats per minute and was otherwise normal. On the second day, transthoracic echocardiog-raphy revealed normal right and left ventricular function, an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 67%, trace regurgitation of the mitral valve, and trace insufficiency of the aortic, pulmonary, and tricuspid valves. MRI of the head (Fig. 1B through 1G), performed after the administration of gadolinium, revealed a homogeneously enhancing mass (2.6 cm by 4.5 cm by 2.5 cm) that was centered in the right cingulate gyrus and body of the corpus callosum. On T2-weighted imaging, the mass had a predominantly intermediate signal, homogeneous internal enhancement, and abnormal restricted diffusion that was suggestive of hypercellularity. The enhancement and restricted diffusion extended into the caudate heads bilaterally, as well as into the septum pellucidum, left fornix, left aspect of the anterior commissure, and right genu of the corpus callosum. There was extensive vasogenic edema in the right frontoparietal white matter, with approximately 8 mm of midline shift to the left. There was no evidence of abnormal lepto-meningeal or spinal cord enhancement in the cervical, thoracic, or lumbar spine. On the third day, combined positron-emission tomography and CT (PET-CT) revealed substantial 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the enhancing mass in the region of the corpus callosum but no abnormal FDG uptake in the rest of the body. A diagnostic procedure was performed. ",{},Primary central nervous system lymphoma. ,,Primary central nervous system lymphoma. ,0
NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2011,37,nejm-case-2011-37,A 9-Month-Old Boy with Recurrent Tachypnea and Respiratory Distress,"Dr. Sze Man Tse (Pediatrics): A male infant was admitted to this hospital at the age of 5.5 months, because of tachypnea and respiratory distress. The patient had been well until 2 days earlier, when cough and somnolence developed. The night before admission, the temperature rose to 38.6°C; acetaminophen was administered. The next morning, labored breathing was observed, and his family noted blotchy areas on his face and that his “chest was sucking in” more than usual. Oral intake decreased, nonbloody diarrhea (four or five episodes) developed, and urination decreased. On examination by his pediatrician that afternoon, the respiratory rate was 30 to 50 breaths per minute, with chest retractions, and the oxygen saturation was 85 to 87% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Albuterol was administered by nebulizer, and he was transported to the emergency department at this hospital. The patient was born after a full-term gestation by scheduled repeat cesarean section, and he had been well except for one febrile episode at the age of 89 days. He had received all routine childhood immunizations through 4 months of age, took no medications, and had no known allergies. He lived with his mother, one sibling, and maternal relatives and attended day care. There were no pets in the house. His father, maternal grandmother, paternal grandfather, and sibling had asthma; his mother smoked cigarettes outside the home. On examination, the weight was 7.2 kg (10th percentile), the temperature 36.4°C, the blood pressure 106/57 mm Hg, the pulse 160 beats per minute, the respiratory rate a maximum of 52 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 90% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Nasal flaring and supraclavicular and subcostal retractions with respirations were present; there were coarse expiratory wheezes bilaterally and decreased breath sounds on the right side. The remainder of the examination was normal. A complete blood count, measurements of serum electrolytes and calcium, tests of renal function, and a urinalysis were normal. Testing for influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial viruses was negative. A chest radiograph showed mildly increased lung volumes, bilateral perihilar interstitial opacities, and peribronchial cuffing. Oxygen was administered by a nonre-breather face mask; the oxygen saturation rose to 96 to 98%. Methylprednisolone, 2 mg per kilogram of body weight, was administered intravenously, and albuterol was given by nebuliz-er. The patient was admitted to the pediatric service, and intravenous crystalloid was administered; prednisolone (2 mg per kilogram per day) was given orally, and ceftriaxone (360 mg) was administered intravenously. A blood culture was sterile. His condition improved, and he was discharged on the third day, taking albuterol and budesonide by nebulizer and prednisolone (a 5-day course) orally. During the next week, cough persisted, nasal congestion increased, and oral intake and urination gradually decreased. Eleven days after discharge, the patient returned to the emergency department. On examination, the pulse was 150 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 90% while he was breathing ambient air; the temperature was normal. Mild rhinorrhea was present, and coarse breath sounds were heard bilaterally, without wheezing or prolongation of the expiratory phase. The remainder of the examination was normal. A complete blood count was normal, as were tests of renal and liver function and measurements of serum electrolytes, glucose, phosphorus, magnesium, total protein, albumin, and direct and total bilirubin. Chest radiographs revealed hyperin-flated lungs, with peribronchial thickening. The patient was readmitted to the hospital; supplemental oxygen, prednisolone, intravenous fluids, and saline nebulizer treatments were added. Testing for respiratory viruses was negative. Intermittent tachypnea and a supplemental oxygen requirement persisted. On the sixth day, auscultation of the lungs revealed coarse breath sounds and fine crackles. Glucocorticoid administration was increased (prednisolone from 1 mg to 2 mg per kilogram per day orally, and budesonide from 0.25 mg to 0.5 mg twice daily), and azithro-mycin was begun. Supplemental oxygen was gradually weaned. The patient was discharged on the ninth day, receiving prednisolone (to taper over a period of 1 week) and azithromycin (total, 5-day course); albuterol, budesonide, and sodium chloride were given by nebulizer. His mother was encouraged to stop smoking. At the ages of 7, 7.5, and 9 months, the patient was again admitted to the hospital because of fever and respiratory distress. When he was 7.5 months of age, testing for influenza A virus antigen was positive (H1N1 presumed), and when he was 9 months of age, testing for respiratory syncytial virus was positive. On physical examination, there were persistent fine crackles in both lungs. Each time, his condition improved with supportive care, and he was discharged after 5 to 7 days. When the patient was 9 months of age, computed tomography (CT) of the chest performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material revealed bilateral, symmetric paramedias-tinal ground-glass opacities, with scattered regions of air trapping, areas of atelectasis in the dependent portions of the lungs, and a few small paren-chymal nodules. Chest radiographs taken 2 weeks later showed hyperinflated lungs and increasing perihilar patchy opacities in the right lung. One month later, a diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,27,nejm-case-2012-27,A 60-Year-Old Woman with Painful Muscle Spasms and Hyperreflexia,"Dr. Mikael L. Rinne (Neurology): A 60-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of painful muscle spasms, weakness, and hyperreflexia. The patient had been well until approximately 4 months before admission, when stiffness and cramping developed in both legs, associated with pain in the back. She saw a rheumatologist; a diagnosis of fibromyalgia was made, and gaba-pentin was administered, without improvement. Two weeks before admission, muscle cramps in the legs progressively worsened. The cramps were more severe proximally, occurred after movement or pressure on the legs, and awakened the patient from sleep. In the days before admission, spasms and stiffness led to multiple falls and required use of a walker. She came to the emergency department at this hospital. The patient rated the pain at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. She reported recent increased forgetfulness and intense generalized pruritus; during the previous 1 to 2 weeks, diaphoresis was associated with the episodes of pain. She did not have weakness or cramping in the arms, fever, headache, sensory loss, weight loss, rashes, bladder or bowel incontinence, or constitutional symptoms. She had hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and chronic low back pain that radiated down her right leg to the midcalf. Medications on admission included atorvastatin, lorazepam, and atenolol, as well as opioid analgesic agents for pain and cetirizine and diphenhydramine as needed for pruritus. She had no known allergies, drank alcohol in moderation, and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. She was widowed and had recently retired from a professional position. Her parents had had dementia, had reportedly had colon cancer, and had died in their 90s; her father had had melanoma; her maternal grandmother had had breast cancer in her 70s; and a maternal cousin had had breast cancer in her 30s. The patient’s three adult children were well. On examination, the patient was anxious and in pain. The blood pressure was 170/111 mg Hg, the pulse 97 beats per minute, the temperature 37.5°C, and the oxygen saturation 93% while she was breathing ambient air. A large bruise on the right arm was the result of a fall. A mental-status examination was limited because of drowsiness, which was attributed to medications; the patient’s attention was poor, and she had difficulty subtracting from 100 by serial 7s, naming the months, or spelling “world” backward. The tone, bulk, and strength of the arms were normal. Motor testing of the legs was limited because of pain and spasms induced by movement or stimulation. There was extreme rigidity of the flexor and extensor muscles bilaterally; the patient was unable to flex her right leg at the knee or fully extend her left leg. She was unable to flex her left hip against gravity and could not flex the right hip. Reflexes were 3+ at the biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, and knees and 4+ at the Achilles’ tendons, with three or four beats of clonus at both ankles. Plantar reflexes were mute. She was unable to arise from a supine or sitting position or walk without assistance. The remainder of the neurologic and general physical examinations was normal. Results of a complete blood count and white-cell differential count were normal, as were serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, total and direct bilirubin, C-reactive protein, total protein, globulin, albumin, cholesterol, triglycerides, and lipoproteins and tests of coagulation and renal function; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed 1+ ketones, was positive for benzodi-azepines and opiates, and was otherwise normal. Atorvastatin was discontinued, and morphine and diazepam were administered, followed by lorazepam and cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride, with improvement in the spasms and rigidity and decreased pain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, performed without the administration of gadolinium, revealed a few nonspecific foci of hyperintensity in the frontal subcortical white matter, seen on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. MRI of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine, performed without the administration of gadolinium and limited by patient discomfort, showed degenerative changes of the cervical and lumbar spine, without cord or nerve-root compression. A diagnostic test was performed.

The patient had been well until approximately 2 hours before presentation, when severe weakness developed on the right side and she lost the ability to speak. The patient’s husband alerted a flight attendant, and a passenger who was a physician informed the crew that they must transport her to a hospital within 3 hours to enable proper treatment. The pilot accelerated the aircraft to arrive in Boston within 2 hours after symptom onset. The patient was evaluated by emergency medical technicians on her arrival at the airport. The blood pressure was 146/82 mm Hg, and the pulse 100 beats per minute and regular. She had a right facial droop and was unable to lift her right arm. The capillary blood glucose level was 151 mg per deciliter (8.4 mmol per liter). Boston Emergency Medical Services (EMS) provided this hospital with prearrival notification, and the patient was brought by ambulance to the emergency department, where a multidisciplinary team had been assembled. The patient had a history of migraine headaches, asthma, and recurrent intermittent swelling of her left thigh every few months since childhood, when she had undergone the surgical excision of a birthmark on the left inner thigh that had frequently bled. Medications were aspirin several days per week (for headaches) and asthma inhalers. She had no known allergies. She was traveling with her husband, who provided the history. She did not smoke cigarettes. There was no family history of hematologic disease or coagulation abnormalities. On the initial examination, the patient was alert and followed simple commands but answered “yup” to all questions. The blood pressure was 146/77 mm Hg, the pulse 121 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while she was breathing oxygen through a nonre-breather face mask at a rate of 4 liters per minute; the temperature was normal. The pupils were 3 mm and reactive to light. There was a left-gaze preference and a slight right facial droop.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2009,20,nejm-case-2009-20,A 79-Year-Old Woman with a Blistering Cutaneous Eruption,"Dr. Jordan M. Cummins (Dermatology): A 79-year-old woman was admitted to the burn unit of this hospital because of a blistering cutaneous eruption. Five days before admission, itching on her head and back and skin lesions on her abdomen developed. She saw her primary care provider at another facility. She had had polymyalgia rheumatica, giant-cell arteritis, and rheumatoid arthritis for many years, treated with prednisone. Hydroxychloroquine had been started approximately 2 weeks earlier. The hydroxychloroquine was stopped and loratadine was administered; prednisone was continued. The rash did not improve and gradually spread to her back, arms, and legs. Three days after the onset of symptoms, she was seen in the emergency department of another hospital. The prednisone was increased from 5 to 40 mg daily, and she was sent home. The rash increased in severity and became painful, sore throat with dysphagia developed, and the temperature rose to 38.8°C. She returned to the emergency room the next day. She described burning pain of the eyes and skin, headache that was 8 on a scale of 0 to 10 (where 10 is the worst pain), light-headedness, poor oral intake, nausea, and puffy eyes. She did not have shortness of breath. On examination, she was alert and appeared weak and ill. The temperature was 36.5°C, the blood pressure 139/69 mm Hg, the pulse 79 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, with 97% oxygen saturation while she was breathing ambient air. There was purulent drainage from the eyes. Crackles were heard at the bases of both lungs. The skin was warm and dry. Coalescing papules and plaques covered most of the skin surface, and there was desquamation involving approximately half the surface of the back. A slight exudate developed when the lesions were rubbed, which was thought to represent a weakly positive Nikolsky’s sign (ready removal of the epidermis with slight tangential pressure). The remainder of the examination was normal. Levels of phosphorus and magnesium and tests of renal function were normal; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Analysis of the urine revealed 1+ leukocyte esterase and was otherwise normal. An electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm, normal rate, with atrial premature complexes. Ondansetron, diphen-hydramine, intravenous crystalloid solution, and acetaminophen were administered, followed by morphine. A biopsy of the skin was performed. Pathological examination of a frozen section reportedly showed vacuolization of the basal layer, epidermal spongiosis, and many neutrophils. The changes were interpreted as exfoliative dermatitis, possibly toxic epidermal necrolysis or the Stevens–Johnson syndrome. The patient was transferred by helicopter to this hospital for admission to the burn unit. On admission, she reported a sandy feeling in her eyes, and increasingly blurred vision. She had a history of macular degeneration, cardiac arrhythmia treated with a pacemaker, borderline hyper-cholesterolemia, and hypertension. There was no history of cold sores. She had had a tonsillectomy, cataract surgery, and bilateral knee replacements in the past. She lived alone, was active, did not smoke, and drank alcohol rarely. Medications on admission included prednisone (40 mg daily), digoxin, nadolol, esomeprazole, hydrochlorothia-zide, pravastatin, lorazepam, calcium citrate, estra-diol, a multivitamin formulated for age-related eye health (PreserVision), artificial tears, and metroni-dazole cream, as well as amoxicillin before dental procedures. She was allergic to sulfa drugs. On examination, the patient appeared ill. The temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 170/65 mm Hg, the pulse 54 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, with 94% oxygen saturation while she was breathing am-bient air. There was purulent discharge in the eyes and erosions on the eyelids, trace injection of the conjunctiva, and serous crusting on the lips; no lesions were seen on the tongue or oropharynx. There was confluent macular erythema on the face, trunk, and limbs, extending to the knees. On the chest, abdomen, and thighs, there were innumerable nonfollicular pustules, 1 to 2 mm in diameter (Fig. 1A). On the back, there were extensive areas of superficial desquamation with a positive Nikolsky’s sign (Fig. 1B). There were targetoid macules and plaques on the trunk, legs, and palms (Fig. 1C and 1D), and there was no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly; the remainder of the examination was normal. Skin involvement was estimated to be approximately 76% of body-surface area. Levels of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, total protein, albumin, globulin, and cardiac enzymes were normal, as were tests of renal and liver function. Other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities but was otherwise normal; a chest radiograph was normal.

Billings (Medicine): A 52-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of weakness and swelling in his legs. The patient had been in his usual health until 9 months earlier, when leg edema and weakness developed, associated with weight gain. His physician prescribed diuretic agents; the edema improved and the patient lost weight, but the leg weakness worsened and the patient had difficulty climbing stairs and standing up from a seated position. Laboratory tests revealed hypokalemia. The diuretics were discontinued, and potassium supplementation was started. Approximately 6 months after the onset of symptoms, erythema and swelling developed in both hands. The patient was admitted to another hospital, where a diagnosis of cellulitis and bactere-mia caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus was made. Nafcillin and daptomycin were administered, and he was discharged home after 9 days, with intravenous antibiotics. Malaise, fatigue, and bilateral leg and hip weakness worsened. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was readmitted to the other hospital 2 weeks after discharge because of pain in the right arm. Studies revealed thrombosis of the right axillary and sub-clavian veins; anticoagulation treatment was administered. A complete blood count and tests of liver function, coagulation, and kidney function were normal, as were the serum levels of electrolytes other than potassium. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain after the administration of gadolinium reportedly revealed nonspecific, small, scattered, nonenhanc-ing hyperintensities of the cerebral white matter on T2-weighted images, without evidence of an intracranial ischemic event or a mass lesion in the pituitary. Results of ultrasonography of the kidneys were normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest after the administration of intravenous contrast material revealed a cavitary lung lesion (18 mm in diameter) in the left upper lobe, a pulmonary embolus in the right lower lobe, a nodule in the left adrenal gland (1 cm in diameter), and a slightly full right adrenal gland, without lymphadenopathy. On the 15th hospital day, a low-dose dexamethasone suppression test was performed; results are shown in Table 1. The patient was discharged, and a referral to the Neuroendocrine Clinical Center at this hospital was scheduled. Six days after discharge, the patient came to the emergency department at this hospital because of debilitating weakness in his legs and hips; he was unable to stand and had edema of the legs with extension to the waist. He reported increased irritability and bruising on his arms. He did not have fever, flushing, tachycardia, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. He had a history of chronic stable hypertension. He lived with his wife and children and was unable to work at his job in an industrial setting because of the deterioration of his health; he did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Medications included warfarin, hydralazine, furosemide, metformin, spironolactone, metoprolol, valsartan, amlodipine, risedronate sodium, oxycodone–acetaminophen, insulin, potassium chloride, acetylsalicylic acid, and stool softener. On examination, the vital signs were normal; the face was round and full; and the abdomen was obese, with dark abdominal striae greater than 1 cm in width, multiple ecchymoses, and hypoactive bowel sounds. There was no abdominal tenderness, distention, or guarding. Distal leg strength was 4 on a scale of 0 to 5 (with 5 indicating normal strength); there was 3+ edema extending to the hips bilaterally. The remainder of the examination was normal. The white-cell count was 14,400 per cubic millimeter; serum levels of globulin, calcium, amylase, lipase, alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, calcitonin, meta-nephrine, normetanephrine, troponin I, and cre-atine kinase isoenzymes were normal; toxicologic screening of the blood and urine was negative; and tests of coagulation were consistent with anticoagulation with warfarin. Other test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph showed free air under the diaphragm. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed diffuse free air (with the largest collection of air in the left lower quadrant tracking into the left scrotum), multiple enlarged lymph nodes, a mass (3.4 cm by 1.8 cm by 8.6 cm) near the right diaphragmatic crus, and thickening of the adrenal glands. A CT scan of the brain without the administration of contrast material was normal. The next morning, exploratory laparotomy was performed. Pus was seen within the peritoneal cavity, and the sigmoid colon appeared inflamed, with perforation. Sigmoid colectomy and colostomy were performed. Pathological examination of the tissue revealed diverticulitis with perforation. Cultures of the peritoneal fluid grew mixed flora. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and ketocon-azole were administered postoperatively. On the 4th day, MRI of the abdomen revealed diskitis of the second and third lumbar vertebrae and an abscess extending into the right diaphragmatic crus. On the 6th day, MRI of the lumbar spine confirmed this finding and also revealed multiple abscesses involving the left paraspinal muscles at L3–L4 and the psoas muscles bilaterally. On the 8th day, diskectomy of the second and third lumbar vertebrae was performed. On the 10th day, bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid was obtained from the left-upper-lobe cavitary lung lesion; cultures grew Mycobacterium avium complex. On the 12th day, diffusion-weighted images from MRI of the head performed after the administration of gadolinium showed a normal pituitary gland and a small punctate focus of hy-perintense signal along the inferior aspect of the right basal ganglia, which was thought to represent a small, subacute lacunar infarct. On the 17th day, scanning performed after the administration of indium-111–labeled pentetreotide showed no abnormal uptake. During the second week of hospitalization, alanine and aspartate aminotransferase levels rose; the dose of ketoconazole was decreased, and metyrapone was added. The urinary free cortisol level fell to 24.5 μg per 24 hours after 3 weeks of treatment; however, changes in mental status developed, and metyrapone was discontinued. The patient’s course was complicated by thrombosis in the common femoral vein, for which argatro-ban was administered, and by transient renal failure. Testing for Goodpasture’s syndrome was negative, as was indirect immunofluorescence testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and antibodies to proteinase 3 and my-eloperoxidase. On the 33rd day, levels of free thyroxine and thyrotropin were normal. A cortico-tropin-releasing hormone stimulation test was performed; additional test results are shown in Table 1 and Figure 1A. On the 45th hospital day, bilateral adrenalectomy was performed; pathological examination revealed diffuse adrenal cortical hyperplasia. Prednisone (5 mg twice daily) and fludrocortisone (0.1 mg daily) were administered. Six days after the operation, the level of urinary cortisol was undetectable. The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility on the 51st day. At follow-up 1 month after discharge, weak-ness with back pain persisted; the patient had cushingoid facies. Levels of free thyroxine and thyrotropin were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1 and Figure 1B. Three months after discharge, CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed no evidence of masses, and CT of the chest without contrast material showed improvement in the left-upper-lobe lesion. Five months after discharge, the patient returned to the Neuroendocrine Clinical Center from the rehabilitation facility for routine follow-up. He reported that he had lost weight and that his strength was improved. He had the feeling that his hands were always dirty and that he was unable to get them clean. He did not report vision changes or headaches. Medications included pred-nisone (5 mg twice daily), fludrocortisone (0.1 mg daily), metoprolol, nifedipine, calcium, and vitamin D; insulin had been stopped. On examination, his face was thinner, without cushingoid features, and the skin, including creases of the hands and abdominal scars, was hyperpigmented; ","{'The pathologic secretion of excess cortisol': [], 'Corticotropin-dependent Cushing’s syndrome': ['Pituitary Sources of Excess Corticotropin', 'Ectopic Sources of Excess Corticotropin'], 'Nelson’s syndrome': []}",Nelson’s syndrome (progression of a corticotroph tumor in a patient after adrenalectomy for Cush-ing’s disease). ,,Nelson’s syndrome (progression of a corticotroph tumor in a patient after adrenalectomy for Cush-ing’s disease). ,0
NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,20,nejm-case-2019-20,A 52-Year-Old Woman with Fever and Rash after Heart Transplantation,"Dr. Taylor A. Lebeis: A 52-year-old woman who had undergone orthotopic heart transplantation because of dilated cardiomyopathy was admitted to this hospital with painful red lesions on the left arm and leg. Eight years before this admission, the patient had ongoing episodes of pain in the chest and left arm, as well as occasional palpitations. She was initially seen at another hospital; electrocardiography and a stress test were performed, and the results were reportedly abnormal. She was referred to the cardiology clinic at this hospital for further evaluation. On examination in the cardiology clinic, the pulse was 83 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 92/60 mm Hg; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, magnesium, calcium, ferritin, and lipids were normal, as were the results of tests of renal, liver, and thyroid function and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The blood level of N-terminal pro–B-type natri-uretic peptide was 536 pg per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 450). Antinuclear antibodies were present at a titer of 1:40 with a speckled pattern, and a test for rheumatoid factor was negative. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with poor R-wave progression, left anterior fascicular block, and frequent premature ventricular contractions. A pharmacologic stress test revealed excellent exercise capacity and a small, fixed region of inferolateral ischemia. Echocardiog-raphy revealed left ventricular dilatation with diffuse hypokinesis, an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 37%, and mild mitral regurgitation. Coronary angiography was recommended but declined by the patient; computed tomography (CT) of the chest with angiographic imaging of the coronary vessels did not reveal radiographically significant plaque or stenosis in the coronary arteries. Metoprolol tartrate, lisinopril, pravastatin, and aspirin were prescribed. During the next year, the episodes of arm pain ceased but palpitations persisted. A 48-hour Holter monitoring recording showed frequent ventricular ectopic activity without ventricular tachycardia. Five years before this admission, echocar-diography revealed that the estimated left ventricular ejection fraction had decreased to 30%, and an automatic implantable cardioverter–defi-brillator was placed. Four years before this admission, the patient began to have frequent hospital admissions because of dyspnea and volume overload. Echocar-diography revealed progressive left ventricular dilatation, an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 21%, severe mitral regurgitation, and a right ventricular systolic pressure of 75 mm Hg. Three years before this admission, the patient underwent surgical mitral-valve repair with placement of a mechanical-valve prosthesis, after which her dyspnea improved. One year before this admission, the patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital because of a 1-hour history of palpitations, light-headedness, chest pressure, nausea, and fatigue; an evaluation revealed ventricular tachycardia with cardiogenic shock. Ventricular tachycardia abated with the administration of intravenous amiodarone and external electrical cardioversion, but shock persisted. Continuous infusions of norepinephrine and milrinone were administered, and an intravascular microaxial blood pump was placed. Before discharge, a left ventricular assist device was placed. During the procedure, a core excision of the left ventricular apex was performed. Dr. Lucas R. Massoth: Histopathological examination of the excised myocardium revealed active, necrotizing myocarditis with an infiltrate composed primarily of lymphocytes, eosinophils, and histiocytes, along with scattered plasma cells and mast cells (Fig. 1A). Hypertrophic cardiac myocytes were present. Trichrome staining revealed severe interstitial fibrosis (Fig. 1B). Dr. Lebeis: An evaluation to determine eligibility for cardiac transplantation was initiated. Routine blood screening detected IgG antibodies to Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) viral capsid antigen and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Additional screening was positive for IgG antibodies to measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, and hepatitis A virus, as well as hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antibodies; these findings indicate either previous infection or vaccine-induced immunity. Serologic screening was negative for antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii, Treponema pallidum, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2, and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Nucleic-acid testing was negative for HBV DNA, HCV RNA, and HIV type 1 RNA. Panel-reactive antibody levels were elevated, with profiles showing a high degree of HLA sensitization. Four months before this admission, intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) infusions and rituximab were administered for desensitization, and plasmapheresis was performed in anticipation of transplantation. Forty days before this admission, the patient was admitted for orthotopic heart transplantation. The donor had a history of substance use disorder and had recently acquired tattoos. Testing of the donor blood revealed IgG antibodies to EBV viral capsid antigen; serologic testing was nonreactive for antibodies to CMV, T. gondii, T. pallidum, HIV types 1 and 2, and HCV, and additional testing was negative for HBV surface antigen, HBV core antibodies, HBV DNA, HCV RNA, and HIV type 1 RNA. During the operation, packed red cells, fresh-frozen plasma, and platelets were transfused, and methylpredniso-lone, mycophenolate mofetil, vancomycin, and levofloxacin were administered. Dr. Massoth: Gross examination of the heart explant revealed cardiomegaly and marked left ventricular dilatation (Fig. 1C and 1D). Histo-pathological evaluation was remarkable for diffuse, active myocarditis with a lymphocyte-predominant infiltrate (Fig. 1E). There were numerous histiocytes, which occasionally formed areas of granulomatous inflammation and multinucleated giant cells (Fig. 1F). One discrete noncaseating granuloma was identified. There were fewer eosinophils in the heart explant than in the initial core excision specimen, but the degree of interstitial fibrosis was similar in the two specimens. Coronary artery disease was negligible. Dr. Lebeis: After transplantation, the patient had a positive B-cell flow-cytometric cross-match; rabbit antithymocyte globulin and IVIG were administered, and plasmapheresis was performed. Oral prednisone, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, valgan-ciclovir, and nystatin were prescribed. Weekly biopsies of the right ventricular endomyocardi-um were performed; no signs of acute cellular rejection were seen on histopathological examination. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 15. Twenty-three days after transplantation (17 days before this admission), the patient was seen in the emergency department of this hospital be-cause of pain in the legs. On examination, the legs were diffusely tender without edema. Ultra-sonography of the legs revealed occlusive deep-vein thromboses of the gastrocnemius veins on both sides. CT of the chest with pulmonary angiography, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a small left pleural effusion with associated subsegmen-tal atelectasis in the left lower lobe and no pulmonary embolus. Subcutaneous injections of enoxaparin sodium were prescribed. Twenty-eight days after transplantation (12 days before this admission), the patient had an episode of cellular rejection, as diagnosed on examination of a biopsy specimen obtained during catheterization of the right side of the heart, which was performed as part of routine post-transplantation screening for early rejection. The episode was treated with an increase in immuno-suppression. On the day of this admission, the patient was seen for follow-up in the cardiology clinic. She reported that 5 days earlier, a circular patch of erythema and warmth (10 cm in diameter) had developed on the left lower leg, and on the morning of the clinic visit, similar patches had appeared on the left thigh and forearm. The lesions were associated with burning pain and pruritus, and chills had occurred. The patient had a history of gastroesophageal reflux, anxiety, and depression. Medications included aspirin, furosemide, prednisone, tacrolimus, mycopheno-late mofetil, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, val-ganciclovir, nystatin, omeprazole, cholecalciferol, and magnesium oxide. She was allergic to penicillin, which had caused a rash. She reported no recent insect bites, animal exposures, sick contacts, or use of new skin-care products. She was born in Central America and had immigrated to the United States 31 years earlier. She lived with her husband and four children in an urban area of New England; she no longer worked because of medical disabilities, but she had previously worked at a retail store. She drank wine socially and did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs. Her father had died from trauma at 50 years of age, and her mother had died from kidney disease at 75 years of age. There was no family history of coronary artery disease, cardiomyopa-thy, or sudden cardiac death. On examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 37.4°C, the pulse 105 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 130/78 mm Hg. There was a healing sternal incision without an exudate, surrounding erythema, or induration. Poorly demarcated, blanching, erythematous nodules were present on the lateral left lower leg, medial left thigh, and lateral left arm (Fig. 2); there was no associated necrosis or ulceration. The remainder of the examination was normal. The platelet count, anion gap, prothrombin time, prothrombin-time international normalized ratio, and blood levels of electrolytes, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were the results of tests of renal and liver function; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed slightly cloudy, yellow urine, with a specific gravity of 1.029 and a pH of 5.0. Chest radiography revealed stable cardiomegaly and patchy opacification of the left lower lobe, findings consistent with atelectasis. Ultrasonog-raphy revealed persistent thromboses of the gastrocnemius veins and no deep-vein thrombosis of the arms. Routine catheterization of the right side of the heart was performed, and filling pressures and cardiac output were normal; a biopsy specimen of the right ventricle was sent for histopathological examination. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Shortly after admission, the patient reported headache and subjective fever. On examination, the temperature was 38.4°C, and a new erythema-tous lesion had developed on the medial aspect of the right knee. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. A diagnosis was made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,07,nejm-case-2012-07,A 79-Year-Old Man with Pain and Weakness in the Legs,"Dr. Aida E. Kuri (Medicine): A 79-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of pain and weakness in the legs. The patient had multiple medical problems but had been in his usual state of health until 6 days before admission, when progressive, generalized pain and tingling developed in both legs. Three days before admission, weakness in both legs developed and gradually worsened and he had difficulty walking. On the morning of admission, he was unable to get out of bed. His wife called emergency medical services, and he was brought to the emergency department at this hospital. The patient had no fevers, chills, headache, chest pain, respiratory symptoms, nausea, vomiting, changes in bladder habits, rectal bleeding, or saddle anesthesia (loss of sensation in the area of the buttocks and perineum) and had no history of trauma, falls, contact with sick persons, or recent travel. Eight days before admission, esopha-gogastroduodenoscopy was performed because of iron-deficiency anemia, with the administration of meperidine and midazolam; multiple nonbleeding duodenal erosions were seen; testing for Helicobacter pylori was negative. The patient had a long history of leg pain that was associated with activity and was relieved with rest, attributed to claudication, which was different from his current symptoms. He had had diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia for more than 10 years, as well as peripheral vascular disease, glaucoma, hypothyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, chronic constipation, urinary retention due to prostatic hypertrophy (for which trans-urethral prostatic resection had been performed 3 years earlier), and for 6 years, worsening chronic kidney disease (stage 3 of 5) (Table 1). He had had a benign colonic adenoma on routine colonoscopy 3 years earlier and a positive tuberculin skin test in the distant past, with negative chest radiographs. He had a history of noncompliance with medications but had recently become more adherent, owing to a visiting nurse and pharmacy-provided prepackaged medications. Daily medications on admission included lisinopril (20 mg), amlodipine (10 mg), metoprolol (200 mg), hydralazine (100 mg in divided doses), furosemide (40 mg), doxazosin (8 mg), sim-vastatin (40 mg daily for 9 months; previously 20 mg daily for 1.5 years), finasteride (5 mg), levothyroxine (88 μg), ferrous sulfate (325 mg), sodium polystyrene sulfonate (30 g), aspirin (81 mg), and insulin glargine (70 U); other medications were gemfi-brozil (600 mg twice daily for 2.5 years), ergocalciferol (50,000 U twice monthly), lactulose (20 g as needed for constipation), and travoprost eyedrops. He had no known allergies. He was born in Mexico, had immigrated to the United States more than two decades earlier, and lived with his wife; he spoke primarily Spanish and was illiterate. He was retired from a service position, with possible exposure to cleaning solvents. He was a former smoker, drank alcohol in moderation, and did not use illicit drugs. His mother and sister had had diabetes mellitus. On examination, the patient was obese, in no physical distress, and anxious and tearful. The temperature was 37°C, the blood pressure 150/72 mm Hg, the pulse 86 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. The general physical examination was normal. On examination by a neurologist, the strength in both arms was 5 out of 5; strength in the quadriceps, hamstrings, tibialis anterior, and extensor hallucis longus muscles was 3 out of 5 on the left and 2 out of 5 on the right. Gait could not be evaluated because of weakness. Reflexes were diffusely decreased, and plantar reflexes were equivocal. The remainder of the neurologic examination was normal. The platelet count and tests of coagulation were normal, as were blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, total and direct bilirubin, calcium, ionized calcium, alkaline phosphatase, lactic acid, lipase, and N-terminal propeptide of B-type natri-uretic peptide. Screening of the blood for troponin I and toxins was negative; other results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed brown, turbid urine with a pH of 6.0, specific gravity of 1.010, 2+ albumin, 3+ occult blood, 0 to 2 red and white cells per high-power field, 3 to 5 hyaline casts and 10 to 20 granular casts per low-power field, very few renal tubular cells, and amorphous crystals and mucin. An electrocardiogram was normal. A chest radiograph was clear. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed nonspecific periven-tricular hypoattenuation and partial opacification of the left mastoid air cells and middle-ear cavity, with an air–liquid level within the left maxillary sinus. Lisinopril, simvastatin, and gemfibrozil were stopped; the patient’s other medications were continued, and the administration of dextrose, bicarbonate, and intravenous crystalloid was begun. He was admitted to the medical service. During the next 3 days, heparin and epoetin alfa were added, and intravenous furosemide and fluids were administered to maintain urine output. Cultures of the blood and urine were sterile. Nerve-conduction studies were essentially normal; there was no evidence of axonal or demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Electromyography (EMG) showed brief myotonic discharges and short, polyphasic, early-recruited motor-unit potentials in the left deltoid and biceps. Echocardiog-raphy revealed trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and was otherwise normal. The level of methylmalonic acid was normal, and screening of the urine for toxins was negative. On the third day, abdominal distention and pain developed. An abdominal radiograph showed numerous gas-filled loops of bowel, consistent with ileus. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, without the use of contrast material, revealed no evidence of bowel obstruction. Nasogastric and rectal tubes were placed, and the abdominal distention and pain improved. Blood levels of thyrotropin, ferritin, vitamin B12, and folate were normal. Testing for antinuclear antibodies was positive at a dilution of 1:160, in a speckled pattern, and testing for antibodies to Ro (SSA) was positive (115.24 optical-density units; reference range, 0 to 19.99); testing for other autoantibodies was negative. Other test results are shown in Table 1. On the fifth day, the blood level of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase was normal and a random urine specimen revealed a creatinine level of 0.6 mg per milliliter (5746 μmol per liter) and a protein level of 1550 mg per liter (reference range, 0 to 135). Results of serologic testing for hepatitis A virus were consistent with past exposure; testing for hepatitis B and C viruses was negative. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Muscle tenderness and weakness persisted; on the 7th day, strength was 1 to 2 out of 5 in the legs and 3 out of 5 in the arms. On the eighth day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2011,17,nejm-case-2011-17,A 49-Year-Old Woman with a Mass in the Breast and Overlying Skin Changes,"Dr. Jerry Younger (Hematology–Oncology): A 49-year-old woman was seen in the outpatient cancer center at this hospital because of a mass in the breast. The patient was well until 3 months before this presentation, when she noted a mass in her right breast, which was similar to benign breast lesions she had had before and which she thought was a cyst. During the next 2 months, she noted that the lesion was enlarging and that redness of the overlying skin was developing. She contacted her gynecologist and scheduled her annual mammographic examination. Digital diagnostic mammographic examination with ultrasonography, performed at another hospital, revealed heterogeneously dense breasts, with a solid mass, measuring 4.8 cm by 4.2 cm by 4.2 cm, in the right breast and at least two smaller solid masses; the masses had not been present on a routine study performed 15 months earlier. Eight days later, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the right breast, performed after the administration of gadolinium, showed an enhancing mass, 5.7 cm in the greatest dimension, in the lower outer quadrant that was highly suggestive of carcinoma, with enhancement of the underlying pectoralis muscle and thickening of the skin. Two smaller enhancing masses, 13 mm and 17 mm in greatest dimension, in the upper outer quadrant were thought to represent satellite lesions. There were multiple enlarged enhancing lymph nodes, up to 19 mm in greatest dimension, in the right axilla. No suspicious lesions were seen in the left breast. Five days later, specimens from ultrasound-guided core biopsies of the masses in the right breast and fine-needle aspiration of the lymph node in the right axilla were obtained. Pathological examination of the tissue from each of the solid masses revealed invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 3 of 3. Testing for estrogen-receptor (ER) and progesterone-receptor (PR) proteins and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) was negative. The specimen from the fine-needle aspiration of the axillary lymph node contained metastatic carcinoma. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen after the administration of contrast material and a bone scan showed no evidence of metastatic disease outside of the breast and axilla. Thirteen days after the biopsy, the patient was seen in the Gillette Center for Women’s Cancers at this hospital. The patient had undergone biopsies of a mass in the left breast at 22 years of age and of masses in the right breast at 45 years of age; examination of all the specimens had revealed features that were consistent with fibroadenomas. Mammography performed every 6 to 12 months for 3 years after the more recent biopsies had been unchanged. Menarche had occurred at 11 years of age. The patient was nulliparous and perimeno-pausal, with two menstrual periods in the previous year; she had taken oral contraceptives in the past and had not taken hormone-replacement therapy. She had wisdom teeth extracted as a teenager, took no medications, and had no known allergies. She was married and worked in an office. She drank less than five servings of alcohol per week and did not smoke. Her sister had had breast ductal carcinoma in situ; her mother and father had had lung cancer at ages 58 and 65 years, respectively; one of her two brothers had had prostate cancer; and both brothers had had strokes in their fifth decade (one had a documented arteriovenous malformation). On examination, the blood pressure was 182/112 mm Hg, the pulse 81 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the temperature 37.1°C. The height was 157 cm, the weight 95.9 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 38.9. A mass, 12 cm in diameter, was present in the right breast; it extended from the areola and involved much of the upper outer quadrant and was fixed to the chest wall. There were mobile lymph nodes in the axilla. The overlying skin was erythematous and edematous with peau d’orange (orange peel) change. There was no discharge from the nipple or ulceration of the skin. The left breast and the remainder of the examination were normal. The next day, MRI of the right breast showed enlargement of the dominant mass to 7.1 cm in the greatest dimension, with enhancement of the pectoralis muscle and thickening of the overlying skin. Two satellite lesions and multiple enhancing right axillary lymph nodes were present. A management decision was made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,11,nejm-case-2012-11,"A 60-Year-Old Man with Weakness, Rash, and Renal Failure","Dr. Pritha Sen (Medicine): A 60-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia was admitted to this hospital in late spring because of weakness, rash, and renal failure. The patient was in his usual state of health until several days before admission, when fatigue and myalgias reportedly developed, associated with markedly decreased activity. Three days before admission, he reportedly lay down on the floor of his home and moved very little or not at all for the next 3 days, without oral intake. On the morning of admission, he was incontinent of urine and his speech was incomprehensible. Emergency medical services personnel were called; they found the patient easily aroused with verbal stimulation and appearing weak and short of breath, with inappropriate verbal responses. The blood pressure was 110/68 mm Hg, the pulse 100 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute. The skin was pale, cold, and dry. The patient moved all extremities and obeyed commands. The neck was immobilized. Oxygen (10 liters) was administered through a nonrebreather face mask; oxygen saturation ranged from 68 to 88%. A glucose level measured with a fingerstick device was 46 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter), and an ampule of glucose, 25 g, was administered. The patient’s responsiveness improved; additional glucose and 2 liters of intravenous fluids were given, and he was transported to another hospital. On arrival, the patient reported shortness of breath. He had a history of schizophrenia (with visual hallucinations and possible catatonic symptoms — described as “lying on the floor for several days” — if he did not take his medications regularly), osteoarthritis, hyperlipidemia, and alcohol and drug abuse; he had had Lyme disease in the past. He was single and lived with a sibling in a coastal community in New England. He drank alcohol daily, smoked tobacco and marijuana, and occasionally used cocaine. His mother had had breast cancer and his father cancer of unknown type; a brother had chronic obstructive lung disease. Medications included fluphenazine hydrochloride and simvastatin; he had no known allergies. On examination, the temperature was 36.1°C, the blood pressure 115/80 mm Hg, the pulse 95 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 81% while the patient was breathing oxygen through a nonrebreather face mask. The extremities were initially cool and mottled, and there was a diffuse papular pink rash on the upper torso, back, and arms. The patient was alert and oriented; strength was 4 out of 5 in the right hand and 3 out of 5 in the left leg. The blood levels of total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and amylase were normal, and alcohol was not detected; other test results are shown in Table 1. A urinalysis showed clear, yellow urine with a specific gravity of 1.025, pH 5.0, 1+ ketones, 3+ blood, 1+ protein, a moderate amount of amorphous sediment, and no white or red cells; toxi-cologic screening of the urine was negative. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm at 112 beats per minute and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. A chest radiograph reportedly was normal, and a radiograph of the lumbo-sacral spine showed a heavily calcified infrare-nal abdominal aorta and was otherwise normal. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the head and cervical spine obtained without the administration of contrast material reportedly was normal. Thiamine, folate, multivitamins, glucose, bicarbonate, normal saline, and lorazepam (1 mg, for agitation) were administered intravenously, and fluphenazine was given orally. Three hours after the patient’s arrival at the other hospital, the blood pressure decreased to 74/54 mm Hg and the pulse to 109 beats per minute. The patient was placed in Trendelenburg’s position, and normal saline and bicarbonate were administered, with improvement. The oxygen saturation improved and was reported as ranging from 96 to 100% with oxygen supplementation. He was transported to this hospital. On examination, the patient was somnolent but alert when roused; disheveled, with poorly groomed fingernails; and breathing with the abdominal muscles. The temperature was 38.4°C, the blood pressure 141/90 mm Hg, the pulse 126 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing 2 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula. A pale pink rash was distributed diffusely over the body, abrasions (<1 cm in diameter) were evident on the lower lumbar area and left knee, and there were two areas of ecchymosis on the left knee and shin. There were intermittent end-expiratory wheezes throughout both lungs, without rhonchi or evidence suggestive of focal consolidation. The patient moved all extremities. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. A urinalysis showed cloudy, yellow urine with a specific gravity of 1.010, pH 5.5, 1+ ketones, 3+ blood, trace protein, and 5 to 10 white cells and no red cells per high-power field. Ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and met-ronidazole were administered intravenously and empirically, and acetylsalicylic acid and acetaminophen were given. An electrocardiogram showed mild ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. A lumbar puncture was performed, and results of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed a normal cell count and normal protein and glucose levels. Gram’s staining of the CSF was negative for organisms. Tachypnea (more than 30 breaths per minute) and agitation developed. Approximately 2 hours after arrival, the trachea was intubated, and sedation and mechanical ventilation were begun. The blood pressure decreased to 55/40 mm Hg, and diffuse rhonchi were present. The administration of phenylephrine was started. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Intravenous fluids were continued, administered with multivitamins, folate, thiamine, glucose, and bicarbonate. Ceftriaxone was stopped, and cefepime and levo-floxacin were begun. The administration of dalte-parin, potassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, and calcium gluconate was begun. Urine output ranged from 60 ml to more than 100 ml per hour. Gram’s staining of the sputum showed few poly-morphonuclear and squamous epithelial cells and few gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. Cultures of the sputum grew respiratory flora, and cultures of the blood, urine, and CSF were sterile. During the next 3 days, tachycardia (up to 130 beats per minute), tachypnea (up to 50 breaths per minute), and temperatures up to 38.6°C occurred intermittently. Propofol was administered for presumed alcohol withdrawal but was discontinued because of hypotension, and midazolam was administered, with boluses of fentanyl as needed. Results of testing for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi were consistent with past infection. Thick and thin smears of peripheral blood showed no babesia. Testing of the serum for antibodies to Ehrlichia chaffeensis and Anaplasma phagocytophilum was negative, and a urine specimen was negative for Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 antigen. Analyses of specimens obtained from nasal mucosa were negative for antigens of adenovirus; influenza A and B; parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3; and respiratory syncytial virus. By the fourth day, the patient had received 22 liters of intravenous fluids, and arterial oxygenation remained stable while he was receiving mechanical ventilation with 40% inspired oxygen. The chest radiograph showed interstitial edema and small pleural effusions. The urine sediment revealed masses of granular muddy-brown casts suggestive of acute tubular necrosis. CT of the head obtained without the administration of contrast material revealed a focal hypodensity in the left posterior centrum semiovale adjacent to the central sulcus, a finding consistent with a small infarct of indeterminate age and mild microan-giopathic changes. CT of the chest obtained without contrast material showed changes consistent with mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis in the lower lobes. CT of the abdomen and pelvis ob-tained without contrast material showed small amounts of ascitic fluid and soft-tissue edema, a mass in the right adrenal gland consistent with an adenoma, and a small, nonobstructing kidney stone in the left kidney. Transthoracic echocar-diography showed an ejection fraction of 35%, which 14 months earlier had been 54%, and left ventricular dysfunction involving the inferolateral and apical regions, which was unchanged. On the fifth day, the patient remained sedated and intubated; the maximum temperature was 37.8°C. Examination by dermatologic consultants revealed diffuse edema; discrete, faintly erythem-atous, blanching macules that were spread diffusely over the trunk; purpuric macules on the distal toes and fingers (Fig. 1A and 1B); brown discoloration of most fingernails (with normal nail noted on the proximal aspects of the nail in areas of recent growth); and a small round eschar on the right lateral knee. A biopsy of the skin was performed. Pathological examination of the biopsy specimen showed a perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes and neutrophils; staining with multiple stains showed no evidence of microorganisms. A diagnostic test was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2020,25,nejm-case-2020-25,A 47-Year-Old Woman with a Lung Mass,"Dr. Jonathan E. Eisen: A 47-year-old woman presented to this hospital early during the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), because of cough and shortness of breath. The patient had been well until 2 months before this evaluation, when intermittent nonproductive cough and wheezing developed. She had no fever, chills, or shortness of breath. Two days before this evaluation, the cough worsened in frequency and severity and new shortness of breath developed. The patient was evaluated by her primary care physician by telephone call. Humidification, flutica-sone nasal spray, and fexofenadine were recommended, as was a follow-up telephone call in 2 weeks. However, the next day, the patient sought evaluation at the emergency department of this hospital because of worsening shortness of breath with ambulation. A review of systems was notable for rhinorrhea, myalgias, and dizziness. She had no fever, chills, sore throat, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, leg swelling, or weight loss. The patient had a history of eczema and gestational diabetes. Medications included azelastine nasal spray, fluocinonide cream, folate, and ferrous sulfate; she had not yet begun to use the fluticasone nasal spray and fexofenadine that had been newly recommended by her primary care physician. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was originally from the equatorial region of South America and had moved to the United States 20 years earlier; she had not traveled outside the United States in many years. She lived in an apartment in an urban area of New England with her husband and five children. She did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had had diabetes and melanoma. On examination, the temperature was 38.0°C, the heart rate 100 beats per min-ute, the blood pressure 124/64 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared to be well and was breathing comfortably. The lungs were clear on auscultation. The white-cell count was 4430 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000); the lymphocyte count was 550 per micro-liter (reference range, 1000 to 4800). Blood levels of electrolytes and results of liver- and renal-function tests were normal. Nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus was negative. Dr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: Posteroanterior and lateral radiography of the chest revealed a 4-cm rounded mass in the right lower lobe (Fig. 1A and 1B). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a rounded mass in the right lower lobe with ground-glass attenuation and a rim of higher attenuation at the periphery of the mass, findings that represent the reversed halo sign (Fig. 1C). In addition, there were smaller ground-glass nodules at the periphery of the right middle lobe and left upper lobe, with associated right hilar lymphadenopa-thy (Fig. 1C, 1D, and 1E). These findings are most consistent with viral pneumonia, although primary cancer of the lung cannot be ruled out. Dr. Eisen: Intravenous fluids were administered, and the dizziness abated. Because there was an initial concern about the possibility of lung cancer, a telephone oncology consultation was requested. The patient was discharged from the emergency department. Self-quarantine at home and additional outpatient imaging studies were recommended.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2011,01,nejm-case-2011-01,"A 35-Year-Old Man with Fever, Bacteremia, and a Mass in the Left Atrium","Dr. John Chorba (Medicine): A 35-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of fever, bacteremia, and a mass in the left atrium. The patient was healthy until 13 days before admission when shaking chills developed, associated with rigors, intermittent fevers (temperatures of up to 38.9°C), frontal headache, nonproductive cough, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. Six days before admission, he was seen at another hospital. On examination, the temperature was 37.7°C, the blood pressure 119/68 mm Hg, the pulse 108 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. The physical examination was normal. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed 10 to 15 red cells and 1 to 3 white cells per high-power field and was otherwise normal. A chest radiograph was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis reportedly revealed multiple foci of diminished enhancement in the right renal cortex, with mild perinephric fat stranding, thought to represent acute pyelonephritis, and no hydronephrosis or abscess. The patient was admitted to the other hospital. Cultures of the urine and blood were obtained, and levofloxacin was administered. On the second day, rigors were observed and the administration of vancomycin and ceftriaxone was begun. Ultrasonography of the abdomen was normal. Blood-culture results are shown in Table 2. Ampicillin was added, but fevers and rigors persisted. On the third day, a chest radiograph and CT scans of the head were normal. On the fourth day, ertapenem was begun and all other antibiotics were discontinued. The next day, a repeat CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed findings that were thought to be consistent with evolving pyelonephritis. On the seventh day, transesophageal echocardiography reportedly revealed a mobile, rectangular echodensity (1.6 cm by 0.5 cm) attached to the nonseptal side of the left atrium, an echodensity in the left atrial appendage, a mildly thickened mitral valve with possible vegetation, and additional echogenic material in the wall of the descending thoracic aorta. A chest radiograph and abdominal ultrasonogram were normal. The patient was transferred to this hospital. The patient had had septic bursitis caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus 4 years earlier, L4–L5 vertebral diskectomy 6 years earlier, and multiple dental extractions, none in the previous 4 months. He had no neurologic symptoms, chest pain, dyspnea, dysphagia, neck pain, dysuria, melena, or rectal bleeding. He lived in New England with his wife and young children and a dog. He was a carpenter and had recently worked on an abandoned house that was contaminated with cat and possibly human feces. He had not traveled recently and had had no recent contact with sick persons. He drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. Medications on transfer included ertapenem and hydrocodone. He had no known allergies. On examination, the temperature was 36.7°C, the blood pressure 142/82 mm Hg, the pulse 89 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. There were numer-ous dental caries and missing teeth but no signs suggesting abscesses. The lungs were clear. There was a split in the first heart sound best heard at the lower left sternal border, the second heart sound was normal, and there were no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The arms and legs were well perfused, with no edema. There were two dark red– purplish blisters, one on the medial side of the left fifth digit and one on the left second digit, which the patient reported were work-related. The remainder of the examination was normal. Testing for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus was negative; other laboratory-test results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Routine urinalysis and an electrocardiogram were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed at least 10 ring-enhancing lesions bilaterally, primarily involving the hemispheric white matter, with mild surrounding vasogenic edema. There was a punctate hemorrhage within the largest lesion in the left posterior centrum semiovale. The administration of ertapenem was stopped, and ceftri-axone and metronidazole were begun. On the second day, a CT scan of the chest showed clear lungs. There were scattered subcen-timeter mediastinal lymph nodes. A CT scan of the neck and mandible showed a periapical lucency surrounding the second left maxillary bicuspid, possibly representing a dental abscess. The administration of ceftriaxone was stopped, and penicillin G was begun. Culture of the urine grew few (100 to <1000 colony-forming units per milliliter) staphylococcus species; culture of the sputum grew very few coagulase-negative staphylococcus species and few yeasts (normal flora was absent). An assay for Clostridium difficile toxin in the stool was negative. Results of culture of the blood are shown in Table 2. On the third day, oral surgical evaluation revealed asymptomatic dental caries and root-tip fractures affecting three teeth; chronic, generalized, moderate gingivitis; and no evidence of acute infection. An orthopantogram showed extensive dental caries. Electrocardiography revealed normal sinus rhythm and possible left atrial enlargement. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed an estimated ejection fraction of 58% and normal ventricular and atrial function, with no evidence of valvular vegetations or patent foramen ovale. Cardiac CT with angiography revealed a fine linear hyperdense mass extending from the right-lower-lobe bronchus through the right inferior pulmonary vein and into the left atrium. Hy-podense material, which was thought to represent fibrous tissue or thrombus, surrounded the mass as it entered the right inferior pulmonary vein at the left atrial margin. There was no evidence of coronary artery disease or stenosis. The left ventricular function appeared normal. The administration of vancomycin, acetylcysteine, and oxyco-done (as needed) was begun. Two days later, the results of cerebral angiography were normal, with no evidence of mycotic aneurysms. The temperature remained normal. On the eighth day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2023,35,nejm-case-2023-35,A 38-Year-Old Woman with Waxing and Waning Pulmonary Nodules,"Dr. Zachary A. Sporn (Medicine): A 38-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of dyspnea, chest discomfort, and nodules on chest imaging. Three years before the current admission, the patient was evaluated by an orthopedist for pain in the hips and lower back, and glucocorticoid injections were administered. Twenty-two months before the current admission, the patient presented to her primary care physician because of diarrhea; 4 months later, she was evaluated by her primary care physician for bloody diarrhea. Testing of a stool specimen for giardia antigen, cryptosporidium antigen, and Clostridioides difficile toxin was negative. The blood level of antibodies to tissue transglutaminase IgA was undetectable, and the level of IgA was normal. A stool culture grew Bacillus cereus. The patient was evaluated by a gastroenterologist; colonoscopy reportedly revealed markedly erythematous mucosa in the rectum, ending 10 cm proximal to the anus, with granularity and loss of vascularity. A biopsy specimen obtained during the colonoscopy reportedly showed evidence of diffuse active chronic colitis. Treatment with mesalamine was started, but her symptoms did not abate; the treatment was stopped after 4 months. During the next several months, the patient noticed progressive dyspnea and fatigue with exercise. Eight months before the current admission, she reported diffuse body and joint aches, especially of the lower back and hips, which prevented her from being able to run. Seven months before the current admission, she reported erythema, swelling, and pruritus in the right eye. Three months before the current admission, there was a recurrence of bloody diarrhea, and colonoscopy was repeated. Examination reportedly revealed perianal skin tags; congested and erythematous mucosa in the rectum, which was biopsied; and two 5-mm colonic polyps, which were excised. Dr. T. Leif Helland: Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimens obtained during colonoscopy reportedly revealed a tubular adenoma and a sessile serrated polyp, as well as moderately active chronic colitis. Treatment with mesal-amine was resumed. Dr. Sporn: The next month, while doing heavy housework, the patient had new dyspnea and bilateral pleuritic chest-wall pain that was greater on the left side than on the right side, and she had to stop doing housework. The pain persisted for several days, the dyspnea worsened, and the patient presented to the emergency department of another hospital. On evaluation, she had diminished breath sounds and a normal electrocardiogram. Laboratory test results were notable for a normal N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level and normal white-cell and differential counts. The troponin I level was undetectable, and the D-dimer level was 3150 ng per milliliter (reference value, <500). A test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was negative. Blood cultures were obtained. Dr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: Chest radiography reportedly revealed bilateral focal, patchy airspace opacities (Fig. 1A). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly ruled out pulmonary embolism but showed multifocal pulmonary nodules that measured up to 18 mm in diameter (Fig. 1B), pleural effusions, and a kidney stone in the left kidney. Dr. Sporn: A 5-day course of doxycycline, azithromycin, and prednisone was prescribed. Thirteen days later, approximately 2 months before the current admission, the patient returned to the emergency department of the other hospital because of continued dyspnea on exertion. The blood cultures that had been obtained during the previous visit to the emergency department were reportedly negative. White-cell and differential counts were normal, and the procal-citonin level was undetectable. Dr. Shepard: Repeat chest radiography reportedly revealed persistent consolidations and increased pleural effusion. Dr. Sporn: An additional 5-day course of pred-nisone and as-needed inhaled albuterol were prescribed. Four weeks later (approximately 5 weeks before the current admission), the patient was evaluated by a pulmonologist at the other hospital. The patient reported pleuritic pain on the right side of the chest; her symptoms and imaging findings were thought to be related to multi-focal pneumonia and parapneumonic effusions. A 3-week tapering course of prednisone was prescribed. After completion of the prednisone course, the patient reported dyspnea with labored breathing, orthopnea, and chest discomfort. Repeat chest CT was performed, and the patient was referred to the pulmonary clinic of this hospital. Dr. Shepard: The repeat chest CT, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed resolution of some of the nodules in the lingula and right upper lobe but also an overall increased number of nodules (Fig. 1C and 1D). Dr. Sporn: Six days after her repeat chest CT (6 days before the current admission), the patient was evaluated at the pulmonary clinic of this hospital. She reported that the prednisone had reduced the pain in the right side of her chest. Her exercise capacity had decreased from being able to run 5 miles to having dyspnea after running less than half a mile. A review of systems was notable for occasional night sweats, weight gain of 15 kg in the past year, a faint rash on the abdomen, blurred vision with swelling of the right eyelid that had lasted for 3 weeks, Raynaud’s phenomenon, diffuse joint stiffness and pain, and swelling of the fingers that limited some movements, such as opening jars. She had no fevers, chills, cough, nose or throat symptoms, eye pain or visual field loss, wheezing, palpitations, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, changes in bowel habits, urinary symptoms, or neuro-logic symptoms. She reported no sick contacts. Medical history was notable for hypothyroidism, multiple kidney stones, and depression. Medications included mesalamine, levothyroxine, and escitalopram, as well as lorazepam and inhaled albuterol as needed. The patient had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 5 years but had quit approximately 20 years before the current admission. She used cannabis oil, but there was no other history of substance use. She previously worked as an educator but had left her job because of illness. She lived in a small town in New England with her spouse and three children. Birds and cats were kept in the home, and she had previously had a cat bite. She reported that she had had no other environmental or occupational exposures. There was no travel history except for a commercial vacation cruise. Family history included celiac disease in her mother and lung cancer in her maternal grandfather, who had been a long-term smoker. The temporal temperature was 36.5°C, the heart rate 95 beats per minute, the blood pressure 129/81 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Examination was notable for intermittent shallow breathing and faint crackles in the right lung. The right eyelid was erythematous and mildly swollen. Blood levels of creatine kinase, aldolase, and rheumatoid factor were normal. Anti-Ro, anti-La, anti-Smith, anti-RNP, anti–Jo-1, anti–Scl-70, anti–human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide, and antineu-trophil cytoplasmic antibodies were not detected. Serum tests for cryptococcal antigen and 1,3-β-d-glucan were negative, as were urine tests for blastomyces, coccidioides, and histo-plasma antigens. An interferon-γ release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and a hypersensitivity pneumonitis panel were also negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital, and repeat CT imaging was scheduled. During the next 6 days, dyspnea worsened, and diffuse pain with involvement of the chest and fingers persisted. The patient was admitted to the medicine unit of this hospital for additional evaluation. The temporal temperature was 36.1°C, the heart rate 64 beats per minute, the blood pressure 141/85 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while she was breathing ambient air. The patient was observed to take intermittent, shallow breaths. There were no ulcers or lesions in the oropharynx. A faint erythematous rash was noted under the breasts, but no other rashes were present. Chest discomfort was not reproducible with palpation. There was no swelling, warmth, or erythema of the joints. Blood levels of high-sensitivity troponin T, NT-proBNP, angiotensin-converting enzyme, galactomannan antigen, and C3 and C4 were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urine levels of human chorionic gonadotropin and anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies were undetectable. Dr. Shepard: High-resolution chest CT (Fig. 1E and 1F) revealed persistent bilateral solid lung nodules with surrounding ground-glass opacities and a small pleural effusion in the right lung. Gallstones and kidney stones were also visible. Dr. Sporn: On the second hospital day, an oph-thalmologic examination performed after dilation revealed blepharitis with a foamy tear layer; there was no uveitis. Oral doxycycline and eye rinses were administered. On the third hospital day, a transthoracic echocardiogram showed trace right-to-left shunting through a patent foramen ovale but was otherwise was normal. Antitreponemal antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin IgM and IgG, and β2-glycoprotein 1 IgM and IgG were undetectable. Diagnostic tests were performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2021,08,nejm-case-2021-08,A 34-Year-Old Woman with Cholangiocarcinoma,"Dr. Christopher T. Chen: A 34-year-old woman was evaluated in the oncology clinic of this hospital for the management of relapsed, metastatic intrahepatic cholangio-carcinoma. The patient had been well until 3 years before this evaluation, when acute abdominal and back pain developed, and she presented to the emergency department of another hospital. As part of the evaluation, abdominal ultrasonography was performed and reportedly revealed a lesion in the right lobe of the liver. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Theodore T. Pierce: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a heterogeneous, hypoenhancing, lobulated lesion that measured 6.1 cm by 4.5 cm (Fig. 1A), with imaging characteristics suggestive of primary or metastatic cancer. The lesion was associated with peripheral biliary dilatation, which suggested biliary obstruction (Fig. 1B); restricted diffusion, indicating high tissue density (Fig. 1C); peripheral rim enhancement on arterial phase imaging, reflecting increased vascularity at the rim of the lesion (Fig. 1D); and delayed enhancement of the more central areas of the lesion, indicating fibrosis (Fig. 1E and 1F). Taken together, these features are atypical of benign lesions, such as hemangiomas, focal nodular hyperplasia, and hepatic adenoma, and are most consistent with cholangiocarcinoma. Positron-emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT), performed after the administration of intravenous 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) tracer, revealed FDG avidity in the hepatic mass in the right lobe. No additional sites of hypermetabolism were noted. Dr. Chen: Given the concern for cancer, blood samples were obtained for testing for tumor markers. The level of CA 19-9 was elevated, at 110 IU per milliliter (reference value, <35), but the levels of alpha-fetoprotein and carcinoembryonic antigen were normal. An ultrasound-guided core-needle biopsy of the liver mass in the right lobe was performed, and management decisions were made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,36,nejm-case-2019-36,"A 34-Year-Old Man with Dyspnea, Odynophagia, and Abdominal Pain","Dr. Pierre O. Ankomah (Medicine): A 34-year-old man with asthma was admitted to this hospital during the winter because of dyspnea. Three months before admission, odynophagia developed, and the patient noted white plaques in his mouth. He presented to an urgent care clinic, where a clinical diagnosis of thrush was made, and an oral suspension of nystatin was prescribed. One month before admission, exertional dyspnea and a cough developed. The cough was intermittently productive of thick, grayish sputum that occasionally contained a small amount of blood. The patient used an albuterol metered-dose inhaler, but the dyspnea progressively worsened. Two weeks before admission, fatigue, myalgias, night sweats, shaking chills, and midsternal chest pain developed. During the 3 days before admission, the patient also noted fevers. On the morning of admission, because of the progressive dyspnea and odynophagia, the patient presented to the emergency department at another hospital for evaluation. On examination at the other hospital, the patient was cachectic and appeared ill. The temperature was 38.7°C, the pulse 121 beats per minute, the blood pressure 96/65 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while he was breathing ambient air. The height was 170 cm, the weight 49.9 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 17.3. The mucous membranes were dry, and white plaques were noted throughout the mouth and posterior oropharynx. The lungs were clear, with no crackles, rhonchi, or wheezes. The red-cell indexes and blood levels of glucose, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and lactic acid were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests and urinalysis; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Culture of a nasopharyngeal swab for influenza type A and B antigens was negative, and a rapid screening test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies was positive. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Intravenous fluids, acetaminophen, and ketorolac were administered, and imaging studies of the chest were performed. Dr. Dexter P. Mendoza: A posteroanterior chest radiograph (Fig. 1A) showed diffuse, hazy airspace opacities that were more prominent on the right side than on the left side, with slight peri-hilar predominance. Subsequent computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material (Fig. 1B), revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities bilaterally; there was no evidence of mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy or pleural effusion. Dr. Ankomah: Two hours after the patient arrived at the emergency department of the other hospital, the oxygen saturation decreased to 91% and the blood pressure decreased to 81/42 mm Hg. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute, a central venous catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein, and a continuous infusion of norepinephrine at a rate of 4 μg per minute was initiated. The blood pressure increased to 106/64 mm Hg. Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin were administered intravenously, and the patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital. On arrival at this hospital, the patient’s blood pressure was normal, and the norepinephrine infusion was stopped; additional history was obtained. The patient reported a diffuse headache. During the preceding 2 months, he had lost approximately 13.6 kg of weight and had had nausea, intermittent vomiting, and mild, diffuse abdominal pain. He had a history of depression, anxiety, and asthma. Thirteen years earlier, he had been treated for gonorrhea and chlamydia. Medications included inhaled albuterol, inhaled budesonide–formoterol, and oral alprazolam as needed. He had no known allergies. The patient was of Mediterranean descent, had been born in the southwestern United States, and had traveled to northern Africa in the remote past. He had unstable housing and slept in shelters or at the homes of friends and family in coastal New England, where he worked on a seasonal basis. He had smoked approximately 10 cigarettes per day since he was 18 years of age, drank two glasses of wine every evening, and smoked marijuana occasionally; he did not inject illicit drugs. He had had 20 previous sexual partners, both men and women, and had used condoms inconsistently. On examination, the patient appeared chronically ill. The temperature was 36.8°C, the pulse 102 beats per minute, the blood pressure 110/56 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. Auscultation of the lungs revealed scattered bi-basilar crackles. Examination of the skin revealed diffuse xerosis, scattered hypopigmented macules on the arms, and a violaceous plaque with irregular borders on the plantar aspect of the medial right foot. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Tests for pneumococcal and legio-nella antigens in the urine were negative, and the blood level of 1,3-β-d-glucan was greater than 500 pg per milliliter (normal value, <60). A clinical diagnosis of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia was made. Treatment with trimethoprim–sulfa-methoxazole was continued, treatment with cef-triaxone and levofloxacin was discontinued, and treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, flucona-zole, and prednisone was initiated. The patient was admitted to this hospital. On the second hospital day, additional laboratory test results were received. A screening assay for HIV type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV type 2 (HIV-2) antibodies and HIV-1 p24 antigen was positive, and an antibody differentiation assay confirmed the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection. The plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load was 363,000 copies per milliliter, and the blood CD4+ T-cell count was 77 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 348 to 1456); 11% of the lymphocytes were CD4+ T cells (reference range, 21 to 64). A blood test for Treponema pallidum antibodies was positive, a rapid plasma reagin test was negative, and a T. pallidum particle agglutination assay was positive. A lumbar puncture revealed clear cerebrospinal fluid with no red or white cells and normal levels of protein and glucose; a Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test was negative. Three induced sputum smears that were examined for acid-fast bacilli were negative, as were a sputum polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) test for Mycobacte-rium tuberculosis, an interferon-γ release assay for cell-mediated immune response to M. tuberculosis, and a blood test for cryptococcal antigen. A test for cytomegalovirus IgG antibodies was positive, and the result of a PCR test for cytomegalovirus DNA performed on a blood specimen was undetectable. The patient’s dyspnea and cough gradually abated, and treatment with supplemental oxygen, vancomycin, and cefepime was discontinued. On the fourth hospital day, a 2-week course of intravenous penicillin was initiated. On the fifth hospital day, the patient reported that his abdominal pain had increased. The pain was diffuse, moderate in intensity, and sharp, and it worsened when he was in the supine position. On examination, the abdomen was soft, with diffuse tenderness on palpation that was most severe in the right and left upper quadrants. Dr. Mendoza: CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a moderate fecal load but was otherwise normal. Dr. Ankomah: Polyethylene glycol and senna were administered. On the sixth hospital day, a fixed-dose formulation of bictegravir, emtricita-bine, and tenofovir alafenamide was started, and the dosage of prednisone was decreased. During the next 4 days, the abdominal pain worsened and was associated with abdominal distention, nausea, several episodes of blood-tinged emesis, and loose stools. On examination, the abdomen was diffusely tender on palpation; normal bowel sounds were present. Laboratory studies revealed stable liver-function test results and a blood lactic acid level of 4.1 mmol per liter (reference range, 0.5 to 2.0). Dr. Mendoza: Repeat CT angiography of the abdomen and pelvis was normal. Dr. Ankomah: Intravenous fluids were administered, and the blood lactic acid level normalized. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2009,36,nejm-case-2009-36,"A 23-Year-Old Man with Cough, Hoarseness, and Abnormalities on Chest Imaging","Dr. David T. Ting (Medical Oncology): A 23-year-old man was transferred to this hospital because of cough, hoarseness, fever, and abnormalities on chest imaging. The patient had been well until 1 month before admission, when a nonproductive cough developed. During the following month, subjective fevers occurred, most often at night with no sweats; he did not take his temperature. One week before admission, hoarseness developed, associated with myalgias and dyspnea on exertion. Two nights before admission, the temperature rose to 38.9°C and was associated with night sweats. The next morning, he saw his primary care provider. He reported no headache, sore throat, sputum production, chest pain, palpitations, bleeding or bruising, change in appetite, or visual, abdominal, urinary, or neurologic symptoms. A chest radiograph reportedly showed hilar and mediastinal masses. He was sent to the emergency department of another hospital. On examination, the patient appeared to be comfortable. The blood pressure was 139/84 mm Hg, the pulse 129 beats per minute, the temperature 36.6°C, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 81.2 kg and the height 193 cm. A discrete movable nodule, 1 to 2 mm in diameter, was present in the posterior right testicle and was thought to be consistent with an epididymal cyst; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. The serum alkaline phosphatase level was 294 U per liter (reference range, 27 to 110) and the lactate dehydrogenase level 545 U per liter (reference range, 110 to 225); levels of alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, electrolytes, glucose, amylase, lipase, uric acid, magnesium, total protein, and albumin and tests of liver and renal function were normal; screening tests for streptococcal pharyngitis and mononucleosis were negative, as were antibody and antigen tests for the Epstein–Barr virus. The platelet count was 521,000 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 135,000 to 400,000), and the remainder of the complete blood count was normal. The activated partial-thromboplastin time was 41.5 seconds (reference range, 23.3 to 34.5), the prothrombin time 16.8 seconds (reference range, 12.8 to 15.0), and the international normalized ratio 1.3 (reference range, 0.9 to 1.1). A chest radiograph revealed massive hilar and medi-astinal lymphadenopathy and ovoid densities in the right apex and superior seg-ment of the left lower lobe. He was admitted to the hospital. The next day, computed tomography (CT) of the chest after the administration of contrast material revealed a large confluent mass of me-diastinal and bilateral hilar lymph nodes, masses in the right apex (3.5 cm and 2.8 cm in diameter) and superior left lower lobe (3.6 cm in diameter), and masses in the left lower lobe that extended from the left hilum. CT of the abdomen and pelvis after the administration of contrast material showed a permeative, lytic, and destructive lesion in the posterior right iliac bone. Transthoracic echocardiography was normal. Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia (132 beats per minute) and was otherwise normal. Mediastinos-copy with biopsy of a mediastinal lymph node was performed, and later that day, the patient was transferred to this hospital. The patient had lost 4.5 kg in weight, without dieting, during the previous 2 months. One month before admission, his primary care physician had palpated a mass in his right testis, and 12 days before admission ultrasonography had shown a small right epididymal cyst and hydro-cele. He had undergone circumcision 5 years earlier for phimosis. He was taking no medications before his admission to the other hospital, and he was allergic to meperidine. He was a college student and lived with a roommate on a farm and had exposures to cows, horses, and wild dogs. He drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. There was no history of recent travel; his roommate had recently traveled to Spain and had a respiratory illness with cough, fever, and sore throat. His parents and two sisters were healthy; his maternal grandfather had died at the age of 67 years from lung cancer, a paternal aunt had died at 25 years of age from fibro-sarcoma, and a maternal aunt had sarcoidosis. On examination, the patient appeared ill and was thin; his voice was hoarse. The temperature was 36.4°C, the blood pressure 137/84 mm Hg, the pulse 107 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The remainder of the examination was normal. The serum alkaline phosphatase level was 253 U per liter (reference range, 45 to 115) and the lactate dehydrogenase level 616 U per liter (reference range, 110 to 210). The platelet count was 644,000 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). Results of other repeated laboratory tests were normal. The next day, the temperature rose to 39.3°C; acetaminophen was administered. Cultures of the blood were sterile, and the urine grew rare staphylococcus species. A chest radio-graph obtained on the fourth hospital day showed no change in the hilar and mediastinal masses and no evidence of pneumonia. A screening test for tuberculosis was negative. On the fifth hospital day, combined 18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET) and CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. The scans showed multiple 18F-FDG–avid lesions in the chest, including masses in the left lower lobe (4.3 by 2.6 cm), left posterior pleural surface (3.7 by 1.7 cm), right upper lobe (3.6 by 2.2 cm), and posterior right apex (0.8 cm in diameter), and the mediastinal and hilar masses noted previously; a heterogeneously enhancing, 18F-FDG–avid, soft-tissue mass (7.3 by 4.7 cm) that obliterated the posterior aspect of the right ilium and infiltrated the superior aspect of the right sacroiliac joint; and 18F-FDG– avid lesions throughout the lumbar spine, ace-tabula, and pubic bones. There was no evidence of pathologic fracture. A screening test for the human immunodeficiency virus was negative. On the sixth day the result of a diagnostic test was received.

The patient had been cutting weeds outdoors using a power string trimmer when a nail was thrown up by the machine and became lodged in the region of his right eye. He had immediate and persistent severe pain in the eye, which became excruciating with attempts to open the eye or move it. Epistaxis occurred but resolved spontaneously. He did not lose consciousness. He called emergency medical services; on examination, the nail appeared to be embedded in the center of the right globe, and there was slight bleeding. Vital signs and the remainder of the examination, including evaluation of the vision in the left eye and a peripheral neurologic examination, were normal. The eyes were bandaged with gauze, and the patient was transported by ambulance to the emergency department of this hospital, arriving approximately 20 minutes after the injury occurred. The patient reported excruciating pain in the right eye that increased with attempts to move or open the eye. He was otherwise healthy. He was allergic to loraze-pam, which had caused hives. He was single, lived alone, and worked as a landscaper. He did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. On examination, the patient was alert, oriented, and in severe pain. The blood pressure was 134/99 mm Hg, the pulse 72 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The head of a nail was protruding from between the right eyelids; the nail appeared to be directed medially and posteriorly (Fig. 1). There was diffuse periorbital swelling, and the patient was unable to open the eye. The left pupil was 5 mm in diameter and reactive. There was dried blood in the right nostril; the remainder of the examination, including evaluation of ambulation, movement of the arms and legs, speech, and sensation, was normal. The white-cell count was 14,000 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), with 87% neutro-phils, 9% lymphocytes, and 4% monocytes; the remainder of the complete blood count was normal, as were results of renal-function and coagulation tests and levels of electrolytes, calcium, and glucose. Morphine sulfate (4 mg) was administered intravenously. Diagnostic tests were performed, and management decisions were made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2021,24,nejm-case-2021-24,"A 63-Year-Old Woman with Fever, Sore Throat, and Confusion","Dr. Peiyun Ni (Medicine): A 63-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of fever, headache, sore throat, and confusion. The patient had been well until 2 weeks before this admission, when fever, chills, myalgias, and headache developed. She also had sore throat, odynophagia, and the feeling of a “lump” in the neck. The patient was concerned that she had coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and sought evaluation at an urgent care clinic of another hospital. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was negative, and she was instructed to quarantine at home. Five days before this admission, the patient returned to the clinic of the other hospital because of persistent symptoms, including daily fevers. The temperature was 37.2°C, and the remainder of the physical examination was reportedly normal. Testing of another nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative, as was testing of an oropharyngeal swab for the rapid detection of streptococcal antigen. On the day of admission, the patient’s sister visited the patient and noticed that she had difficulty with word finding and performing basic tasks at home. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient reported fevers, chills, myalgias, fatigue, generalized weakness, headaches, sore throat, and odynophagia. She acknowledged that she had mild confusion and “mental slowness” of 2 weeks’ duration. A review of systems was notable for a lump in the neck, poor appetite, unintentional weight loss of 3 kg in the past 2 weeks, and anosmia for the past year, with onset before the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. There was no neck stiffness, photophobia, cough, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or dysuria. The patient had hypertension for which she took amlodipine and lisinopril; there were no known drug allergies. She was born in South America and had im-migrated to the United States two decades earlier. She lived in an urban area of New England with her mother and son. Her son had a brain injury and was seen by visiting nurses daily; one nurse had had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test 4 days before this evaluation. There were no other sick contacts. The patient worked in management and enjoyed gardening as a hobby. She had no recent insect bites or travel. Although she had not been sexually active for several years, she had had an episode of unprotected sexual intercourse with a new male partner 3 weeks before this evaluation. She smoked four cigarettes daily and had done so for 40 years. She did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her mother had Alzheimer’s disease. The temperature was 38.9°C, the blood pressure 160/80 mm Hg, the pulse 96 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 29.9. The patient appeared fatigued and was alert and oriented. She was unable to perform simple calculations, to list the days of the week in reverse order, or to follow two-step commands. The mucous membranes were dry, and a small non-tender lymph node was palpable in the posterior neck on the left side. The white-cell count was 3700 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000); the aspartate aminotransferase level was 280 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 32) and the alanine aminotransferase level 235 U per liter (reference range, 7 to 33). Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed the presence of ketones, nitrites, and protein; there were fewer than 10 white cells per high-power field (reference range, <10). Testing of a third nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative, and blood specimens were obtained for culture. Dr. William A. Mehan: A radiograph of the chest was normal. Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed gallbladder sludge. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, showed prominent gastrohepatic, periportal, peri-aortic, and inguinal lymph nodes, the largest measuring 1.4 cm in diameter. CT of the head, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, showed mild scattered hypodensities in the peri-ventricular and subcortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the intravenous administration of contrast material, was notable for multifocal patchy hyper-intensities throughout the juxtacortical and deep white matter of the cerebral hemispheres on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, without corresponding restricted diffusion or abnor-mal enhancement (Fig. 1). The findings were unchanged from MRI findings obtained 3 months before presentation. Dr. Ni: Empirical treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone and acyclovir was started, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. A lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was 24 cm of water; the cerebrospi-nal fluid (CSF) was clear and colorless. On CSF analysis, the total protein level was 201 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55) and the glucose level 43 mg per deciliter (2.4 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]). There were 73 white cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), of which 65% were lymphocytes, 29% plasma cells, and 6% monocytes. Gram’s staining showed abundant mononuclear cells and no organisms. The intravenous administration of ceftriaxone and acyclovir was stopped. A diagnostic test was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2013,10,nejm-case-2013-10,"A 30-Year-Old Man with Fever, Myalgias, Arthritis, and Rash","Dr. Sheila F.Mitsuma (Medicine): A 30-year-old man with a history of intravenous drug use was admitted to this hospital because of fever, myalgias, arthritis, and rash. The patient was in his usual state of health until 12 days before admission, when 2 days after discharge from a detoxification clinic, he reportedly self-administered heroin intravenously. Two days later, fever, chills, cough, myalgias, anorexia, and malaise occurred and were associated with the gradual onset of joint swelling and pain, an erythematous and nonpruritic rash, and episodes of severe diaphoresis. The joint symptoms first developed in the ankles, and during the 3 days before admission, they affected his knees, hands, and elbows and were accompanied by weakness of the arms and legs. Two days before admission, the patient went to the emergency department of another hospital. On examination, the temperature was 38.3°C. The white-cell count was reportedly normal, the blood alanine aminotransferase level was 110 U per liter, and the aspartate aminotransferase level was 73 U per liter; the remainder of the complete blood count and metabolic panel was normal. A chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and transesophageal echocardiogram were also reportedly normal. Cultures of the blood were obtained. A diagnosis of a viral syndrome was made, and he returned home. Fevers resolved, but the pain increased and became more severe in the arms than in the legs; the patient rated it at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He walked gingerly and in small steps because of his joint symptoms and was unable to raise his arms above his head or grasp a cup of coffee. He came to the emergency department of this hospital. The patient reported redness of the eyes and pain in the neck region. However, he reported no headaches, sore throat, rhinorrhea, sinusitis, tinnitus, loss of weight, impairment of his senses (smell, vision, hearing, and taste), or changes in bowel and urinary function. One month before admission, wheezing, dyspnea at rest, lightheadedness, and a dry cough developed, without fever or chills. The patient had used intravenous drugs for 10 years, participated intermittently in needle-exchange programs, and had enrolled in detoxification programs 15 times. Three days after the onset of symptoms, methadone therapy was begun. He also had migraines, long-standing Raynaud’s phenomenon, and recurrent epistaxis after repair of facial and nasal-bridge fractures. He had a history of a fractured wrist and, after intra-venous drug use, an abscess in his left arm. He suspected that he had hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, acquired after a remote exposure to a known carrier. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 6 months earlier had reportedly been negative. He had taken ibuprofen for muscle pain and had no known allergies. He was unemployed and lived with his mother. He was sexually active and monogamous with his girlfriend and did not use barrier protection. He smoked cigarettes. His father had coronary artery disease and had had his first myocardial infarction when he was in his 30s; his mother, sister, and multiple maternal relatives had diabetes mel-litus; a sister had systemic lupus erythematosus; another sister had eczema; and a nephew had Kawasaki’s disease. On examination, the temperature was 37.2°C, the blood pressure 138/88 mm Hg, the pulse 106 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The con-junctivae were injected, and dentition was poor. Breath sounds were coarse, with mild wheezing, and there was a tender, palpable liver tip 2 cm below the costal margin. On the extremities and anterior trunk, there was a fine, erythematous, blanching, reticular, macular rash. The joints of the hands, elbows, knees, and ankles were diffusely swollen and warm. There were also effusions in the wrists, metacarpal–phalangeal joints, and knees. Active movement of the large joints caused severe pain; passive range of motion was full, including that of the cervical spine. There was diffuse muscle tenderness (especially in the quadriceps and calves) and 1+ edema in the extremities, decreased muscle strength (4 out of 5) with extension and flexion of the arms and hands, and 3+ deep-tendon reflexes of the brachioradia-lis and patellar tendons. The gait involved small steps and a wide stance; the remainder of the examination was normal. The hematocrit, hemoglobin, and red-cell indexes were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, creatine kinase, total and direct bilirubin, total protein, albumin, globulin, and alkaline phosphatase and the results of renal-function tests; other test results are shown in Table 1. Testing of a specimen of blood for rheumatoid factor and antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide and double-stranded DNA was negative. Testing for antibodies against HIV type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV type 2 (HIV-2) was nonreactive, and HIV-1 RNA was not detected. Testing of blood for cryopro-tein was also negative. A test for syphilis, with the use of rapid plasma reagin, was negative. Urinalysis revealed trace urobilinogen and was otherwise normal. Cultures of the blood drawn earlier remained sterile. A chest radiograph was normal. A combination of acetaminophen and oxycodone was administered. Diagnostic tests were performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2008,37,nejm-case-2008-37,A 17-Year-Old Boy with a Pituitary Tumor and Skull Abnormalities,"A 17-year-old boy was seen at this hospital because of a pituitary tumor and radiologic evidence of bony abnormalities in the skull. The patient was well until approximately 12 years of age, when headaches developed. The pain ranged from dull to stabbing (up to 8 on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain), was located primarily in the left frontal region (medial and posterior to his left eye), and occurred one to two times per month, with no precipitating factors. Nausea, without vomiting, occurred occasionally in the morning. His peripheral vision and visual acuity decreased, and his performance at school declined. Approximately 2 years before this evaluation, his growth stopped; his parents noted mood changes and angry outbursts, and he was referred to a psychiatrist. Buspirone was administered. During the next 18 months, the frequency increased to one or two headaches per week, with fatigue, occasional somnolence, cold intolerance, darkening of the skin over his elbows and neck, and occasional epistaxis. There was no constipation, dry skin, or hair loss. During the 3 years before this evaluation, he gained 13.6 kg in weight, and stretch marks developed on his abdomen. Approximately 3 months before this evaluation, the headaches became consistently stabbing and increased in severity; the patient rated the pain as 10. Computed tomography (CT) of the sinuses, performed without the administration of contrast material at another hospital, revealed normal sinuses but a moth-eaten appearance of the skull base and clivus, with destruction of cortical bone. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head with the administration of gadolinium revealed an ex-pansile, cystic-appearing lesion, 2 cm in diameter, in the sellar and suprasellar region, which compressed the optic chiasm, and a solid mass, with mixed signal intensity and heterogeneous enhancement, that involved the entire clivus, extended into the petrous bones, indented the midpons, and expanded into the right cerebel-lomedullary angle. Ten weeks before the current evaluation, the patient saw a neurosurgeon at another hospital. On examination, there was a mild right sixth-nerve palsy; bitemporal hemianopia; positive Hoffmann’s sign (in which sudden flexion of the third finger by flicking the nail induces extension of the distal interphalangeal joint of that finger and flexion of the thumb) on the right side; striae on the shoulders, axillae, and waist; and an area of hyperpigmentation on the right shoulder. There was no facial or chest hair, and the patient was at Tanner stage 4 for puberty. Results of laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Ophthalmologic examination showed noncon-gruous bitemporal hemianopia, with complete temporal hemianopia on the right side and a less severe left temporal visual-field defect. Visual acuity was 20/50 in both eyes, correcting to 20/30 in the right and 20/25 in the left. On endocrinologic evaluation, the patient reported that pubic hair, adult body odor, and acne had developed at the age of 13 years. The weight was 82.4 kg, the height 168 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 29.2; the vital signs were normal. There was mild facial acne and acanthosis nigricans of the neck and axillae. A grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur was present at the left sternal border, and the liver edge was palpated at 5 to 6 cm; the remainder of the examination was normal. Neu-ropsychological evaluation revealed high-average overall abilities, some difficulties with short-term memory, and more developed nonverbal than verbal skills. Test results are shown in Table 1. Treatment with levothyroxine was begun. The patient was admitted to the other hospital. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. The sellar component of the mass was resected through a transsphenoidal approach, with biopsy of the clivus. Pathological examination revealed a prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma. Two days after the operation, MRI of the brain and spine with gadolinium revealed decompression and resection of the cystic hemorrhagic component in the sellar region. The patient was discharged on the fourth hospital day; medications included ca-bergoline, dexamethasone, levothyroxine, buspi-rone, and ranitidine. Two weeks after the operation, the patient reported improvement in his vision and infrequent mild, dull headaches. Visual acuity was 20/25 in both eyes, and the visual fields were normal. Results of laboratory tests performed 3 weeks postoperatively are shown in Table 1. Positron-emission tomography (PET) of the whole body and head, with 18F fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) as a tracer, revealed variable but generally low 18F-FDG avidity of the residual mass and no evidence of disease elsewhere. A lumbar puncture was normal. Four weeks postoperatively, the patient was seen in the pediatric endocrinology and radiation-oncology clinics of this hospital, for consideration of proton-beam irradiation to the bone lesion. His energy level had improved, and the headaches had diminished in frequency and severity. The patient had been adopted at the age of 5 months. Early development had been normal. He lived with his adoptive parents. A junior in high school, he was a good student and active in sports. No history of the health of his biologic family was available. The vital signs were normal, and the findings on physical examination were unchanged and consistent with pubertal development at Tanner stage 4. Results of laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. The dose of cabergoline was increased to 0.5 mg twice weekly. Repeated MRI of the brain with the administration of gadolinium again revealed a large, heterogeneously enhancing mass centered in the clivus, with extension into the pe-trous bones, effacement of the prepontine cistern with indenting of the pons, and narrowing of the right cerebellomedullary angle. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2018,37,nejm-case-2018-37,A 23-Year-Old Woman with Vision Loss,"Dr. Seth N. Levin (Neurology): A 23-year-old right-handed woman with a history of migraines was evaluated at this hospital for vertigo and vision loss affecting the right eye. Six days before admission, a right frontal headache and right retro-orbital pain developed; these features had not been typical of the patient’s previous migraines. Five days before admission, the patient awoke with an alteration in her vision, which she described as a “gray dot” approximately 6 cm in diameter (as measured with the use of an Amsler grid held at 12 inches) and was located in the inferona-sal field of vision of the right eye. Later that day, she had intermittent diminished vision in the right eye, which she described as “white appearing” and lasting for 45 to 60 seconds at a time. The size of the abnormality was difficult for the patient to define, but the abnormality did not involve the entire field of vision of the right eye. She did not have pain with eye movement, floaters, scintillating scotomata, or fortification spectra. When she covered her right eye, the vision in her left eye was normal. Three days before admission, several episodes of vertigo occurred. The patient described the vertigo as “room spinning” and lasting for approximately 30 seconds. The vertigo was not provoked by angular head movements. Intermittent nonposi-tional bifrontal headaches occurred one or two times daily, particularly when the patient was straining her eyes to look at a cellular telephone or computer. She did not have facial numbness, loss of vision with eye movement, or other neurologic symptoms. The abnormality that she had described as a gray dot in the infero-nasal field of vision of the right eye remained fixed, and the night before admission, she went to a hospital that specializes in ophthalmology and is affiliated with this hospital. In the emergency department of the affiliated hospital, the temperature was 36.6°C, the pulse 79 beats per minute, the blood pressure 103/64 mm Hg, the re-spiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. On the Ishihara color test, six of eight color plates were identified correctly in the visual field of the right eye (two half plates were missed in the area of reported loss of vision) and eight of eight color plates were identified correctly in the visual field of the left eye. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light, without a relative afferent pupillary defect. Automated perimetry revealed a dense depression in the inferonasal field of vision of the right eye. Slit-lamp examination of the eyes revealed normal adnexa, lids, lashes, conjunctivae, and sclerae and clear corneas. The anterior chambers, irises, lenses, and vitreous were normal in both eyes. The intraocular pressure was 12 mm Hg in both eyes. The optic nerves were pink, with normal cups and sharp margins. There was an area of mild macular whitening superotemporal to the fovea in the right eye. The vessels appeared normal in both eyes, without emboli, Gass plaques, boxcarring (segmentation of blood in retinal arterioles), or sheathing. Extraocular movements were full bilaterally, without nystagmus. The next morning, the patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital for further diagnostic evaluation. She reported stable visual-field defects and ongoing intermittent headaches. She had had no rash or ulcers. There was a 16-year history of migraines without aura; the migraines occurred every 1 to 3 months, were pulsatile in quality, were associated with sensitivity to light, and resolved with sleep. There was no history of blood clots, miscarriage, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or autoimmune disease. The only medication was an etonogestrel implant. There were no known drug allergies. There was no family history of stroke, hypercoagulability, or cardiac disease. The patient worked in a nursing home and lived alone in eastern Massachusetts. She was sexually active with one male partner, with whom she was in a monogamous relationship. She drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. The results of the ophthalmologic examination had not changed from the examination at the affiliated hospital, and the results of the general and neurologic examinations were normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, glycated hemoglobin, thyrotropin, C-reactive protein, and homocysteine were normal, as were results of renal- and liver-function tests, the prothrombin time, the international normalized ratio, the partial-thromboplastin time, the complete blood count, the differential count, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Test results were normal for protein S, protein C, and antithrombin III activity, as well as the prothrombin G20210A mutation and activated protein C resistance. A lupus anticoagulant screen was negative. An assay for antinuclear antibodies was positive at 1:640 with a speckled pattern, and assays for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs), β2-glycoprotein 1 IgM and IgG antibodies, and anticardiolipin IgM and IgG antibodies were negative. A lumbar puncture revealed colorless cerebrospinal fluid, with an opening pressure of 13 cm of water, a glucose level of 62 mg per deciliter (3.4 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]), a total protein level of 77 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55), a total nucleated-cell count of 1 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 0 to 5), and a red-cell count of 3 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 0 to 5). Low-dose aspirin was administered, and the patient was admitted to the neurology service. One day after admission, hearing loss and tinnitus of the right ear developed. Audiometry revealed bilateral sensorineural hearing loss that was more severe in the right ear than in the left ear, with normal tympanic-membrane mobility bilaterally. On the fourth day, color photographs of the fundus were obtained, and fluorescein angiography was performed to evaluate the retinal vasculature. Dr. Lucy H. Young: Wide-field photographs of the fundus showed retinal whitening superotempo-ral to the fovea in the right eye (Fig. 1A) and a subtle area of retinal whitening along the infero-temporal arcade of the left eye (Fig. 1B). Fluores-cein angiography revealed delayed filling of two arteriolar branches along the superotemporal arcade of the right eye, with one remaining blocked even at 39 seconds after the administration of fluorescein (Fig. 2A). In the left eye, blocked arterioles were noted in the inferonasal and infero-temporal periphery (Fig. 2B). Images obtained 5 minutes after the administration of fluores-cein showed segmental perivascular staining in both eyes (Fig. 2C and 2D).

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2008,21,nejm-case-2008-21,An 11-Month-Old Boy with Fever and Pulmonary Infiltrates,"An 11-month-old boy was admitted to this hospital because of fevers and pulmonary infiltrates. One month before admission, a month after beginning a visit to India with his parents, daily fevers, with temperatures up to 38.9°C, developed, without localizing signs or symptoms. Before the family left for India, the boy’s primary care physician gave him one dose of immunoglobulin intramuscularly for hepatitis A prophylaxis and prescribed mefloquine weekly for malaria prophylaxis. He was evaluated at an Indian health care facility, and amoxicillin–clavulanate was administered, but there was no improvement. On the sixth day after the onset of fevers, mefloquine was stopped and chloroquine was administered for 3 days, followed by ciprofloxacin for 3 days. Fever persisted, and a nonproductive cough developed. Nineteen days before his admission to this hospital, the patient was admitted to a hospital in India. His blood pressure was 90/60 mm Hg and his pulse 138 beats per minute; although he had been febrile, his temperature was normal. Hepato-splenomegaly was noted, but the results of the remainder of the examination were normal. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. No parasites were seen on examination of a peripheral-blood smear, and a test for serum antibodies to Salmonella typhi was negative. A chest radiograph showed an irregular perihilar paren-chymal opacity with air bronchograms and multiple smaller air-space opacities in the left perihilar region. Ampicillin–sulbactam and amikacin were administered intravenously. A tuberculin skin test showed no induration after 48 hours, and the temperature, which had been fluctuating, returned to normal on the fifth hospital day. Intravenous fluid being infused through a catheter inserted in the dorsum of the right distal forearm infiltrated into the tissue, and an adhesive bandage was applied over the site. The patient was discharged on the sixth hospital day, receiving oral amoxicillin–clavulanate and clarithromycin, and his cough gradually resolved. Nine days after discharge, and 5 days before admission to this hospital, he returned to the United States. Two days after his return to the United States, his temperature rose to 39°C, and fever recurred daily thereafter. The amoxicillin–clavulanate was stopped after completion of the course of therapy; the day before admission to this hospital, the clarithromycin was completed. On the day of admission, he was evaluated at the office of his primary care physician; his temperature was 38.7°C. An erythematous nodule, 15 to 18 mm in diameter, was present on the dorsum of the right distal forearm, at the site of the previous venipuncture. There were no other localizing signs or symptoms. A chest ra-diograph showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. A biopsy of the nodule on the forearm was performed, and specimens were sent for culture and pathological examination. The patient was referred to this hospital for admission. The patient was born in the United States after a full-term gestation to a primigravid mother; delivery was by cesarean section because of ce-phalopelvic disproportion. At birth, the patient’s weight was 3.075 kg (21st percentile) and his length 53.3 cm (90th percentile). At 6 weeks of age, he had been admitted to another hospital for a self-limited episode of fever and poor feeding. A palpable spleen tip was noted on examination, and ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed that the spleen was 6.2 cm in length, the upper limit of normal for his age. A culture of the blood was sterile; his temperature returned to normal and he was discharged. Follow-up ultra-sonography of the abdomen 1 month after discharge was normal. Routine immunizations were given, and developmental milestones and growth parameters were normal. At 6 months of age, his weight was 7.1 kg (18th percentile) and length 71 cm (92nd percentile). While in India, the patient and his parents had stayed with relatives in an urban area, and the patient had close contact with many people, including a relative with pulmonary tuberculosis who was receiving triple-drug therapy. There were no exposures to animals. The patient had no allergies to medications, and in the United States he lived with his parents and did not attend day care. His parents were professionals who had emigrated from India. There was no family history of recurrent febrile illnesses, rheu-matologic diseases, or immunodeficiency. On examination, he appeared well — he was playful and breathing comfortably. His weight was 8.2 kg (3rd percentile), temperature 39.3°C, pulse 140 beats per minute, respiratory rate 42 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99% while breathing ambient air. A well-circumscribed area of erythema and induration, 1 cm by 2 cm, was present on the dorsum of the right forearm, and the incision from the biopsy was clean and dry. The lungs were clear, and the results of the remainder of the physical examination were normal. Levels of serum electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the test results for renal and liver function; the results of other laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Tests of nasal secretions for antigens of adenovirus, influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3, and respiratory syncytial virus were negative. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed nodular areas of consolidation throughout both lungs, some with calcification. The larger opacities were in the upper lobes, up to 2.6 cm by 1.7 cm by 1.9 cm. Some were contiguous with the hila and extended to the pleural surface. Soft-tissue fullness in the mediastinum, hila, and left axilla suggested lymphadenopathy. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen were administered orally and cef-triaxone intravenously. On the second hospital day, the temperature rose to 39.7°C. A tuberculin skin test was performed, and an aspirate of gastric secretions obtained in the early morning was sent for acid-fast staining and mycobacterial culture. Isoniazid, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and rifampin were begun. Analysis of a urine specimen was normal, and a culture of the urine specimen, collected in an external bag, grew few mixed flora. Specimens of stool were sent for culture of enteric pathogens, presence of Clostridium difficile toxin, and ova and parasitologic analysis. During the next 3 days, two additional early-morning specimens of gastric aspirate were obtained; staining did not reveal acid-fast bacilli and cultures were pending. On the fourth hospital day, the temperature rose to 40°C and the patient vomited intermittently, occasionally after episodes of coughing productive of white sputum. The site of the tuberculin skin test showed no induration. The next day, the temperature fluctuated between 34.6 and 40.1°C. Serum IgG antibodies to cytomegalovirus were present; test results for Epstein–Barr virus and human immunodeficiency virus antibodies in the serum and legionella and histoplasma urine antigens were negative. Other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Additional specimens of blood were sent for culture; results of other tests were pending. A review of the slides from the skin biopsy that had been performed earlier revealed scattered nuclear debris and rare structures suggestive of fungal hyphae; in deeper sections stained for organisms, these structures were no longer visible. Ceftriaxone was stopped and meropenem and liposomal amphotericin were administered intravenously. On the sixth hospital day, emesis was tinged with blood, and a sample of stool was guaiac-positive. The respiratory rate transiently increased to 66 to 75 breaths per minute, with oxygen saturations between 98 and 100%, then returned to 32 to 44 breaths per minute. The temperature ranged from 33.9 to 39.6°C. Additional chest radiography continued to show bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. A diagnostic procedure was performed on the seventh hospital day.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,16,nejm-case-2010-16,A 48-Year-Old Man with a Cough and Pain in the Left Shoulder,"Dr. Amy C. Sievers (Infectious Diseases): A 48-year-old man was seen in the orthopedic clinic of this hospital because of cough, pain in the left shoulder, and a radio-graphically lucent lesion in the scapula. The patient had been well until approximately 2.5 months earlier, when pain in the left shoulder developed, which was initially intermittent and then became constant. Two months before evaluation, a cough productive of greenish sputum developed, without hemoptysis, chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers, chills, weight loss, or fatigue. A chest radiograph obtained at another hospital reportedly showed pneumonia and a possible lucency in the left scapula. Antibiotics were administered, and the cough improved but then recurred. Five days later, a bone scan reportedly showed two lesions with increased activity involving the posterior spine of the left scapula and the medial cortex of the right femoral shaft. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a lucent lesion within the left scapular spine, with erosion of the cortical surface along the ventral aspect and an intact dorsal (posterior) cortex. There were numerous mildly enlarged mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymph nodes, as well as ill-defined lung nodules, an indeterminate lesion (5 mm in diameter) in the left hepatic lobe, three other cystic lesions (5 mm in diameter) within the liver, and apparent thickening of the wall of the cecum. A colonoscopic examination was reportedly normal. Approximately 6 weeks before this evaluation, dual CT and positron-emission tomography (PET) performed after the administration of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) reportedly showed a well-circumscribed lytic lesion, 13 mm in diameter, in the left scapular spine with marked 18F-FDG uptake (specific uptake value, approximately 5.5 to 6), which was thought to be suspicious for a neoplasm. The PET–CT scan also showed hypodense nodules in the lower pole of the left lobe of the thyroid gland and in the left lobe of the liver and scattered lymph nodes (<1 cm in diameter) in the mediastinum, with no 18F-FDG uptake. Cytologic examination of a specimen from a CT-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the scapular lesion showed blood and scattered inflammatory cells and was thought to be nondi-agnostic. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the left shoulder and right femur, obtained at another facility after the administration of gadolinium, showed a lesion (23 mm by 14 mm) in the left scapular spine, which was isointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images, with heterogeneous enhancement and extension through the ventral cortex of the scapula and a periosteal reaction, soft-tissue component, and an intact posterior cortex. A sharply defined, gadolinium-enhancing lytic lesion within the cortex of the right distal femoral shaft showed a mild periosteal reaction and some associated cortical thickening. The patient was referred to the orthopedic clinic of this hospital. The patient reported that the pain was located primarily in the region of the left scapular spine, occurred at rest, and awoke him at night. He described it as a constant aching and throbbing and gave it a score of 5 (on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is the most severe pain). The pain lessened with rest and narcotic analgesia and increased when the patient lay on his side, raised his arms overhead, lifted objects, and moved his neck. He had no fever, chills, change in appetite or weight, or leg pain. He was right-handed, had a history of bipolar disorder, and had had an appendectomy in the past. He had no known allergies to medications. Medications included oxy-codone as needed for pain, lamotrigine, lithium, and pantoprazole. He was divorced and worked in an office. He had smoked one to two packs of cigarettes per day for the past 3 years but more than two packs per day during the past several months. He did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. His father had died at 68 years of age from metastatic colon cancer, his mother was 83 years of age and had Paget’s disease, and a brother had diabetes mellitus. On examination, the height was 175 cm and the weight 90.7 kg. The vital signs were normal. The patient was in mild distress because of pain in the left shoulder and posterior scapular area during active and passive motion; the range of motion was restricted when his arm was above the horizontal position. The spine of the left scapula was tender to palpation; sensation, strength, and pulses in both arms and legs and motion of the right shoulder and arm were normal. The white-cell count was 13,000 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), with a normal differential count, and the level of C-reactive protein was 11.7 mg per liter (reference range, <8). Results were normal for measurements of platelets, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, glucose, plasma electrolytes, calcium, total protein, albumin, globulin, bilirubin, lactate dehydroge-nase, immunoglobulins, and urine Bence Jones protein; studies of serum protein electrophoresis and tests of renal and liver function were also normal. Two days later, a CT-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the right femur was performed at this hospital; pathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed inflammatory cells, striated muscle, debris, and a few epithelioid histio-cytes and was thought to be nondiagnostic. Six days later, the patient was admitted to this hospital. The white-cell count was 15,800 per cubic millimeter, with a normal differential count, and the level of C-reactive protein was 19 mg per liter; the remainder of the complete blood count was normal, as were serum levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), and vitamin D. A chest radio-graph revealed low lung volumes. An open exci-sional biopsy and curettage of the lesion of the left scapular spine were performed; cefazolin was administered before and after the surgery. Pathological examination showed necrotizing granu-lomas and acute inflammation, features thought to be consistent with granulomatous osteomyeli-tis. Gram’s staining of a smear showed few mononuclear cells, very few polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and no organisms; specimens were cultured for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi and remained sterile. The next day, an infectious-disease consultant obtained additional history. The patient reported having severe fatigue, sweats, myalgias, and anxiety for several weeks. A skin test for tuberculosis had been negative within the past year, and testing for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was reportedly negative 1 year earlier. The patient had traveled to Eastern Europe and South America during the previous 16 years but had not been to rural areas or been exposed to animals recently. He reported no high-risk sexual activity, occupational exposures, or travel to the Midwest or southwestern United States. Tests for Coxiella burnetii, Treponema pallidum, Bartonella henselae, Bartonella quintana, and Burkhold-eria pseudomallei, and urinary histoplasma antigen were negative. He was discharged later that day. Five days later, at a follow-up visit, the patient reported increased scapular pain. A radiograph of the left scapula showed a lytic lesion of the left scapular spine, with associated fracture. Tests of pulmonary function showed reduced single-breath carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (21.38 ml per minute per millimeter of mercury, or 68% of the predicted value) and decreased residual volume (0.94 liters, or 47% of the predicted value). During the next 3 days, increasing fatigue, malaise, weakness, sweats, myalgias, and scapular pain developed. He was readmitted to this hospital. The vital signs were normal. There was mild ery-thema surrounding the surgical incision on the left scapula, which was clean and dry, with its sutures in place; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. An electrocardiogram was normal. Tests for brucella species and crypto-coccus were negative. The white-cell count was 15,000 per cubic millimeter, with a normal differential count. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed multiple nodules (2 to 4 mm in diameter) and cystic lucencies throughout both lungs, lymph nodes in both axillae (up to 1.2 cm in diameter) and the abdomen (up to 1.7 cm in diameter), and a thyroid nodule (1.2 cm). Airborne precautions were instituted. Specimens of blood and sputum were cultured for bacteria, myco-bacteria, and fungi and remained sterile. Vanco-mycin and doxycycline were begun. Tests for respiratory viruses and antibodies to HIV were negative, as were multiple specimens of sputum stained for acid-fast bacilli; airborne precautions were stopped on the third day. Vancomycin was discontinued, and ceftriaxone and gentamicin were begun. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2013,06,nejm-case-2013-06,A 54-Year-Old Man with Recurrent Diarrhea,"Dr. Michael T. Forrester (Medicine): A 54-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of diarrhea, vomiting, and weight loss. The patient was well until approximately 2.5 years before admission, when abdominal cramping and nonbloody diarrhea developed 1 day after he flew from the Northeast to Colorado for a skiing trip; the symptoms persisted for the duration of his 4-day vacation. Four days after returning home, he went to the emergency department of another hospital because of persistent symptoms, where he was told he had a stomach virus. The next day, he saw his primary care provider, and ciprofloxacin was administered, without benefit. One month later, he saw a gas-troenterologist. Routine laboratory studies were normal. A stool specimen showed many leukocytes and no ova or parasites; a stool assay for Clostridium difficile and a stool culture were negative. A course of metronidazole was administered for 10 days, and the symptoms nearly resolved. Two years before this admission, esophagogastroduodenoscopy reportedly revealed an inlet patch (i.e., an area of ectopic gastric mucosa) involving the circumference of the cervical esophagus and extending at least 4 cm in length, multiple erosions of the gastric antrum, antral gastritis, superficial ulcerations in the duodenum, and a prominent mucosal fold in the gastric side of the gastroesophageal junction. A colonoscopy showed several small polyps. Pathological examination of the biopsy specimens of the proximal portion of the esophagus reportedly showed squamous mucosa and gastric-type mucosa, with intestinal metaplasia that was thought to be consistent with Barrett’s esophagus. Pathological examination of a biopsy specimen of a polyp in the transverse colon revealed adenomatous changes and low-grade dysplasia; a hyperplastic rectal polyp and normal fragments of duodenal mucosa were also seen. Testing for Helicobacter pylori and giardia was negative. Proton-pump inhibitors were prescribed. Nine months later, 1 day after another flight to Colorado, the patient again awoke with abdominal cramps and watery diarrhea (up to one episode per hour); 3 days later, nausea and vomiting developed. Examination of a stool specimen at that time revealed Blastocystis hominis, and the symptoms again resolved after treatment with metronidazole. Four months before admission, the patient traveled to the Middle East. While traveling, he stayed in hotels and drank only bottled water. The day after arrival, abdominal cramping developed, with watery, nonbloody diarrhea occurring every 1 to 2 hours during the day and occasionally awakening him at night. His discomfort increased with eating. On the sixth day, nausea and nonbloody, nonbilious vomiting (two to three episodes daily) occurred, in association with increased diarrhea and without fevers or diaphore-sis. None of his 15 travel companions had symptoms. Twelve days later, the patient returned home. His symptoms persisted, and 3 weeks after their onset, he went to a second hospital for evaluation; intravenous fluids and metroni-dazole were administered, but the symptoms worsened. Examination of the stool for pathogens and screening for H. pylori were negative. During the next 3 months, anorexia developed, and the patient lost 15.9 kg. Approximately 2 weeks before admission, his physician prescribed trimethoprim– sulfamethoxazole, with partial improvement of diarrhea. Eight days before admission, the patient was seen in the infectious-disease clinic of this hospital. On examination, the blood pressure was 114/86 mm Hg and the pulse was 88 beats per minute; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. The platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, red-cell indexes, and serum levels of glucose, urea nitrogen, calcium, vitamin B12, C-reactive protein, cortisol, thyrotropin, amylase, and lipase were normal, as were the results of liver-function tests. Testing for IgA antibodies to gliadin, endomysial antigen, and tissue transglutaminase was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Stool specimens showed no enteric pathogens, ova, or parasites, and testing for C. difficile toxin was negative. During the ensuing week, the patient’s symptoms worsened and included diarrhea (occurring hourly throughout the day), constant nausea, vomiting within 3 minutes after oral intake, and weakness, with orthostatic lightheadedness. He came to the emergency department of this hospital. The patient reported no fever, chills, sweats, flushing, or headache. His only medication was omeprazole, 20 mg daily, which he took for symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux. He had no known allergies. He was of Ashkenazi (Eastern European) Jewish ancestry, worked in a service industry, and was monogamous with his girlfriend. He drank alcohol in moderation, had smoked as a young adult, and did not use illicit drugs. He had had no exposures to sick persons or animals and had no history of ingestion of unpasteurized milk products or raw meats. He had traveled annually to the Caribbean for 14 years, most recently 8 years before admission. His father was 82 years of age and had dementia, his mother was deceased and had a history of Parkinson’s disease and heart disease, and an uncle reportedly had stomach cancer. On examination, the blood pressure was 133/94 mm Hg and the pulse 120 beats per minute; the temperature, respirations, and oxygen saturation while the patient was breathing ambient air were normal, as was the remainder of the examination. The platelet count, activated partial-thromboplastin time, and serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and prealbumin were normal, as were the results of liver-function tests; other test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram was normal. Normal saline was infused. The patient was admitted to this hospital. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis after the oral and intravenous administration of contrast material showed thickening and enhancement of the proximal small-bowel walls, mild dilatation in the small bowel, a large amount of fluid in the small bowel and colon with air–fluid levels, an enlarged retroperitoneal node (1.3 cm in the short axis), calcific atherosclerosis of the aorta, and a ground-glass nodule (0.7 cm in diameter) in the lower lobe of the right lung. Omeprazole, prochlorperazine, and ondansetron hydrochloride were administered, and additional crystalloid solution was infused intravenously. Urinalysis revealed 1+ ketones and albumin and was otherwise normal. During the next 2 days, levels of erythropoietin and folate were found to be normal, and testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Stool studies were again unrevealing. On the fourth day, the level of potassium in the stool was 21.7 mmol per liter (serum level, 3.4 mmol per liter) and stool fat was 37% (reference range, 0 to 19). Esophagogastroduodenos-copy revealed erosive or exudative circumferential lesions (grade III esophagitis, according to the modified Savary–Miller classification, which ","{'Acute diarrheal illness': [], 'Evaluation of the patient with chronic diarrhea': [], 'Chronic watery diarrhea': [], 'Peptide-Secreting Tumors': []}",Sporadic (non–multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1) Zollinger–Ellison syndrome (gastrinoma). ,,Sporadic (non–multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1) Zollinger–Ellison syndrome (gastrinoma). ,0
NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,20,nejm-case-2012-20,"A 77-Year-Old Man with Leg Edema, Hematuria, and Acute Renal Failure","Dr. Jonathan Reisman (Internal Medicine): A 77-year-old man was transferred to this hospital because of leg edema, hematuria, and acute renal failure. The patient had a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and an aortic aneurysm. He had been in his usual health until approximately 1 month before admission, when bilateral lower-leg edema developed, followed by a red rash on the feet. He saw his physician, who noted worsening hypertension; the patient’s antihyper-tensive medications were changed, including discontinuation of amlodipine, a short trial of atenolol (which caused increased shortness of breath and wheezing), and initiation of diltiazem, without improvement in blood-pressure control and peripheral edema. Twenty days before admission, he saw his cardiologist and reported leg swelling and dyspnea. On examination, the blood pressure was 156/90 mm Hg and the pulse 70 beats per minute (irregularly irregular rhythm), with 3+ lower-leg edema. Diltiazem was stopped, and chlorthalidone begun. At a follow-up visit 5 days later, the patient reported slight improvement in dyspnea, his weight had decreased 3.6 kg, and the blood pressure was 146/80 mm Hg. The blood urea nitrogen level was 34 mg per deciliter (12.1 mmol per liter) (reference range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter [2.9 to 8.9 mmol per liter]), and the creatinine, which reportedly had been 1.4 mg per deciliter (123.8 μmol per liter) the previous year, was 2.7 mg per deciliter (238.7 μmol per liter) (reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53.0 to 132.6 μmol per liter]). Chlorthalidone and lisinopril were stopped, and follow-up was scheduled. Medications also included aspirin (81 mg), terazosin, and a combination of oxycodone and acetaminophen. During the next week, subjective fevers and shaking chills developed; chest tightness occurred occasionally, but dyspnea on exertion lessened. Six days before this admission, two episodes of vomiting, with nonbilious emesis, and one episode of hemoptysis occurred. The urine appeared dark red. The next day, the patient went to the emergency department at another hospital. On examination, the height was 170 cm, the weight 72.1 kg, the blood pressure 141/85 mm Hg, the pulse 80 beats per minute and irregular, the temperature 36.7°C, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. There were fine crackles at the base of the left lung and a papular rash on the legs, without pretibial edema; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of total protein, phosphorus, magnesium, total bilirubin, creatine kinase, amylase, lipase, uric acid, IgA, IgG, and complement (C3 and C4) were normal, as were tests of coagulation and liver function. Testing was negative for antibodies to glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and for antineutro-phil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), including those with a cytoplasmic pattern of staining (c-ANCA, antibodies to serine proteinase 3) and those with a perinuclear pattern of staining (p-ANCA, antibodies to myeloperoxidase); other test results are shown in Table 1. Specimens of urine and blood were cultured, and intravenous fluids and ceftriaxone were administered. The patient was admitted to the other hospital. Renal ultrasonography reportedly showed an abdominal aortic aneurysm of 8 cm. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, without the administration of contrast material, reportedly showed a circumferential fusiform aneurysm (8.3 cm) of the infrarenal abdominal aorta and another aneurysm (2 cm) in the right iliac artery. Terazosin, Lactobacillus acidophilus, heparin, clonidine, omeprazole, ferrous sulfate, nife-dipine, and a polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine were administered. The blood level of creatinine rose daily. On the third day, testing for antinuclear antibodies was negative, and no monoclonal immunoglobulin was detected; other test results are shown in Table 1. On the second, third, and fourth hospital days, methylprednisolone (500 mg daily) was administered. On the third day, insulin was added. A unit of leukocyte-poor packed red cells was transfused. On the fifth hospital day, blood cultures drawn on admission remained sterile. A renal biopsy was performed. The next afternoon, pathological examination of the biopsy tissue revealed mild proliferative glo-merulonephritis with crescents, segmental nodular glomerulosclerosis, diffuse linear immuno-fluorescence reactivity for IgG along the GBM, and signs of active and healed mesangiolysis, moderate tubular atrophy, and widespread endothelial-cell injury. The patient was transferred to this hospital. The patient had a history of intermittent he-moptysis during the previous 5 years and reported no recent headache, changes in vision, malaise, fatigue, chest or abdominal pain, or diarrhea. He had hypertension, atrial fibrillation (for which he had declined anticoagulation therapy), hepatic and renal cysts, benign prostatic hypertrophy, and an aneurysm (4.3 cm by 4.4 cm) of the ascending thoracic aorta as revealed by CT imaging 2 years earlier. He had had orthopedic surgery, an appendectomy, and a deep venous thrombosis that was treated with heparin. He was married, had children, and was retired from the construction industry. He was a current cigarette smoker (55 pack-years), drank alcohol occasionally, and did not use illicit drugs. His father died at 58 years of age of myocardial infarction, his mother died at 67 years of age of breast cancer, a daughter had breast cancer, and two children had diabetes mellitus. On examination, the blood pressure was 135/85 mm Hg and the pulse 85 beats per minute and irregular; the temperature, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were normal. He had faint crackles in both lungs, 3+ pitting edema to the knees, and a nonpalpable, pink, blanching mac-ular rash on both medial malleoli; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of protein, albumin, globulin, phosphorus, and magnesium were normal, as were tests of coagulation and liver function; other test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph showed focal, patchy opacification in the right lower lobe. Diagnostic test results were received, and management decisions were made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2011,30,nejm-case-2011-30,A 62-Year-Old Woman with Renal Failure,"Dr. Kyle Staller (Medicine): A 62-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of renal failure. The patient had an autoimmune overlap syndrome with polymyositis, treated with prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil, but had been in her usual health until 6 weeks before admission, when she noted increasing skin tightness around her mouth, dry mouth, difficulty swallowing, worsening gastroesophageal reflux, hair loss, and discoloration of her fingers, which were ash-colored, painful, and cool. Prednisone was increased from 10 to 20 mg daily, without improvement. Four days before admission, the patient was found on the floor of her bathroom, confused and minimally conversant, and was taken to another hospital. The day before admission to the other hospital, the patient had reported some weakness and no other symptoms. On examination, the temperature was 35.9°C, the blood pressure 175/99 mm Hg, the pulse 84 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 17 breaths per minute. The patient was awake, with slow responses, and oriented to person only. The skin around the mouth and on the fingers was tight, and there was muscle wasting of the neck. On neurologic examination, she followed simple commands inconsistently, with psychomotor slowing, a decreased ability to name objects, and an inability to read or to repeat words spoken to her. Her face was symmetric, with possible mild weakness on the right side. Muscle strength was 4 out of 5 or better (with 5 indicating normal strength), with mild asterixis bilaterally. Levels of vitamin B12, folate, and glycated hemoglobin were normal, as were tests of coagulation and thyroid function; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed yellow, cloudy urine with a pH of 5.5 and a specific gravity of 1.016; a screening dipstick test showed a large amount of blood, 15 mg of ketones per deciliter, 300 mg of protein per deciliter, and 0.2 mg of urobilinogen per deciliter. Microscopical examination of the urine revealed 1 to 2 hyaline casts per low-power field, as well as 37 white cells and no red cells per high-power field. A chest radiograph reportedly showed basilar consolidation in the right lung, a small pleural effusion on the right side, and increased interstitial markings bilaterally, which were thought to be chronic. Computed tomography (CT) of the head without the administration of contrast material revealed hyperdensities adjacent to the frontal horn of the left lateral ventricle in the vicinity of the caudate head and in the left basal ganglia, findings that were thought to be consistent with a small hemorrhagic infarct. The CT scan also showed prominent ventricles and sulci. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit; intravenous fluids, furosemide, chlorothia-zide, methylprednisolone, nicardipine drip, cef-triaxone, atenolol, nitroglycerin paste, mycophe-nolatemofetil,andfamotidinewereadministered. The next morning, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed high T2-weighted signal intensity in a lesion in the left basal ganglia and in a lesion in the left thalamus (suggestive of an acute infarction in the basal ganglia and a subacute infarction in the left thalamus), a diffusion abnormality in the left caudate head with high signal intensity on sagittal T1-weighted images, brain atrophy, and small-vessel ischemic changes; there was no mass effect or midline shift. Renal ultrasonography revealed kidneys (9.1 cm and 9.8 cm in the longest axis) with increased echogenicity and no nephrolithiasis or hydronephrosis. Echocardiography revealed left ventricular hypertrophy, with an ejection fraction of 63%. Serum levels of complement (C3 and C4) and antibodies to double-stranded DNA and glomerular basement membrane were normal. Other test results are shown in Table 1. An electroencephalogram showed abnormalities consistent with toxic metabolic encephalopathy. A urine culture was sterile. On the fourth day, the patient was transferred to this hospital. A diagnosis of autoimmune overlap syndrome had been made 17 months earlier, after an 18-month progressive illness, including increasing limb weakness and head drop. Approximately 2.5 years before admission, pathological examination of a bone marrow–biopsy specimen reportedly showed slightly hypocellular bone marrow with relative erythroid hyperplasia and a mild increase in the number of mononuclear cells with plasmacytoid features. Results of laboratory testing performed 26 months before admission are shown in Table 1. A diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) was made. Approximately 2 years before admission, the creatine kinase level, measured at another hospital, was reportedly 3800 U per liter; electromyography revealed findings suggestive of myopathy. Twenty months before admission, pathological examination of a biopsy specimen of the sternocleidomastoid muscle showed marked variation in fiber size, with hypertrophic and round atrophic fibers, marked endomysial fibrosis, phagocytosis, and a small focus of inflammation surrounding individual muscle cells. Results of testing for dystrophin and other sarco-lemmal proteins were normal, as was the result of electron microscopy. The administration of prednisone (60 mg per day) was begun, with partial improvement in strength. Tests for other autoimmune antibodies were negative; levels of free kappa light chains were low, and levels of lambda light chains, angiotensin-converting enzyme, nonmaternal alpha-fetoprotein, CA 19-9, CA-125, C-reactive protein, carcinoembryonic antigen, and β2-microglobulin were normal. Pred-nisone was gradually tapered to 10 mg daily. Approximately 11 months before admission, urine collection revealed 102 mg of protein per 24 hours (170 mg per liter); no Bence Jones protein was detected in a urine specimen concentrated 50 times. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Seven months before admission, while the patient was taking prednisone (10 mg), she had persistent, severe weakness and atrophy in the neck muscles with head drop. The patient’s muscle strength was rated 2 to 3− on the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale, which ranges from 0 (paralysis) to 5 (normal strength). She also had moderately severe weakness in the muscles of the shoulder girdle and pelvic girdle (MRC score, 3+ to 4−), with well-preserved distal muscles, tendon reflexes, and sensation. Ambulation and balance were normal. A follow-up electromyo-gram (EMG) continued to show an active myopa-thy. Five months before admission, the administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1000 mg twice weekly) was begun; strength in the neck muscles improved, but limb weakness continued and fatigue worsened. Two weeks before admission, the patient fell at home, injuring her back, and thereafter took naproxen daily for pain. The patient’s medical history included hypertension, osteoporosis, depression, and multinod-ular nontoxic goiter. A thyroid-biopsy specimen showed no abnormalities. She was allergic to azithromycin and cephalexin. She was single, lived alone, and was a retired office worker. She drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. Her mother had had breast cancer and Alzheimer’s disease and died at 81 years of age, her father died of myocardial infarction at the age of 65 years, a sister died of systemic lupus erythematosus at the age of 27 years, and two other siblings were healthy. On examination, the patient was alert and conversant and afebrile. The blood pressure was 173/76 mm Hg, the pulse 75 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while she was breathing ambient air. There was marked thickening and puckering of the skin around the mouth, and the oral mucosa was dry. The neck was supple and showed evidence of muscle wasting; the jugular venous pressure was normal. There were fine crackles at the lung bases bilaterally. Telangiec-tasias were evident over the patient’s face and upper chest. On neurologic examination, she was slow to respond to questions but eventually provided clear, cogent answers. Motor strength in the hip flexors was less than 3 out of 5, bilaterally; she was unable to lift her legs off the bed. The results of the remainder of the lower-extremity motor and sensory examination and the general examination were normal. Levels of total and direct bilirubin, globulin, magnesium, and haptoglobin were normal, as were tests of coagulation; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed cloudy, yellow urine with a specific gravity of 1.008 and a pH of 6.0, with 3+ occult blood, 2+ albumin, 0 to 2 red cells and white cells per high-power field, and very few transitional cells. An electrocardiogram was normal. A chest radiograph showed bilateral pleural effusions and basilar atelectasis, with no evidence of pulmonary edema. CT of the head without contrast material was unchanged. Normal saline and furosemide were administered intravenously; urine output was approximately 30 ml overnight. On the second day, levels of C3 and C4 were normal and tests for anticardiolipin antibodies, antineuronal nuclear antibodies, and antibodies to Ro, La, and Scl-70 were negative, as was a test for lupus anticoagulant; additional results are shown in Table 1, and other results were pending. A 24-hour urine collection and electrophoresis revealed 1160 mg of protein per liter (reference range, 0 to 135), moderate albumin and alpha, beta and probably intact immunoglobulin, and a low level of IgG lambda M component in the same region as the serum IgG lambda M component; no Bence Jones protein was detected in urine that was concentrated 50 times. The administration of ceftriaxone and atenolol was stopped, and captopril was begun. Prednisone (20 mg daily) and mycophenolate mofetil were continued. Oliguria persisted. On the third day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,07,nejm-case-2019-07,A 73-Year-Old Woman with Swelling of the Right Groin and Fever,"Dr. Alexandria K. Maurer (Medicine): A 73-year-old woman with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was admitted to this hospital because of right inguinal lymphadenopathy, fever, and drenching night sweats. The patient had been in her usual state of health and had been undergoing active medical surveillance for CLL until 2 weeks before this presentation, when swelling of the right groin developed. During the next 2 weeks, the swollen area increased in size. Drenching night sweats and daily fevers developed; temperatures taken at home were as high as 38.3°C. The patient called her hematologist’s office and was asked to present to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. The patient had received a diagnosis of CLL 27 years earlier. At that time, lympho-cytosis developed and an evaluation revealed pelvic lymphadenopathy. The patient underwent resection of the left ovary and a nearby retroperitoneal mass. On pathological evaluation, the ovarian tissue was normal, but findings in the nodal tissue were consistent with CLL. During the next 12 years, the patient had slowly progressive lymphocytosis and stable splenomegaly, and she underwent active surveillance with periodic complete blood counts and physical examinations. Fifteen years before this presentation, fatigue and anemia developed and a 3-month course of chlorambucil was administered, with improvement in lymphocy-tosis and anemia. During the next 3 years, the patient received three additional courses of chlorambucil for symptomatic anemia, each of which was followed by a period of remission. Nine years before this presentation, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and splenomegaly developed and fludarabine and rituximab were administered, with improvement in blood counts and splenomegaly. Three years before this presentation, during post-treatment surveillance, fatigue, worsening anemia, and spleno-megaly developed and idelalisib and rituximab were administered, with improvement in symptoms. After 1 year, all treatment was stopped because of a diffuse rash that was attributed to idelalisib. Two months before this presentation, the patient had a white-cell count of 19,000 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000). In addition, several years before this presentation, hypogammaglobulinemia developed in association with rituximab treatment and was complicated by recurrent sinopulmonary infections, and intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) treatment was initiated. In the past, the patient had undergone resection of squamous-cell carcinoma from the right leg and of multiple basal-cell carcinomas. Other history included recurrent herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 infection of the genitals (for which she received acyclovir as needed), diverticulosis, a burst fracture of the first lumbar vertebra after a fall, and shingles due to herpes zoster infection of the right L2 dermatome. Four years before this presentation, she was treated empirically for Borrelia burgdorferi infection. The patient had no known drug allergies. Her medications included subcutaneous IVIG every other week, a multivitamin, calcium carbonate, vitamin C, lysine, and acyclovir as needed. She had smoked tobacco for 10 years but had quit 40 years before this presentation. She drank alcohol occasionally and did not use illicit drugs. Her husband had died 1 year before this presentation, and she was not sexually active. She was a retired librarian, lived in Massachusetts, and had not traveled outside the United States. She had no pets or exposures to cats. She enjoyed gardening and took daily walks outside. Her family history included heart disease in her mother and skin cancer in her father. In the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing daily fevers and night sweats, as well as an unspecified amount of weight loss over the past month. She reported no headaches, sore throat, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, vaginal discharge, or rash. On physical examination, the temperature was 37.4°C, the pulse 84 beats per minute, the blood pressure 140/63 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 92% while she was breathing ambient air. The weight was 61 kg, the height 158 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 24.7. The patient did not appear ill. The abdomen was nondistended, with normal bowel sounds and no tenderness on palpation. The spleen was palpable. Multiple right inguinal lymph nodes were enlarged, measuring 2 to 5 cm in maximal diameter; the nodes were hard, nonmobile, and mildly tender, and there were no overlying skin changes. Multiple left inguinal lymph nodes measured 1 to 2 cm in maximal diameter. There was no lymphadenopathy in the occipital, posterior auricular, anterior cervical, posterior cervical, axillary, epitrochlear, or supraclavicular region. There were no rashes or skin lesions. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, uric acid, lactic acid, and haptoglobin were normal, as were results of renal-function tests and the prothrom-bin time. Urinalysis revealed clear yellow urine, with a specific gravity of 1.024 (reference range, 1.001 to 1.035) and a pH of 5.0 (reference range, 5.0 to 9.0) and with no blood, ketones, glucose, protein, nitrates, or urobilinogen. Blood cultures had no growth. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. Dr. Shahein H. Tajmir: Chest radiography revealed no consolidation or evidence of pulmonary edema. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes with dystrophic calcification, as well as a nodule measuring 1 cm in diameter in the peripheral lung, abutting the pleura. There was evidence of diverticulosis, an unchanged compression fracture of the first lumbar vertebra, and stable enlargement of the spleen (measuring 24 cm in length; reference range, ≤12 cm), with internal heterogeneous attenuation and scattered areas of splenic parenchymal calcification. There were multiple enlarged right inguinal lymph nodes with internal heterogeneity; the largest (dominant) lymph node measured 5 cm in diameter and had surrounding fat stranding. Right external iliac and pelvic sidewall lymph nodes measured up to 4 cm in diameter, and left pelvic sidewall lymph nodes were also enlarged. Assessment of the area from the neck to the proximal thigh with the use of 18F-fluorodeoxy-glucose (FDG)–positron-emission tomography and CT (PET-CT) revealed intense FDG uptake in the right inguinal lymph nodes, approximately three times the uptake in the liver (Fig. 1). The dominant node had central photopenia suggestive of necrosis. Right external iliac and pelvic sidewall lymph nodes had moderate FDG uptake, greater than the uptake in the liver. In the chest, a high right paratracheal lymph node had moderate FDG uptake, slightly greater than the uptake in the liver, and a subpleural nodule in the left upper lobe had mild FDG uptake. The level of FDG uptake in the spleen was lower than the level in the liver, with no focal uptake abnormality. Dr. Maurer: On the second hospital day, fine-needle aspiration and core biopsy of the dominant right inguinal lymph node were performed. Dr. Lucas R. Massoth: Examination of the core biopsy specimen revealed a dense monomorphic infiltrate of small mature lymphocytes with scant cytoplasm (Fig. 2A). Some areas of the tumor were necrotic, but there was no evidence of large-cell transformation (Fig. 2B). Flow cytome-try and immunohistochemical staining revealed monoclonal B cells that had an immunopheno-type characteristic of CLL (Fig. 2C and 2D). Dr. Maurer: Additional diagnostic tests were performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2009,11,nejm-case-2009-11,"A 47-Year-Old Man with Fever, Headache, Rash, and Vomiting","Dr. Mary Berlik Rice (Medicine): A 47-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of fever, headache, rash, and vomiting. The patient had been well until 8 days earlier, when severe pleuritic chest pain developed, worse on the right side than on the left, and a maculopapular rash appeared on his torso, which by the next day involved the scalp and the arms and legs, sparing the palms and soles. He also had temperatures of up to 39.1°C, chills, diaphoresis, a throbbing frontal headache that radiated to the vertex, a sore throat, swollen cervical lymph nodes, a cough productive of thick yellow sputum, and diffuse myalgias and arthralgias without joint swelling or erythema. Five days before admission, the patient went to the emergency department of another hospital for these symptoms. Measurements of serum electrolytes and glucose and tests of renal function were normal; results of other laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen revealed multiple small nodules (the largest was 17 mm in diameter) in both adrenal glands; imaging revealed characteristics of an adenoma but was otherwise normal. Acetaminophen was prescribed, and he was sent home. During the next 3 days, the symptoms did not improve, and the patient’s appetite decreased. Bleeding from the left nostril occurred twice, and he vomited once; his temperature rose to 38.9°C. Three days before admission, he was seen in the medical walk-in clinic of this hospital. On examination, he appeared uncomfortable. The temperature was 37.4°C, the blood pressure 112/75 mm Hg, and the pulse 93 beats per minute. Photophobia was present, with discomfort on upward gaze. The neck was supple. There were innumerable brown-gray macules on the trunk and face. The conjunctivae were slightly injected; the tonsils were diffusely red and enlarged, with a sparse white exudate. There was a tender, mobile, soft lymph node, approximately 4 cm in diameter, in the left submandibular area and smaller palpable anterior and posterior cervical and inguinal nodes bilaterally and in the right axilla. The chest was tender to palpation along the lateral ribs below the nipple line, more on the right side than on the left. The remainder of the examination was normal. The urine was positive for blood (4+) but was otherwise negative; results of other laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Specimens of blood, urine, and sputum were cultured. Ketorolac was administered intramuscularly, and the patient was sent home with instructions to take doses of ibuprofen alternating with acetaminophen for fever and to follow up in 3 days, or sooner if the symptoms worsened. Three days later, he came to the emergency department of this hospital because of persistent symptoms and increased nausea and vomiting. He reported photophobia, neck stiffness and pain, and some pressure on initiating urination. The pain in the chest and abdomen had resolved, and there was no diarrhea, shortness of breath, hema-turia, pyuria, or dysuria; there also were no palpitations or changes to vision or hearing. The lesions on the chest and back had faded. A culture of the sputum from 3 days earlier grew abundant Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis, and cultures of the blood and urine were sterile. Nucleic acid testing of a urine specimen was negative for N. gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. The patient had had syphilis at the age of 18 years, and he had lumbar disk disease with L5 disk herniation, for which he was receiving disability payments. Serologic tests for syphilis and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) had reportedly been negative 6 months earlier. He lived with a single male partner with whom he had been monogamous for the past 3 years. Four years earlier, his partner had received a diagnosis of HIV infection and did not take antiretro-viral medications, reportedly because of a low viral load and normal CD4 count. The patient and his partner did not use condoms and reportedly did not practice anal sex. He owned cats, had been exposed to paint chips 2 weeks earlier when he scraped a room in his home, and had not traveled recently. His partner was not ill. The patient’s illness occurred during the winter, and he had not been exposed to mosquitoes or ticks. He smoked cigarettes and marijuana and had done so for many years; he drank alcohol rarely, after years of heavy use in the past, and he did not use intravenous drugs. Family members had had coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and polysubstance abuse; a sibling had died from cirrhosis related to alcohol and infection with hepatitis C virus. Medications included oxycodone as needed for pain, diazepam, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen. He had no allergies to medications. On examination, the patient coughed frequently, the respirations were 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation was 98% while he was breathing ambient air. The temperature was 36.3°C; it rose to 38.3°C within 2 hours and was 39.2°C later in the day. Other vital signs were normal. There was bilateral posterior cervical lymphade-nopathy; the oropharynx was erythematous, with no exudate or tonsillar enlargement. Neck flex-ion caused discomfort; range of motion was full. There was abdominal guarding. An erythematous, blanching rash covered the chest and upper back, with no papules or nodules. The remainder of the examination was normal. Screening tests for influenza A and B antigens were negative. Measurements of serum electrolytes, total protein, and globulin and tests of liver and renal function were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram was normal. An ultrasonogram of the abdomen revealed a region of hypoattenuation within the pancreatic head that was thought to represent a peripancreatic lymph node. A radiograph of the chest showed a perihilar linear opacity suggestive of mild subsegmental atelectasis. CT of the brain revealed mucosal thickening of the maxillary sinus. A lumbar puncture was performed; results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis are shown in Table 2. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Van-comycin, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, narcotic analgesia, sumatriptan, and acetaminophen were administered. Additional diagnostic tests were performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,11,nejm-case-2019-11,A 49-Year-Old Man with HIV Infection and Chronic Kidney Disease,"Dr. Nikolaus Jilg (Medicine): A 49-year-old white man with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease was evaluated in the kidney transplantation clinic at this hospital because of declining kidney function. Twenty-seven years before the current presentation, the patient received a diagnosis of HIV infection after a screening test, performed at the time of a blood donation, was positive. He was referred to an infectious disease physician at another hospital, and approximately 3 years later, he began to take unspecified antiretroviral medications. The antiretroviral regimen was modified frequently, and after 4 years of treatment, it was stopped; the CD4+ T-cell count then decreased to 0 per cubic millimeter (normal range, 350 to 1460). During the next 9 years, multiple antiretroviral regimens were prescribed. Eleven years before the current presentation, HIV genotypic drug-resistance testing revealed multiple mutations in the reverse transcriptase and protease genes (Table 1). Tropism testing revealed that the virus was not susceptible to the CCR5 antagonist maraviroc. A regimen of darunavir coadministered with ritonavir and a fixed-dose formulation of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was begun, and the plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load decreased to less than 50 copies per milliliter. Eight years before the current presentation, the patient was seen in the infectious disease clinic at this hospital to establish care after he had moved to the area. He reported good adherence to his prescribed antiretroviral regimen. He also reported that he had received a diagnosis of HCV infection several years earlier, after a positive routine screening test, and had been treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin for 24 weeks, without a sustained virologic response. On physical examination, the pulse was 88 beats per minute, the blood pressure 134/100 mm Hg, and the weight 89.4 kg. There was symmetric enlargement of the parotid glands and mild centripetal obesity. The HIV RNA viral load was less than 50 copies per milliliter, and the CD4+ T-cell count was 949 per cubic millimeter. Urinalysis revealed 3+ glucose, 3+ albumin, and trace blood by dipstick testing; in a spot urine sample, the ratio of microalbumin (in milligrams) to creatinine (in grams) was 5110 (reference range, <30). Urine nucleic acid tests for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were negative, as was a tuberculin skin test. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 2. The current antiretroviral regimen was continued, and the patient was seen regularly for follow-up in the infectious disease clinic and in multiple other clinics at this hospital for management of his medical conditions. Seven years before the current presentation, the patient was again treated for HCV infection with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, this time for 48 weeks, and had a sustained virologic response. After completion of this treatment, the alanine aminotransferase level was 179 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 55), the aspartate aminotransferase level was 67 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 40), and on serial measurements, the triglyceride level ranged from 746 to 2072 mg per deciliter (8.42 to 23.39 mmol per liter; reference range, 40 to 150 mg per deciliter [0.45 to 1.69 mmol per liter]). After comprehensive evaluation by a hepatologist, which included a liver biopsy, the patient received a diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Five years before the current presentation, raltegravir was added to the antiretroviral regimen. On serial measurements, the HIV RNA and HCV RNA viral loads were undetectable. Three years before the current presentation, laboratory tests revealed a serum creatinine level of 1.97 mg per deciliter (174 μmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 μmol per liter]) and an estimated glomeru-lar filtration rate of 37 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area (reference range, >60); in a spot urine sample, the microalbumin-to-creatinine ratio was 8808. The patient was referred to the nephrology clinic at this hospital. A kidney biopsy was performed, and lisinopril was prescribed. Dr. Ivy A. Rosales: Examination of a core needle– biopsy specimen of the kidney revealed 16 glom-eruli, of which 3 were globally sclerosed. Five glomeruli showed segmental sclerosis that was characterized by an increase in mesangial matrix, obliteration of the capillary lumina, and adhesions to Bowman’s capsule (Fig. 1A). Occasional perihilar adhesions were present, without evidence of collapse or hypercellularity.1,2 The nonsclerotic portions of the intact glomeruli did not show endocapillary or mesangial hypercellularity (Fig. 1B). The glomerular capillary walls were normal. There was focal tubular injury, with flattened epithelium, loss of brush borders, and occasional protein casts. Approximately 10% of the cortex showed interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy; the fibrotic areas showed interstitial inflammation that was composed of mononuclear cells. The arteries were normal; a few arterioles showed hyalinosis, but other arterioles were normal. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed both broad and segmental staining for IgM and C3 along glomerular capillary walls, a finding that is considered to be nonspecific but is often seen in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). There was no staining of the tubular basement membranes or vessels. There was no evidence of immune deposition of IgG, IgA, C1q, fibrin, kappa, or lambda. Electron microscopy revealed segmental podocyte foot-process effacement involving up to 50% of the glomerular capillary surface (Fig. 1C). Tubuloreticular inclusions were not identified. The glomerular basement membranes were thickened (harmonic mean [±SD] thickness, 665±201 nm; normal value in men, 373±42),3 a feature characteristic of early diabetic nephropathy. A few abnormal mitochondria were present in some tubular epithelial cells (Fig. 1D), a feature associated with antiviral (tenofovir) toxicity.4,5 Taken together, the biopsy findings are most consistent with FSGS not otherwise specified1,2 and mild tenofovir toxicity. FSGS not otherwise specified has been reported in 24% of patients with HIV and HCV coinfection who have been treated with effective combination antiretroviral therapy; the incidence of immune-mediated glomerulonephritis is lower among these patients than among patients who had HIV and HCV coinfection during the era before such therapy became available.6 FSGS has also been reported in patients who have undergone interferon treatment for HCV or other diseases.7 Although diabetes may account for FSGS, the diabetic glomerular changes seen on biopsy in this patient were mild, whereas the global and segmental types of glomerulosclero-sis are typically seen in patients with advanced diabetic nephropathy. Dr. Jilg: On follow-up in the infectious disease clinic 29 months before the current presentation, the administration of the fixed-dose formulation of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was changed from once per day to every other day. Testing for HLA-B*5701 was negative. Three months later, the antiretroviral regimen was changed to lamivudine, darunavir coadminis-tered with ritonavir, and dolutegravir. Subsequently, on serial measurements, the HIV RNA viral load remained undetectable. During the next 26 months, kidney function declined, with the estimated glomerular filtration rate decreasing to 19 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 . The patient was referred to the kidney transplantation clinic at this hospital to discuss options for renal-replacement therapy. In the kidney transplantation clinic, the patient reported that he was interested in pursuing options for living-donor and deceased-donor transplantation and that he was willing to accept an organ from an increased-risk donor (i.e., a donor with one or more exposures that would confer an increased risk of transmitting recent HIV, HCV, or hepatitis B virus infection to a recipient). In addition to HIV and HCV infections and chronic kidney disease, the patient had insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, combined hyperlipidemia, nephrolithiasis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, mild hearing loss, gastroesopha-geal reflux disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, peripheral neuropathy, depression, and anxiety. He had undergone an appendectomy during childhood, and he had a history of anal dyspla-sia and anal herpes simplex virus infection; he had had a prolonged hospitalization in the intensive care unit 9 years earlier because of legion-ella pneumonia, as well as recent hospitalizations because of influenza and shigellosis. Medications included lamivudine, darunavir, ritonavir, dolutegravir, lisinopril, sodium bicarbonate, patiromer, cholecalciferol, ascorbic acid, a multivitamin, insulin, atenolol, amlodipine, aspirin, gemfibrozil, pitavastatin, fish oil, inhaled beclomethasone, inhaled albuterol, fexofenadine, omeprazole, finasteride, oxybutynin, gabapentin, venlafaxine, mirtazapine, and dextroamphet-amine–amphetamine. Tamsulosin had caused hives, enfuvirtide had caused injection-site reactions, pravastatin had caused myalgias, and feno-fibrate had been associated with an increase in the serum creatinine level. The patient lived with his husband, a nephew, and pets (dogs, cats, and fish) in an urban area of New England; he had previously lived in the ",{},,End-stage renal disease in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus infection. ,End-stage renal disease in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus infection. ,0
NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2011,26,nejm-case-2011-26,A 7-Year-Old Boy with a Complex Cyst in the Kidney,"A 7-year-old boy was seen in an outpatient clinic at this hospital because of a complex cyst in the kidney. The patient was born by vaginal delivery after an uncomplicated 38-week gestation. His birth weight was 3.04 kg. A diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) was made at age 4 months, when he was admitted to this hospital with respiratory distress due to bronchiolitis associated with short episodes of apnea and cyanosis. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a shortened PR interval. Transthoracic echocar-diography revealed multiple intracardiac masses involving the right ventricle, right atrium, septum, and possibly the left ventricle, features consistent with rhabdomyo-mas. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed multiple subependy-mal nodules along the lateral ventricular margins, innumerable cortical tubers, and multiple linear areas of increased T1-weighted signal and decreased T2-weighted signal within the white matter, findings that are typical of tuberous sclerosis. A renal ultrasound examination revealed enlarged kidneys (right kidney, 7.5 cm in length; left kidney, 9.3 cm) with multiple large bilateral cysts (up to 4 cm in diameter) and no evidence of a solid mass. An electroencephalogram showed attenuation of the background amplitude and slowing in the left hemisphere as compared with the right, and focal spikes in the right temporal region at T4 during drowsiness and sleep. Examination with a Wood’s lamp revealed 12 small hypopigmented cutaneous macules; an ophthalmologic examination was normal. Discussion with the parents revealed that the patient’s father had received a diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis during adolescence, manifested by renal cysts, hy-popigmented macules, and a facial angiofibroma; he reportedly had no abnormalities on brain-imaging studies but had learning disabilities. The patient had three older maternal half siblings, none of whom had the disease. The infant was discharged on the fourth hospital day, after initiation of treatment with oral amoxicil-lin and nebulized albuterol. When the patient was 6 months of age, seizure activity developed and was treated with divalproex sodium. At 12 months of age, infantile spasms began, which were treated with vigabatrin. At 13 months of age, hypertension developed and was treated first with nifedipine and later with amlodipine. Repeat renal ultrasonography revealed enlarging, multicystic kidneys (right kidney, 14.8 cm in length; left kidney, 15.7 cm). During the next 5 years, the patient returned to the TSC clinic at this hospital regularly. He had neurodevelopmental delay and behavioral problems. Genetic testing revealed a deletion of exons 36 through 41 in the TSC2 gene. Serial MRI of the brain revealed stable cerebral tubers. Serial ultrasound examination and MRI of the kidneys revealed gradually enlarging polycystic kidneys, with 50 to 100 cysts (some with heterogeneous signal intensity) and distortion of the renal architecture. Annual renal MRI at 6.5 years of age revealed that a complex cyst in the lower pole of the left kidney had an increase in the number and thickness of septations (from 1.8 cm in greatest thickness to 3.0 to 3.4 cm). Four months later, repeat MRI showed continued slight enlargement of the complex cyst, with increasingly conspicuous enhancement of a stellate central component. When the patient was 7 years of age, a complete blood count and tests of renal and liver function were normal, as were levels of plasma electrolytes, glucose, calcium, magnesium, total protein, and albumin; levels of urinary creatinine and protein; the urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio; and urinalysis. Medications included atenolol, enalapril, lamotrigine, gabapentin, and valproic acid. The patient was allergic to risperidone (which had caused tachycardia) and methylphenidate (which had caused anaphylaxis). He lived with his mother and three half-siblings some of the time and his father the rest of the time, and he attended a school for children with special needs. Two half-siblings had asthma. On examination, the patient was alert and intermittently cooperative, with poor verbal skills. The weight was 30.8 kg, the height 119.5 cm, and the blood pressure 112/70 mm Hg. There were facial angiofibromas and hypopigmented mac-ules on the torso and arms. On neurologic examination, the reflexes, muscle bulk and tone and power, and gait were normal. The remainder of the examination was normal. One month later, MRI of the kidneys revealed no increase in the size of the complex cyst in the lower pole of the left kidney; however, the cystic areas were smaller as compared with the previous study, and the central component appeared more solid and enhanced on images obtained after the administration of gadolinium; there was no fatty component. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2018,10,nejm-case-2018-10,An 84-Year-Old Man with Painless Unilateral Testicular Swelling,"Dr. Michael S. Abers (Medicine): An 84-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of painless right testicular swelling. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 6 weeks before this evaluation, when he noted while showering that the right testicle was approximately 3 times larger than the left testicle. The testicle was soft and nontender on palpation, and the enlargement had not been present the previous day. The next day, the patient was evaluated at a local urgent care clinic. He reported no trauma, heavy lifting, recent sexual intercourse, testicular or scrotal pain, abdominal or back pain, skin changes or rash, obstructive urinary symptoms, hematuria or dysuria, or discharge. He had no constitutional symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, or weight loss. On examination, the right testicle had a large, soft, mobile posterior mass; the left testicle was normal. A presumptive diagnosis of a hydrocele was made, and the patient was advised to use scrotal support and, if pain occurred, to take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Testicular ultrasonography was scheduled for the following day. Dr. HeiShun Yu: The next day, ultrasonography (Fig. 1) revealed marked asymmetric enlargement and hypervascularity of the right testicle. A hypoechoic region in the mediastinum testis was most likely related to edema due to infection or inflammation. The epididymis was also enlarged and hypervascular. An associated complex hydrocele, with septations and internal debris, was present on the right side. These findings were compatible with right epididymo-orchitis. The left testicle had normal echotexture and no focal lesion. There was an incidental left varicocele. Dr. Abers: A 10-day course of oral levofloxacin was prescribed. Six weeks later, at a follow-up visit with his primary care physician, the patient reported persistent testicular swelling. He noted that there had been a mild decrease in the swelling after he had completed the levofloxacin course but that the testicle continued to ","{'Hernia and Hydrocele': [], 'Inflammation': [], 'Cancer': [], 'Genitourinary Sarcoidosis': [], 'Genitourinary Tuberculosis': [], 'Narrowing the Differential Diagnosis': []}",Genitourinary tuberculosis. ,Mycobacterial epididymo-orchitis due to Myco-bacterium tuberculosis. ,Mycobacterial epididymo-orchitis due to Myco-bacterium tuberculosis. ,0
NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,31,nejm-case-2010-31,A 29-Year-Old Woman with Fever after a Cat Bite,"Dr. Allyson K. Bloom (Infectious Disease): A 29-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of fever after a cat bite. The patient had been well until 5 days before admission, when, while working as a veterinarian’s assistant at an animal hospital, she was bitten on the right thenar eminence by a domesticated cat, sustaining a single puncture wound. The cat, which had received rabies vaccinations in the past, had disappeared from its home for several days and had returned febrile, jaundiced, and anemic. After being bitten, the patient washed the wound and took one dose of amoxicillin, according to workplace protocol. She continued to work that day and handled cats, rabbits, guinea pigs, and dogs (including a dog with elevated results of liver-function tests and a history of leptospirosis). During the next 4 days, the patient cleaned cages, handled animals, and petted horses, sheep, and unvaccinated “barn cats” outside. She did not report that any animal licked her wound. The day before admission, swelling, erythema, and pain developed over the volar radial surface of the patient’s hand. The same day, the cat was euthanized because of progressive illness, and a specimen of the brain was sent for rabies testing. The next morning, throbbing pain developed in the patient’s hand. She went to another hospital, where she rated the pain at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. On examination, the vital signs were normal. The thenar eminence was red, hot, and swollen, with evidence of a small puncture wound; the range of motion of the joints was full, without pain, and there was no fluctuance. Ampicillin–sulbactam was given intravenously, and immunizations for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis were administered intramuscularly. Amoxicil-lin–clavulanic acid and oxycodone were prescribed, and the patient was discharged 2 hours after presentation, with instructions to follow up the next day, or sooner if the condition worsened. Approximately 9 hours later, she returned to the other hospital because of increasing pain (rated at 10 of 10) and swelling of the hand, difficulty moving her wrist, malaise, chills, neck pain, swollen lymph nodes, and subjective fever. On examination, the temperature was 37.7°C; other vital signs were normal. There was 1+ nonpitting edema on the right arm; edema and ery-thema were present over the thenar eminence, with proximal streaking and increased warmth. Range of motion at the wrist was normal. Right axillary lymph-adenopathy was present. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Morphine sulfate and another dose of ampicillin–sulbactam were administered intravenously, and ondansetron and oxy-codone were given orally. Approximately 2 hours after presentation, the patient was discharged and driven to this hospital for further evaluation. The patient was otherwise well. She had had a cesarean section 6 months earlier and lived with her partner and child, both of whom were healthy; she was monogamous with her partner. She drank alcohol socially, had smoked 10 cigarettes per day for 8 years, and did not use illicit drugs. She was taking no other medications and had no allergies. She owned cats, a dog, turtles, and a frog. She lived in a rural area of coastal southeastern Massachusetts. Her only foreign travel had been to the Caribbean years earlier. She had been to southern California a year ago. She was not aware of having received any tick bites. On examination, she appeared anxious and uncomfortable. The temperature was 37.1°C, the blood pressure 117/61 mm Hg, the pulse 102 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. The right hand, wrist, and axilla were tender, and the hand was swollen. A puncture wound was visible on the right thenar eminence, with surrounding erythema and red linear tracking on the ventral aspect of the wrist. There was right axillary lymphadenopathy. Sensation and peripheral puls-es were normal, and there was no fluctuance that was suggestive of an abscess. The remainder of the examination was normal. A radio-graph of the hand showed normal joint spaces and no foreign body. The level of glucose and tests of renal function were normal; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to the observation unit. Morphine sulfate, ketorolac tromethamine, and ampicillin–sulbactam (third dose) were administered intravenously; acetaminophen was administered orally; and the hand was elevated. Pain in the hand decreased, and 12 hours after arrival, the patient was discharged with instructions to take amoxicillin–clavulanic acid twice daily for 10 days, to elevate her right hand at all times, and to seek medical follow-up in 3 days, or sooner if the condition worsened. That evening, 6.5 hours after discharge from this hospital, the patient returned to the first hospital because of shaking chills, a temperature of 40°C, headache, and generalized aching and arthralgias. On examination, the temperature was reportedly 38.5°C. Additional ampicillin– sulbactam, morphine, hydromorphone, diphen-hydramine, and ondansetron were administered, and a splint was applied. In the morning, she was transferred by ambulance to this hospital, arriving 31 hours after her initial presentation at this hospital. She reported that the pain in the hand and wrist had improved; pain in the right arm, axilla, and neck had increased; and headache, diffuse body aches, mild abdominal and low pelvic pain, and transient numbness and tingling in the back and legs had developed. She reported no urinary symptoms. The temperature was 39.0°C; other vital signs were stable. Erythema was decreased, cervical and axillary lymph nodes and the right hand were enlarged and tender, and the right hand was edematous (2+), with decreased range of motion of the wrist and fingers. Levels of glucose and bilirubin were normal, as were the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the results of renal-function tests. Urinalysis revealed 1+ ketones and trace urobilinogen and was otherwise normal. Tests for antibodies to hepatitis A and C viruses were negative; other test results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Examination of Wright-stained smears of whole blood (thick and thin preparations) showed no evidence of intracellular or extracellular organisms or morulae. Chest radiographs showed minimal patchy airspace opacities in the middle lobe of the right lung, without focal consolidation, and abdominal ultrasonography was normal. Specimens of blood were cultured. Vancomycin, levofloxacin, morphine sulfate, ketorolac tromethamine, and normal saline were administered intravenously. Infectious-disease specialists were consulted, and the administration of ampicillin–sulbactam and azithromycin was begun. Her symptoms improved. On the second hospital day, the administration of azithromycin was stopped, and doxycy-cline was begun. The swelling, pain, and ery-thema markedly diminished, and the temperature was normal. On the fourth day, the patient was discharged with instructions to take amoxicil-lin–clavulanic acid, doxycycline, and levofloxa-cin for 2 weeks. At follow-up 7 weeks later, she felt well, and the physical examination was normal. A diagnostic test was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2023,28,nejm-case-2023-28,A 37-Year-Old Man with a Rash,"Dr. Stephanie Lin-Beckford (Medicine): A 37-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of a rash. The patient had been well until 9 days before this admission, when a diffuse rash developed on the hands and feet. During the next 3 days, the rash spread proximally to the arms and the legs, then extended to the groin, trunk, and face. Six days before this admission, the patient noticed new throat tightness and lip swelling. Three days before this admission, when difficulty with swallowing and shortness of breath developed, the patient sought evaluation at the emergency department of another hospital. On evaluation at the other hospital, the patient reported that he had received an mRNA-based coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine on the day before the rash appeared. Vital signs and results of routine laboratory tests were reportedly normal. Treatment with dexamethasone, diphenhydramine, famotidine, and intravenous fluids was administered. The patient was discharged home. During the next 3 days, the symptoms did not abate. On the day of this admission, the patient sought evaluation in the emergency department of this hospital. He described having difficulty with opening his mouth because of pain in his lips, as well as mild difficulty with swallowing and breathing. The rash had become more confluent over the arms, legs, chest, back, face, and groin, and there was increased redness and swelling. The patient described the rash as mildly itchy and painful and stated that the affected skin felt “tight.” A review of systems was notable for fatigue, malaise, chills, and night sweats, as well as intermittent nausea, abdominal pain, watery stools, and dysuria. He had no fever, headache, cough, myalgias, or arthralgias. The patient had no known medical conditions, took no medications, and had no known drug allergies. He was born in coastal South America and had immigrated to the United States 17 years before this admission. He lived in suburban New England with extended family members and had no pets; he had not traveled recently and had no known sick contacts. The patient worked in environmental services and wore gloves whenever he used cleaning products. He had smoked a half pack of CME at NEJM.org cigarettes daily for 5 years; he did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. He was sexually active and reported that his last episode of unprotected sexual intercourse had been with a female partner 2 years before this admission. No family members had autoimmune diseases or skin conditions. On examination, the temporal temperature was 37.1°C, the heart rate 105 beats per minute, the blood pressure 138/92 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. There was fissuring at the oral com-missures, and the posterior oropharynx had a cobblestone appearance; no mucosal lesions were noted. There was no conjunctival injection. The lungs were clear on auscultation. No joint swelling or cervical lymphadenopathy was present, but he had nontender bilateral inguinal lymphade-nopathy. Morbilliform macules, papules, and plaques were observed on the arms, legs, chest, back, face, scalp, groin, and penis (Fig. 1). The rash became confluent at the dorsa and palms of the hands and at the dorsa and soles of the feet. No skin sloughing, erosions, ulcers, vesicles, or bullae were present. The complete blood count, blood levels of electrolytes, and results of tests of kidney and liver function were normal. The C-reactive protein level was 16.7 mg per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 8.0) and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 30 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 13). Urinalysis was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to this hospital, and diagnostic tests were performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2008,06,nejm-case-2008-06,A 46-Year-Old Woman with Renal Failure and Stiffness of the Joints and Skin,"Dr. Nancy Cibotti-Granof (Medicine): A 46-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease was seen by a rheumatology consultant because of stiffness of her joints and skin. The patient had been well except for mild asthma until 7 years earlier, when group A streptococcal pneumonia developed, complicated by septic shock, with acute respiratory distress syndrome; septic emboli to the lungs, brain, and kidney; renal failure requiring dialysis; flaccid quadriplegia; and coma. On the 25th day after initial admission to another hospital, she was transferred to this hospital while she was receiving mechanical ventilation. As part of the evaluation during admission, computed tomography (CT) of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis with intravenous contrast revealed cavitary lesions in the right lower lobe of the lung, with diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities, small bilateral pleural effusions, and multiple prominent mediastinal lymph nodes. CT of the head revealed regions of cortical mineralization in the left posterior frontal lobe and the right parietal lobe, with surrounding hypodensity consistent with edema and minimal enhancement consistent with cerebritis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with gadolinium revealed regions of cortical enhancement with surrounding edema in the left posterior frontal lobe and right parietal lobe consistent with cerebritis and vasculitis, as well as a small infarct in the right corona radiata (Fig. 1A). Follow-up CT scans with contrast enhancement and MRI studies with gadolinium enhancement revealed regions of cerebritis and small infarcts, with no drainable abscesses. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography showed a patent foramen ovale, normal left ventricular function, and no valvular vegetations. A filter was placed in the inferior vena cava. During the hospital stay, the blood pressure stabilized; the patient regained consciousness and recovered speech and motor strength, with residual right-sided weakness. Kidney function improved, and hemodialysis was discontinued. Weakness, sensory loss, and pain in both feet persisted, and treatment with gabapentin (300 mg twice daily) was begun. The patient was discharged on the 53rd hospital day, first to a rehabilitation facility for 2 months, and then to home.

Sawalla Guseh II: A 35-year-old woman with a history of Crohn’s disease was admitted to this hospital with headache, subjective fever, and anemia. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 1 week before admission, when headache, fatigue, and myalgias developed. During the next 2 days, she felt generally unwell, and the headache did not diminish with the use of acetaminophen. Five days before admission, she felt feverish, but her temperature (measured at home) was 37.8°C. The frequency of bowel movements increased from a baseline of one to three movements per day to five to eight per day; the color of the stool remained brown, but the consistency became looser, and the stool occasionally contained small amounts of mucus and blood. Two days before admission, the patient presented to her primary care physician for evaluation. The hemoglobin level was reportedly 8 g per deciliter (reference range, 12 to 16); 6 weeks earlier, the level had been 13 g per deciliter. A provisional diagnosis of a flare of Crohn’s disease was made, and prednisone and intravenous fluids were administered. One day before admission, the hemoglobin level was reportedly 7 g per deciliter, and the patient was asked by her gastroenterolo-gist to stop taking prednisone and to present to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing headache, fatigue, and myalgias but no dyspnea on exertion or palpitations. She had a history of infertility, and 4 weeks before admission, she had completed one cycle of intrauterine insemination after the administration of follicle-stimulating hormone. She did not become pregnant, and the last menstrual period began 2 weeks before admission, with menstrual flow that was heavier and of longer duration than the flow of previous menstrual cycles. The patient had received a diagnosis of Crohn’s disease 9 years before admission. Two years later, cytomegalovirus colitis developed while she was receiving infliximab and azathioprine, and her treatment was changed to infliximab monotherapy. Two years before admission, she had evidence of persistent inflammation on endoscopy, and her treatment was then changed to vedolizumab. Eight weeks before admission, the frequency of the vedolizumab dose was increased after the stool calprotectin level was found to be elevated. The patient also had a history of primary sclerosing cholangitis with normal hepatic synthetic function, stable diffuse intrahepatic disease, and no evidence of a clear dominant stricture on magnetic resonance cholangiopan-creatography performed 3 months before admission. In addition to vedolizumab, medications included cetirizine and a prenatal multivitamin with iron. The patient did not smoke tobacco, drank alcohol rarely, and did not use illicit drugs. She lived in New England, worked as an engineer, and was of Asian Indian descent. Her 3-year-old son attended day care regularly. Ten days before admission, fever and an erythema-tous facial rash had developed in the son; he was not evaluated by a medical provider and recovered after 2 days. On examination, the temperature was 36.7°C, the blood pressure 103/66 mm Hg, the pulse 96 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was alert and oriented. The sclerae were anic-teric, and the conjunctivae were pale. The oro-pharynx appeared normal, and there was no cervical lymphadenopathy. She did not have a rash, petechiae, ecchymoses, spider angiomas, or palmar erythema. Bowel sounds were present, and the abdomen was soft, nondistended, and nontender on palpation; there was no spleno-megaly. The first and second heart sounds were normal, without murmurs. The arms and legs did not have edema. A rectal examination revealed brown stool that tested positive for fecal occult blood. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, total protein, albumin, folate, vitamin B12, and fibrino-gen were normal, as were results of kidney-function and coagulation tests. The total bilirubin level was 1.1 mg per deciliter (19 μmol per liter; reference range, 0 to 1.0 mg per deciliter [0 to 17 μmol per liter]); it had increased from a baseline level of 0.3 to 0.7 mg per deciliter (5 to 12 μmol per liter). Blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen and antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2 were negative. Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.003 (reference range, 1.001 to 1.035) and a pH of 6 (reference range, 5 to 9) and was negative for glucose, blood, protein, bilirubin, and urobilinogen. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed sparse red cells, which were normal in size and central pallor, with scattered sphero-cytes; there were no schistocytes or reticulo-cytes. White cells and platelets appeared normal, except for the presence of a few atypical lymphocytes. One unit of packed red cells was transfused, and the patient was admitted to this hospital.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2013,01,nejm-case-2013-01,A 63-Year-Old Man with Paresthesias and Difficulty Swallowing,"Dr. Andrew M. Brunner (Medicine): A 63-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of paresthesias, difficulty drinking liquids, and anxiety. The patient had been well until 4 days before admission, when aching developed in the left elbow, which improved with ibuprofen. The next day, right-elbow discomfort occurred, and he had decreased appetite. Two days before admission, he noted difficulty forming words, mild light-headedness, and mild recurrent pain in both elbows. An attempt to drink a glass of water precipitated a gagging sensation. He had difficulty breathing and could not swallow the water. The choking sensation resolved when he spat out the water, but it recurred with subsequent attempts. He stopped drinking liquids and became increasingly anxious. One day before admission, he was unable to shower because of increased anxiety and noted intermittent decreased fluency in his speech and pruritus at the nape of his neck. He was concerned that he was having a stroke, and he drove to the emergency department at a local hospital. On examination, the temperature was 37.8°C, the blood pressure 111/81 mm Hg, the pulse 97 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was intermittently very anxious and hyperventilating. When given a cup of water or juice, he gagged as the cup neared his mouth and coughed while attempting to drink, with improvement after he expectorated the liquid. He was able to swallow solids. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood levels of hemoglobin, electrolytes, total protein, albumin, creatine kinase isoenzymes, and troponin T were normal, as were the hematocrit, platelet count, and red-cell indexes; tests of coagulation and renal and liver function were also normal. Other test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 87 beats per minute, left ventricular hypertrophy, and a QRS-complex duration of 134 msec, without evidence of acute ischemia. A chest radiograph was normal. Lorazepam and intravenous fluids were administered, with some reduction in anxiety. Computed tomography (CT) of the head without the administration of contrast material was reportedly normal. The patient was transferred to this hospital. The patient reported intermittent tremulousness during the previous 2 days, retching when thinking about drinking water, and a transient pruritic rash on his left shoulder 2 weeks before this presentation, without recent fever, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, pharyngitis, or focal motor deficits. He had hypertension, chronic ptosis of the right eyelid, and, 6 months earlier, a tick bite for which doxycycline had been administered. Medications included hydrochlorothiazide and low-dose aspirin daily; he had received influenza and tetanus vaccinations within the past year. He had no allergies. He drank alcohol occasionally, had stopped smoking 25 years earlier, and did not use illicit drugs. He lived with his wife in an old house in a semirural region of New England. He had no history of animal bites; however, bats had been seen in his home and in a barn where he had worked several times during the previous year. He had not traveled internationally in the past decade. His father had had lung cancer. On examination, the patient appeared anxious, with dry mucous membranes. The blood pressure was 171/80 mm Hg, the pulse 86 beats per minute, the temperature 36.4°C, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. Other findings included ptosis of the right eyelid, mild facial twitching, postural hand tremors, and dysmetria on finger–nose–finger and heel-to-shin testing, without truncal ataxia. Deep-tendon reflexes were symmetrically hyperactive throughout; plantar reflexes were flexor. There was mild difficulty with tandem walking. The patient’s speech was rushed and fluent, except for occasional slurred words and pauses for word finding; the remainder of the general and neuro-logic examination was normal. The hematocrit, platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and levels of hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, and troponin T were normal, as were tests of renal and liver function; toxicologic screening and testing for antibodies to Ro and La were negative. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Loraze-pam was administered. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain without the administration of contrast material and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the head and neck revealed abnormal signal hyperintensity scattered in the periventric-ular and subcortical white matter on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images and was otherwise normal. A chest ra-diograph was normal. The patient was admitted to the hospital. During the first day, the patient was conversant and had increasing anxiety and discomfort from ambient noises, including hospital monitor alarms. Evaluation by a speech and language pathologist revealed severe anxiety related to swallowing liquids (characterized by physically aversive behaviors when liquids began to approach his facial area), without evidence of focal dysphagia, dysarthria, or an anatomical contraindication to swallowing. Overnight, anxiety increased. Lorazepam and haloperidol were administered. Early in the morning of the second day, the temperature rose to 38.2°C. The patient was tremulous, agitated, oriented but confused, and unable to give a clear history. After premedication with additional lor-azepam and haloperidol, a lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was 33 cm of water. Results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and other test results are shown in Table 1. Cytologic examination and flow cytometry of the CSF showed no abnormalities. Immediately after the procedure, cyanosis developed; the systolic blood pressure was 240 mm Hg, the pulse 160 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 40 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 40 to 49%. An ECG showed supraventricular tachycardia at a rate of 150 beats per minute, with regular rhythm and right bundle-branch block, without ischemic changes. The pulse suddenly decreased from 150 beats per minute to 60, then returned to 150 beats per minute before pharmacologic intervention. Oxygen was administered, and the oxygen saturation rose to 95%. Metoprolol and fu-rosemide were administered intravenously, followed by diltiazem. A repeat chest radiograph showed perihilar fullness and loss of definition of the pulmonary vasculature, consistent with pulmonary edema. The trachea was intubated, and the patient was admitted to the cardiac care unit. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed moderate generalized background slowing without focal features, epileptiform activity, or correlation to episodes of arm tremors and twitching. CT of the brain showed no evidence of acute injury. Diagnostic procedures were performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,11,nejm-case-2010-11,"A 69-Year-Old Woman with Lethargy, Confusion, and Abnormalities on Brain Imaging","Dr. Tracey A. Cho (Neurology): A 69-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of increasing lethargy, confusion, and abnormalities on brain imaging. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 2 months earlier, when her family noted increasing apathy and lethargy. During the subsequent weeks, social withdrawal, episodes of confusion, and visual and tactile hallucinations developed, and she slept most of the time and required assistance with activities of daily living. Three weeks before admission, she saw her primary care physician for a routine annual examination. The patient reported sadness and a lack of motivation; she had had an episode of transient shaking chills the day before but felt well otherwise. A diagnosis of connective-tissue disease had been made 7 years earlier, identified as a lupuslike syndrome, associated with positive tests for antinuclear antibodies and antiphospho-lipid antibodies and negative tests for rheumatoid factor and antibodies to double-stranded DNA and Ro, La, Sm, and RNP antigens. She had been treated with low-dose corticosteroids. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura had been diagnosed 5 years earlier, which did not respond to increased corticosteroids and intravenous immune globulin. Pathological examination of a specimen from a bone marrow biopsy performed at another hospital reportedly showed adequate megakaryocytes and numerous lymphoid aggregates, normal cytogenetic test results, and no evidence of a clonal B-cell population according to flow-cytometric analysis. During the subsequent years, treatment had included rofecoxib, azathioprine, rituximab (given weekly for 4 weeks, 5.5 years earlier), prednisone, hydroxychloroquine, nabumetone, and danazol, as well as another course (5 days) of intravenous immune globulin; she had declined splenectomy repeatedly. Bilateral subdural hematomas and subarachnoid hemorrhages had occurred 4 years earlier. Because of thrombocytopenia, the patient had received blood transfusions in the 2 years before admission, whenever gastrointestinal bleeding occurred. For the past 2 years, she had been participating in an experimental protocol for severe thrombocytopenia that involved the administration of romiplostim (a thrombopoietin-receptor agonist) (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00102336) and tapering doses of prednisone, which led to improvement in platelet levels. She also had a history of polymyalgia rheumatica, arthritis, congenital sixth cranial nerve palsy on the left side (Duane syndrome), migraine headaches, multinodular goiter, dry eyes, gastroesoph-ageal reflux disease, Helicobacter pylori infection, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia. The patient lived with her husband and had worked in an office before retirement; she had cared for her elderly father at home until his death during the year before this evaluation. Her father had had depression and died in his 90s; her mother died at 85 years of age from bladder and kidney cancer. An aunt had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The patient’s children and grandchildren were well. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Medications included prednisone (10 mg every other day), atenolol, omeprazole, sumatriptan as needed, acetaminophen, multivitamins, ascorbic acid, ergo-calciferol, iron polysaccharide, conjugated estrogens, calcium carbonate, annual infusions of zole-dronic acid, and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole. On examination, the patient was quiet and withdrawn; the vital signs and physical examination were normal. Urine culture grew moderate Escherichia coli; other laboratory-test results were negative. Cephalexin was administered for 5 days for a urinary tract infection; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was scheduled, and she was referred for psychiatric evaluation. The next week, the patient saw a psychiatrist. The patient and her family reported that she had been sad since the death of her father the previous year, with the recent onset of decreased appetite, poor focus and concentration, lack of energy and motivation, and a desire to sleep all the time. She had had intermittent migraine headaches for years, which were unchanged, with no history of psychiatric illness. She appeared sad. Her speech was coherent but had a paucity of details. A diagnosis of major depressive disorder was made. Alprazolam, which she had been taking for sleep, was discontinued, and treatment with mirtazapine was begun. Ten days before admission, MRI of the brain, performed with the administration of gadolinium, revealed a large area of signal abnormality and subtle enhancement predominantly involving the white matter of the right frontal lobe and insula, with less extensive involvement of the left frontal lobe. A mass to the right of the tentorial leaflet was thought to be consistent with a small men-ingioma. Five days before admission, the patient saw a neurosurgeon. She reported no improvement in her symptoms while she was taking mirtazapine. On examination, the vital signs were normal and the oxygen saturation was 95% while she was breathing ambient air. She was alert, was oriented but inattentive, and had little insight into her medical condition. She displayed perseveration and had decreased verbal fluency, impaired calculations, and an inability to follow three-step commands. Memory, language, and praxis were otherwise normal. There was a left sixth-nerve palsy without diplopia, but otherwise, extraocular movements and other cranial nerves were intact. Motor examination revealed normal power with no bradykinesia, rigidity, or tremor. Deep-tendon reflexes were increased on the left side. Vibration sense was mildly impaired in the toes, but sensation was otherwise intact. Coordination was normal. Gait was unsteady and slow. Romberg’s test revealed minimal swaying after 30 seconds; the patient was unable to perform heel-to-toe walking. Urinalysis revealed yellow, cloudy urine, with a specific gravity of 1.021, a pH of 5.5, 1+ albumin, 5 to 10 white cells per high-power field, 10 to 20 hyaline casts and 20 to 100 granular casts per low-power field, and few squamous cells; it was otherwise normal. Serum electrolyte levels, results of renal-function tests, and the white-cell count were normal. The hematocrit was 34.8%, and the platelet count 635,000 per cubic millimeter. An electrocardiogram was normal, and a chest radiograph revealed clear lungs. Four days later, MRI of the brain with the administration of gadolinium showed no changes from the examination 10 days earlier. The next day, the patient was admitted to the hospital and a diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2015,28,nejm-case-2015-28,"A 32-Year-Old Man with Fever, Headache, and Myalgias after Traveling from Liberia","Dr. Paul D. Biddinger: In December 2014, the emergency department of this hospital received a call from a public health authority about a 32-year-old man with fever, headache, and myalgias that had developed 8 days after he had traveled from Liberia. The patient had been in Liberia for 3 months, working as an administrator for a nonprofit organization that was involved in the response to the epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD). He had not had any known direct contact with persons infected with the virus. While he was in Liberia, he did observe patients with EVD, as well as health care workers and funeral personnel in protective clothing, but only from afar. He departed from Liberia 8 days before admission. He arrived in the United States the day after he left Liberia and immediately began participating in an EVD monitoring program administered by a public health authority, with plans to participate in the program for the 21-day period after his departure from Liberia. As part of this program, the patient measured his temperature twice daily, performed self-observation for other signs or symptoms of infection, and communicated each day with a public health official about his condition. He reported temperatures that were within normal limits and had felt well until the morning of the day of admission, when a headache and myalgias developed. Several hours later, his temperature rose to 39.3°C, with associated chills. The patient contacted the public health authority, who subsequently called the person who had been previously specified as the point of contact at this hospital to discuss the facts of the case and to notify the hospital about the patient’s impending arrival. The public health authority coordinated the dispatch of emergency medical services (EMS) to the patient’s home. EMS personnel performed an initial interview and assessment of the patient while maintaining a distance of greater than 6 ft (2 m) between themselves and the patient. The patient appeared to be alert, oriented, conversant, ambulatory, and well. He was provided with an impermeable jumpsuit and a face mask; EMS per-sonnel also put on personal protective equipment (PPE) and draped the patient compartment of the ambulance in plastic. The patient was then transported to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. On arrival at the emergency department, the patient was immediately placed in a negative-pressure isolation room. He rated his headache at 7 or 8 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain) and reported fatigue, mild nausea, and a reduced appetite. He had a history of a mandibular fracture that had occurred in a sledding accident 6 years previously, and he had undergone strabismus repair in early childhood and laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis 1 year before admission. He also had a history of traumatic microhyphema and partial-thickness corneal laceration that had occurred after he was bitten on the face by a dog 6 years earlier, at which time the rabies vaccine and rabies immune globulin were administered. Before the patient traveled to Liberia, he had received the tetanus– diphtheria–acellular pertussis vaccine, the live-attenuated oral typhoid vaccine, and the yellow fever vaccine. He had received doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis during the trip, but he discontinued taking the medication on the day he returned to the United States. He took no other medications and had no known allergies. The patient was single; he had recently ended a long-term monogamous relationship and had no new sexual partners. He lived with roommates, consumed alcohol in moderation, and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. During the previous 9.5 years, he had traveled extensively in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and the Caucasus. During his trip to Liberia, he had spent half his time in Monrovia and the remainder divided between two sites where there were no known active cases of EVD. He had not used public transportation, shared his sleeping quarters with other persons, or had exposure to animals; he had been bitten by mosquitoes. Four days before admission, he had spent time with a friend who had a resolving upper respiratory tract infection. On limited examination, the patient did not appear to have signs that were immediately worrisome for possible sepsis. He was alert, cooperative, and oriented to person, place, and time. Extraocular-muscle movements were intact, oral mucous membranes were dry, and respiratory effort was normal. While he was in the emergency department, the patient reported having increasing chills and feeling more tired; he had slight diaphoresis, and the temperature was 39.7°C. Acetaminophen was administered. Management decisions were made, and a diagnostic test was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2008,26,nejm-case-2008-26,A 26-Year-Old Woman with Headache and Behavioral Changes,"Dr. Thomas J. Cummings, Jr. (Psychiatry): A 26-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of headache, behavioral changes, abnormal movements, and inability to communicate. The patient had been well, except for occasional migraine headaches, until 7 weeks earlier, when generalized, diffuse headache developed. It was most severe in the occipital region, with associated neck stiffness, sensitivity to sounds, intermittent blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. There were no prodromal symptoms or visual scotoma, which had occurred routinely with her migraines, and the pain did not diminish in response to her usual migraine treatment. During the next 10 days, she was seen multiple times in the emergency departments of other hospitals. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the brain obtained without the administration of gadolinium reportedly showed inflammatory changes in the left maxillary and ethmoid sinuses but was otherwise normal. Medications, including butalbital, oxycodone, hydrocodone, ibuprofen, sumatriptan, indomethacin, acetaminophen, and caffeine, were administered, with transient partial relief from pain. Somnolence, dys-phoria, short-term memory problems, confusion, agitation, and symptoms of depersonalization developed. Five and a half weeks before admission to this hospital, increasing visual disturbances that were thought to be visual hallucinations developed, with increasing confusion. On evaluation in a local emergency department, laboratory tests revealed negative results in tests for Lyme disease and syphilis. She was admitted to an inpatient psychiatric facility. The patient had a history of migraine headaches, obesity, asthma, and seasonal allergies. She smoked cigarettes and drank up to six alcoholic beverages on weekends. Several days before the onset of symptoms, she had attended a party and taken a drug that was reported to contain cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, ecstasy, and possibly salvia. On admission to the psychiatric hospital, her speech was initially fluent and appropriate but became garbled and incoherent; abnormal movements developed, including hyperextension of the arms and movements of the mouth. Anti-psychotic medications, including haloperidol, risperidone, benztropine, lorazepam, olanzapine, valproic acid, and quetiapine, were administered, without improvement. Fever developed, and the serum level of creatine kinase was reportedly elevated. On the fifth day, she was transferred to another hospital because of suspected neuro-leptic malignant syndrome. A lumbar puncture was performed; results of a cerebrospinal fluid analysis are shown in Table 1. A pregnancy test was negative. Naloxone, ceftriax-one, ampicillin, and acyclovir were administered, without improvement. A CT scan of the brain was reportedly normal. The next day, a generalized tonic–clonic seizure occurred, associated with bra-dycardia (30 to 39 beats per minute). The trachea was intubated, and phenobarbital and fospheny-toin were administered intravenously. Results of laboratory tests are shown in Table 2. A repeated CT study was reportedly unchanged. The next day, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit of another hospital. On examination, the patient was intubated and sedated and was not responsive to verbal or painful stimuli. Her pupils were equal and sluggishly reactive to light, with no tracking of the eyes. Reflexes were 3 out of 4 in the arms and 2 out of 4 in the legs, with 1 beat of clonus in the left foot; plantar responses were flexor. A lumbar puncture was repeated. Results of laboratory tests are shown in Tables 1 and 2. A chest radiograph reportedly revealed focal consolidation, which was consistent with pneumonia or atelectasis. Results of toxicology testing reportedly revealed the presence of barbiturates, tetrahydrocannabinol, and alcohol. On the second day, electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring was reported to suggest nonconvul-sive status epilepticus; later tracings did not show evidence of seizure activity. A CT scan of the brain obtained after the administration of contrast material was unchanged. Testing of the urine for heavy metals was negative. During the next 3 days, the patient became unresponsive to noxious stimuli, with pinpoint pupils; there were no focal or lateralizing findings. Long-term EEG monitoring reportedly showed a nonspecific, diffuse disturbance that was compatible with toxic or metabolic encephalopathy, neu-rodegenerative disease, or chronic encephalopathy. The results of transthoracic echocardiography were normal. Cultures of blood and sputum specimens were sterile; a urine specimen grew yeast, and this infection was treated. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with angiography, performed on the 14th day, showed no abnormalities. Lorazepam and propofol were administered for sedation; attempts at extubation led to increased agitation and nonfunctional, erratic breathing. Between the 17th and 21st days, four of six blood cultures grew coagulase-negative staphylococ-cus. Transesophageal echocardiography reportedly showed an ejection fraction of 60%, a possible mass on the aortic valve, and a mobile echoden-sity at the right coronary cusp. The antibiotics were changed to vancomycin and doxycycline. Diarrhea developed; a test for infection with Clostridium difficile was negative. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, percutaneous placement of an endoscopic gastros-tomy tube, and a tracheostomy were performed. The patient continued to be intermittently febrile and agitated, and her mental status did not improve. Seven weeks after the onset of symptoms, she was transferred to the neurology intensive care unit of this hospital. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) had reportedly been negative twice in the previous 2 years. The patient had visited California 11 months earlier, moved seasonally between New England and Florida, and worked outdoors (where she may have been exposed to permethrin, cyper-methrin, methomyl insecticide, citric-acid solution, and anhydrous ammonia) and in a warehouse where rodents had been seen. There was no exposure to exotic animals. Her father had multiple sclerosis and was adopted; his family history was unknown. Her maternal grandfather had had rheumatoid arthritis and had died of lung cancer; her maternal grandmother had lymphoma, autoimmune hepatitis, and a brain aneurysm; and a maternal uncle had cerebral palsy and a seizure disorder. The patient’s medications on admission included vancomycin, doxycycline, levetiracetam, midazolam, diphenhydramine, olanzapine, panto-prazole, fentanyl, oxycodone, albuterol by nebu-lizer, potassium, Ringer’s infusions, propofol, and norepinephrine (adjusted for hypotension). The patient was allergic to sulfa and benztropine. On examination, the trachea was intubated; the patient was alert but noncommunicative and intermittently agitated, with facial flushing, diapho-resis, and nasal flaring. Her blood pressure was 160/80 mm Hg, and her pulse 115 beats per minute; her respirations were 18 to 22 breaths per minute and irregular; and her oxygen saturation was 96%. The chest was clear on auscultation; there was a hyperdynamic cardiac murmur. The abdomen was obese and soft, with no tenderness or distention. Bowel sounds were present. The patient’s eyes were open, with conjugate gaze and with darting extraocular movements in all directions that were most frequent near the midline. She did not follow commands, make eye contact, turn to loud sounds, or react to noxious stimuli. There was continuous grimacing with oromotor dyskinesias, frowning, eyebrow elevation, near closure of the eyelids, and continuous movements of the head and neck. There was no audible speech, but she appeared to be mouthing nonsensical words when prompted with questions. Her pupils were reactive and small to pinpoint; the corneal reflexes were intact, and tongue protrusion was straight. Her arms did not move spontaneously or in response to stimuli; there were spontaneous rotatory and flexion–extension leg movements. Reflexes were brisk and symmetric, and plantar responses were flexor. Results of laboratory tests are shown in Table 2. Propofol and dexmedetomidine were administered for agitation, without improvement. Fentanyl, oxycodone, and lorazepam were administered; propofol was gradually discontinued, and clonazepam was added. Her agitation abated. On the third day, an MRI scan of the brain obtained after the administration of gadolinium revealed mild sinus mucosal thickening, a mucous retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus, and partial fluid opacification of the mastoid air cells, but was otherwise normal. A CT scan of the brain, obtained before the administration of contrast material, with CT angiography of the head and neck, obtained after the administration of contrast material, showed no intracranial hemorrhage and normal carotid, vertebral, and cerebral arteries. A CT scan of the chest, obtained to look for pulmonary embolism, revealed complete collapse of the lower lobe of the left lung due to mucous plugging of the left-lower-lobe bronchus and its segmental branches, as well as partial collapse of the right lower lobe. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, obtained after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed multiple large, peripheral, wedge-shaped areas of decreased enhancement in normal-size kidneys. The scan also revealed a lesion, 1.6 cm in diameter, in the left ovary that contained fat and calcifications, which were consistent with a dermoid cyst. Transthorac-ic and transesophageal echocardiograms showed mild, symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, a hy-perkinetic left ventricle, and a pleural effusion; the results were otherwise normal. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed a normal pattern and a moderate, diffuse decrease in gamma globulin (477 mg per deciliter; reference range, 614 to 1295). No Bence Jones protein or M component was detected. Other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 2. Levels of serum creatine kinase and isoen-zymes, troponin T, thyrotropin, copper, cerulo-plasmin, and antibodies to islet cells (GAD and IA-2), voltage-gated potassium channels, and peroxidase were normal; the results of tests for anti-neuronal nuclear antibodies and antibodies to Ma2 and CV2 were negative. On the fifth day, a lumbar puncture was performed. The results are shown in Table 1. On the 10th day, ultrasonography of the pelvis revealed a hyperechogenic focus, 1.9 cm by 2.4 cm, in the left ovary that contained fat and internal calcification, findings that were consistent with a dermoid cyst. Treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone (1000 mg per day for 5 days) was begun. A test for HIV was negative. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2018,26,nejm-case-2018-26,"A 48-Year-Old Man with Fever, Chills, Myalgias, and Rash","Dr. William G. Tsiaras: A 48-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of fever, chills, myalgias, diarrhea, and a diffuse rash. The patient had been in his usual state of good health until about 3 weeks before admission, in the late spring, when he noted the onset of fevers, chills, headache, and diffuse myalgias. He thought that he had influenza. Five days later, he noted an erythematous rash affecting his trunk, legs, feet, and hands. One day after that, mild, diffuse abdominal discomfort developed, along with anorexia and multiple episodes of nonbloody diarrhea. During the next 5 days, he had positional dizziness with syncope. Fourteen days before admission to this hospital, the patient sought medical attention at another hospital. At the other hospital, examination revealed that the patient had fatigue and a diffuse erythematous rash. The temperature was 37.7°C. Laboratory evaluation was notable for an absolute eosinophil count of 600 per cubic millimeter (reference range at the other hospital, 0 to 200) and elevated levels on liver-function tests. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, reportedly revealed mild, diffuse enlargement of lymph nodes, which were up to 9 mm in diameter in the mediastinum and up to 15 mm in diameter in the porta hepatis. A test of a nasopharyngeal swab for influenza A and B viruses, a rapid test of a throat swab for streptococcal antigen, and tests of the blood for babesia DNA, ehrlichia DNA, hepatitis A virus antibody, hepatitis B virus surface antibody and surface antigen, hepatitis C virus antibody, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) p24 antigen and antibody, and Lyme disease IgM antibody were negative. The patient was treated with an unknown antibiotic agent, and after 5 days, he was discharged with prescriptions for cetirizine and hydroxyzine. He was scheduled for follow-up with his primary care physician. The day before admission, the patient observed new mild swelling of the face and hands, with blisters on the palms. He was seen by his primary care physician the next day, and he reported persistent fevers, chills, rash with blistering, anorexia, and positional light-headedness. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. On the basis of advice from a rheumatologist located in the same office, the patient was given one dose of oral prednisone and was referred to the emergency department of this hospital. Additional history was obtained in the emergency department. The patient reported pruritus in the areas of the previous leg rash, fatigue, chronic pain in the cervical spine and low back, and a mostly intentional weight loss of 11 kg over the previous 15 weeks. He had had no known exposures to animals or insects. He had a history of hyperlipidemia, depression, and gastroesopha-geal reflux disease. Medications included aspirin, mirtazapine, rosuvastatin, omeprazole, and cetiri-zine, as well as hydroxyzine as needed for pruritus. He reported that he had started to take a new over-the-counter medication for the treatment of pain approximately 5 weeks before admission but had stopped taking it at the onset of his presenting symptoms. He could not recall the name of this new medication. He had had no adverse reactions to medications. His family history was notable for lung cancer in his mother and diabetes and coronary artery disease in his father; there was no history of autoimmune or derma-tologic disorders. He had smoked two packs of cigarettes daily and marijuana once weekly for the past 30 years. He did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. He worked as a manual laborer and driver. He had not traveled outside of New England. He was single and had had multiple female sexual contacts but had always used barrier protection; the young grandchild of his current sexual partner had recently had a self-limited febrile illness with a diffuse maculopapular, ery-thematous rash. On examination, the patient appeared fatigued. The temperature was 37.1°C, the heart rate 89 beats per minute, the blood pressure 132/57 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 79 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 28.1. He had mild periorbital edema and mild exfolia-tive scale on the temple and forehead. A blanching, maculopapular rash was present on the trunk. On the arms, legs, and dorsal feet, there were thin, faintly violaceous plaques with mild exfo-liative scale. Small flaccid bullae, including some that were hemorrhagic, were noted on several fingers and the palms, and a few had ruptured (Fig. 1). He did not have a rash on mucosal surfaces or nail changes. There were mildly tender, mobile lymph nodes in the bilateral cervical, submandibular, axillary, and inguinal distribu-tions, including a 1-cm axillary node and a 2-cm inguinal node. There was mild abdominal tenderness in the upper quadrants, with hepatospleno-megaly. The stool was guaiac-negative. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of thyrotropin, creatine kinase, troponin T, amylase, lipase, and vitamin D were normal, as were the serum osmolality, basophil count, prothrombin time, and activated partial-thromboplastin time. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to the general medicine unit. Two sets of blood cultures were obtained. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed atypical-appearing mononuclear cells. Dr. Shaunagh McDermott: On the second hospital day, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material. There were areas of centri-lobular emphysema and bronchial-wall thickening, scattered pulmonary nodules (2 to 3 mm in diameter) in the upper lobes, and multiple enlarged lymph nodes (Fig. 2A and 2B). There was also splenomegaly (spleen length, 15.2 cm; normal length, ≤12.0 cm), with a splenic cyst (Fig. 2B). Dr. Tsiaras: On the third hospital day, the temperature rose to 38.4°C and the heart rate was 110 beats per minute. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cultures of the urine and blood were obtained. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed mild, diffuse hypergammaglobulinemia, ","{'Eosinophilia': [], 'Cancer': [], 'Addison’s Disease': [], 'Parasitic Infection': [], 'Allergy': [], 'Reevaluation of the Clinical Presentation': [], 'HHV-6 Infection': []}","The DRESS syndrome, most likely triggered by a drug reaction, associated with human herpesvi-rus 6 infection.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2013,40,nejm-case-2013-40,A 36-Year-Old Man  with Agitation and Paranoia,"Dr. David P. Curley (Emergency Medicine): A 36-year-old man with a history of alcohol and substance abuse was admitted to this hospital because of severe agitation and paranoia. The patient’s girlfriend reported that the patient had been sober for approximately 20 months, until he lost his job. Three days before admission, he began drinking alcohol and taking “bath salts” (psychoactive drugs) intranasally after having had no sleep and minimal oral intake. The night before admission, increasing agitation developed and was associated with apparent auditory and visual hallucinations that people were trying to harm him. On the morning of admission, shortly after snorting more bath salts, he ran outside unclothed, shouting that someone was trying to strangle him. His girlfriend called the police, who found him running naked in the street. When emergency medical services personnel arrived, they found him restrained by police officers, combative, and confused, with nonsensical, paranoid, and rambling speech. The pulse was 157 beats per minute, with bounding radial pulses, and the respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute. The pupils were 5 mm in diameter. The skin was flushed, warm, and diaphoretic. A capillary glucose level was 268 mg per deciliter (14.9 mmol per liter). Soft restraints were applied, and oxygen was administered through a nonrebreather face mask. The patient was transported to the emergency department at this hospital. En route, he suddenly became quiet, and a seizure was suspected. The administration of midazolam was attempted, but the patient pulled out the intravenous catheter. On arrival, the patient was unable to communicate. His history was obtained from his girlfriend. He had a history of depression, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse (including heroin, cocaine, and prescription opiates). His only medication was flu-oxetine, which he reportedly had not taken for 2 weeks. He was allergic to shellfish and had no known allergies to medications. He smoked cigarettes. He lived with his girlfriend and had recently lost his job at a service station. He had a family history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and diabetes mellitus. On examination, the patient was agitated, flailing his arms and legs, jerking his head, and making loud incomprehensible sounds. He was unable to cooperate during the examination and required restraining by several security officers. The temperature was 37.0°C, the blood pressure 157/67 mm Hg, the pulse 173 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. The skin was diaphoretic. The pupils were equal and reactive to light; the gaze was deviated upward, with slow, horizontal ocular movements. The patient’s speech was rapid and mostly unintelligible, but he made references to attacking and being attacked by animals, people, and monsters. The remainder of the examination was normal. The prothrombin time, prothrombin-time international normalized ratio, and results of liver-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of calcium, total protein, albumin, and globulin; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed clear, yellow urine with a specific gravity greater than 1.030, a pH of 5.5, 2+ occult blood, 1+ albumin, and trace ketones by dipstick. There were 3 to 5 red cells, 10 to 20 white cells, few squamous cells, and very few renal tubular cells per high-power field and few bacteria and 3 to 5 hyaline and granular casts per low-power field; mucin was present. Urinalysis was otherwise normal. The urine creatinine level was 3.50 mg per milliliter. The patient was restrained, and midazolam was administered intravenously, followed by lo-razepam, but his condition did not improve. Etomidate and rocuronium were administered, the trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was begun, followed by sedation with pro-pofol. A urinary catheter and an esophagogastric tube were inserted. A chest radiograph showed low lung volumes and the correct placement of the endotracheal and gastric tubes; changes consistent with pulmonary edema or pneumothorax were not observed. A computed tomographic scan of the head, obtained without the administration of contrast material, showed no acute intracra-nial hemorrhage, infarction, or mass lesion. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 113 beats per minute, with inverted T waves in the inferior leads and nonspecific T-wave abnormalities in the lateral leads. Fomepizole, sodium thiosulfate, sodium bicarbonate, normal saline, and potassium chloride were administered intravenously, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. The pulse fell to 92 beats per minute, and 290 ml of urine was excreted. A diagnostic test result was received.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2018,30,nejm-case-2018-30,A 66-Year-Old Woman with Chronic Abdominal Pain,"Dr. Josephine Henderson-Frost (Medicine): A 66-year-old woman presented to a community health center affiliated with this hospital for an initial evaluation and to establish care with a primary care provider. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 5 months before presentation, when fevers and throbbing pain in the left ear and on the left side of the face developed. The pain radiated to the jaw and was associated with neck stiffness and tinnitus. She was evaluated by a physician in Guatemala, where she was living when the symptoms began. Computed tomography (CT) of the head reportedly revealed findings consistent with sinusitis and otitis media of the left ear. The fevers and neck stiffness resolved without specific treatment, but the ear and facial pain persisted and did not diminish with the use of acetaminophen. On presentation to the community health center, the patient reported an intentional weight loss of 7 kg during the 6 months before presentation, which she attributed to changes in her diet. She had no fever, night sweats, rash, chest pain, or shortness of breath. She had a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia. Dull, waxing and waning pain in the left side of the abdomen, which had begun after the birth of her youngest child, had not changed in location, quality, or intensity during the past 30 years. Two years before presentation to the community health center, episodes of epigastric pain had developed. The pain was burning in quality, radiated toward the chest, occurred most frequently after meals, and was associated with diarrhea. At that time, the patient was evaluated by a physician in Guatemala, and testing reportedly revealed Helicobacter pylori infection. She was not treated with antibiotic agents, but the epigastric pain diminished with the administration of intermittent proton-pump inhibitor therapy. Ten months before presentation to the community health center, the patient had been visiting New England and had presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation of epigastric pain. The epigastric pain was similar to previous episodes but did not diminish after 3 days of proton-pump inhibitor therapy. She reported no dark stools, fevers, chills, or sick contacts. On examination, the temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 134/74 mm Hg, the heart rate 72 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while she was breathing ambient air. The weight was 71.7 kg, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 32. The patient appeared to be well. The abdomen was tender on palpation of the epigastric area, without rebound or guarding. The bowel sounds were normal, and there was no palpable abdominal mass or hepatospleno-megaly. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Urinalysis, results of kidney-function tests, and blood levels of glucose, electrolytes, and lipase were normal; other laboratory tests results are shown in Table 1. Stool culture revealed normal enteric flora. Examination of the stool for H. pylori antigen was negative. The patient was referred to a primary care clinic in New England for further evaluation, but the abdominal pain resolved and she returned to Guatemala. On evaluation at the community health center, medications included alprazolam, aspirin, amiloride–hydrochlorothiazide, bisoprolol, and ciprofibrate. The patient was not taking any other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or herbal supplements. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She lived in a small, rural town in Guatemala. She often ate boiled fish, shrimp, and crayfish from the freshwater rivers around her home. She worked as a midwife and made frequent trips to New England to visit family. There was no family history of cancer or heart disease; several family members had been exposed to tuberculosis. On examination, the weight was 65.8 kg and the BMI 29. There was tenderness on palpation of the left temporomandibular joint, temporal region, and cheek. The left jaw clicked with opening. There was no cervical lymphadenopa-thy. There was a systolic crescendo–decrescendo murmur, grade 2/6, that was best heard at the right upper sternal border. The bowel sounds were normal, and the abdomen was soft, without distention, mass, tenderness, rebound, or guarding. The remainder of the examination was normal. The glycated hemoglobin level was 5.6% (reference range, 4.3 to 6.4), and a lipid panel was normal. Tests for hepatitis A virus IgM antibodies, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, hepatitis B virus surface antibodies, hepatitis B virus core antibodies, and hepatitis C virus antibodies were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Acetaminophen and jaw exercises with massage were recommended for the facial pain. The patient was referred for mammography and colonoscopy for age-appropriate cancer screening. Two days later, an interferon-γ release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was positive, and a chest radiograph was obtained. Dr. Kristine S. Burk: The chest radiograph showed normal mediastinal contours without evidence of lymphadenopathy or cardiomegaly, clear pleural spaces without evidence of an effusion, and clear lungs without evidence of opacities, apical scarring, or calcified granulomas. Dr. Henderson-Frost: One month after the initial visit, the patient returned to the community health center to discuss treatment options for latent tuberculosis infection. At that time, she reported a 2-month history of intermittent pain in the right upper and lower quadrants that had not been discussed at the previous visit. The physical examination was unchanged. CT of the abdomen was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2013,17,nejm-case-2013-17,A 56-Year-Old Woman with Poorly Controlled Diabetes Mellitus and Fatigue,"Dr. Harshabad Singh (Medicine): A 56-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus was admitted to this hospital because of hyperglycemia and chest pain. The patient had been well, with a history of diabetes mellitus for which she took oral medication, until the previous year when glucose levels became increasingly difficult to control. Approximately 6 months before this admission, vague symptoms developed, including nausea, metallic taste, headache, throat pain, chest discomfort, and “indigestion.” Omeprazole, lansoprazole, and antacids were administered, with partial relief. Three weeks before admission, she was seen in the clinic for evaluation of her symptoms. The weight was 74.4 kg and the lips were dry; the vital signs and the remainder of the examination were normal. The capillary blood glucose level was 314 mg per deciliter (17.4 mmol per liter); other results are shown in Table 1. The patient was referred to the diabetes clinic. On examination 3 days before admission, the blood pressure was 128/76 mm Hg, the pulse 100 beats per minute, the weight 73.8 kg, the height 174 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 24.4. The lungs were clear, there was trace edema of the legs, and pedal pulses were 2+ bilaterally. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed a moderately fatty liver, pancreatic atrophy, and a cyst in the right kidney. The administration of metoclopramide was begun for presumed dysmotility. On the day of admission, the patient came to the emergency department at this hospital because of persistent discomfort in the throat, chest, and epigastrium that increased when she was in a supine position, interrupted her sleep, and was associated with postprandial abdominal fullness and nausea. She reported generalized malaise for 1 week and a metallic taste in her mouth. She reported no chest pain on exertion and no dys-pnea, diaphoresis, light-headedness, palpitations, vomiting, diarrhea, melena, or blood in her stool. Approximately 3.5 years before this admission, a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type 2 had been made after polyuria and polydipsia had developed; metformin was administered. Glycated hemoglobin levels were 7.4% or lower when measured 1 year earlier; 4 months before admission, the level rose to 10.4% and glimepiride was added.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,07,nejm-case-2010-07,A 49-Year-Old Man with Peripheral Neuropathy and Ascites,"Dr. Caron A. Jacobson (Medical Oncology): A 49-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of ascites. The patient had been well until approximately 4 years earlier, when paresthesias of both feet, weakness of the lower legs, and bilateral foot drop developed gradually. Three years before admission, he saw a neurologist at another hospital. Laboratory-test results, including testing for autoantibodies, were reportedly normal. Electromyography (EMG) reportedly showed prolonged F responses in both feet, normal motor and sensory responses in the distal segments of the arms, and no motor responses in the intrinsic foot muscles. A diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) was made, and therapy with intravenous immune globulin was begun. Two and a half years before admission, the patient was referred to the neurology clinic of this hospital. On examination, the Romberg test was markedly abnormal; there was bilateral foot drop, and the patient was unable to walk on his toes or heels. He was able to sign his name but not without visual control. Strength (on a scale of 0 to 5, where 5 is normal) in the ankle dorsiflexors measured 1 to 2; in the muscles of ankle eversion and inversion, 4−; in the extensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum brevis, and toe flexors, 0; and in the plantar flexors, 4− to 4. The left hand was mildly weak, particularly the abductor pollicis brevis, and strength was normal in the proximal arms. Deep-tendon reflexes were absent. Perception of vibration was absent in both first toes, decreased in both ankles, and normal at the knees and fingers. Position sense was diminished in both first toes. There was no muscle atrophy or fasciculation, and the remainder of the neurologic examination was normal. As compared with the previous study, EMG and nerve-conduction studies showed decreased sensory responses, absent sural-nerve responses, prolonged F-wave latencies, and more prominent denerva-tion in the tibialis anterior and medial gastrocnemius muscles, features consistent with a demyelinating polyneuropathy. During the next 6 months, weakness in the patient’s legs and arms increased, and intermittent stabbing pain in the lower legs developed. Intravenous immune globulin was stopped, and the administration of azathioprine and gabapentin was begun. Two years before admission, the patient reported difficulty inhaling when he was supine, as well as discoloration of his feet. Tests of liver and renal function and measurements of serum electrolytes, thyrotropin, glycated hemoglobin, and homocysteine and urinary methylmalonic acid were normal. Tests for rheumatoid factor; anti-neuronal nuclear antibodies; antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi, gastric parietal cells, intrinsic factor, and myelin-associated glycoprotein; anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies; sulfatide autoantibod-ies; and GALOP (gait disturbance, autoantibody, late-age onset, and polyneuropathy) autoantibod-ies were negative, as was the co-GM1 triad antibody test (Athena Diagnostics), which tests for co-Asialo ganglioside antibodies, co-GD1b antibodies, and GM1 antibodies. Additional laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. EMG testing showed further decreases in evoked motor responses and absent sensory responses in the right median and ulnar nerves. Spirometry showed a maximal inspiratory pressure of 23 cm of water while the patient was supine (20% of predicted) and a maximal expiratory pressure of 98 cm of water (45% of predicted); lung volumes were normal. Plasmapheresis was begun. The patient’s respiratory function improved; he thought that the strength in his arms and legs had improved somewhat, but intermittent edema of the legs developed. Eight months before admission, he was admitted to the hospital because of coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteremia, which was treated with vancomycin; after treatment, he noted hearing loss and high-pitched tinnitus. Six months before admission, he began to have episodes of blurred vision, sometimes related to positional change, and intermittent peripheral-visual-field loss and scotoma. Approximately 2.5 months before admission, plasmapheresis was stopped and infusions of intravenous immune globulin were resumed. Leg edema and abdominal girth increased, associated with fatigue. Ophthalmo-logic and otolaryngologic examinations 2 months before admission revealed bilateral disk edema, enlarged blind spots, and sensorineural hearing loss. Six weeks before admission, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with magnetic resonance angiography revealed pachymeningeal enhancement along the calvaria and the falx cerebri, enhancement of the dura and multiple cranial nerves, and arachnoid granulation that narrowed the right transverse sinus. A lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was 120 mm of water; results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis are shown in Table 1. Leg edema and abdominal discomfort and swelling increased. Furosemide was administered, with no improvement. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen performed at another hospital reportedly showed ascites and iliac and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, with lymph nodes up to 1.7 cm in diameter. The patient was admitted to this hospital. The patient reported no neck, lower back, or joint pain or bladder or bowel symptoms. He had had erectile dysfunction for the past year, he had dyslipidemia and hypercholesterolemia controlled by diet, and he had had knee surgery in the past. He was allergic to penicillin and ondansetron. He lived with his wife and children, used leg braces and a walker to ambulate, and was a businessman. He drank alcohol rarely and did not smoke. There was no family history of diabetes, coagul-opathy, or hematologic, autoimmune, ophthalmo-logic, or neurologic diseases. Medications included azathioprine (250 mg per day), gabapentin, duloxetine, and hydrocodone–acetaminophen. On examination, the temperature was 36.3°C, the blood pressure 122/76 mm Hg, the pulse 72 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. There were crackles at the lung bases. Bowel sounds were present, and the abdomen was tense, distended, and nontender. There were contractures of the hands, 3+ pitting edema of the legs to the waist, and decreased strength in the arms and legs. Abdominal paracentesis was performed, 2 liters of ascitic fluid were removed, and abdominal discomfort decreased. Results of ascitic-fluid analysis are shown in Table 1. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed increased echogenicity of the liver, splenomegaly (span, 16.6 cm), and ascites; the portal and hepatic vasculature was patent. Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of more than 1.040, 1+ albumin, a total protein level of 320 mg per liter (reference range, 0 to 135), and a ratio of total protein to creatinine of 0.18; it was otherwise normal. Specimens from percutaneous, CT-guided fine-needle aspiration and core biopsy of a left retro-peritoneal lymph node were obtained. Pathological examination of the biopsy specimens showed reactive hyperplasia; no malignant cells were identified. Flow cytometry identified normal B-cell and T-cell populations. Analysis of urine (concentrated 50 times) revealed small amounts of kappa Bence Jones protein and trace amounts of albumin; there was no Bence Jones protein in the serum. During the next week, multiple therapeutic paracenteses were performed; no malignant cells were seen. Tests for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) were negative, and levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and folate were normal. Tests of renal function returned to normal. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis after the administration of contrast material revealed scattered nodules (2 to 3 mm in diameter) in both lungs, diffuse lymphadenopathy (including a ret-roperitoneal paraaortic mass, 2.2 cm by 2.1 cm), ascites, a small pericardial effusion, and bilateral pleural effusions. Examination of a bone marrow–biopsy specimen and aspirate showed normocellular marrow with trilineage hemato-poiesis; a stain for amyloid was negative. Immu-nohistochemical and flow-cytometric analyses showed no evidence of monoclonal B cells or plasma cells; the karyotype was normal. Congo red staining of a biopsy specimen of the abdominal fat pad was negative for amyloid. A radiographic skeletal survey showed lucency in the right tibial diaphysis. Azathioprine was discontinued, and the patient was discharged on the 11th day, returning for outpatient paracenteses one or two times weekly thereafter. Three weeks later, MRI of the right lower leg showed heterogeneity of the marrow and an enhancing focal lesion within the medullary cavity of the midtibial diaphysis (3.7 cm in length) that was hypointense on T1-weighted images and hy-perintense on T2-weighted images. A percutaneous, CT-guided biopsy showed bone with no evidence of a neoplastic process. Pathological examination of a biopsy specimen of the right antebrachial nerve revealed evidence of chronic demyelination and remyelination, with axonal degeneration affecting both myelinated and un-myelinated fibers. Eleven weeks after discharge, CT of the neck, chest, and abdomen, performed in conjunction with positron-emission tomography (PET), showed intense uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FFDG) in a lytic lesion (5.4 cm by 3.8 cm) in the sacrum that had sclerotic margins and central soft-tissue components. Lymphadenopathy and pulmonary nodules were unchanged from previous CT examinations and not associated with increased 18F-FDG uptake. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2009,31,nejm-case-2009-31,A 26-Year-Old Man with Abdominal Distention and Shock,"Dr. Jeffrey S. Ustin (Trauma, Emergency Surgery, and Surgical Critical Care): A 26-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal distention and shock. The patient had been well until the evening before admission, when mild abdominal pain developed, shortly after he had eaten five or six frankfurters. The pain gradually increased overnight, and nausea developed the next day. In the evening of the day of admission, his parents found him unresponsive, with coffee-grounds material emanating from his mouth. They called emergency medical services. On examination, he was obtunded, with agonal respirations. The trachea was intubated without medications, and supplemental oxygen was administered by means of an anesthesia bag attached to the endotracheal tube; the patient was transported to another hospital. On examination in the emergency department, the femoral pulse rate was 150 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute; the blood pressure could not be measured. Twenty-two minutes after arrival, during insertion of a central intravenous catheter, the patient became pulseless, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was begun. Within 12 minutes, the blood pressure was 87/70 mm Hg and compressions were stopped. Screening of the urine for toxins was negative. Laboratory-test results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. He began to awaken, and fentanyl and vecuronium were administered. A nasogastric tube was inserted, and brown material (200 to 300 ml) was aspirated. Levofloxacin and metronidazole were administered intravenously. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis reportedly showed markedly dilated loops of bowel, without free air or evidence of obstruction or volvulus, and CT scans of the chest and head were normal. Two hours 40 minutes after arrival, the patient was transferred to this hospital by helicopter. The blood pressure during transfer ranged between 79 and 116 mm Hg systolic and between 34 and 50 mm Hg diastolic, and the pulse was 125 beats per minute. Four intravenous catheters were in place. The patient arrived at this hospital 47 minutes later. The patient’s history was obtained from his family. The patient had had increas-ing abdominal distention during the past several weeks. He had not had diarrhea. One month before admission, at the time of his annual physical examination, mild lymphocytosis and throm-bocytopenia (platelet count, 123,000 per cubic millimeter) had been noted. Urinalysis had been normal. At follow-up testing performed 4 days before admission, the platelet count was 132,000 per cubic millimeter; the white-cell and differential counts were normal. A diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia was made at the age of 16 years. The patient had been poorly compliant with medications in the past and had been an inpatient at a psychiatric hospital for the past 3 years, staying at his parents’ home on the weekends, where he was when he became ill. He had had fractures of the fourth and fifth metacarpals of the right hand in fights several years earlier and had been bitten by a dog in the past. Medications included clozapine (550 mg), valproic acid (2250 mg), and glycopyrrolate (4 mg) orally at night. He had no known allergies to medications. He smoked cigarettes and drank alcohol and did not use illicit drugs. He was single, had completed the 11th grade, had worked outdoors in the past, and was currently unemployed. His brother also had schizophrenia. There was no family history of other mental illness, diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, coronary artery disease, hypertension, gastrointestinal disease, or nephrolithiasis. On examination, the patient was sedated, intubated, ventilated, and unresponsive to painful stimuli. The blood pressure was 57/41 mm Hg, the pulse 127 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing 100% oxygen. The pupils were round, 6 mm in diameter, and equal, and they reacted sluggishly to light, with an absence of corneal reflexes. The neck was supple, lung sounds were normal, and no cardiac murmurs were heard. The abdomen was rigid and distended, with tympany. The legs were cold and pale, but the skin was not mottled. The radial pulse was weakly palpable, and pedal or femoral pulses were absent. Laboratory-test results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. An electrocardiogram showed tachycardia (133 beats per minute) that was thought to be of sinus origin, right-axis deviation, and an intraventricular conduction defect. Intravenous fluids, norepineph-rine, and phenylephrine were administered; the blood pressure rose to 120/86 mm Hg. Vancomy-cin was added, and levofloxacin and metronida-zole were continued. Thirty minutes after the patient’s arrival at this hospital, a procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,31,nejm-case-2019-31,A 45-Year-Old Woman with Headache and Somnolence,"Dr. Elinor L. Baron: A 45-year-old woman with multiple sclerosis, seronegative inflammatory polyarthritis, and migraine was admitted to this hospital during the winter because of lethargy and decreased verbal output. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 13 days before this admission, when a severe headache developed. The pain began insidiously, was pounding in quality, and radiated from the occiput to the retro-orbital area and forehead. The onset of pain coincided with visual aura, including blurring of the peripheral vision and oscillating flashes of light. The headache was reminiscent of the patient’s previous migraine headaches, the last of which had occurred more than 10 years earlier; symptoms had typically abated with butalbital–acetaminophen– caffeine therapy. Five days later, and 8 days before this admission, symptoms worsened, and the patient sought care at the emergency department at another hospital. On arrival, she reported photophobia, nausea, and vomiting; she had no history of head injury, and she reported no neck pain, fever, chills, numbness, tingling, weakness, or dizziness. On examination, the temperature was 37.1°C, the pulse 101 beats per minute, the blood pressure 147/98 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared uncomfortable and was lying in bed in a dark room with her eyes covered. She was alert, oriented, and able to follow commands. Her neck was supple. Ptosis and miosis of the left eye were noted; the neurologic examination was otherwise normal. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, and blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and thyrotropin were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Computed tomography (CT) of the head showed no evidence of an acute intra-cranial process, and there was a finding suggestive of an inferior basal ganglia cyst that appeared unchanged from that seen on imaging that had been performed 5 years earlier. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance arteriography of the head and neck revealed stable, scattered demyelinating plaques; no active demyelinating lesions were seen, and there was no evidence of venous sinus thrombosis or cavernous sinus thrombosis. The patient received intravenous fluids, ondansetron, diphenhydramine, meto-clopramide, magnesium sulfate, and morphine, but the headache persisted. Intravenous hydro-morphone, ketorolac, and methylprednisolone were subsequently administered, which led to a moderate reduction in pain. The patient was discharged home and was instructed to take diclo-fenac and oral methylprednisolone for 5 days. One day after discharge, and 5 days before admission to this hospital, the headache and nausea recurred, along with intermittent episodes of vomiting. Four days before this admission, lethargy, disorientation, and decreased verbal output developed. The patient was able to follow commands, but verbal responses to questions were limited to “yes” and “no.” She had no fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, dizziness, loss of consciousness, convulsive movements, incontinence, facial droop, or slurred speech. The patient was taken by ambulance to the emergency department of the other hospital. On examination, the patient was alert but confused. The temperature was 37.3°C, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the blood pressure 160/110 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while she was breathing ambient air. She was able to follow commands, and the neurologic examination was unchanged from the previous examination. Levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests; a urine toxicology screen was positive for cannabinoids. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. CT of the head was unchanged from the CT performed 3 days earlier, and a chest radiograph was normal. Intravenous ketorolac, famotidine, and pantoprazole were administered, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. The next morning, a fever with a temperature of up to 38.0°C developed. Repeat MRI of the head revealed no notable change from the previous MRI. A lumbar puncture was performed; the opening pressure was 28 cm of water, and 6 ml of clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was removed. The results of the CSF analysis are shown in Table 1. Testing of the CSF for autoantibodies associated with autoimmune and paraneoplastic encephalopathy was performed. Specimens of blood, urine, and CSF were obtained for culture, and the patient received empirical intravenous acyclovir, vancomycin, and meropenem. That evening, nuchal rigidity was noted. During the next 3 days, the patient’s mental status waxed and waned but was persistently poor overall, and she had a fever with a temperature of up to 39.0°C. She was transferred to the neurology service of this hospital for further evaluation. On the patient’s admission to this hospital, her husband reported that her verbal output had increased since admission to the other hospital, such that responses to questions now included words and phrases. The patient had a history of multiple sclerosis, which had been stable for many years with treatment with rituximab. She had seronegative inflammatory polyarthritis with progressive symptoms, despite increased use of immunosuppressive therapies. She also had a history of hypertension, depression, anxiety, and melanoma. An episode of sinusitis had occurred 10 weeks before admission to this hospital and had resolved after the administration of doxycy-cline. She had undergone an extended carpal tunnel release of the right wrist and radical flexor tenosynovectomy for inflammatory flexor tenosynovitis. Medications before admission included rituximab, hydroxychloroquine (started 18 months before admission), leflunomide (started 11 months before admission), methylprednisolone (started 18 months before admission), butalbital– acetaminophen–caffeine combination tablets, diclofenac, hydrocodone–acetaminophen, inhaled albuterol, duloxetine, bupropion, quetiapine, trazo-done, lisinopril, nifedipine, cholecalciferol, and folic acid. She was allergic to penicillin, levo-floxacin, cephalosporins, and sulfonamide-containing medications. The patient was married and had three school-age children; she lived with her family in a suburban community in New England and spent summers on Cape Cod, in Massachusetts. She was receiving disability benefits and spent most of her time indoors. There was no recent history of travel. She had a healthy dog. She had smoked 10 cigarettes daily for 7 years and had quit 22 years before this admission. She drank alcoholic beverages in moderation and reported no use of illicit drugs. Her mother had had coronary artery disease, diabetes, and migraine; her father had had hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and multiple sclerosis. On examination, the temperature was 36.3°C, the pulse 90 beats per minute, the blood pressure 106/65 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was awake, alert, and oriented to her name. The sclerae and conjunctivae were clear, and the pupils were symmetric and reactive, with no afferent pupillary defect. Repetitive blinking and squinting in the left eye were noted, but there was no definite ptosis or facial droop. No oro-pharyngeal exudates were present, and there was no erythema. Mild resistance to neck flexion was noted. The lungs were clear. There were ulcers on the distal fingers, but no rashes were noted. Muscle tone and strength were normal, as was sensation to light touch. Reflexes were normal, and there was no startle myoclonus; a mild postural tremor was seen. The patient wrote “magical” when asked to write her name. She was able to follow simple, but not complex, commands. Laboratory testing revealed a blood sodium level of 133 mmol per liter (reference range, 135 to 145). The levels of other electrolytes, glucose, creatine kinase, and lactic acid were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. Blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen and antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2 were negative. Bacterial cultures of the blood, urine, and CSF that were obtained at the other hospital before the initiation of antibiotic agents were negative, as was testing of the CSF for autoanti-bodies. Dr. Karen A. Buch: On admission to this hospital, MRI of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed subtle leptomeningeal enhancement in the posterior fossa. T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging showed signal hyperintensity in the sulci of the temporal and occipital lobes, as well as signal hyperintensity in the right posterior periatrial region that corresponded with a punctate focus of restricted diffusion (Fig. 1). Dr. Baron: Empirical treatment with doxycycline was initiated, and the administration of intravenous acyclovir and meropenem was continued. A repeat lumbar puncture was performed, and the results of the CSF analysis are shown in Table 1. During the subsequent 2 days, the patient’s mental status remained poor. An electroencephalogram showed diffuse theta slowing in the background, with no epileptiform activity. The next day, a fever with a temperature of up to 38.6°C developed, along with loss of all verbal output and an inconsistent ability to follow commands. Dr. Buch: Follow-up MRI of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed the presence of new hydrocephalus, progressive and extensive lepto-meningeal enhancement, and abnormal enhancement in the choroid plexus and ependyma of the lateral ventricles. T2-weighted FLAIR imaging showed extensive periventricular signal hyperin-tensity throughout both cerebral hemispheres, in the dentate nuclei, and surrounding the fourth ventricle, as well as signal hyperintensity in the bilateral basal ganglia, bilateral hippocampi, splenium of the corpus callosum, and periven-tricular white matter that corresponded to areas of restricted diffusion (Fig. 2). A diagnostic test result was received. ","{'Noninfectious Causes of Acute Meningoencephalitis': ['Fungi', 'Bacteria', 'Viruses']}",Adenovirus meningoencephalitis. ,,Adenovirus meningoencephalitis. ,0
NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2011,06,nejm-case-2011-06,"A 77-Year-Old Man with Dyspnea, Weakness, and Diaphoresis","Dr. Gyanprakash A. Ketwaroo (Medicine): A 77-year-old man with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy was admitted to this hospital in midspring because of increasing dyspnea, weakness, and diaphoresis. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 3 days before admission, when weakness, loss of appetite, fatigue, and diarrhea developed, followed by progressive shortness of breath. On the morning of admission, he awoke with dys-pnea, which was worse when he was lying flat; he was unable to catch his breath or get out of bed. He was diaphoretic and felt nauseated and weak, with no chest pain, fever, or cough. The temperature was reportedly 37.8°C. His wife administered acetaminophen and called emergency medical services personnel. On their arrival, the patient’s skin was cool and pale, he spoke in sentences of three or four words, and he used accessory respiratory muscles. The blood pressure was 160/90 mm Hg, the pulse 96 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 40 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 90 to 91% while he was breathing ambient air. Basilar rales extended a third to half of the way up both lung fields, and the abdomen was distended. Oxygen (5 liters per minute) was administered by a nonrebreather mask, and oxygen saturation increased to 99%. He was taken to another hospital. On examination, the temperature was 37.2°C, the blood pressure 152/79 mm Hg, the pulse 93 beats per minute (irregularly irregular), the respiratory rate 24 to 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing supplemental oxygen through a nonrebreather mask. There were coarse rales bilaterally, the skin was cool and diaphoretic, and respiratory support with bilevel continuous positive airway pressure was added transiently on arrival, with symptomatic improvement. Electrocardiography revealed atrial fibrillation with intermittent pacing and bifascicular block, with ST-segment depression, T-wave inversion, and Q waves in leads V1 and V2, which were reportedly unchanged from 5 months before. A chest radiograph reportedly revealed mild pulmonary edema and moderate cardiomegaly. The serum levels of total bilirubin, creatine kinase MB isoenzymes, and troponin I were normal; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Nitroglycerin and furosemide were administered intravenously, and acetaminophen was given, as well as the patient’s usual doses of digoxin, ezetimibe, levothyroxine, lisinopril, sotalol, and acetylsalicylic acid. The systolic blood pressure decreased to below 100 mm Hg; the intravenous nitroglycerin was stopped, and sublingual and cutaneous nitrate preparations were administered thereafter. Approximately 6 hours after arrival, the patient was transferred by ambulance to this hospital. The patient had ischemic cardiomyopathy, which was associated with an anteroseptal myocardial infarction 30 years earlier. Two years before admission, echocardiography showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 23%. He had arrhythmias, including atrial flutter and ventricular tachycardia, for which an implantable cardioverter–defibrillator (ICD) had been placed. Nine months before admission, atrial fibrillation had developed and an ablation procedure was performed; sinus rhythm had predominated since then. The patient also had hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension, and he had had a transient ischemic attack, a stroke (suggestive of emboli) while he was receiving therapeutic anticoagulation, a di-verticular bleed 2 months before admission, and an appendectomy 3 months before admission. Other medications included fenofibrate and war-farin. He had no known allergies. He was retired, had returned from a prolonged wintertime trip to Florida 3 weeks before admission, and lived with his wife in a wooded suburban community in the Northeast, with no pets. The patient and his wife had traveled extensively through the United States but not internationally. He had stopped smoking 35 years earlier and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. His children were healthy, and he had no contact with sick persons. On examination, the patient was diaphoretic. The weight was 79.6 kg, the temperature 36.6°C, the blood pressure 90/54 mm Hg, the pulse 85 beats per minute (atrial fibrillation with paced beats), the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was breathing 40% oxygen by face mask. The jugular veins were distended to the angle of the jaw, the lung sounds were diminished and included faint bibasilar rales, and the remainder of the examination was normal. The level of digoxin was therapeutic, and the level of thyrotropin was normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Oxygen supplementation and additional furose-mide were administered. The urine output totaled 1975 ml that day, resulting in some improvement in the patient’s symptoms; he remained fatigued and dyspneic after minimal activity. During the night, tachypnea and diaphoresis recurred and were followed by short runs of ventricular tachycardia; magnesium sulfate was administered. Fourteen hours after admission, the patient was diaphoretic, with cool and clammy skin and increasing somnolence. The axillary temperature was 37.2°C, the blood pressure 133/77 mm Hg, the pulse 80 to 90 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 36 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing 40% oxygen by face mask. Breath sounds were coarse, with no rales or wheezing. Serum levels of total and direct bilirubin, total protein, albumin, cholesterol, low-density lipo-protein, amylase, and lipase were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed clear yellow urine, a pH of 5.5, a specific gravity of 1.015, 1+ ketones, 3+ blood, 2+ protein, and 5 to 10 red cells and 0 to 2 white cells per high-power field. A chest radiograph showed mild pulmonary venous hypertension, atelectasis in the base of the left lung, a small pleural effusion on the left side, and mild cardiomegaly. Two hours later, 16 hours after admission, a prolonged episode of ventricular tachycardia (190 beats per minute) was recorded on a monitor and converted to sinus rhythm by means of overdrive pacing. The patient was unresponsive; the blood pressure was 69/41 mm Hg and the oxygen saturation 87% while he was breathing 40% oxygen through a nonrebreather mask. The trachea was intubated, and intravenous fluids and vasopres-sors were administered. The patient was transferred to the coronary care unit. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 15%, with a diffusely hypoki-netic right ventricle and a right ventricular systolic pressure of 36 mm Hg, and no vegetations. Vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole were administered. An abdominal radiograph showed no evidence of bowel obstruction or perforation. Specimens of blood and sputum were cultured. That night, the temperature rose to 39.4°C. The next day, the results of a diagnostic test were received.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2023,32,nejm-case-2023-32,A 62-Year-Old Woman with Recurrent Hemorrhagic Pericardial Effusion,"Dr. Nilay K. Patel: A 62-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of recurrent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 months before the current admission, when pleuritic pain and tightness in her chest developed suddenly while she was eating. The chest pain persisted and began to radiate to the neck and back. The symptoms did not abate with aspirin or acetaminophen. Within an hour after symptom onset, she noticed that the pain worsened with exertion and when she was in the supine position; she was also unable to take a full breath and had dizziness with exertion. She presented to the emergency department of another hospital. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.5°C, the heart rate 104 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/91 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Except for the finding of tachycardia, the examination was reportedly normal. The prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, and blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the results of tests of liver and kidney function; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram (ECG) reportedly showed ST-segment elevation and T-wave inversion in the anterior and inferior leads. A chest radiograph reportedly showed a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette. Intravenous heparin was administered. Four hours later, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed according to a pulmonary embolism protocol, reportedly ruled out pulmonary embolism; it also revealed a moderate circumferential pericardial effusion with an attenuation level of 34 to 50 Hounsfield units, a mildly dilated ascending aorta (at a diameter of 37 mm; normal diameter, <36 mm on the basis of the patient’s sex and body-surface area), and a pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe that measured 4 mm in diameter. Intravenous heparin was stopped, and protamine sulfate was adminis-CME at NEJM.org tered. The patient was transferred to the emergency department of a second hospital 3 hours later. On arrival at the second hospital, the temporal temperature was 36.5°C, the heart rate 101 beats per minute, the blood pressure 108/75 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. Pulsus paradoxus measured 16 mm Hg. The jugular venous pressure was 12 cm of water. Auscultation revealed tachycardia and a pericardial friction rub. The remainder of the examination was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the level of troponin were normal. An ECG showed sinus tachycardia and right-axis deviation, with minor nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Dr. Daniela R. Crousillat: A transthoracic echo-cardiogram (TTE) showed a small-to-moderate circumferential pericardial effusion primarily abutting the right atrium and right ventricle with right atrial inversion and intermittent diastolic inversion of the right ventricle (Fig. 1A). There was increased respiratory variation in the mitral inflow velocities and a dilated inferior vena cava with reduced respirophasic collapse; both these features were suggestive of the presence of physiologic characteristics of early tamponade (Fig. 1B and Video 1). Colchicine and ibuprofen were administered, and the patient was admitted to the second hospital. Dr. Patel: The next morning, pericardiocente-sis was performed under fluoroscopic guidance with the use of a subxiphoid approach, and 200 ml of bloody fluid was drained; the intrapericardial pressure decreased from 12 mm Hg to 4 mm Hg. Analysis of the pericardial fluid revealed 4,700,000 erythrocytes per microliter and 12,010 nucleated cells per microliter, of which 78% were neutro-phils, 13% monocytes, 8% lymphocytes, and 1% eosinophils. Gram’s staining revealed neutro-phils and no organisms. The pericardial fluid albumin level was 3.0 g per deciliter, the total protein level 4.7 g per deciliter, the lactate dehy-drogenase level 614 U per liter, the glucose level 71 mg per deciliter (3.9 mmol per liter), and the amylase level 31 U per liter. Dr. Vinit Baliyan: On the second hospital day, a CT angiogram (CTA) of the chest showed a reduction in hemopericardium, and a pericardial drain was visible; there was no aortic dissection. There was an atrial septal occluder device in place that appeared to be in an appropriate position. The device appeared to be relatively large and abutted the aortic root anteriorly (Fig. 1C). However, there was no evidence of erosion of the device into the aortic wall (known as device erosion) or pseudoaneurysm formation (Fig. 1D). Dr. Patel: On the third hospital day, no pericar-dial effusion was detected on TTE. Cytologic analysis of the pericardial fluid revealed reactive mesothelial cells, neutrophils, histiocytes, and eosinophils, with no malignant cells. The patient was discharged home with prescriptions for colchicine and ibuprofen. Ten days after discharge from the second hospital, the patient had a follow-up visit with her cardiologist and reported that the chest pain and dyspnea had resolved. The heart rate was 94 beats per minute, the blood pressure 159/88 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was breathing ambient air; the remainder of the examination was normal. The antinuclear antibody titer was 1:160, with a homogeneous pattern, and a test for rheumatoid factor was negative. CT of the chest, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed small-volume pericardial effusion, mild bronchial wall thickening, and a 4-mm pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe. Colchicine treatment was stopped. Six weeks before the current admission, the patient called her primary care physician to report recurrent back pain and dyspnea that she noted were similar to her previous presentation; treatment with colchicine was resumed. During the next 12 days, sinus pressure, myalgias, nasal congestion, and cough productive of green sputum developed, and she was seen by her primary care physician. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.7°C, the heart rate 112 beats per minute, the blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 94% while she was breathing ambient air. The remainder of the examination was reportedly normal. A screening test for respiratory viruses was negative. A chest radiograph reportedly showed clear lungs. Doxy-cycline was prescribed. Four days before the current admission, the patient was evaluated by her cardiologist at this hospital and reported ongoing cough and dys-pnea. The heart rate was 87 beats per minute, and the blood pressure was 138/100 mm Hg. The remainder of the examination was normal. Dr. Crousillat: A TTE showed recurrence of a moderate pericardial effusion, measuring up to 14 mm in end diastole, that was adjacent to the right ventricular free wall. There was evidence of right ventricular diastolic inversion that was suggestive of the physiologic characteristics of tam-ponade (Fig. 2A and 2B). The patient was admitted to the cardiology floor of this hospital. Dr. Patel: On evaluation, the patient reported that she had had episodes of dyspnea and cough with sputum production and a decrease in exercise tolerance in the weeks before this admission. She had no known sick contacts. The patient’s medical history was notable for postoperative pulmonary embolism, hypertension, dyslipidemia, recurrent episodes of syncope with cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor responses on tilt testing, asthma, obstructive sleep ap-nea (for which she used a continuous positive airway pressure device), obesity, tubular adeno-mas (colonic polyps), hepatic steatosis, hiatal hernia, osteopenia, and cataracts. She also had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; on previous pulmonary-function testing, the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was 0.92 liters (39% of the predicted value), and the ratio of FEV1  to forced vital capacity was 47%. Five and a half years before the current admission, the patient had undergone laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and abdominoplasty that had resulted in postoperative hemorrhage; she had lost 44 kg of weight after the sleeve gastrectomy. Fourteen years before this admission, the patient had undergone percutaneous transcatheter closure of a fenestrated atrial septal defect (ASD) with an interatrial septal aneurysm and a right-to-left shunt that was possibly related to recurrent transient ischemic attacks; the procedure had been performed with a 30-mm Amplatzer septal occluder device. She had had mammography and cervical cancer screening within the 16 months before this admission. Medications included colchicine, apixaban, losartan, theophylline, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B12, a multivitamin, and inhaled tiotropium and mometasone–formoterol, as well as furose-mide and albuterol as needed. Topiramate had caused paresthesia. The patient lived in Massachusetts with her husband and was a business owner. She had a 40-pack-year history of cigarette smoking and had quit smoking 10 years earlier; she did not drink alcohol or use other substances. Her family history was notable for coronary artery disease in her mother and father, stroke in her maternal grandmother and paternal grandfather, and seizure in a nephew. The temporal temperature was 36.9°C, the heart rate 120 beats per minute, the blood pressure 126/81 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Pulsus paradoxus measured 10 mm Hg. The height was 163 cm and the weight 67 kg; the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.2. On examination, the jugular venous pressure was 10 cm of water. Auscultation revealed tachycardia, with no murmur or rub. The remainder of the examination was normal. The prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, and blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the results of tests of liver and kidney function; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An ECG showed irregular tachycardia of uncertain underlying rhythm, low voltage in the limb leads, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes, and a rightward axis. Diagnostic tests were performed, and management decisions were made.

The patient, who was of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, had no known family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Medical history included asthma and a fibro-adenoma in the left breast, for which she had undergone excisional biopsy 30 years earlier. Menarche had occurred at 12 years of age and menopause at 54 years of age; she had not received hormone-replacement therapy. Physical examination revealed a mass, measuring 3 cm in greatest dimension, in the left breast. No other masses or axillary lymph nodes were palpable. The patient underwent imaging studies in accordance with the American College of Radiology guidelines.1 Both breasts were imaged, since the patient’s last mammogram had been obtained 7 years earlier. Dr. Gary X. Wang: Mammography revealed an irregular mass with spiculated margins underlying the skin marker in the left breast, with imaging characteristics highly suggestive of cancer (Fig. 1A, 1B, and 1C).2 Subsequent ultrasound examination revealed a solid, irregular mass in the left breast that measured 3.1 cm by 1.5 cm by 1.2 cm (Fig. 1D) and normal left axillary lymph nodes. Tissue sampling with core-needle biopsy under ultrasonographic guidance was performed (Fig. 1E).

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2011,10,nejm-case-2011-10,"A Woman with Fever, Confusion, Liver Failure, Anemia, and Thrombocytopenia","Dr. Andrea L. Russo (Medicine): A 60-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of fever, confusion, liver failure, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The patient had been in her usual state of health, with a history of hepatitis C virus infection and cirrhosis, until 2 to 3 weeks before admission, when low-grade fevers developed and relatives noted she was acting strangely, with slurred speech and urinary incontinence. Approximately 3 days before admission, increasing confusion and diarrhea developed. The day before admission, emergency medical services were called, and she was taken to another hospital. On examination, she was restless and oriented to person and place; her speech was slurred and her verbal responses to questions were confused. The temperature was 38.2°C, the blood pressure 127/63 mm Hg, the pulse 125 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 25 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was breathing ambient air. The sclera were icteric; the abdomen was tender without rigidity, and bowel sounds were present; there were ecchymoses on her abdomen and legs, with trace edema of the legs. Asterixis was present; the remainder of the examination was reportedly normal. The level of d-dimer was 19.18 µg per milliliter (reference range, 0.0 to 0.49), and plasma levels of glucose, globulin, magnesium, and ammonia and tests of renal function were normal; other results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed cloudy urine with 2+ blood and 1+ protein; results were otherwise normal. Screening tests revealed immunity to hepatitis A and B viruses, the presence of cannabinoids in the urine, and occult blood in the stool. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia (121 beats per minute). Chest radiography showed elevation of the right hemidia-phragm and minimal atelectasis at the base of the right lung. Computed tomography (CT) of the head without the administration of contrast material showed postoperative changes in the left frontal lobe, which were consistent with the surgical evacuation of an intracranial hemorrhage in the past and were unchanged from the findings on a CT examination performed 2 years earlier, after a fall. An abdominal ultrasonographic examination showed sludge in the gallbladder and pericholecystic fluid, with no clear evidence of Murphy’s sign or hepatic or portal-vein thrombosis. Cultures of the blood were sterile. Ceftriaxone, vancomycin, rifaximin, vitamin K, lactulose, and pantoprazole were administered, and normal saline, platelets, packed red cells, and fresh frozen plasma were infused, with improvement in tests of coagulation. The patient became increasingly confused and agitated and was transferred to this hospital in the early hours of the next morning. A diagnosis of hepatitis C virus (HCV) (genotype 1a) infection had been made several years earlier; the level of RNA copies was 1,080,000 U per milliliter 17 months before admission. During the year before admission, imaging studies had revealed splenomegaly, normal liver echotex-ture with two hepatic hemangiomas, and no evidence of esophageal varices or hepatic or colonic cancer. The plasma level of γ-glutamyl transpep-tidase was 95 IU per liter (reference range, 0 to 60) and, with the results of tests of other serum biochemical markers (α2-macroglobulin, haptoglobin, apolipoprotein A-1, bilirubin, and alanine amino-transferase) (Table 1), was consistent with stage F4 cirrhosis and stage A3 severe necroinflammation (according to the results of analysis by means of HCV FibroSURE1). Treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin was begun 3 months before admission. One month later, the patient reported fatigue; laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Epoetin alfa (administered parenterally) was added. The patient had a history of depression and anxiety, intravenous drug abuse 30 years earlier, cocaine use, and alcohol abuse (until 9 years earlier). Other medications included fluoxetine, bu-propion, omeprazole, and antacids. She had no allergies. She was born in the United States and traveled to Europe and Central America more than 5 years earlier. She lived with her boyfriend and many dogs, birds, and cats, including strays; one cat had recently scratched her. Her mother had died at 88 years of age, with an unspecified blood disorder and stomach cancer; her father had died at 51 years of age from emphysema. Her son was healthy. On examination, the patient was agitated, disoriented, and incontinent of maroon stool; she followed commands minimally. The temperature was 39.8°C, the blood pressure 149/64 mm Hg, the pulse 126 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while she was breathing ambient air. The right pupil was approximately 4 mm in diameter and the left approximately 1 to 2 mm; both were minimally reactive to light and there was evidence of light sensitivity. There were petechiae on the tongue, active bowel sounds, voluntary abdominal guarding and tenderness with no palpable organomegaly, multiple ecchymoses (3 to 6 cm in diameter), and an ulceration on the right buttock. The remainder of the examination was normal. The level of factor V was 58% (reference range, 60 to 140), and the level of factor VIII 124% (reference range, 50 to 200). Hematologic indexes; levels of magnesium, total protein, globulin, and ammonia; and renal function were normal (other results are shown in Table 1). Urinalysis revealed amber, cloudy urine with a pH of 6.0; a specific gravity of 1.017; 3+ occult blood; 1+ bilirubin, uro-bilinogen, and albumin; trace ketones; and 50 to 100 white cells, more than 100 red cells, and a few squamous cells per high-power field. The patient’s agitation increased, and haloperi-dol was administered, without benefit. Four hours after her arrival, the trachea was intubated and the patient was sedated to protect the airway and so that the diagnostic evaluation could be completed. CT of the chest showed dependent opacities in both lower lobes, nodules in the posterior left upper lobe (6 to 7 mm in diameter) and right upper lobe (2 to 3 mm), enlarged mediastinal and right peridiaphragmatic lymph nodes, and a small left pleural effusion. CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed morphologic characteristics of the liver that were compatible with cirrhosis, without any focal lesions; splenomegaly (16.8-cm span; upper limit of the normal range, 13 cm); perigastric varices; mild pelvic ascites; prominent periportal lymph nodes; and a 5.2-cm hematoma within the sheath of the right rectus muscle. Six hours after arrival, the temperature rose to 40.9°C. External cooling was begun, and amoxicillin and acyclovir were added. Repeat chest radiography showed evidence of mild pulmonary edema and persistent air-space opacities in the left lower lung. Additional units of fresh frozen plasma, platelets, and red cells were transfused, and interferon and riba-virin were discontinued. On the second day, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed postsurgical changes and no acute process. Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed morphologic characteristics of the liver that were compatible with cirrhosis, patent hepatic vasculature, and splenomegaly (19.5 cm in the craniocaudal dimension), with no evidence of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis. A lumbar punc-ture was performed; analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed clear, colorless fluid with a glucose concentration of 37 mg per deciliter (2.1 mmol per liter) (reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]), protein 33 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55), 3 white cells per cubic millimeter (reference range, 0 to 5) in both tube 1 (100% monocytes) and tube 4 (40% lymphocytes, 40% neutrophils, and 20% mono-cytes) and 76 red cells and 313 red cells per cubic millimeter (reference value, 0) in tubes 1 and 4, respectively. Cytologic examination of the cere-brospinal fluid showed no malignant cells. During the first 3 days of hospitalization, extensive testing of the blood, urine, sputum, nares, stool, and cerebrospinal fluid was performed. Evidence of past exposure to the Epstein–Barr and varicella–zoster viruses was detected, and test results were negative for syphilis, bartonella species, mycobacteria, legionella, Borrelia burgdorferi, babe-sia, toxoplasma, cryptococcus, pneumocystis, herpes simplex virus, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), parvovirus, respiratory viruses, cyto-megalovirus, other bacteria, stool pathogens, and urinary histoplasma antigen. The serum level of complement C3 was 46 mg per deciliter (reference range, 86 to 184) and the level of complement C4 was 11 mg per deciliter (reference range, 16 to 38). A test for antinuclear antibodies was positive, at 1:40 and 1:160 in a speckled pattern, and a test for antibodies to smooth muscle was positive, at 1:40 (reference value, negative at 1:20). Test results were negative for rheumatoid factor; antibodies to double-stranded DNA; the SSA (Ro), SSB (La), Sm, RNP, and Scl-70 antigens; anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide IgG antibodies; and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Other results are shown in Table 1. During the second and third days, the patient’s temperature rose to 38.0°C or higher. On the third day, acyclovir was continued and doxycycline begun; other antimicrobial agents were discontinued. Testing of the buttock lesion showed no evidence of herpes simplex virus or varicella–zoster virus. Other test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,27,nejm-case-2019-27,A 16-Year-Old Girl with Head Trauma during a Sailboat Race,"Dr. Hung M. Le (Pediatrics): A 16-year-old girl was seen in the sports concussion clinic at this hospital because of headache, dizziness, balance problems, fatigue, irritability, and difficulties with sleep and concentration after she had head trauma during a sailboat race. The patient had been well until 11 days before this evaluation, when she was racing in a regatta and was struck in the head by the boom of another team’s boat. On collision, her team’s boat capsized. The patient was reportedly dazed and confused, but she was assisted back into the boat by her teammates and they continued to sail. Shortly thereafter, the weather became windy and the patient and her teammates were again knocked out of the boat. The patient reportedly lost consciousness for several minutes; it was suspected but not confirmed that she had been hit by the boom of her team’s boat. She was rescued and brought to shore. On arrival of emergency medical services personnel, she was awake and talking but confused. She was transported by ambulance to the emergency department at another hospital. During the ambulance ride, she was agitated and resisted care. In the emergency department, the patient reported that she felt confused, dizzy, and unsteady and had a headache. The results of a neurologic examination and an examination of the neck were reportedly normal, as were radiographs of the cervical spine. Rest and observation were recommended, and the patient was discharged home in the care of her parents. Eleven days later, the patient was seen in the sports concussion clinic at this hospital. She did not remember the sailing accident or the subsequent ambulance ride. Since discharge, she had been resting at home with limited activity and stimulation. She had occasional frontotemporal headaches with sharp pain, which she rated at 3 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. She also reported dizziness, balance problems, fatigue, and difficulty sleeping. The patient noted that she had had difficulty concentrating on her summer reading assignment and could not read a full page without losing focus, although she could read less challenging material for 15-to-20-minute intervals. Reading precipitated headaches. She reported that she felt irritable and impatient with having to stay home and that her symptoms decreased with activity. The patient had a history of several sports-related injuries. When she was 13 years of age, she had a concussion without loss of consciousness after being hit in the head with a paddle-board. After that injury, she was dizzy for several days and had headaches for 3 months. The patient took no medications and had no known allergies. She lived with her parents and brother in a suburban area of New England and was an excellent student. Her brother had attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). There was no family history of headaches, learning disabilities, depression, anxiety, or seizure disorders. On examination, the patient was alert and answered questions appropriately. On a mental-status examination, orientation, immediate and delayed recall, attention, and language were intact. The neck was not tender and had a full range of motion. Cranial nerves II through XII were normal, and there was no nystagmus. Photo-phobia was present, and there was pain with upward gaze; the near point of convergence was 15 cm. Both nodding and side-to-side movements of the head caused dizziness. On a Romberg test, the patient swayed mildly when she stood with her feet together and eyes closed. There were mild difficulties with double-leg, single-leg, and tandem stance on a hard surface. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. A diagnosis and management decisions were made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2009,27,nejm-case-2009-27,"A 56-Year-Old Woman with Fever, Rash, and Lymphadenopathy","Dr. David T. Ting (Medical Oncology): A 56-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy. She had been well until 11 weeks earlier when, while residing in Florida, a pustule on the right hand developed shortly after a fire-ant sting. Four hours later, rigors and fever, with temperatures as high as 38.9°C, developed. The next day, an erythematous, pruritic rash appeared on the upper left arm, and she went to the emergency department of another hospital. Analysis of the urine reportedly suggested an infection, and levofloxacin was administered. During the next 3 days, the rash spread to the buttocks and legs. Levofloxacin was stopped and oral corticosteroid therapy, tapered over a period of 4 weeks, was prescribed. Within 5 days after beginning prednisone, all symptoms resolved. She saw an allergist, who performed serum protein electrophoresis, radioallergosorbent testing, and testing for systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and serum levels of IgE and C-reactive protein. All test results were reportedly normal. Approximately 6 weeks before admission, the patient noticed slightly enlarged, nontender lymph nodes in the neck and axillae. Two weeks before admission, examination by a physician in Florida revealed lymphadenopathy in the cervical, posterior auricular, and axillary regions and splenomegaly. A chest radiograph was normal, and ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed mild splenomegaly. Ser-ologic testing for Lyme disease was reported to be positive, and doxycycline was begun, but gastrointestinal symptoms developed, and the medication was stopped after 7 days. Eleven days before admission, a rash and diffuse pruritus developed, with low-grade fever and mild nocturnal diaphoresis. Four days later, the temperature rose to 40.0°C, with rigors and drenching night sweats. The next day, she returned to her home in Massachusetts. Four days before admission, the patient saw her primary care physician. The temperature was 39.4°C; other vital signs were normal. There was a diffuse ery-thematous rash, and palpable lymph nodes in the posterior auricular, anterior cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, and inguinal regions were mobile, nontender, and up to 1.5 cm in diameter. A short systolic ejection murmur was heard. The spleen was palpable 4 to 5 cm below the costal margin and was tender; the remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis after the administration of contrast material showed generalized lymph-node enlargement, up to 2.8 cm in diameter, and mild splenomegaly. An excisional biopsy of a left occipital lymph node (<1 cm in diameter) was performed. Pathological examination revealed changes thought to suggest der-matopathic lymphadenitis. Results of testing for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and parvovirus B19 antibodies were suggestive of past infection, and the level of angiotensin-converting enzyme was normal. Tests for malaria, toxoplasma, syphilis, and hepatitis viruses (A, B, and C) were negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Specimens of blood were cultured and were sterile. Indomethacin was prescribed for fever. Two days later, she was admitted to this hospital. The patient had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, rosacea, and recurrent herpes simplex virus infection. She had worked in a professional occupation and was currently a homemaker; she lived with her husband, mother, and a pet dog. She moved seasonally between Massachusetts and Florida and had no recent international travel or exposure to ill persons. Before this illness, she had been physically active. She consumed two or three alcoholic beverages per week; she did not smoke or use illicit drugs and had no known allergies. Medications included diphenhydramine, indomethacin, omeprazole, and vitamin supplements. Her mother had had lung cancer, her maternal grandfather had died of pancreatic cancer, and her father had died of Parkinson’s disease; her daughter and a half-brother were healthy. On examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable, scratching her skin. The temperature was 38.1°C, the blood pressure 101/64 mm Hg, the pulse 123 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while she was breathing ambient air. There was a diffuse maculopapular rash and numerous nontender lymph nodes in the cervical, postauricular, and axillary regions. The abdomen was soft, and the spleen tip was palpable 2 cm below the left costal margin; the remainder of the examination was normal. During the next 4 days, pain in the throat, cough, and diarrhea developed. The pharynx appeared slightly erythematous, but the examina-tion was otherwise unchanged. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus, bartonella species infection, EBV DNA, and pharyngeal group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus were negative, as was a tuberculin skin test. Other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Cultures of blood were sterile. Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed splenomegaly and enlarged peripancreatic and periportal lymph nodes. Transthoracic echocar-diography revealed no valvular vegetations. On the sixth day, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were performed. Examination of the aspirate and biopsy specimen showed trilineage hematopoiesis, with myeloid hyperplasia and no malignant cells. Flow-cytometric analysis showed no monoclonal B-cell or abnormal T-cell populations; the karyotype was normal. Other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. The maximum temperature was 39.2°C. Cultures of the blood remained sterile. Acetaminophen, meperi-dine, and hydroxyzine were administered for fever, rigors, and pruritus. On the eighth day, excisional biopsy of a right cervical lymph node (2.2 cm in diameter) was performed. Pathological examination revealed follicular hyperplasia and focal paracortical expansion, with vascular proliferation and a poly-morphous population of small lymphocytes, im-munoblasts, plasma cells, and eosinophils. Im-munophenotyping studies showed T cells and polyclonal B cells, with no evidence of EBV infection. The differential diagnosis included an atypical reactive process and a T-cell lymphoma. Results of analysis of the T-cell receptor and immunoglobulin genes by molecular genetic techniques and results of cytogenetic analysis were pending. Prednisone (60 mg daily) was begun. The rash, fevers, and rigors resolved within 48 hours. The patient was discharged on the 13th day. During the next 3 weeks, fevers and rigors returned, with temperatures up to 39.4°C. An 18F-fluorode-oxyglucose positron-emission tomographic (FDG PET) scan showed extensive FDG-avid lymphade-nopathy in the cervical, axillary, mediastinal, hilar, retroperitoneal, and inguinal chains bilaterally. The spleen was markedly enlarged and FDG-avid. Testing for Lyme disease, cytomegalo-virus (CMV), histoplasma, and cryptococcus were negative; other results are shown in Table 1. Twenty-three days after discharge from the hospital, a diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2014,29,nejm-case-2014-29,A 60-Year-Old Woman with Syncope,"Dr. David Curley (Emergency Medicine): A 60-year-old woman was seen in the emergency department at this hospital after a syncopal episode. The patient had been well until the day of admission, when light-headedness and dyspnea suddenly developed while she was walking with her husband. The dys-pnea improved rapidly with rest, but when she attempted to walk again, she lost consciousness and was lowered to the ground by her husband. She rapidly regained consciousness, and her husband called emergency medical services. On evaluation by paramedical personnel, the oxygen saturation was 71% while she was breathing ambient air and increased to 99% while she was breathing oxygen through a non-rebreather face mask. She was brought to the emergency department at this hospital by ambulance. On evaluation, the patient reported feeling well, with no shortness of breath, chest pain, light-headedness, dizziness, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; she had had no similar episodes in the past. She reported having a transient episode of cramping in the left calf on the morning of admission that had resolved spontaneously. She had no other notable information in her medical history. She took no medications and had no known allergies. She lived with her husband, had no children, and was a retired health care worker. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She had traveled approximately 2 weeks earlier by airplane for 4 hours. Her father had died of a stroke at the age of 58 years, and her mother had hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure. There was no other family history of thrombotic or bleeding events or sudden death. On examination, the patient appeared well and was not in distress. The blood pressure was 121/81 mm Hg, the pulse 77 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 88% while she was breathing ambient air and 98% while she was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute; the temperature was normal. The weight was 104.6 kg, and the abdomen was obese; the remainder of the examination was normal. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, at a rate of 74 beats per minute, as well as incomplete right bundle-branch block, diffuse submillimeter ST-segment depressions, and T-wave inversions. The platelet count was 120,000 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000), the blood level of carbon dioxide was 20.9 mmol per liter (reference range, 23.0 to 31.9), and the level of d-dimer was greater than 10,000 ng per milliliter (reference value, <500). The he-matocrit, hemoglobin level, total white-cell count, anion gap, and results of tests of coagulation and renal function were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, phosphorus, magnesium, other electrolytes, calcium, troponin T, and N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,26,nejm-case-2019-26,A 27-Year-Old Woman with Opioid Use Disorder and Suicidal Ideation,"Dr. Andrew Cruz (Psychiatry): A 27-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of a suicide attempt. Approximately 3 months before admission, the patient became homeless and was staying intermittently with friends. Two months before admission, she began to ingest clonazepam daily, and 3 weeks before admission, she began to use intranasal heroin daily. She had depression and anxiety, and 2 days before admission, she expressed that she felt “tired of living this life” and wanted “to end it all.” On the evening of presentation, the patient reportedly smashed her cell phone on the ground and ate the glass shards as a suicide attempt. Nausea and diffuse abdominal discomfort developed, and she reportedly had an episode vomiting, with the vomit containing 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of blood. Three hours after the ingestion, she presented to the emergency department of this hospital with throat, chest, and abdominal pain. She reported that she had “regret” about the ingestion and wanted “help” with her substance use and suicidality. The patient reported past sexual trauma but did not provide details; she did not report any previous suicide attempts, homicidal ideation, or hallucinations. A limited review of systems was notable for anorexia, diaphoresis, diarrhea, impaired sleep, fatigue, mood lability, nightmares, and flashbacks. Her psychiatric history included polysubstance use disorder (with the use of intravenous heroin, fentanyl, benzodiazepines, and cocaine), cutting behavior during adolescence, and anxiety and depression. She had never undergone psychiatric treatment or hospitalization. Her medical history included hepatitis C virus infection, obesity, genital herpes simplex virus infection, and a low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion of the cervix; in addition, a motor vehicle collision had led to open reduction and internal fixation involving the left arm. She took no medications and had no known adverse reactions to medications. She worked in a local store and had a small child. She had smoked one and a half packs of cigarettes daily for the past 10 years and was a current smoker. She drank 1 pint of vodka daily and reported no history of withdrawals or blackouts. Multiple relatives, including both of her parents, had a history of substance use disorder. On examination, the temperature was 36.8°C, the pulse 70 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared disheveled, tearful, and anxious. Abdominal examination revealed mild tenderness on the right side on palpation. On examination by a psychiatrist, she had limited eye contact and mumbling speech, along with poor concentration, depressed mood with a congruent affect, and poor insight and judgment. The complete blood count and levels of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, lactate, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and albumin were normal; the aspartate aminotransferase level was 162 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 32), and the alanine aminotransferase level was 52 U per liter (reference range, 7 to 33). Ethanol was not detected in the blood, and human chorionic gonado-tropin was not detected in the urine. A urine toxicology screen was positive for opioids and cocaine metabolites. The findings on an electrocardiogram were normal and unchanged from a tracing obtained 10 years earlier. Dr. Efren J. Flores: The results of radiography of the neck, chest, and abdomen were normal, without a visible radiopaque foreign body. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material (Fig. 1), revealed gallbladder wall thickening and trace perihepatic fluid. These findings can be seen in patients with acute hepatitis. There was no evidence of pneumo-peritoneum or of a radiopaque foreign body. Dr. Cruz: Intravenous normal saline, morphine sulfate, and piperacillin–tazobactam were administered. The patient was evaluated by the surgery and psychiatry services. Because of concern about the patient’s risk of self-harm, an order that authorized temporary involuntary hospitalization was implemented. The next evening, the patient reported that while she was trying to get out of a stretcher, she “heard a pop” in her right elbow, which was accompanied by immediate pain without any numbness or tingling. On examination by an orthopedic surgeon, the olecranon process appeared to protrude posteriorly and medially without ecchy-mosis. The patient was not able to move the arm at the elbow, although range of motion was intact at the shoulder and wrist. Dr. Flores: A lateral image of the right elbow (Fig. 2A) showed posterior dislocation of the elbow with impaction of the olecranon process of the ulna into the distal humerus outside the olecranon fossa. An anteroposterior image of the right elbow (Fig. 2B) confirmed dislocation of the elbow with malalignment of the ulnotroch-lear and radiocapitellar joints. Dr. Cruz: After the administration of acetaminophen, ibuprofen, oxycodone, and intravenous morphine, the elbow was manually reduced and a splint was applied. Additional radiographic images were obtained. Dr. Flores: Lateral and anteroposterior images of the right elbow obtained after closed reduction and splinting (Fig. 2C and 2D) showed normal alignment of the ulnotrochlear and radio-capitellar joints. Dr. Cruz: During the next 18 hours, the patient remained under observation, with a plan for transfer to an inpatient psychiatric hospital for ongoing care. One hour before transfer, the patient went to the bathroom without her observer and then reported that she could not move her right arm. Dr. Flores: A lateral image of the right elbow showed that the splint was in place and showed posterior dislocation of the elbow with impaction of the olecranon process of the ulna into the distal humerus outside the olecranon fossa. An anteroposterior image of the right elbow confirmed dislocation of the elbow with predominant involvement of the radiocapitellar joint. There was irregularity of the radial head and lateral humeral epicondyle that was consistent with a nondisplaced fracture. Dr. Cruz: Intravenous morphine was administered. The elbow was again reduced, and a circumferential fiberglass cast was placed. Dr. Flores: A lateral image of the right elbow obtained after the second closed reduction and casting showed normal alignment and the presence of a cast. Dr. Cruz: The next afternoon, after the plan for transfer to a psychiatric hospital was shared with the patient, she was found in the bathroom without her observer, where she was banging her left ",{},Severe opioid use disorder and malingering (deception syndrome). ,Opioid use disorder and malingering. ,Opioid use disorder and malingering. ,0
NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2009,26,nejm-case-2009-26,A 34-Year-Old Man with Cystic Fibrosis with Abdominal Pain and Distention,"Dr. David M. Dudzinski (Medicine): Fever and abdominal pain and distention developed in a 34-year-old man with cystic fibrosis during an admission to this hospital for pulmonary care. The patient was awaiting lung transplantation for end-stage lung disease due to cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis had been diagnosed at birth, and he was homozygous for the F508 mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR). He had been hospitalized at least annually for complications of the disease, most recently 1 year earlier because of pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. His daily pulmonary care included albuterol and hypertonic saline by nebulizer, followed sequentially by physical therapy with the vest system of high-frequency chest-wall oscillation and colis-tin by nebulizer. Other medications included trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole twice daily; during the 2 months before admission, ciprofloxacin and tobramycin aerosol treatments were administered because of worsening cough, declining pulmonary function, and sputum cultures that were positive for P. aeruginosa. Three days before admission, the patient was seen in the pulmonary clinic of this hospital. He reported persistent cough, increased dyspnea, and moderate sputum production. On examination, he appeared dyspneic, and inspiratory crackles were heard in both upper lobes. Oxygen saturation was 93% while he was breathing ambient air. Measurement of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was 0.74 liter (21% of the predicted value). A specimen of sputum was obtained, which grew P. aeruginosa, with intermediate resistance to fluoroquinolones; it was susceptible to cefepime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, gentamicin, and piperacillin–tazobactam. He was admitted to the hospital for pulmonary care and additional antibiotic therapy. An operation had been performed on the bowel when the patient was an infant. He had insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and osteoporosis. Approximately 3.5 years before admission, during evaluation for lung transplantation, mild elevations in serum aminotransferase levels were noted. Pathological examination of a biopsy specimen of the liver revealed biliary scarring and inflammation, mild fibrosis without cirrhosis, and mild-to-moderate steatosis. Nineteen months before admission, the distal intestinal obstruction syndrome was treated with intravenous fluids and oral polyethylene glycol at another hospital. He also had psoriasis, poor dentition, and a past traumatic wrist fracture. He had no known allergies. He was single and lived with his father and stepmother, who owned a bird and fish. He worked in the food industry, drank alcohol rarely, and had smoked briefly more than 15 years earlier; he did not use illicit drugs. He had no exposure to tuberculosis or sick persons and had not traveled recently. There was no family history of cystic fibrosis, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, or cancer. His mother had reportedly died at a young age from an unknown cause. Medications on admission included hypertonic saline by nebulizer, ur-sodiol, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, pancre-lipase, neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin with meals and lispro human analogue insulin as needed, alendronate weekly, and vitamins. On examination, the patient appeared relatively well nourished but was thin and weighed 54.2 kg. He was able to converse without dyspnea or tach-ypnea. The blood pressure was 138/57 mm Hg, the pulse 73 beats per minute, the temperature 36.2°C, and the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute; oxygen saturation was 91% while he was breathing ambient air and 97% while he was breathing 2 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula. Excursion of the chest was symmetrical and measured 2 to 3 cm; breath sounds were coarse bilaterally, with inspiratory crackles at the left middle and upper posterior lung fields, the right upper posterior lung field, and the bilateral upper anterior lung fields. The abdomen was soft, with no tenderness or distention. Bowel sounds were present. There was a transverse, healed surgical scar, 15 cm in length, on the abdomen, and the liver edge was palpated 1 cm below the costal margin; there was no tenderness or rebound. There was clubbing of the fingers and toes; the remainder of the examination was normal. The prothrombin time was 16.9 seconds (reference range, 11.1 to 13.6); measurement of other tests of coagulation and plasma levels of bilirubin, total protein, albumin, globulin, magnesium, amylase, and lactic dehydrogenase were normal; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph showed hyperexpanded lungs and architectural distortion consistent with cystic fibrosis; the findings were unchanged as compared with previous studies. A percutaneous central venous catheter was placed and its position confirmed by chest radiography. Tobramycin, ceftazidime, and trimetho-prim–sulfamethoxazole were administered. On the second hospital day, a sputum culture grew P. aeruginosa, two types of candida, and one colony of Aspergillus fumigatus. On the afternoon of the fifth hospital day, the temperature rose to 38.7°C; the pulmonary and abdominal examinations were unchanged. Specimens of blood, sputum, and urine were cultured. A chest radiograph showed a catheter extending from the right arm with the tip projecting over the right shoulder and was otherwise unchanged. Acetaminophen was administered, and the antibiotics were continued. The next morning, the temperature was 36.8°C, and it rose to 38.7°C later that day. Cough was productive of green sputum with brown flecks. Inspiratory rhonchi were present at the left base and both apexes, and crackles were heard at the apex. Bowel sounds were normal, and there was no abdominal pain, tenderness, or distention. Cultures of the blood and urine remained sterile, and the sputum was unchanged. The intravenous catheter was removed, and the catheter tip was cultured. Administration of van-comycin was begun. On the eighth hospital day, the temperature rose to 39.1°C and nausea with vomiting developed. On examination, the blood pressure was 99/52 mm Hg, the pulse 117 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 90% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient appeared comfortable. There were crackles in the upper lung fields, with occasional wheezes. Bowel sounds were normal; the right upper quadrant was tender, without distention or rebound. Results of laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Ceftazidime was stopped and cefepime was begun. On the ninth hospital day, vomiting increased in frequency, without anorexia or diarrhea. The systolic blood pressure was 70 to 80 mm Hg. Bowel sounds were decreased, and the abdomen was slightly distended, with diffuse tenderness and rebound tenderness. Tobramycin was discontinued, and metronidazole and intravenous fluids were administered. Oral intake was stopped. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1; results of other tests were pending. A chest radiograph was unchanged, and radiographs of the abdomen revealed nondilated loops of small and large bowel, without free air or obstruction. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed mild bron-chiectatic changes in both lung bases, and tree-in-bud opacities in the right lung base were thought to represent bronchiolitis. CT of the abdomen after the administration of oral contrast material revealed marked thickening of the wall of the entire colon that extended into the distal small bowel; material within the small bowel was suggestive of fecal contents. Prominent mesenteric stranding and moderate ascites were present, without pneu-matosis or free air. The liver had a nodular contour consistent with cirrhosis, and there was fatty replacement of the pancreas; the ureters and bladder were normal. During the next 12 hours after the CT scanning, the patient’s discomfort increased and the abdomen became massively distended. On the 10th hospital day, a procedure was performed, and additional test results were received.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,01,nejm-case-2012-01,An 82-Year-Old Man with Persistent Ulcers on the Hands,"Dr. Sarah Gee (Dermatology): An 82-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of persistent skin lesions on the hands. The patient had a history of diabetes mellitus and recurrent hidradenitis sup-purativa. Five weeks before admission, he was admitted to another hospital because of drainage from a perineal abscess that was unresponsive to cephalexin. On examination, he reportedly had a small abrasion on his left hand, which he thought was caused by a dog bite. The administration of cephalexin was discontinued, and piperacillin–tazobactam and vancomycin were begun. During the following week, increasing erythema and an enlarging hemorrhagic bulla developed on the dorsum of the left hand and a diffuse, urticarial, and purpuric rash developed on the torso. Laboratory testing reportedly revealed thrombocytopenia. Débridement of the lesion of the left hand was performed; pathological examination of a specimen reportedly showed acute inflammation and granulation tissue. After débridement, the lesion worsened and similar lesions developed on the right hand, on the meta-carpophalangeal joints. The lesions were reportedly painful to the touch and to manipulation, with ulceration extending to the tendons. Glucocorticoids were administered. On the 10th hospital day, a biopsy specimen of the skin of the right abdomen was obtained; pathological examination reportedly showed leukocytoclas-tic vasculitis and no microorganisms. The administration of piperacillin–tazobactam and vancomycin was stopped, as was subcutaneous heparin (begun during admission), and ciprofloxacin and linezolid were begun, in conjunction with a topical antimicrobial solution for the hands. The lesions expanded to include the proximal interpha-langeal joints and became more erosive and painful. On the 13th day, the patient was transferred to a second hospital for evaluation and management of the skin lesions. At the second hospital, the patient reported weight loss of approximately 2.3 kg per week during the previous month and intermittent diarrhea. On examination, the temperature was normal. On the dorsal surfaces of the hands were well-demarcated, edematous, friable, erythematous-to-violaceous plaques, with gray discoloration at the margins (Fig. 1A). Smaller violaceous, erythematous, edematous plaques were present on the trunk and thighs. A biopsy specimen of the skin on the dorsum of the right hand was obtained; pathological examination revealed a superficial and deep, dense, diffuse neutrophilic infiltrate. Staining for microorganisms was negative, and cultures were sterile. The serum level of sodium was 130 mmol per liter (reference range, 135 to 145), and levels of the other electrolytes were normal. Tests of liver function were normal, and testing for antibodies to the platelet factor 4–heparin complex was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. The administration of antibiotics was stopped, higher-dose systemic glucocorticoids were begun, and local wound care was performed, with partial improvement. The patient was discharged home on the fifth day, taking prednisone (70 mg orally daily) with instructions to initiate a taper in 2 to 3 weeks. He also was prescribed an intensive wound-care regimen, with the assistance of a home nurse. Shortly after discharge, the prednisone dose was tapered from 70 mg daily to 40 mg daily, the administration of cyclosporine (300 mg daily) was begun, and intralesional triamcinolone acetonide (to a total of 60 mg daily) was injected. Six days before admission to this hospital, a biopsy specimen of the skin on the dorsum of the right hand was obtained; pathological examination reportedly revealed neutrophilic dermatitis, with a suggestion of follicular perforation and folliculitis; no microorganisms were seen. The next day, levels of serum electrolytes, total bilirubin, total protein, globulin, and calcium were normal, as were tests of liver function; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Three days later, the lesions seemed improved; the cyclosporine dose was decreased to 100 mg orally daily, dapsone (100 mg daily) was started, and prednisone was maintained at 40 mg daily. During the next 2 days, the lesions on the patient’s hands worsened. He was referred to this hospital and admitted because of increased pain and oozing of the lesions. The patient reported feeling well except for his hands. He had a history of hidradenitis sup-purativa, with recurrent abscesses, for more than 20 years, for which multiple antibiotics had been administered; diabetes mellitus, for which he had recently started taking insulin; hypertension; hyperlipidemia; cholelithiasis; a malignant melanoma of the back, which had been excised; macrocytic anemia with low folate levels; multi-nodular goiter; diverticulosis; microhematuria; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; brady-cardia, for which a cardiac pacemaker had been inserted; and bilateral leg edema. He had had herniorrhaphies and an appendectomy. Other medications included lisinopril and aspirin. He was allergic to penicillin. He was retired, lived with his wife, smoked cigarettes, and drank alcohol in moderation. He had no history of exposures to chemicals. There was no family history of similar skin lesions, autoimmune disorders, or inflammatory bowel disease. On examination, the respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute and the oxygen saturation was 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air; other vital signs were normal. There were violaceous, edematous, denuded plaques on the metacarpophalangeal joints of both hands and on both elbows (Fig. 1B), as well as bilateral leg edema. The serum iron level was 50 μg per deciliter (9 μmol per liter; reference range, 45 to 160 μg per deciliter [8 to 29 μmol per liter]), iron-binding capacity 220 μg per deciliter (39 μmol per liter; reference range, 228 to 429 μg per deciliter [41 to 77 μmol per liter]), and ferritin level 540 ng per milliliter (reference range, 30 to 300, in men). The serum levels of electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, total protein and globulin, free thyroxine, lactate dehydrogenase, vitamin B12, folate, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were normal, as were tests of liver function. Testing was negative for rheumatoid factor; evidence of hepatitis A, B, and C viruses; antiphospholipid antibodies; and lupus anticoagulant. Other test results are shown in Table 1. The administration of trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole was begun. No Bence Jones proteins were detected in a con-centrated urine specimen. Urinalysis revealed cloudy yellow urine, trace protein, 3+ occult blood, 20 to 50 red cells per high-power field, and 3 to 5 hyaline casts per low-power field. On the fourth day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2020,35,nejm-case-2020-35,A 59-Year-Old Woman with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Obtundation,"Dr. Denis T. Balaban (Neurology): A 59-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes mellitus was transferred to the neurology intensive care unit (ICU) of this hospital in the winter because of obtundation. The evening before this presentation, the patient was observed by her neighbor to be sitting in the driver’s seat of a vehicle in her driveway. The following morning, she remained seated in the same position and was found to be unresponsive; the neighbor attempted to wake her but could not. On arrival of emergency medical services personnel, intranasal naloxone was administered but did not have any effect on her mental status. The patient was transported to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. On arrival at the emergency department, the patient was unable to provide any history. She did not open her eyes but moaned in response to tactile stimulation and withdrew her arms and legs in response to noxious stimulation. The pupils were 4 mm in diameter and reactive to light. Corneal, oculocephalic, and gag reflexes were present. Reflexes were 2+ and symmetric in the arms and absent in the legs; the Babinski sign was present bilaterally. A pump for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion was in place. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood glucose level was 321 mg per deciliter (17.8 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 100 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 5.6 mmol per liter]). Blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, albumin, lactate, ammonia, troponin, thyrotropin, carboxyhe-moglobin, and methemoglobin were normal, as were results of renal-function and liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of more than 1.030 and the presence of protein, glucose, and ketones. Urine and blood toxicologic screening was negative. The insulin pump was interrogated, and there had been no hypoglycemic episodes in the preceding week. Specimens of blood were obtained for culture. Dr. Otto Rapalino: Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed subtle, symmetric increased attenuation in the basal ganglia, thalami, and dentate nuclei. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed extensive signal loss in the basal ganglia, thalami, dentate nuclei, and leptomeningeal surfaces on gradient echo images. Dr. Balaban: A lumbar puncture was performed; results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis are shown in Table 1. Gram’s staining of the CSF showed rare neutrophils with no organisms. Cultures were performed. Tests of the CSF for herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 DNA and syphilis were negative, as was examination of a smear for acid-fast bacilli. Cytologic studies of the CSF showed rare atypical cells. Electroencephalography showed generalized slowing without epileptiform activity. Vancomy-cin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir were administered. During the next 2 days, the patient’s mental status did not improve. Cultures of blood and CSF obtained 48 hours previously showed no growth. The patient was transferred by ambulance to the neurology ICU of this hospital for further evaluation. On arrival at this hospital, the patient was unable to answer questions, and additional history was obtained from her medical records. A diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus had been made when she was 19 years of age, and the disease had been complicated by diabetic reti-nopathy. Other medical history included chronic lymphocytic leukemia, ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast (for which she had undergone lumpectomy), chronic anemia, asthma, and arthritis due to Lyme disease. Medications included rituximab administered every 3 months for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, subcutaneous insulin infusion, and inhaled budeso-nide and albuterol; letrozole had been prescribed, but the patient had not taken the medication for the preceding 3 months. The patient had allergies to penicillin, cephalexin, and ciprofloxacin. She lived with her adult daughter in a suburban community in New England; her husband had died of renal cell carcinoma 4 years earlier. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit substances. Her mother had had a history of hypertension and essential thrombocytosis, and her father had had type 2 diabetes mellitus. A maternal aunt had died of breast cancer at an unknown age, and another maternal aunt had had ovarian cancer. On examination, the patient opened her eyes and moaned in response to sternal rub and showed purposeful movement toward changing painful stimuli. Her pupils were 4 mm and reactive to light. She blinked appropriately in response to confrontational threat in all fields. The oculocephalic reflex was present, and her face appeared symmetric. The remainder of the evaluation was normal. Blood levels of cobalamin and cortisol were normal; additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. On a repeat lumbar puncture, the opening pressure was 14 cm of water; other results are shown in Table 1. Tests of the CSF for Lyme disease and for enterovirus, varicella virus, and West Nile virus infection were performed. Dr. Rapalino: Repeat MRI of the head confirmed the presence of diffuse, symmetric hypo-intensity on T2-weighted images and showed abnormal susceptibility signal throughout the basal ganglia, thalami, dentate nuclei, and cortical surfaces of the cerebral hemispheres on susceptibility-weighted images (Fig. 1). Dr. Balaban: Electroencephalography showed generalized polymorphic theta slowing in the background and frequent, prolonged runs of bi-frontal irregular delta activity with embedded bifrontal low-amplitude blunt discharges. Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir were continued, and meropenem was administered intravenously. During the next 3 days, the patient began to open her eyes spontaneously, move her arms and legs independently, and follow commands intermittently. Increased tone was noted in the legs and arms. Cultures of blood and CSF obtained 72 hours previously showed no growth. The CSF tests for Lyme disease and for enterovirus, varicella virus, and West Nile virus infection were negative. Vanco-mycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir were discontinued, and the patient was transferred from the ICU to the neurology unit. Additional history was obtained from the patient’s neighbors, outpatient endocrinologist, and family. Two years before this presentation, the patient’s neighbors had noted the development of suspicious and paranoid beliefs. For example, the patient believed that her computer was being used to spy on her and gather personal information, and she repeatedly asked them to help fix the device. Approximately 21 months before this presentation, the patient’s endocrinologist had noted the development of confusion. The patient began to contact her physician’s office repeatedly, often several times daily. Whereas she had previously managed her diabetes with a high degree of sophistication, she began to ask questions that suggested she was having difficulty with basic diabetes management. Her telephone calls contained many unrelated and, at times, nonsensical questions; emails were similarly tangential and incoherent. When she was asked about these changes, the patient reported that her cognitive function was as “sharp as a tack” and that her emails were confusing because of “slow Internet speed.” During an office visit with her endocrinologist, the Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was 24 on a scale ranging from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function; points were deducted because the patient had made errors of short-term object recall, attention, and calculation. The patient was referred to the outpatient neurology clinic of the other hospital for further evaluation, but she did not attend the scheduled visit. Two weeks before the current presentation, the patient’s family had noted that she had sent individualized holiday gifts to incorrect family members. In the accompanying holiday cards, her penmanship, which had previously been neat, was nearly illegible and was likened by family members to a child’s handwriting. During the current hospitalization, the patient continued to show slow neurologic improvement with supportive care. She was able to answer questions in short sentences, was oriented to self but not to time or place, and was unable to provide further history about the events that led to her hospitalization. A diagnostic test was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2011,11,nejm-case-2011-11,A 47-Year-Old Man with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Heart Failure,"Dr. Caroline L. Sokol (Medicine): A 47-year-old man with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and progressive cardiac failure was transferred to this hospital after a cardiac arrest. One year before admission, dyspnea, leg edema, and abdominal distention gradually developed, and the patient was told that his liver was abnormal. He became progressively incapacitated and eventually bedridden, with dyspnea on exertion and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Two months before admission, cardiac catheterization reportedly showed 60% occlusion of the right coronary artery, 30% occlusion of the left anterior descending artery, and mitral-valve regurgitation. Mitral-valve replacement was planned. Two days before admission, fever, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea developed. The next day, pain in the left arm, severe dyspnea, and orthopnea developed; the patient went to the emergency department at another hospital. On examination, he was pale and retching. The temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 133/107 mm Hg, the pulse 133 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 75% while he was breathing ambient air. The oral mucous membranes were dry. There were basilar rales in the right lung field and decreased breath sounds throughout both lung fields. A cardiac monitor showed intermittent runs of ventricular tachycardia, and an electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed couplets, intermittent ventricular tachycardia with polymorphic waveforms, a prolonged QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) of approximately 520 msec, and ST-segment elevations in leads V2 through V4 (see the figure in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Calcium, magnesium, and amiodarone were administered. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Transthoracic echocardiogra-phy showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%, left ventricular hypertrophy, severe mitral-valve regurgitation, moderate tricuspid-valve regurgitation, biatrial enlargement, mild right ventricular dilatation, a pulmonary-artery systolic pressure of 40 to 50 mm Hg, and a dilated inferior vena cava with impaired inspiratory collapse; there was no pericardial effusion. Cardiac catheterization reportedly showed coronary artery disease that was unchanged from 2 months earlier and normal left ventricular function. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. During the night, a bradycardic arrest with unknown rhythm occurred. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, atropine and bicarbonate were administered intravenously, and ami-odarone was discontinued. The urine output decreased; vitamin K, furosemide, and albumin were administered. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. In the morning, an ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with intraventricular conduction delay and was otherwise unchanged. That evening, he was transferred to this hospital. A diagnosis of SLE had been made 14 years earlier, with fatigue, arthritis, and a photosensitive rash on the arms and chest. Pathological examination of a skin-biopsy specimen at another institution reportedly revealed changes suggestive of SLE; testing for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) was positive at 1:640 in a speckled pattern, and the titer of antibodies to double-stranded DNA was 1:2560. Treatment with hy-droxychloroquine (at a dose of 200 mg twice daily) and naproxen was begun. Prednisone (10 mg daily) was begun several years later; the dose was tapered intermittently, but it could not be discontinued, because of recurrent symptoms. Two years before admission, hydroxychloroquine was increased to 200 mg three times daily because of worsening rash. The patient had hyper-lipidemia, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Four years before admission, a right ne-phrectomy was performed at another institution because of a myxoid liposarcoma; pathological examination of the kidney showed lupus nephritis (the mesangial proliferative variant, World Health Organization class II), diffuse early nodular glomerulosclerosis, and arterial and arteriolar sclerosis. Proteinuria (2 g per day) and renal failure developed 2 years before admission. Myco-phenolate mofetil was added; proteinuria improved, but creatinine levels remained between 1.8 and 2.2 mg per deciliter (159.1 and 194.5 µmol per liter). Urinalysis reportedly did not show active sediment. Medications on admission included hydroxy-chloroquine (200 mg three times daily), myco-phenolate mofetil (500 mg twice daily), prednisone (10 mg daily), simvastatin, amlodipine, flutica-sone–salmeterol and albuterol metered-dose inhalers, calcitriol, calcium, temazepam, and ace-tylsalicylic acid. The patient was allergic to penicillin. He lived with his wife and was receiving disability payments. He smoked cigarettes (22 pack-years), had abused alcohol in his 20s but had been abstinent for the previous 5 years, and did not use illicit drugs. His mother had died in her 60s with dementia; his father was in his 70s and had a positive ANA test. Two sisters had died in their 40s, one from ovarian cancer and the other, who had severe juvenile-onset SLE-myositis overlap syndrome and coronary artery disease, from pancreatitis. A brother who was 52 years of age had coronary artery disease. On examination, the patient was sedated, intubated, and mechanically ventilated. The temperature was 37.0°C, the blood pressure 117/95 mm Hg, the pulse 69 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was ventilated with 100% oxygen. He was thin and cachectic. The pupils were sluggishly reactive to light; the con-junctivae were slightly icteric, without injection. The jugular venous pressure was 10 cm of water without a Kussmaul sign or hepatojugular reflux. There were bilateral rhonchi. Examination of the heart showed a diffuse point of maximal impulse and a holosystolic murmur (grade 2/6) that was loudest over the apex. There was abdominal distention with decreased bowel sounds and a liver span of 8 cm. The extremities were cool, with 1+ pulses in the arms and legs. There was an erythematous macular rash in a shawl-like distribution and palmar erythema. The remainder of the examination was normal. The mean corpuscular volume, plasma fibrin-ogen, and levels of glucose, magnesium, and alkaline phosphatase were normal; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph revealed cardiomegaly. ECG showed sinus rhythm at 74 beats per minute; intraven-tricular conduction delay; poor R-wave progression in leads V1 through V3, with downsloping ST-T segments in V1 and V2; ST-segment convex elevations (>6 mm) in V3 and T-wave inversions in V4; and prominent R-wave voltage in V3 and V4. Intravenous furosemide was administered. The patient remained hemodynamically stable without the need for vasopressor therapy; the trachea was extubated on the second day, and furosemide was discontinued. Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed diffusely increased left renal parenchymal echogenicity, ascites, and bilateral pleural effusions; the hepatic vasculature was patent, with normal flow. On the third day, transthoracic echocardiog-raphy showed marked biventricular hypertrophy, severe mitral-valve regurgitation, biatrial enlargement, dilatation of the inferior vena cava and hepatic vein, a right ventricular systolic pressure of at least 31 mm Hg, an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 54%, and a small posterior pericardial effusion. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen without contrast material showed diffuse dilatation of small-bowel segments and the transverse colon and moderate free fluid. Hydroxychloroquine was discontinued. Serum protein electrophoresis showed a normal pattern and a diffuse decrease in immune globulin, with an IgG level of 495 mg per deciliter (reference range, 614 to 1295); tests for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, hepatitis B and C viruses, anti–liver-kidney microsomal type 1 antibodies, and antibodies to smooth muscle and double-stranded DNA were negative; the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, levels of IgA and IgM, fibrinogen, iron-binding capacity, ferritin, vitamin B12, folate, thyrotropin, and ammonia were normal; additional laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. On the seventh day, a diagnostic test was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,17,nejm-case-2012-17,A 54-Year-Old Man with Visual-Field Loss and a Mass in the Brain,"A 54-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of visual-field loss and a mass in the brain. The patient had been well until 3 weeks before admission, when loss of vision in the right eye, associated with diplopia, developed while he was jogging; it resolved spontaneously after several minutes. Four days before admission, the symptoms recurred transiently, and he bumped into a tree while running. On the morning of admission, dizziness and loss of vision in the right lower visual field in both eyes developed, which did not resolve and resulted in difficulty driving. He went to the emergency department at another hospital. On examination, nystagmus was present in both eyes on left and right gaze. The vital signs and the remainder of the examination were normal, as were the results of laboratory tests, including a complete blood count; blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, and glucose; and tests of coagulation and renal and hepatic function. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, after the administration of gadolinium, revealed two adjacent masses (2 cm by 2 cm and 1 cm by 1.5 cm) in the left occipital and posterior parietal regions. Mass effect on the left occipital horn was associated with abnormal T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal hyperintensity extending through the splenium of the corpus callosum. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and acetylsalicylic acid, dexamethasone, and phenytoin were administered. Later that day, he was transferred to this hospital. The patient reported difficulty seeing objects in the right lower visual field and dizziness. He reported no headache, nausea, vomiting, numbness, weakness, bowel or bladder dysfunction, or seizures. He had a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and Helicobacter pylori infection and had recently had hematuria. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen obtained 3 months before admission showed prostatic enlargement and was otherwise normal. He had had inguinal hernior-rhaphies in the past. He took esomeprazole and had no known allergies. He was divorced, had children, and was physically active, running daily and competing in multiple marathons. He drank alcohol in moderation, had never smoked, and had no recent exposure to ill persons, tuberculosis, or asbestos. An uncle had had an inoperable primary brain tumor; the patient’s siblings and children were healthy. On examination, there was bilateral right inferior quadrantanopia; the vital signs, oxygen saturation, and remainder of the general and neurologic examination were normal. The administration of dexamethasone was continued, and omeprazole was added. The blood glucose level was 199 mg per deciliter (11.0 mmol per liter) (reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]), and the lactate dehydrogenase level 217 U per liter (reference range, 110 to 210). The complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes, protein, albumin, globulin, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, carcinoembryonic antigen, prostate-specific antigen, CA 19-9, and nonmaternal alpha-fetoprotein were normal, as were tests of coagulation and renal function and a urinalysis. A chest radiograph was normal. On the second day, an MRI scan of the brain, obtained after the administration of gadolinium, showed two heterogeneously enhancing, well-circumscribed lesions in the left occipital lobe (2.2 cm by 1.8 cm and 1.1 cm by 1.4 cm). Within the enhancing portions of the lesions, there was restricted diffusion. Extensive signal abnormality on T2-weighted and FLAIR images was seen in the surrounding white matter of the left occipital lobe, extending into the posterior left temporal lobe and the splenium of the corpus callosum. Mass effect was present on the surrounding sulci and occipital horn and trigone of the left lateral ventricle, with no evidence of midline shift or hydrocephalus. The next day, an MRI scan of the abdomen and pelvis after the administration of gadolinium, a CT scan of the chest, and a bone scan showed no evidence of cancer. The patient was discharged on the fourth hospital day, taking omeprazole and dexamethasone. Three days later, the patient was readmitted, and a diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2011,07,nejm-case-2011-07,A 52-Year-Old Man with Upper Respiratory Symptoms and Low Oxygen Saturation Levels,"Dr. Roby P. Bhattacharyya (Medicine): A 52-year-old man was seen in the urgent care outpatient medical clinic at this hospital because of upper respiratory symptoms. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 3 days earlier, when subjective fever, fatigue, headache, nasal and sinus congestion, sore throat, and a nonproductive cough developed. Three days later, he came to the outpatient clinic. He did not have chills, gastrointestinal symptoms, shortness of breath, wheezing, night sweats, or chest discomfort, and he reported that his respiratory symptoms were not as severe as those he had had during a previous episode of pneumonia. The patient had had type 1 diabetes mellitus for 17 years, for which he was followed at another hospital. Control of blood glucose levels had been poor, despite low hemoglobin A1c measurements; glycemic control was followed by measuring the levels of plasma fructosamine. Eight years before this evaluation, he had an episode of prolonged altered consciousness and somnolence, associated with a fasting blood sugar level of 49 mg per deciliter (2.7 mmol per liter); his condition improved slowly after the administration of glucagon and intravenous glucose. Eighteen months before this evaluation, he had an episode of transient expressive aphasia and was treated briefly with valproic acid. He also had hypertension, exercise-induced angina, hyperlipidemia, hyperbilirubinemia of more than 8 years’ duration, glaucoma, and dermatitis herpetiformis, for which he had taken dapsone for more than 8 years. Testing for serum endomysial antibodies had been positive, and he had briefly tried a gluten-free diet but had not adhered to it. He had migraine headaches, atypical chest pains, and peripheral neuropathy with mildly diminished vibratory sensation in his feet. Episodes of elevated aminotransferase levels had occurred 18 months, 8 months, and 2 months before this evaluation, after the initiation of valproic acid, simvastatin, and atorvastatin, respectively. A screening colonoscopy had revealed diverticulosis and a tubular adenoma (4 mm in diameter), which had been excised. Medications included the human insulin analogue lispro, insulin glargine, dapsone (200 mg daily), lisinopril, metoprolol succinate, and nitroglycerin as needed for chest pain. The patient reported omitting his antihypertensive medications for the 3 days preceding the current evaluation, and he had not taken atorvastatin for the previous 2 weeks, nor had he taken aspirin, ranitidine, or latanoprost ophthalmic drops recently. He had received influenza and pneumococcal vaccines in the past. He lived with his wife and worked in an office. His wife had been ill with respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms approximately 1 week before this evaluation. He drank alcohol moderately, had never smoked, and did not use illicit drugs. His father had died at 52 years of age from metastatic colon cancer, both parents had had hypertension, his mother and sister had migraines, and an uncle had type 1 diabetes; there was no other family history of autoimmune diseases. On examination, the patient appeared to be comfortable, without respiratory distress. The skin was pale. The blood pressure was 164/75 mm Hg, the pulse 81 beats per minute, the temperature 37.7°C, the respiratory rate 12 to 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation (tested on multiple digits of both hands and feet) 85 to 90% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (BMI) (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 32. Capillary refill occurred in 2 to 3 seconds, and there was no clubbing, cyanosis, or ulcerations. The remainder of the examination was normal. On further review of the patient’s record, the oxygen saturation had been 89% and 86%, 17 months and 15 months before this evaluation, respectively, as measured by pulse oximetry (most likely with different oximeters) while he was breathing ambient air. The white-cell count, differential count, platelet count, and levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, and aspartate and alanine aminotransferases were normal; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph was normal. Fluticasone nasal spray was prescribed, and the patient was discharged with instructions to follow up with his internist for additional laboratory studies. Two months later, he returned to the outpatient clinic for routine follow-up; he had resumed taking atorvastatin. On examination, he appeared to be comfortable. The respiratory rate was 12 to 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 88% while he was breathing ambient air. The BMI was 32.8, and the blood pressure, pulse, and temperature were normal. The remainder of the examination was normal. The white-cell count, differential count, and platelet count were normal. The levels of electrolytes, protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate and alanine aminotransferases, calcium, iron, iron-binding capacity, and ferritin were normal, as were hemoglobin electrophoresis, the anion gap, and tests of renal function; other test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnostic test was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2023,33,nejm-case-2023-33,An 86-Year-Old Man with Shortness of Breath,"Dr. Elliott Winford (Medicine): An 86-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of shortness of breath. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 6 months before the current admission, when he began to have shortness of breath that occurred intermittently during his daily walk of 1 to 2 miles. Ten weeks before the current admission, posterior lumbar decompression was performed for the treatment of spinal stenosis. The patient healed from the surgery; however, as his mobility increased, he noticed that shortness of breath occurred more frequently. During the 7 weeks after the surgery, shortness of breath occurred with decreasing levels of exertion. Three weeks before the current admission, the patient’s symptoms worsened such that he was unable to walk across a room, and he sought evaluation in the primary care clinic of another hospital. The d-dimer level was 3220 ng per milliliter (reference value, <500), and he was instructed to present to the emergency department of this hospital. On evaluation in the emergency department, the patient described shortness of breath that was worse with exertion or lying down. He also noted mild swelling in the right leg. There was no fever, cough, or chest discomfort. The temporal temperature was 35.8°C, the blood pressure 156/74 mm Hg, the heart rate 81 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He appeared fatigued. The lungs were clear on auscultation; there was a systolic murmur. Trace edema was present in the right leg. The high-sensitivity troponin level was 24 ng per liter (reference range, 0 to 14), and the N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level was 1105 pg per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 1800). Tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza virus types A and B were negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Ryan Chung: Computed tomographic (CT) pulmonary angiography was nega-tive for pulmonary emboli but showed bilateral subpleural clustered nodules and tree-in-bud opacities, as well as ground-glass and reticular opacities at the lung bases. The right atrium and right ventricle were dilated. Dr. Ada C. Stefanescu Schmidt: Myocardial perfusion imaging, performed after the administration of intravenous regadenoson, revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 75%. There was no evidence of ischemia or infarction. Dr. Winford: The patient was discharged home with instructions to follow up in the primary care clinic. During the 2 weeks after hospital discharge, shortness of breath persisted. On the day of the current admission, the patient was unable to walk even a few steps because of his shortness of breath. He returned to the primary care clinic of the other hospital for evaluation. The oxygen saturation was 78% while he was breathing ambient air. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula, and he was brought to the emergency department of this hospital. The patient reported that the shortness of breath had worsened such that he used hiking poles to walk to the bathroom and sometimes used a wheelchair. The review of systems was notable for weight loss of 11 kg during the past 3 months, intermittent dizziness, cough that was worse when he was lying down, and diarrhea. The patient had a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, depression, migraines, spinal stenosis, and osteoarthritis. Medications included omeprazole, sertraline, cholecalciferol, and a fluticasone inhaler. He took oxycodone as needed for musculoskeletal pain, and he used an albuterol inhaler as needed for shortness of breath. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was retired and lived in a suburban area of coastal New England with his wife and two dogs. He drank one glass of wine weekly and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. His father had died of stroke and his mother of heart disease. On examination, the blood pressure was 150/73 mm Hg, the heart rate 75 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 5 liters per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20.7. The patient appeared tired, and there were telangiectasias on his cheeks. He had dys-pnea during the conversation and needed to take short breaks between sentences. He had an elevated jugular venous pressure with a prominent c-v wave; Kussmaul’s sign was absent. Crackles were heard at both lung bases, and there was no wheezing. There was a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur, which was heard best at the left lower sternal border, as well as a soft diastolic murmur. The abdomen was nontender on palpation, and the liver was pulsatile. There was 1+ edema in both legs. The NT-proBNP level was 1788 pg per milliliter. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Stefanescu Schmidt: An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with a right bundle-branch block. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) (Fig. 1; and Videos 1, 2, and 3, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 68%. The right ventricle was dilated, and the interventricular septum was flattened; these findings are consistent with right ventricular volume overload. The tricuspid valve, particularly the septal leaflet, was thickened and retracted and had restricted motion. There was resultant severe tricuspid regurgitation with a large coaptation gap; the jet was directed predominantly toward the atrial septum. The pul-monic valve was thickened, with at least moderate pulmonic regurgitation. The mitral and aortic valves were mildly thickened, without clinically significant stenosis or regurgitation. The right atrium was dilated, and there was a patent foramen ovale (PFO) with right-to-left shunting on color Doppler imaging. The right ventricular systolic pressure was estimated to be 30 mm Hg. Dr. Winford: Intravenous furosemide was administered. The patient was admitted to the hospital. A diagnostic test was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,40,nejm-case-2012-40,A 43-Year-Old Woman with Cardiorespiratory Arrest after a Cesarean Section,"Dr. Britta Panda (Obstetrics and Gynecology): A 43-year-old woman (a multigravida) was admitted to the labor and delivery service of this hospital at 36.4 weeks of gestation because of vaginal bleeding. The patient had had regular prenatal care at this hospital; routine prenatal screening tests were negative. She had had four previous uncomplicated pregnancies, with spontaneous vaginal deliveries, the most recent 14 years earlier. She had a history of obesity (prenatal body-mass index [the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], 32.1) and migraine headaches; she had no known allergies. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Marginal placenta previa was seen on obstetrical ultrasonography, and two episodes of bleeding occurred, at 27.7 weeks and 32.7 weeks of gestation, which resolved after the patient was admitted for bed rest, hydration, and the administration of beta-methasone. She was advised to maintain bed rest at home and continue prenatal visits; the medications on discharge were iron sulfate and prenatal vitamins. At a routine prenatal visit 8 days before this presentation (at 35.3 weeks of gestation), obstetrical ultrasonography revealed an anterior placenta with the edge covering the internal os, a finding consistent with placenta previa. Heavy vaginal bleeding developed on the day of admission; the patient came to this hospital and was admitted to labor and delivery. On examination in the labor and delivery unit, the vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal; there was active vaginal bleeding. Plans were made for emergency cesarean delivery. The hematocrit was 30.9% (reference range in women who are not pregnant, 36.0 to 46.0), the hemoglobin level was 10.7 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0), and the ABO blood type was O, Rh-positive, with negative antibody screening; the white-cell and platelet counts were normal. A spinal anesthetic was administered, and a cesarean section was performed, with delivery of a healthy boy; the 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores were 8 and 9, respectively. The placenta previa was removed. Twenty minutes after delivery, as the abdominal fascia was being closed, the patient’s systolic blood pressure fell to 70 to 80 mm Hg, the pulse to 30 to 39 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation to 70 to 80%. The patient reported chest pain, and her lips became white; apnea developed rapidly thereafter, and she became unresponsive. Electrical activity was present on electrocardiography (ECG), but radial and carotid pulses were not palpable. The trachea was intubated, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was begun, with closed chest compressions and the administration of pressors. Diagnostic procedures were performed, and additional management decisions were made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,30,nejm-case-2019-30,A 65-Year-Old Woman with Lung Cancer and Chest Pain,"Dr. Mathew S. Lopes: A 65-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of chest pain. Six months before the current presentation, the patient presented to a hospital affiliated with this hospital with a 4-day history of acute pain in the lower back, left paraspinal muscles, and right flank. The pain worsened with movement and, to a lesser extent, with inspiration. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Mannudeep K. Kalra: A frontal radiograph of the chest (Fig. 1A) showed a spiculated nodule in the left lung, with left hilar prominence. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material according to a pulmonary embolism protocol (Fig. 1B), revealed a spicu-lated nodule (1.7 cm in diameter) in the left upper lobe and left hilar lymphade-nopathy. There were bone lesions in the thoracic skeleton, including a lytic lesion (2.3 cm in diameter) at the level of the ninth thoracic vertebra. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Positron-emission tomography and CT (PET-CT) revealed foci of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity in the mass in the left upper lobe, as well as in mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, the eighth transverse process, the ninth thoracic vertebral body, and the right ninth rib (Fig. 1C). A biopsy specimen of the lung mass showed evidence of lung adenocarcinoma with a mutation in KRAS. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and spine did not reveal cerebral metastases but confirmed the presence of a lytic lesion at the level of the eighth and ninth thoracic vertebrae; a compression fracture was also observed. Dr. Lopes: External-beam radiation therapy was administered during the next 2 weeks, followed by four cycles of carboplatin and pemetrexed that were completed during the next 3 months. Dr. Kalra: A repeat PET-CT scan obtained 2 weeks after completion of chemo-therapy showed that the FDG-avid foci in the right ninth rib and in lymph nodes in the medi-astinum, hilum, and right supraclavicular region had increased in size. Dr. Lopes: Palliative external-beam radiation therapy was administered. Two weeks later, the patient was readmitted to the other hospital with increased back pain. CT of the chest, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed atelectasis in the left upper lobe. The patient was treated with external-beam radiation therapy, prednisone, supplemental oxygen, ipratropium in combination with albute-rol, and salmeterol in combination with flutica-sone, and she was discharged home 2 days later. Two days after discharge, the patient presented to the other hospital with dyspnea and hypox-emia. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed complete collapse of the left upper lobe due to an obstructing endobronchial lesion. The patient received prednisone, inhaled albuterol, tiotropium, salmeterol in combination with fluti-casone, and five treatments of external-beam radiation therapy during a 7-day hospitalization. One week after discharge, a dose of the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab (3 mg per kilogram of body weight) was administered for the treatment of non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the outpatient oncology clinic of the other hospital. Three weeks later, the back pain and dyspnea worsened, and anorexia and a sore throat developed. Two days later, the patient had new pain in the left lateral chest wall. She described the pain as having a stabbing quality that was non-pleuritic, radiated from back to front, and wors-ened when she lay on her left side. After 2 days of chest pain, she was evaluated at the emergency department of the other hospital. Treatment with sublingual nitroglycerin did not reduce the chest pain. Examination was notable for a heart rate of 121 beats per minute and tenderness in the left precordium near the anterior axillary and midaxillary lines. An electrocardiogram reportedly did not show any ischemic changes. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A radio-graph of the chest reportedly showed left hilar opacity, atelectasis in the left upper lobe, and osteopenia. Aspirin was given orally, and morphine, hydromorphone, normal saline, and heparin were administered intravenously. The patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital. A review of systems was notable for anorexia, fatigue, and constipation, but the patient had no fever, chills, dyspnea, cough, diaphoresis, nausea, emesis, diarrhea, or urinary urgency or frequency. The medical history included hypercholesterol-emia, hypothyroidism, gastroesophageal reflux disease, gout, anxiety, and glaucoma; she had undergone kyphoplasty for osteoporosis, internal fixation for an ulnar fracture and radiopatellar dislocation, and when she was in her early 40s, ovary-sparing total abdominal hysterectomy for endometriosis. Medications included inhaled sal-meterol in combination with fluticasone, tiotro-pium, morphine sulfate (controlled release), bri-monidine, latanoprost, cholecalciferol, senna, docusate, omeprazole, oxycodone, and acetaminophen as needed for pain. Treatment with eryth-romycin caused stomach upset. She had smoked 1.5 packs of cigarettes per day from 30 years of age until the diagnosis of lung cancer was made, 6 months before the current presentation; she did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. She was retired from working as an administrator. She was widowed, had three adult children, and was serving as a caregiver for her mother. Her father had had coronary artery disease, and her mother had lung cancer, osteoporosis for which she had undergone kyphoplasty, and spinal ste-nosis for which she had undergone laminectomy. The temperature was 36.2°C, the heart rate 116 beats per minute, the blood pressure 128/65 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared cachectic and was uncomfortable with movement. The jugular venous pressure was 5 cm of water. The heart rhythm was tachycardic, but no cardiac murmur or rub was noted. There was tenderness on palpation of the left and right lateral chest wall. Diminished breath sounds were noted on the left side, with crackles at the left apex. A faint erythematous rash was present at the site of radiation therapy on the left upper back. The patient had no swelling or palpable cords in the legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. An electrocardiogram (Fig. 2) showed sinus tachycardia, a rightward axis, and minor non-specific ST-segment and T-wave changes. Telemetry revealed intermittent premature ventricular contractions. Laboratory testing revealed normal levels of magnesium, phosphorus, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, lipase, lactic acid, and thyrotropin; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood samples were obtained for culture. Dr. Kalra: A frontal radiograph of the chest (Fig. 3A) showed an elevated left hilum with adjacent opacity, findings that were consistent with a collapsed left upper lobe. Dual-energy CT of the chest (Fig. 3B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material according to a pulmonary embolism protocol, revealed a low-attenuation lesion (measuring 2 cm in diameter) at the left hilum that was consistent with the patient’s known lung cancer, but there was no evidence of pulmonary embolism. The lesion caused complete occlusion of the bronchus of the left upper lobe at its origin, with obstructive collapse of the left upper lobe. In addition, patchy consolidation was noted in an adjacent area of the left lower lobe. There were multiple lytic lesions in the thoracic skeleton, with the largest lesions seen in the eighth thoracic vertebra and the ninth right rib. The imaging also revealed multiple sites of previous vertebroplasty in the lower thoracic spine. Dr. Lopes: Atorvastatin, levofloxacin, metopro-lol, and intravenous hydromorphone and morphine were administered, and the patient was admitted to the cardiology service. A transtho-racic echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 57%; there was subtle hypo-kinesis in the mid-inferior, basal inferior, and basal inferoseptal walls, mild-to-moderate tri-cuspid regurgitation, and no evidence of pericar-dial effusion, and the size and function of the right ventricle were normal. Diagnostic tests were performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,06,nejm-case-2010-06,A 37-Year-Old Man with a Lesion on the Tongue,"Dr. Salim Afshar (Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery): A 37-year-old man was seen in the oral and maxillofacial surgery clinic of this hospital because of a lesion on the tongue. Three weeks earlier, a painful lesion had developed on the tongue, associated with a tender nodule in the left neck. A few days later, the patient saw his primary care provider at another health care facility. He reported no other symptoms, except for the development of dermatitis on his legs after exposure to poison ivy several weeks earlier. On examination, the vital signs were normal. There was a tender, irregular, shallow ulcerated lesion on the left ventral surface of the tongue and a mobile, smooth, tender lymph node in the left anterior cervical chain of lymph nodes. Scattered areas of erythema and blisters were present on the lower legs; some blisters were open and draining, and one cloudy blister on the right foot had 5 mm of surrounding erythema. Acyclovir, for 5 days, and sulfamethoxazole– trimethoprim, for 10 days, were administered empirically. A culture of the tongue lesion was negative for herpes simplex virus (HSV); a culture of the cloudy blister on the foot grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. During the next 2 weeks, the tongue lesion increased in size. Three days before this evaluation, the patient returned to his physician. On examination, the tongue lesion had increased slightly in size and had an exudate; the lymphadenopathy was unchanged. He was referred to the oral and maxillofacial surgery clinic of this hospital. The patient reported no fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, or recent weight loss. He had a history of borderline hypertension and asthma, and he had had a tonsillectomy and an adenoidectomy in the past. A screening test for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was reportedly negative 3 months earlier. He was sexually active with men, drank alcohol socially, and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. He worked in an office. His father was 66 years of age, had coronary artery disease, and had had a myocardial infarction; his mother, 63 years of age, had thyroid disease; and another relative had had melanoma. The patient was allergic to penicillin and cephalexin and took no medications. On examination, there were palpable and tender lymph nodes, 1 to 2 cm in diameter, in the submandibular and anterior cervical regions. There was a palpable, raised lesion (1.5 cm in diameter) near the tip of the ventral surface of the tongue, on the left side (Fig. 1). The lesion was very tender to palpation, was slightly ulcerated, and had a white filmy surface layer with irregular borders and surrounding erythema. Wiping the lesion with gauze did not remove the white film. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. No cutaneous lesion or rash was evident. A punch biopsy of the lesion was performed. After the procedure, chlorhexidine gluconate rinses, narcotic analgesia for pain, and clindamy-cin for 5 days were prescribed. The next day, computed tomographic (CT) scans of the head and neck, partially obscured by beam-hardening artifacts that were caused by dental restorations and appeared as streaks, showed a well-defined, low-density lesion on the ventral surface of the left tongue, with little surrounding enhancement; soft-tissue densities within both valleculae that were thought to represent hyperplastic lingual tonsils; and multiple bilateral enlarged cervical lymph nodes, up to 2.3 cm in the greatest dimension. Mild mucosal thickening was noted in the alveolar recesses of the maxillary sinuses. There were no abnormal calcifications, and the pharyngeal mucosa, major cervical vessels, lung apexes, visible cervical spine, and parotid, submandibular, and thyroid glands were normal. Three days later, the patient returned to his primary care provider. The lesion had slightly increased in size, and the examination was otherwise unchanged. The next day, a diagnostic test result was received.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2018,31,nejm-case-2018-31,A 37-Year-Old Man with a Self-Inflicted Gunshot Wound,"Dr. Jordan P. Bloom (Surgery): A 37-year-old man was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit (ICU) of this hospital because of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 days before admission. That evening, while he was at home with his family, he reportedly was drinking alcohol and appeared to be upset. He left the room. Shortly after midnight, his wife heard a gunshot. She found the patient slumped forward in a chair in the kitchen, next to his AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, with severe facial injuries. He was conscious and responded appropriately to questions by nodding and shaking his head. The patient’s wife called emergency medical services, and the patient was transported to the emergency department of a local hospital, where a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine, cefazolin, fentanyl, midazolam, intravenous fluids, and a continuous infusion of propofol were administered. A cricothyroidotomy was performed, and mechanical ventilation was initiated. The blood ethanol level was 178 mg per deciliter (reference range, <10). The patient was transferred to a tertiary care center for further treatment. On examination at the second hospital, the temperature was 36.2°C, the pulse 97 beats per minute, the blood pressure 89/73 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 19 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was receiving full mechanical ventilatory support (fraction of inspired oxygen [Fio2], 1.00). The weight was 109 kg. There were open wounds involving the submandibular soft tissues and the bones and soft tissues of the middle portion of the left side of the face, extending from the upper lip to the nasal radix (Fig. 1). The globe of the right eye was ruptured. On examination of the lungs, breath sounds were absent on the left side. The remainder of the examination was normal. The platelet count and red-cell indexes were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A urine drug screen was presumptively positive for methamphetamine and negative for other drugs of abuse; confirmatory testing was not performed. A chest radiograph showed intubation of the right main bronchus; the endotracheal tube was adjusted, and a repeat image showed the tube to be well positioned. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Shahmir Kamalian: Computed tomography (CT) with three-dimensional reconstruction of the face (Fig. 2A) revealed a large entry wound under the chin, extensive tissue damage along the track of the bullet, and a giant exit wound in the middle of the face. The high-velocity bullets fired from military-style AR-15 rifles produce a much larger temporary cavity (the space that forms when tissue moves away from the bullet, before the tissue settles back once the bullet has passed through the body) than the temporary cavity caused by bullets fired from typical handguns; the large temporary cavity is associated with extensive damage to the displaced tissues and a large exit wound. The trajectory of the bullet in this case (Fig. 2A), with the gun fired under the chin while the neck was hyperextended, is suggestive of a suicide attempt. When a bullet is fired in this manner, it often misses the brain, causing a nonlethal wound. Since the gun was fired from the submental region, the bullet caused severe injury to the middle portion of the mandible and face (Fig. 2B). In addition, scattered fragments of bullet that were produced by early impact with the dense mandible acted as secondary projectiles along the track of the bullet (Fig. 2C), causing additional tissue damage and rupture of the right globe (Fig. 2D). The bones of the middle of the face were widely commi-nuted, with bone fragments extending to the intracranial compartment (Fig. 2E and 2F), conferring a predisposition to meningitis or a cere-brospinal fluid (CSF) leak. Dr. Bloom: The patient was admitted to the surgical ICU of the second hospital. On admission, the infusion of sedative medications was briefly paused, and the patient awakened to voice and followed commands to show his thumbs and wiggle his toes. The facial wounds were irrigated, and a standard tracheotomy was performed. During the next day, the patient was evaluated by a team of surgical subspecialists. Ultimately, transfer was recommended for definitive care of the facial injuries, and the patient was admitted to the surgical ICU of this hospital for further treatment. Additional history was obtained from the patient’s wife. The patient was healthy, took no medications, and was allergic to penicillin, which had caused a rash. He lived with his wife and young children in a rural area of New England and had stable employment at a construction company. He reportedly owned four guns, chewed tobacco but did not smoke it, and drank alcohol socially. The patient’s sister had opioid-use disorder, and his father had died 10 years earlier of an unspecified cause. On examination, the patient was sedated and mechanically ventilated by means of tracheotomy. The temperature was 38.4°C, the pulse 86 beats per minute, the blood pressure 133/80 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was receiving mechanical ventilatory support (Fio2, 0.30). The left pupil was reactive to light. On examination of the lungs, the breath sounds were coarse. Ecchymosis was present on the left medial forearm. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. The platelet count, red-cell indexes, and blood levels of total and direct bilirubin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Management decisions were made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2008,31,nejm-case-2008-31,"A 39-Year-Old Man with Chest Pain, Arthralgias, and a Mediastinal Mass","A 39-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of chest pain, arthralgias, and a mediastinal mass. Two months before admission, pain in the middle and right chest developed, which radiated intermittently to the right arm, increased in intensity with deep inspiration or changes in position, and was accompanied by fatigue and mild shortness of breath; there was no wheezing, cough, or production of sputum. He came to the emergency department of this hospital. He had been admitted to this hospital approximately 1 year earlier because of similar symptoms associated with diffuse arthralgias; an electrocardiogram at that time showed a normal sinus rhythm, left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage, subtle PR-segment depression, and ST-segment elevations. Laboratory results from that admission are shown in Table 1. A diagnosis of pericarditis was made; ibuprofen was prescribed, and he was discharged the next day. Computed tomographic (CT) scans of the chest 1 week later showed a small pericardial effusion, thickened pericardium, several pericardial lymph nodes measuring up to 0.4 cm in diameter, and a small left pleural effusion. Skin testing for tuberculosis was negative; additional laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. His symptoms improved, and the ibuprofen was gradually discontinued. On evaluation in the emergency department, the patient stated that in retrospect he thought that the chest pain had never fully resolved from a year earlier but had become more intense during the past month. Physical examination was normal, with normal heart sounds and no murmurs or rubs; laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Electrocardiography revealed a PR interval of 256 msec and first-degree atrioventricular block. The patient declined admission; ibuprofen was prescribed, and outpatient follow-up was scheduled. The next day, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis that was performed to detect pulmonary embolus showed pericardial thickening, which was increased as compared with the earlier study; the main pulmonary artery was distorted and narrowed to 2.6 cm in diameter (from 3.2 cm 1 year earlier) at the level of the bifurcation; lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum, right hilar, and gastrohepatic regions was unchanged. There were no pleural or pericardial effusions, and there was no pulmonary embolus. The next day, repeat electrocardiography revealed normal sinus rhythm with first-degree atrioventricular block (PR interval, 268 msec) and additional laboratory testing was performed (Table 1). On evaluation by a cardiologist 2 weeks later, the patient reported that the chest pain was localized to the upper sternum, was worse on deep inspiration, and had improved with ibuprofen. Arthralgias had developed, and he felt fatigued. He reported that his breathing felt “shallow” at times. On examination, there was no jugular venous distention or peripheral edema; heart sounds were normal and there were no cardiac murmurs or rubs. A cardiac stress test was negative. Five days later, he returned to his primary care physician, reporting arthralgias involving the neck, shoulders, hips, knees, elbows, and wrists, without swelling, for the past several weeks, and 1 week of drenching night sweats. The physical examination was normal; there was no joint swelling or tenderness. Serum levels of electrolytes, lipids, parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and thyrotropin were normal, as were the results of renal- and liver-function tests. Tests for antibodies to double-stranded DNA, anti-Smith, anti-RNP, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide IgG, anti-La, and anti-Ro were negative, as were tests for hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency viruses, a mono-spot test for mononucleosis, a rapid plasma reagin test, and testing for Lyme disease and hepatitis B virus surface antigen. Other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. A tuberculin skin test was negative. Two days later, he saw a rheumatologist. The arthralgias were associated with morning stiffness, and he rated the pain as 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, where 10 is the most severe. Physical examination disclosed oropharyngeal erythema and some pain on internal and external rotation of both hips and on movement of the shoulders; there was a cool, minimal effusion of the left knee; the remainder of the examination was normal. Echocardiography revealed a normal ejection fraction and mitral valve, mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation, mild right atrial enlargement, and a mildly dilated right ventricle. Homogeneous echodensities within the main pulmonary artery narrowed the lumen to approximately 1 cm; the lumen of the right pulmonary artery was approximately 0.8 cm at its origin. The flow velocities in the main pulmonary artery were increased, with a peak gradient of 33 mm Hg and a mean gradient of 16 mm Hg. Velocities at the level of the pulmonary valve were normal. Estimated right ventricular systolic pressure was 46 mm Hg. There was a small pleural effusion and no evidence of pericardial constriction. Specimens of blood and urine were sent for culture and were sterile. Results of additional laboratory tests are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Prednisone (7.5 mg daily) and doxycycline (100 mg twice daily for 2 weeks) were added. Two weeks later, severe joint pain persisted and oxycodone as needed was prescribed. Night sweats had decreased in severity, but chest pain recurred occasionally. On follow-up 2 weeks after that (1 week before admission), cardiac auscultation revealed a prominently split second heart sound with a loud pulmonic valve component, which had not been present on examination 2 weeks earlier. There was a new systolic murmur (grade 1 to 2 out of 6) at the left upper sternal border. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was scheduled, and low-molecular-weight heparin was initiated. Four days before admission, on follow-up with the rheumatologist, the physical examination was unchanged; the results of urinalysis are shown in Table 2. Prednisone (15 mg daily) was begun. The patient repeatedly declined hospitalization. On the day before admission, MRI of the chest showed that the mediastinum contained extensive soft tissue, which surrounded the ascending thoracic aorta and portions of the right pulmonary artery, with approximately 80% reduction in the diameter of the lumen of the proximal portion of the right pulmonary artery and moderate compression of the left pulmonary artery. The mediastinal tissue was isointense as compared with skeletal muscle on T1-weighted images, hyperintense as compared with skeletal muscle on T2-weighted images, and enhanced after the administration of gadolinium. The next day, the patient was admitted to the hospital. The patient rated the pain in his chest and joints as 6 to 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, where 10 is the most severe. He did not have a cough, hemop-tysis, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, rhinitis, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, melena, hemato-chezia, sinusitis, dysuria, urinary urgency, visible hematuria, trouble voiding, or skin rash. He had a history of optic neuritis 5 years earlier, with loss of vision in the right eye, enhancement of the frontal meninges and both optic nerves on MRI, and a right hilar lymph node (1 cm in diameter) on CT of the chest. Laboratory-test results from that time are shown in Table 1. Pathological examination of a lung-biopsy specimen showed no malignant tumor cells or granu-lomas. He was treated with glucocorticoids, but right periorbital headaches developed, right optic-nerve enhancement on MRI persisted, and pseudo-tumor cerebri developed. Prednisone (100 mg per day), acetazolamide, and oxcarbazepine were administered. Approximately 15 months before admission, corticosteroids were tapered and then discontinued. Intermittent headaches continued and were treated with ibuprofen. There was a history of renal calculi 4 years earlier and multiple fractures after a fall 20 years earlier. He was allergic to penicillin. He was a former smoker and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. He was divorced, was sexually active, and worked as a machinist. His father had died in a motor vehicle accident, his maternal grandfather had congestive heart failure, his maternal grandmother had had a brain tumor, his mother had fibromyalgia, a paternal female cousin had become blind at a young age, and his children were in good health. Medications included pred-nisone (15 mg daily), ibuprofen (800 mg three times daily), and oxycodone–acetaminophen for pain, as well as low-molecular-weight heparin. On examination, the patient appeared tired. The blood pressure was 116/71 mm Hg, the pulse 74 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, the temperature 36.3°C, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The conjunctivae and oropharynx were injected. Visual acuity was impaired in the right eye. There was no jugular venous distention while sitting, and carotid volume and stroke were normal. No bruits were heard. The first heart sound was absent, the second heart sound was loud with a prominent split, and a systolic ejection murmur (grade 1 to 2 out of 6) was loudest at the left upper sternal border. There were soft lymph nodes (1 to 2 cm in diameter) that were palpable in the axillae bilaterally, trace edema of the legs, and mild tenderness in the large muscle groups, with 4+/5 strength diffusely. There was full range of motion in all joints and no swelling, redness, or effusions. The remainder of the examination was normal. Serum levels of electrolytes, bilirubin, calcium, glucose, and magnesium phosphorus and the results of liver- and renal-function tests were normal. Tests for creatine kinase isoenzymes and troponin I were negative. Other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. During the first three hospital days, night sweats occurred and the maximum temperature was 38.1°C. On the third day, CT of the chest performed with the use of contrast material showed increased soft tissue encasing the great vessels and the ascending aorta, with slight narrowing of the aortic lumen and further narrowing of the pulmonary artery at its origin and at the bifurcation. Swelling of the metacarpal and proximal interphalangeal joints of both hands developed, with tenderness on palpation and decreased of range of motion; swelling and limited range of motion in both ankles and numbness over the dorsum of the feet also developed. Cyto-logic examination of the urine was negative; results of analysis of the urine are shown in Table 2. On the fourth hospital day, MRI of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine disclosed no abnormalities. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2008,27,nejm-case-2008-27,"A 64-Year-Old Man with Abdominal Pain, Nausea, and an Elevated Level of Serum Creatinine","A 64-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of abdominal pain, nausea, and an elevated level of serum creatinine. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 4 months before admission, when he was admitted to this hospital for 10 days because of abdominal pain. Acute pancreatitis and gastritis due to Helico-bacter pylori were diagnosed. His symptoms diminished minimally after treatment with amoxicillin, metronidazole, and a proton-pump inhibitor and a shift to a bland diet. During the next 2 months, he was evaluated repeatedly by gastroenter-ologists, visited the emergency department multiple times because of abdominal pain, and was then readmitted to this hospital for 5 days. The findings on endoscopic ultrasonography were suggestive of pancreatic-duct dilatation; biopsy specimens of gastric mucosa were negative for H. pylori. Eighteen days after discharge, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography showed no dilatation of the pancreatic duct. The abdominal pain gradually diminished. Approximately 1 month before the current admission, the patient noted red blood in his stools and intermittently on toilet tissue. Abdominal and rectal examinations performed by his physician 2 weeks later (11 days before admission) were normal; occult blood was detected in the stool. One week before admission, the patient reported epigastric pain that was similar to the pain he had experienced earlier, along with other symptoms of reflux. Anorexia, nausea, and occasional vomiting developed and persisted despite decreased oral intake. Four days before admission, colonoscopic examination revealed nonbleeding, external hemorrhoids that were small (<1 cm in diameter); the findings were otherwise normal. During the next 3 days, the patient stopped eating and drinking, but the abdominal pain and retching worsened. He came to the emergency department of this hospital. On admission, the patient described the pain as primarily epigastric, radiating sporadically to the right upper quadrant and right flank, and he rated it as 6 on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 representing the most severe pain. He had a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypertension, benign prostatic hypertrophy, cluster headaches, and chronic back pain with degenerative joint disease, stenoses, and spondylosis at multiple levels. Colonic polyps had been seen on endoscopy 3 years earlier. Previous surgical procedures included resection of the soft palate for carcinoma (more than 10 years earlier), excision of a lipoma from the neck, hydrocele repair, and arthroscopic surgery of the left knee. He had not taken nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications, and he had no history of recent travel or infectious exposures. Medications included esomeprazole and nifedipine daily, and oxy-codone (10 mg) as needed. He had no allergies to medications. The patient was a machinist but had stopped working several years earlier because of back pain. He had been born in the southeastern United States, was divorced, and was in a monogamous heterosexual relationship. He had no history of sexually transmitted diseases. He had a 20-pack-year history of tobacco smoking but had stopped 15 years earlier; he had also been a heavy alcohol user in the past but had stopped 7 months earlier. He did not use illicit drugs. His mother had died at the age of 80 years from heart disease, his father had died in a motor vehicle accident, and a sister had hypertension. His six children were healthy. On examination in the emergency department, the temperature was 36.4°C, the blood pressure 178/88 mm Hg, the pulse 54 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The skin was diapho-retic. The uvula was absent, and the palate was asymmetric. Range of motion in the neck was decreased; the jugular veins were distended to 7 cm. The abdomen was flat, with active bowel sounds, normal tympany, and tenderness on palpation in the right upper and right lower quadrants and suprapubic region. The liver edge was smooth and was palpated 3 to 4 cm below the right costal margin. Rectal tone was normal, and there was no blood in the stool. The reflexes were 1 out of 4 diffusely, and there was no clonus. The remainder of the examination was normal. The platelet count, white-cell count, coagulation studies, and tests of liver and thyroid function, as well as serum levels of glucose, protein, globulin, and albumin, were normal. Test results for myocardial infarction were negative. Other laboratory-test results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. A chest radiograph revealed a linear density in the peripheral right upper lobe that was thought to be atelectasis. An electrocardiogram revealed left atrial enlargement with sinus bradycardia. Abdominal ultrasonography showed slightly decreased liver echotexture that was suggestive of edema, with no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, a normal gallbladder, a common bile duct that was 5 mm in diameter, a diffusely hypoechoic pancreas, and a normal spleen. The right kidney was 12.7 cm in length, and the left kidney 10.7 cm. There was a renal cyst, 1.4 cm in diameter, on the left side, with no hydroneph-rosis or stones. Acetylsalicylic acid, morphine (total dose, 4 mg), magnesium sulfate, ranitidine, and nitroglycerin were administered and 4 liters of intravenous fluid infused during the first 12 hours of care in the emergency department. The urinary output was 650 ml, and peripheral edema developed. The patient was admitted to the hospital 12 hours after his arrival in the emergency department. Results of laboratory tests during the next 8 days are shown in Table 1. Serum protein electrophoresis was normal, and a test for antinuclear antibody was negative; the H. pylori antibody titer was 1.90 (a ratio >1.09 is considered positive), and a stool specimen for H. pylori antigen was negative. Screening for toxins revealed opiates in the urine and was otherwise negative. Testing for antibody against the human immunodeficiency virus was negative, and no Bence Jones proteins were detected in a concentrated urine specimen. Follow-up ultrasonograms of the abdomen on the second and third days revealed new dilatation of the main pancreatic duct and kidneys of normal size, with no evidence of renal-artery stenosis. A culture of the urine grew enteric gram-negative rods, proteus species, and probable enterococcus; levofloxacin and amoxicillin–clavanulate were administered for 7 days. On the fifth hospital day, intravenous fluid and furosemide were administered. Laboratory-test results from the sixth hospital day are shown in Tables 1 and 2. On the seventh hospital day, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pancreas revealed a normal pancreas, minimal dilatation of the proximal intrahepatic biliary tree, a right adrenal adenoma that was 1.2 cm in diameter, and scattered hepatic cysts that appeared benign. The next day, cultures of the blood and urine were sterile. Serum levels of vitamin B12 and folate were normal; the results of other laboratory tests are shown in Tables 1 and 2. A diagnostic procedure was performed on the 11th hospital day.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2018,27,nejm-case-2018-27,A 3-Year-Old Boy with Seizures,"Dr. Caitlin E. Naureckas Li (Pediatrics): A 3-year-old boy was admitted to this hospital during the summer because of a seizure. The patient had been well until 3 days before admission, when one episode of emesis occurred. The following evening, he was fussy, and on the third day of illness, he had decreased language output and one loose bowel movement. That evening, he told his mother that he wanted to sleep, which was atypical behavior. One minute after the patient lay down, he suddenly sat up; his whole body stiffened, and he did not respond to his name being called. His mother noted that he felt warm to the touch, that his head was turned to the left, and that he appeared to be “staring off into space.” Both arms were flexed, and there were shaking movements of the arms and legs that were greater on the left side than on the right side. After 1 minute, the movements stopped and the patient vomited; he seemed to be confused and then fell asleep. Emergency medical services were called. On examination 10 minutes later, he was somnolent but arousable and had spontaneous movements of the arms and legs. He vomited again and was transported to the emergency department of another hospital, arriving 25 minutes after the episode. On examination, the patient was alert, active, and in no apparent distress. The temperature was 36.9°C; other vital signs were normal. The weight was 15.8 kg (71st percentile). Strength, sensation, coordination, and cranial-nerve function were normal, as was the remainder of the physical examination. The blood glucose level, obtained by fingerstick testing, was 105 mg per deciliter (5.8 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). The patient vomited, and ondansetron was administered orally. Early the following morning, after a pediatric neurologist was consulted, the patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital. The history was obtained from the patient’s mother. There had been no known head trauma or toxic ingestion. The patient had been born after a full-term gestation and had had normal growth and development, except for a previous mild speech delay; he currently knew at least 200 words and spoke in full sentences. He had not received vaccines for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus inf luenzae type b, hepatitis B virus, or rotavirus because of parental refusal; he had received other routine childhood vaccines. He did not take any medications or have any known allergies. He lived with his parents and siblings in an urban area of New England. There were no pets at home. There was no family history of seizures. On examination, the patient was sleeping; he awoke when touched and pushed the examiner away. The temperature was 37.4°C, the pulse 86 beats per minute, the blood pressure 100/59 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. The pupils were round, equal, and reactive to light, decreasing from 3 mm to 2 mm in diameter; there was no ptosis. The face was symmetric, with normal forehead wrinkling, blinking, smiling, and cheek puffing. Muscle bulk and tone were normal, as was strength. The patient withdrew from tickling. Deep-tendon reflexes were 1+ throughout, and plantar reflexes were flexor. The remainder of the examination was normal. The red-cell count, red-cell indexes, platelet count, and results of renal- and liver-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, calcium, and magnesium; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed, and a T2-weighted single-shot turbo spin–echo image showed normal ventricles and no extraaxial fluid collection, mass lesion, or midline shift. Electroencephalography (EEG), performed 12 hours after the seizure, revealed continuous focal polymorphic delta slowing and occasional broad sharp wave discharges over the right frontal region. That afternoon, the patient’s temperature was 38.2°C; acetaminophen was adminis-tered. He was observed overnight and had no seizure activity, and the following morning, he was discharged home. One week after discharge, the patient was taken back to the emergency department of the other hospital. His mother reported that he had been well for the 2 days after discharge, but for the past 5 days, he had had progressively decreased language output, increased sleep (such that he was now sleeping for most of the day, awakening for only 10 minutes at a time), decreased oral intake, and constipation that could not be relieved by orally administered polyethylene glycol. During the past 2 days, mood lability had developed; there had been periods when he seemed enraged and was physically and verbally aggressive toward family members, as well as periods when he laughed hysterically, and these moods had not been provoked. He had babbled, repeated unusual phrases, and lost interest in games, toys, and videos; his gait had become increasingly unsteady, with frequent tripping. On the day of this presentation, writhing movements had occurred after he ate and drank; his mother thought these movements might have been caused by abdominal pain. In addition, his urine output had decreased. On examination, the patient was quiet, with a flat affect and subdued behavior. Vital signs were normal; the weight was 14.7 kg (48th percentile). The oral mucous membranes were dry. The abdomen was soft and flat, without tenderness; bowel sounds were normal. The patient followed some commands and then fell asleep during the examination. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood glucose level, obtained by fingerstick testing, was 76 mg per deciliter (4.2 mmol per liter), and abdominal radiography revealed feces in the colon, without evidence of obstruction. Normal saline was administered intravenously; 1 hour later, the red-cell count, red-cell indexes, platelet count, results of renal- and liver-function tests, and venous blood gas measurements were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, calcium, magnesium, thyrotropin, and free thyroxine. A serum toxicology screen was negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed increased bowel gas, without evidence of intus-susception. The patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation and treatment. In the emergency department, the patient was somnolent but aroused in response to voice; he made only limited eye contact with his parents and the examiner and had unintelligible speech. There was one unprovoked episode of agitation and screaming. Vital signs were normal. The pupils were round, equal, and reactive to light, decreasing from 5 mm to 2 mm in diameter. He blinked in response to threat bilaterally. Extraocular movements were intact, without nystagmus. The face was symmetric, and the tongue was midline. The neck was supple. The patient moved the arms and legs equally and had normal strength and normal sensation to light touch. Deep-tendon reflexes were 2+ throughout. Plantar reflexes were flexor. The gait was unsteady and ataxic. The remainder of the examination was normal. A sodium phos-phate–based enema was administered, and the patient had a large bowel movement. He was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment. The following day, magnetic resonance angiography of the head was normal. MRI of the head and spine was performed before and after the intravenous administration of contrast material, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images revealed a small number of scattered, punctate, nonspecific hyperintense foci in the white matter of the brain and mild, scattered mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinus, without other abnormalities. A lumbar puncture was performed; the results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis are shown in Table 2. A plasma sample was sent for acylcarnitine profile analysis, and tests of a nasopharyngeal swab for adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, and metapneumovirus antigens were negative. Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.017, a pH of 6.0, and 1+ ketones. Intravenous fluids, acyclovir, and oral acetaminophen and ibuprofen were administered. During the third and fourth hospital days, the patient had episodes of irritability, thrashing, and screaming, as well as intermittent stereotyped arm movements, athetoid hand movements, and orofacial dyskinesias. Video EEG revealed generalized polymorphic slowing of the resting background (at a rate of 2 to 5 Hz), even while the patient was in a maximally awake state; the abnormal movements had no correlate on EEG. On the morning of the fifth hospital day, apnea occurred, with associated tachycardia, hypertension, opisthotonic posturing, and jaw clenching. Ventilation with a bag-valve-mask device was difficult to administer. Midazolam, fentanyl, and rocuroni-um were administered intravenously, the trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was begun; thereafter, the posturing resolved and vital signs normalized. The patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU). A diagnosis and management decisions were made.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2020,19,nejm-case-2020-19,A 74-Year-Old Man with Acute Respiratory Failure and Unclear Goals of Care,"Dr. Kathy M. Tran: A 74-year-old man with mantle-cell lymphoma was admitted to this hospital during the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic because of acute respiratory failure. One day before this admission, productive cough and dyspnea developed. The next day, when the patient was being evaluated at home by a visiting nurse, the oxygen saturation was 85% while he was breathing ambient air. Emergency medical services were called, and on their arrival, treatment with continuous positive airway pressure was initiated. The patient was transported by ambulance to this hospital. In the emergency department, the patient reported severe shortness of breath. He had no fever, chills, chest pain, abdominal distention, diarrhea, or leg swelling. Additional history was obtained from the patient’s wife by telephone. Twenty-three years before this admission, the patient had received a diagnosis of metastatic mantle-cell lymphoma, and several different regimens of chemotherapy had been used for the treatment of progressive disease. Four years before this admission, gastrointestinal bleeding had occurred because of a duodenal ulcer, resulting in hemorrhagic shock; 3 years before this admission, severe gastrointestinal bleeding had recurred because of an esophageal ulcer. At that time, an inpatient medical team had discussed goals of care with the patient, and a status of “do not resuscitate” (DNR) had been assigned. Three weeks before this admission, the patient had undergone transcatheter mitral valve repair for the treatment of mitral regurgitation. One week later, veneto-clax therapy was initiated. Shortness of breath developed, and furosemide was administered. An inpatient medical team discussed goals of care with the patient, who explained that he had agreed to a DNR status several years earlier, when he had been “very sick and near death” and “in a different place”; a new status of “full code” was assigned. The patient had coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic renal insufficiency, obstructive sleep apnea, and gout. Medications included veneto-clax, furosemide, aspirin, atorvastatin, amlodipine, levothyroxine, allopurinol, omeprazole, alfuzosin, finasteride, riboflavin, as-corbic acid, calcium carbonate, and cholecalciferol. On examination, the patient appeared to be in respiratory distress. The temperature was 35.9°C, the pulse 98 beats per minute, the blood pressure 129/58 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was receiving oxygen through a nonrebreather face mask at a rate of 6 liters per minute; the oxygen saturation decreased to 87% with minimal exertion. Heart sounds were regular, and a systolic murmur was present; both lungs were clear on auscultation. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Radiography of the chest revealed bibasilar patchy and interstitial opacities and small bilateral pleural effusions (Fig. 1). Furosemide, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and oseltamivir were administered intravenously. Ninety minutes after the patient arrived in the emergency department, the oxygen saturation decreased to 74%, and the rate of supplemental oxygen was increased to 15 liters per minute. Preparations were made for intubation of the trachea and initiation of mechanical ventilation. The emergency department team was concerned about the likelihood of benefit of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and intubation; an urgent palliative care consultation was requested.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,10,nejm-case-2010-10,A 37-Year-Old Woman with Weakness and a Mass in the Brain,"Dr. Brian P. Walcott (Neurosurgery): A 37-year-old, right-handed woman was admitted to this hospital because of vertigo, left-sided weakness, and a mass in the brain on imaging studies. The patient was in her usual state of health until 3 days before admission, when she suddenly had a sensation of the room spinning, associated with nausea and an unsteady gait. After approximately 4 hours, she went to the emergency department of another hospital. While in the emergency department, her symptoms worsened and numbness and weakness developed suddenly in the left arm. Subsequently, she had pain in the left thigh and involuntary movements of the left leg, which lasted for 25 minutes and resolved with the administration of intravenous lorazepam. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reportedly revealed a ring-enhancing mass, measuring 8 mm by 9 mm, in the right parietal lobe of the brain. Computed tomographic (CT) scans of the chest reportedly showed an enhancing, lobulated mass in the right lower lobe of the lung, with features consistent with an arterio-venous malformation. Levetiracetam was begun, and she was admitted to that hospital; no further seizures occurred. At the patient’s request, she was transferred on the third day to this hospital and admitted to the neurosurgical service. The patient did not have fever, chills, headache, sinus or ear pain, abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhea. She had a recent diagnosis of endometriosis, and an endometrial biopsy had been performed 2 weeks before admission. A dental procedure had been performed 9 days before presentation, with drainage of periodontal abscesses of the right upper quadrant. Since childhood, she had had numerous episodes of epistaxis. She had a long history of anemia and had been told she had a form of thalassemia. She worked in an office, was married, and lived with her husband and four children. She did not smoke, consume alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She had not traveled recently. She was of Italian and Irish ancestry. Her father had congenital heart disease and had a valve replacement at 45 years of age, and one brother had cardiac valvular disease. Her mother, other siblings, and children were well. No members of her immediate family were known to have similar problems. She was allergic to sulfonamides and erythromy-cin. She had not taken any medications at home before this illness. Medications on admission included levetiracetam. The temperature was 36.6°C, the pulse 82 beats per minute, the blood pressure 100/66 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. There were no cutaneous or buccal telangiecta-sias. There was packing over the gingiva of the right upper quadrant but no tenderness or evidence of active infection. There was no tenderness to palpation over the sinuses or mastoids. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy. The heart sounds were normal, with no murmurs. The lungs were clear on auscultation and the abdomen was soft and nontender. On neurologic examination, the patient was alert and fully oriented. The pupils were 3.5 mm in diameter and symmetrically reactive to light exposure. The extraocular movements and visual acuity were intact, and the results of confrontation tests showed that the visual fields were normal. Sensation to light touch was decreased on the left side, with the leg affected more than the arm. Strength and deep-tendon reflexes were normal. The remainder of the detailed neurologic examination was normal. The white-cell count was 14,500 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000) and the platelet count was normal; the hematocrit was 32.4% (reference range, 36.0 to 46.0), the hemoglobin level 10.6 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0), the mean corpuscular volume 65 fl (reference range, 80 to 100), the mean corpuscular hemoglobin 21.3 pg per red cell (reference range, 26.0 to 34.0), the red-cell distribution width 19.1% (reference range, 11.5 to 14.5), and the C-reactive protein level 13.2 mg per liter (reference range for evaluation of inflammation, <8). Other routine laboratory tests, including measurement of electrolyte levels and tests of coagulation and of liver and renal function, were normal. MRI of the brain revealed an enhancing lesion, 1.9 cm by 2.2 cm by 2.8 cm, in the right posterior cingulate gyrus, associated with surrounding T2-weighted signal hyperintensity within the left posterior frontal and parietal lobes. On diffusion-weighted sequences, there were areas of restricted diffusion within the lesion but not beyond the area of susceptibility. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed a decrease in the N-acetyl aspartate peak, without definite evidence of a lactate doublet or a markedly elevated ratio of choline to creatinine associated with the lesion. Later that day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2017,34,nejm-case-2017-34,"A 76-Year-Old Man with Fever, Weight Loss, and Weakness","Dr. Benjamin R. Robbins (Psychiatry): A 76-year-old man was admitted to this hospital in the late summer because of weight loss, generalized weakness, and fever. The patient had been well until 3 weeks before admission, when he began to have decreased energy and poor appetite, symptoms that were associated with a weight loss of 4.5 kg. The next week, he was evaluated by his primary care physician. The patient reported dyspnea on exertion, diffuse myalgias, and severe fatigue that prevented him from engaging in his usual activities of walking outside, gardening, and swimming in the ocean. On examination, the temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 124/73 mm Hg, the pulse 59 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, vitamin B12, and thyrotropin were normal, as were the results of renal- and liver-function tests and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Tests for hepatitis C antibodies, antitreponemal antibodies, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) p24 antigen, and HIV type 1 and type 2 antibodies were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A stool test was positive for occult blood, and a diagnostic colonoscopy was scheduled. Three days before admission, the patient felt feverish but did not check his temperature at home. Fevers continued, despite the use of acetaminophen. One day before admission, he had one episode of nonbloody, nonbilious vomiting. On the day of admission, the patient had an unwitnessed fall while he was standing in the bathroom; he reported that he had felt generally weak and had tried to sit down but fell backward and struck his head, without loss of consciousness. He was found on the floor by a family member and was unable to stand up. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital. On evaluation in the emergency department, the patient reported generalized myalgias but no headache, photophobia, or neck stiffness. He had a history of hypertension, non–insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and vitamin D deficiency. Medications included lisinopril and aspirin; the diabetes was controlled by diet. He had no family history of cancer or autoimmune disease. He had not smoked tobacco in 30 years but had previously smoked 1 pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years. He drank alcohol occasionally and did not use illicit drugs. He was retired, resided in New England, and had not traveled outside the region in several years. He did not have pets or known exposures to bats. He had recently cleaned out the basement of his home, where he had occasionally seen mice. On examination, the temperature was 38.9°C, the blood pressure 140/64 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was diaphoretic but did not appear ill. He was alert and oriented, and he answered questions appropriately. Examination of cranial nerves II through XII was normal. Strength and sensation to light touch were intact in the arms and legs. Deep-tendon reflexes in the arms and legs were normal; the plantar reflex was flexor bilaterally. Examination of the neck, heart, lungs, and abdomen was normal. There was no rash. Blood specimens were obtained for culture. A urinalysis was unremarkable; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Pamela W. Schaefer: Computed tomography of the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material. Imaging studies of the head did not show evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarction. The lungs were normal, with no pleural effusion or lymphade-nopathy. Mild circumferential thickening of the middle and distal esophagus was noted. No focal hepatic lesions, thickening or distention of the gastrointestinal tract, or suspicious lytic or blas-tic lesions of the bones were noted. Dr. Robbins: The patient was admitted to the hospital. During the next 12 hours, altered mental status developed, with progressive confusion, difficulties with word finding, and inability to consistently follow commands. Several attempts at lumbar puncture for analysis of the cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) were unsuccessful, and empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cef-triaxone, ampicillin, and acyclovir was initiated. Additional studies were obtained. Dr. Schaefer: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images showed scattered foci of signal abnormalities in the supratentorial white matter, with no evidence of intracranial mass, hemorrhage, or acute infarction. Dr. Robbins: Electroencephalography revealed intermittent irregular delta slowing that was most prominent in the left frontocentral area and intermittent diffuse theta slowing in the background, with no epileptiform abnormalities. On the second hospital day, a lumbar punc-ture revealed an opening pressure of 19.5 cm of water; other results are shown in Table 1. Doxycy-cline was administered orally. Fevers continued, despite the administration of acetaminophen. The blood cultures had no growth. Progressive tachypnea developed, and the patient was unable to lie in a recumbent position to undergo repeat MRI of the head. Elective intubation was performed, and mechanical ventilation was initiated. Dr. Schaefer: On the fourth hospital day, repeat MRI of the head was performed. FLAIR images showed new mild, diffuse hyperintensity in the sulci, and FLAIR and T2-weighted images showed mild hyperintensity in the medial thalami and medial temporal lobes (Fig. 1). Dr. Robbins: Physical examination, which was performed while the patient was not receiving sedation, revealed decreased tone and no spontaneous movements of the arms or legs, findings consistent with flaccid paralysis. There was also no withdrawal in response to nail-bed pressure, and deep-tendon reflexes were absent in the arms, knees, and ankles bilaterally. The patient opened his eyes but did not regard or track the examiner and did not respond to requests. The diameter of the pupils was 3 mm bilaterally and decreased to 2 mm in response to bright light. The corneal reflexes and cough reflex were intact, but there was no grimace in response to pressure in the supraorbital notch. On the 10th hospital day, nerve-conduction studies were performed. The sensory responses of the left median and ulnar nerves were prolonged and had moderately-to-severely reduced amplitude, and the motor responses of the bilateral median nerves had severely reduced amplitude, normal conduction velocities, and normal durations. Stimulation of the muscles by means of needle electromyography revealed abundant fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves in the left deltoid, extensor digitorum communis, first dorsal interosseous, and tibialis anterior muscles, as well as increased insertional activity in the left vastus lateralis and medial gastroc-nemius muscles and no voluntary motor units in the left arm or leg. A diagnostic test was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2023,29,nejm-case-2023-29,A 34-Year-Old Woman with Abdominal Distention and Acute Kidney Injury,"Dr. Matthew B. Roberts (Medicine): A 34-year-old woman with a history of end-stage liver disease due to alcohol use disorder was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal distention, fatigue, and acute kidney injury that occurred 10 months after orthotopic liver transplantation. Two weeks before the current admission, fatigue, weakness, and anorexia developed, along with associated myalgias and night sweats. Three days before the current admission, three to five episodes of nonbloody, watery diarrhea occurred. The next day, symptoms did not abate, and the patient presented to another hospital for evaluation. She reported no fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dyspnea, or swelling of the legs. The temporal temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 76/49 mm Hg, the pulse 132 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. She appeared thin and frail. There was abdominal distention without tenderness. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. The blood cre-atinine level was 3.25 mg per deciliter (287 μmol per liter; reference range, 0.55 to 1.30 mg per deciliter [49 to 115 μmol per liter]), which was higher than the level obtained 1 month earlier (1.27 mg per deciliter [112 μmol per liter]). The blood sodium level was 120 mmol per liter (reference range, 136 to 146) and the potassium level 6.3 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.6 to 5.2); additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Three liters of fluids, hydrocortisone, piperacillin–tazobactam, and vancomycin were administered intravenously, and the blood pressure increased. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a large volume of ascitic fluid and scattered areas of high-density material. Paracentesis was performed, and 1300 ml of as-citic fluid was removed. Analysis of the ascitic fluid was notable for more than 1000 red cells per microliter, 2099 nucleated cells per microliter (with 400 neutro-phils per microliter), and numerous atypical cells that were not further characterized. Blood and ascitic fluid specimens were obtained for culture. CME at NEJM.org On the second hospital day, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of this hospital because of concern for sepsis. She reported persistent fatigue, weakness, myalgias, and watery diarrhea. Additional history was obtained. Twenty-two months before this admission, the patient had been admitted to the other hospital because of abnormal results on liver-function tests. She had received a diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis complicated by cirrhosis with ascites. Treatment with a short course of prednisone had been initiated, furosemide administered, and large-volume paracentesis performed for the management of ascites. The patient had been advised to discontinue alcohol consumption. Ten months later, and 12 months before the current admission, the patient had been admitted to this hospital because of decompensated liver disease complicated by hepatorenal syndrome. Renal replacement therapy had been initiated, and small-volume paracentesis had been performed to obtain ascitic fluid for cytologic and hematologic analysis. Dr. Robert P. Hasserjian: Analysis of the ascitic fluid performed 12 months before the current admission had been notable for 44 nucleated cells per microliter, of which 1% were lymphocytes, 53% monocytes, 17% macrophages, and 29% atypical-appearing plasma cells (Fig. 1A). These findings had prompted flow cytometric analysis of the ascitic fluid, which had revealed a clonal plasma cell population with lambda light-chain restriction (Fig. 1B) but no evidence of a monoclonal B-cell or unusual T-cell population. Dr. Roberts: Twelve months before the current admission, the serum IgG level had been 1394 mg per deciliter (reference range, 614 to 1295), the IgA level 885 mg per deciliter (reference range, 69 to 309), and the IgM level 177 mg per deciliter (reference range, 53 to 334). Serum protein electrophoresis had revealed a diffuse increase in the gamma globulin level in a normal pattern; no monoclonal protein had been detected on immunofixation. The serum level of free kappa light chains had been 246.2 mg per liter (reference range, 3.3 to 19.4) and the level of free lambda light chains 78.4 mg per liter (reference range, 5.7 to 26.3), with a kappa:lambda ratio of 3.14 (reference range, 0.26 to 1.65). A bone marrow biopsy had been performed, and analysis of the bone marrow had revealed 5% plasma cells, which were polytypic for kappa and lambda light chains on in situ hybridization. Flow cytometric analysis of the bone marrow had revealed no clonal plasma cells or abnormal lymphocytes. tomography (PET) and CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis had revealed a cirrhotic liver with evidence of portal hypertension, including abdominal varices and ascites, but no focal masses or lymphadenopathy. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission Taken together, these findings had been considered to be due to liver disease, an inflammatory state, and kidney dysfunction, and the patient had been listed for liver transplantation. Ten months before the current admission, or-thotopic liver transplantation had been performed. Pretransplantation testing for Epstein– Barr virus (EBV) IgG and cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG had been positive in both the donor and the recipient. The explanted native liver had shown micronodular cirrhosis with mildly inflamed septa and evidence of iron overload. The immediate post-transplantation course had been notable for intraperitoneal hemorrhage, as well as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium bactere-mia and recurrent peritonitis. The patient had been discharged to a rehabilitation facility 21 days after transplantation. Three months after liver transplantation, and 7 months before the current admission, biliary stent obstruction and multidrug-resistant Kleb­siella pneumoniae bacteremia had developed. The biliary stent had been removed and intravenous antibiotic agents administered. Four months before the current admission, asymptomatic CMV viremia had developed. Outpatient treatment with valganciclovir had been initiated. The patient had remained well until the current admission. At the time of the current admission, medications included aspirin, atovaquone, vitamin B complex, calcium citrate, vitamin D3, ferrous sulfate, fludrocortisone, gabapentin, magnesium, melatonin, mycophenolate, omeprazole, prednisone, tacrolimus, and ursodiol. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was born in New England and lived with her mother. She had not traveled outside the region, and there had been no animal exposures. The patient had stopped drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes approximately 2 years before the current admission. There was no illicit drug use. Her mother and father both had cardiac and liver disease; her maternal grandfather also had liver disease. On examination, the temperature was 36.7°C, the blood pressure 100/53 mm Hg, the heart rate 114 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21. The patient appeared thin and frail. An abdominal examination revealed moderate distention, shifting dullness, and softness without tenderness. There was no hepatospleno-megaly or lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Treatment with intravenous cefepime and linezolid and oral van-comycin was initiated, and intravenous fluids were continued. Blood, urine, and stool specimens were obtained for culture. Dr. Mark A. Anderson: PET-CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed multifocal, predominantly peritoneal FDG-avid masses, as well as diffuse FDG uptake along the surface of large-bowel and small-bowel loops (Fig. 2). These findings had not been present on a CT scan obtained 1 year earlier. Dr. Roberts: Testing for Clostridioides difficile toxin in stool was positive. Treatment with intravenous antibiotics was stopped, and oral vanco-mycin was continued. The diarrhea abated, and the hypotension resolved. On the third hospital day, the blood creatinine level decreased to 2.25 mg per deciliter (199 μmol per liter); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood, urine, and stool cultures were negative. Diagnostic paracentesis was performed, and analysis of the ascitic fluid was notable for 2018 nucleated cells per microliter, of which 30% were unclassified; additional results are shown in Table 1. A diagnostic test was performed. ","{'Infection': [], 'Cancer': [], 'Primary Effusion Lymphoma': [], 'Post-transplantation Lymphoproliferative Disorder': [], 'Hypergammaglobulinemia': []}","Multiple myeloma. The mass contained sheets of large cells (Fig. 3A) that were positive for MUM1, CD138, CD56, and lambda light chains (Fig. 3B, 3C, and 3D) and were negative for CD20, CD19, kappa light chains, HHV-8, and EBV (on Epstein–Barr encoding region in situ hybridization). The large cells also strongly expressed MYC and had a Ki-67 proliferation index of 80%. Similar cells were seen in the ascitic fluid. Flow cytometric analysis of the ascitic fluid revealed that they were clonal plasma cells that expressed monotypic lambda light chains. A bone marrow biopsy was also performed. The bone marrow contained clusters of large, neoplastic plasma cells with prominent nucleoli (Fig. 3E). On analysis of a smear of bone marrow aspirate, 15% of the cells were highly atypical plasma cells with prominent nucleoli (Fig. 3F). On flow cytometric analysis, these cells expressed monotypic lambda light chains. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of the bone marrow aspirate revealed a MYC rearrangement, an IGH rearrangement, a 1q22 duplication, and a deletion of the TP53 locus at 17p13.1. Next-generation sequencing revealed pathogenic variants in HRAS, STAT3, and ARID1A. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation showed an IgA lambda M component (2.28 g per deciliter). The overall findings confirmed a diagnosis of plasma cell myeloma with plasmablastic features. Plasmablastic plasma cell myeloma has morphologic and immunophenotypic features similar to those of plasmablastic lymphoma, but plasmablastic lymphoma is usually positive for EBV and is not typically associated with a high serum paraprotein level. Although a clonal plasma cell population had been identified in the ascitic fluid in this patient before liver transplantation, the unusual fluid-based presentation in the absence of tissue masses, bone marrow involvement, and paraprotein had precluded a definitive diagnosis of plasma cell myeloma at that time; in rare cases, clonal plasma cells may be identified in fluid specimens in reactive conditions.5,6 Nevertheless, because this clonal plasma cell population had been present before the patient’s liver transplantation, the plasma cell myeloma was not considered to be a PTLD.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,30,nejm-case-2010-30,A 15-Year-Old Boy with a Recurrent Skin Lesion,"Dr. Adam D. Lipworth (Dermatology): A 15-year-old boy presented at the outpatient cancer center at this hospital with a recurrent skin lesion. Approximately 18 months earlier, the patient noted a small, white lump on the posterior upper portion of the right arm that initially resembled a wart; it later became reddish, and a surface scab developed. Sixteen months before this evaluation, he went to see his pediatrician and a surgeon at another hospital. On examination, the lesion measured 0.75 cm by 0.5 cm and was thought to be consistent with a basal-cell carcinoma; an excisional biopsy specimen was obtained. Pathological examination of the tissue revealed an ulcerated lesion (0.8 cm by 0.5 cm). A diagnosis of a compound type, traumatized Spitz nevus was made. The lesion extended to the lateral border of the specimen. Approximately 2 to 3 months after the excision, the patient’s mother noted small, raised red lesions in a starburst pattern near the scar; the complex of lesions slowly grew to approximately 2.5 cm in diameter during the ensuing year. One month before this evaluation, the abnormal area was excised at the other hospital. Pathological examination of the specimen led to a diagnosis of severely atypical, recurrent, multifocal, epithelioid-cell melanocytic proliferation, with features consistent with melanoma. Three weeks later, the patient was seen in the cancer center at this hospital. The patient did not have weight loss, night sweats, fatigue, cough, other skin lesions, bleeding, gastrointestinal symptoms, or headaches. He had received a diagnosis of attention deficit disorder, for which he took a combination of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine. He had no known allergies. He lived with his parents and a sibling and was a student. He did not smoke or drink alcohol. There was no family history of melanoma or other cancers; his parents and sibling were well. On examination, the vital signs were normal; the height was 175.3 cm, and the weight 63.5 kg. There was a healing incision, 5 cm in length, on the posterior right upper arm, without residual pigmentation. The remainder of the examination was normal. A diagnostic procedure was performed, and management decisions were made. ",{},Recurrent atypical (borderline) spitzoid tumor. ,,Recurrent atypical (borderline) spitzoid tumor. ,0
NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2010,26,nejm-case-2010-26,A 54-Year-Old Man with Loss of Vision and a Rash,"Dr. Joseph D. Tucker (Infectious Diseases): A 54-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of acute unilateral loss of vision. On the morning before admission, the patient noted decreased central vision in his left eye. That evening after work, he went to an ophthalmologist. He reported that peripheral vision in the left eye and vision in the right eye were normal; he did not have headache, eye or neck pain, flashes of light, or other visual symptoms. On examination, visual acuity in the left eye was 20/400. Funduscopic examination of the left eye after dilatation revealed a pale, edematous optic nerve, with fine vessels on the surface, and flame-shaped hemorrhages inferior to the nerve. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was reportedly elevated. He was referred to a neurologist, who sent him to the emergency department at this hospital, where he arrived approximately 31 hours after the onset of symptoms. A diagnosis of stage IIB Hodgkin’s lymphoma had been made 10 months before this admission; the presenting symptoms were cervical and mediastinal lymphade-nopathy, drenching night sweats, and pruritus. Treatment included chemotherapy (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine followed by mechlorethamine, procarbazine, and prednisone), which was completed 4 months before admission, followed by radiation therapy (a total of 21 Gy in 12 fractions to cervical and me-diastinal lymph nodes), which was completed 1 month before admission. Symptoms resolved after the first cycle of chemotherapy, and repeat imaging studies at the completion of chemotherapy showed resolution of the lymphadenopathy. Chemotherapy was complicated by persistent pancytopenia and recurrent infections (which persisted after completion of chemotherapy), for which transfusions, growth factors, and antibiotics were administered, and peripheral neuropathy, with numbness and paresthesias in the hands and feet and decreased sensation of pinprick and vibration on examination. Five months before admission, a macular rash developed on the trunk, associated with low-grade fevers, thought to represent filgrastim-associated neutrophilic dermatitis. Two months before admission, two episodes of vertigo occurred, associated with nausea, vomiting, and unsteady gait. Meclizine was administered, with partial improvement but some persistent unsteadiness. The patient had lost 20 kg since the diagnosis of lymphoma. A diagnosis of the Guillain–Barré syndrome had been made 10 years earlier; it was manifested by progressive sensory loss and diminished reflexes, without weakness. Testing for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was negative at that time. Immune globulin was administered intravenously, and the symptoms resolved within 6 months. The patient also had chronic back pain, with compression fractures of the 11th and 12th thoracic vertebrae and cervical degenerative disk disease. He had had an appendectomy, shoulder arthroscopy, and a fractured leg in the past. Medications on admission included citalopram, lor-azepam, antiinflammatory medications, and mec-lizine. He lived in New England, was married, was monogamous with his wife, and worked in an office. He drank alcohol occasionally, had stopped smoking years earlier, and did not use illicit drugs. His father had cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and stroke; his mother had arthritis; and his siblings were healthy. On examination, the temperature was 36.3°C, the blood pressure 90/55 mm Hg, the pulse 71 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. There was no pain in the scalp or over temporal areas. Corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/200 in the left eye, with effort and eccentric fixation. Visual-field testing revealed a dense central scotoma and diminished color vision. The pupils contracted symmetrically on illumination. There was a relative afferent pupil-lary defect in the left eye. Eye movements were normal. The globes were normal to touch, were not tender, and had no proptosis. The left upper eyelid had mild ptosis from dermal redundancy. The conjunctivae were normal. Percussion of the frontal and maxillary sinuses did not elicit pain. On funduscopic examination, the right optic nerve was normal. The left optic nerve was diffusely edematous, with small splinter hemorrhages at the 6 and 7 o’clock positions. No Roth spots or retinal hemorrhages were noted. The peripheral retinal vessels appeared normal. Pinprick sensation was decreased in the fingertips and toes. The gait was narrow-based and unsteady, and the patient was unable to perform tandem gait or to walk on his heels or toes. He swayed but did not fall on performance of a Romberg test. An ery-thematous, dry, flaking, patchy rash was present on the forehead, chest, and upper back. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Levels of serum electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium and tests of renal function were normal, and tests for cardiac ischemia were negative; other laboratory results are shown in Table 1. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after the administration of gadolinium, computed tomography (CT), and CT angiography of the head and neck, the patient’s ventricles, sulci, and cisterns were prominent relative to his age. The imaging scans also showed mild paren-chymal volume loss; they were otherwise normal. The patient was admitted to this hospital. Methylprednisolone (1 g) was administered intravenously, with improvement in visual acuity to 20/100 in the left eye. Otolaryngologic examination was normal. A radiograph of the chest was normal. Results of laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. One unit of packed red cells and 2 units of fresh-frozen plasma were transfused. On the third day, a lumbar puncture showed an opening pressure of 21 cm of water while the patient’s legs were extended. Flow cytometry of the cerebrospinal fluid showed normal B cells and T cells; other results are shown in Table 2. On questioning by an infectious-diseases consultant, the patient recalled that 6 months before admission, an ulcer had developed on the dorsum of the penis, which was intermittently painful and which was thought to be a herpetic lesion. Topical powder was prescribed, and the lesion gradually resolved. On the fourth day, at 8 a.m., the serum corti-sol level was 2.7 μg per deciliter (74 nmol per liter) (reference range between 8 a.m. and noon, 5 to 25 μg per deciliter [138 to 690 nmol per liter]), and the thyrotropin level was normal. A dermatologist noted papules (erythematous to pink) and plaques with adherent scales on the scalp, the sides of the neck, the arms, the chest, and the upper back, distributed predominantly in areas of sun exposure. A test result was received, and a diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2008,11,nejm-case-2008-11,A 45-Year-Old Man with Changes in Mental Status after Liver Transplantation,"A 45-year-old man was admitted to this hospital for orthotopic liver transplantation. The patient had been well until the age of 18 years, when a diagnosis of non-A, non-B hepatitis was made after a 1-month episode of jaundice; the source of exposure was thought to be tattoos. Jaundice recurred intermittently thereafter. Six years before admission, the episodes became more frequent and severe, and chronic pruritus developed. Serologic testing disclosed antibodies to hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) core and surface antigens; tests for hepatitis B surface antigen and antibodies to hepatitis A were negative. The patient began drinking heavily during this time. A diagnosis of hepatic cirrhosis was made 2 years before admission, which was complicated during the next 2 years by esophageal varices, fluid retention, as-cites, and hepatic encephalopathy. Although the hepatitis C viral load was 900,000 RNA copies per milliliter of plasma, he was not believed to be a candidate for antiviral therapy because of continued alcohol use. During the 4 months before admission, lactulose was administered for encephalopathy, and multiple therapeutic paracenteses were performed, with removal of a total of more than 26 liters of ascitic fluid. Two weeks before admission, the patient was admitted to another hospital because of worsening encephalopathy, ascites, and hyponatremia. He had chronic pruritus but no fever, night sweats, emesis, hemateme-sis, hematochezia, or melena. During the hospitalization, approximately 7 liters of straw-colored ascitic fluid were removed, and electrolyte abnormalities diminished. On the 14th hospital day, the patient was transferred to this hospital for liver transplantation. At the time of transfer, his medications included furosemide, proprano-lol, hydroxyzine, lactulose, and ursodiol, all administered orally. There was no history of intravenous drug use or blood transfusions. In adolescence, the patient had acquired tattoos over much of his body. One month before this hospitalization, an incarcerated umbilical hernia was repaired; left orchidopexy, tonsillectomy, and adenoidectomy had been performed in the past. He had no allergies to medications. The patient was separated from his wife and had worked in a factory in the past, with some exposure to solvents. His father had died of coronary artery disease, and his mother of breast cancer; one sibling had died of an unclear cause, and another sibling and the patient’s two children were well. On examination, the temperature was 37.1°C, the blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, the pulse 80 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The skin was jaundiced and excoriated, with spider angio-mas on the chest and a well-healed umbilical hernia scar on the abdomen. Tattoos covered most areas of his skin. Prominent upper-body wasting and mild gynecomastia were evident. The sclerae were icteric, and the jugular veins were distended to approximately 8 cm. The heart rhythm was regular, and a holosystolic murmur, grade 1/6, was heard throughout the precordium. The abdomen was soft, nontender, and distended, with a fluid wave; the spleen tip was palpable. Neurologic examination revealed asterixis. There was no peripheral edema, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Analysis of the stool for blood was positive. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph was normal. On the 4th hospital day, orthotopic liver transplantation was performed. Hyperkalemia occurred during surgery, but there were no other complications; blood loss was estimated at 3323 ml. Two units of packed red cells and 3 units of fresh-frozen plasma were transfused, and cefazolin (1 g every 12 hours) was administered. Azathioprine (100 mg daily), tacrolimus, methylprednisolone (5 mg twice daily), trimethoprim–sulfamethoxa-zole, and clotrimazole were started and continued after transplantation. Pathological examination of the explanted liver disclosed end-stage cirrhosis, with no evidence of cancer. Results of laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. On the first postoperative day, oliguria developed. Ultrasonography of the abdomen the next day revealed mild ascites; the right and left hepatic arteries were not visualized, and flow in other hepatic, splenic, and pancreatic vessels appeared normal. Tacrolimus was discontinued for 2 days. During the next several days, urine output improved, and tests of liver function were stable. The patient was alert, oriented, and conversant. On the 6th postoperative day (10th hospital day), cholangiography showed no extravasation of contrast material or evidence of a stone in the common bile duct. The next day, the temperature was 38.1°C. Results of laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Ul-trasonography of the abdomen showed moderate ascites and bilateral pleural effusions. The liver was normal in size, without masses. The portal veins and the main hepatic artery were patent, with normal flow. Later in the day, the patient had a headache, which resolved after the administration of propoxyphene and acetaminophen. On the 12th hospital day, the maximum temperature was 37.9°C, and the patient was ambulatory and alert. Between the 13th and 16th hospital days, the patient reported recurrent headaches and fatigue, and he intermittently appeared somnolent. Diarrhea and occasional incontinence of stool occurred. Specimens of stool were sent for culture. A chest radiograph showed clear lungs and a small pleural effusion on the right side. Results of laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Packed red cells were transfused, and immune globulin was administered intravenously. Temperatures remained at or below 37.6°C. During the early morning of the 17th hospital day, intermittent confusion and slurred speech developed. Computed tomographic (CT) scanning of the brain without the administration of contrast material showed no evidence of an intracra-nial hemorrhage, mass, or infarct. The next day, confusion worsened; the patient’s speech was garbled, and he was unable to follow commands. He had difficulty walking without assistance and was intermittently incontinent of urine and stool. The temperature was 37.7°C. Chest radiographs showed no change from the previous study. A specimen of stool was positive for Clostridium difficile toxin, and therapy with metronidazole was begun the next day. On the 19th hospital day, the temperature rose to 39.1°C, and chills and diarrhea occurred. There was no cough, shortness of breath, or urinary symptoms. On examination, the neck was supple, the chest clear, and the abdomen soft. The patient was alert and oriented to place and person; he knew the day of the week but not the month or year. The remainder of the examination was normal. Tacrolimus was discontinued, and specimens of blood were sent for culture. Vancomycin and aztreonam were administered. Current medications include cyclosporine (300 mg twice daily), mycophenolate mofetil (1 g twice daily), predni-sone (10 mg daily), propranolol, trimethoprim– sulfamethoxazole, omeprazole, multivitamins, thiamine, folate, itraconazole (100 mg daily), and valganciclovir (900 mg daily). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain after the administration of gadolinium showed abnormal hyperinten-sity of the basal ganglia on T1-weighted images, which was thought to be related to preexisting chronic liver disease. The patient was more confused than on the previous day. On the 20th hospital day, the temperature was 39.3°C, and the patient’s speech was unintelligible. Examination disclosed photophobia and stiffness of the neck; he moaned when his neck was manipulated. He was able to follow simple commands, but he did not answer questions. Myo-clonic jerks occurred when a light was shined in his eyes; he was able to move all limbs, and sensation was intact. There was diffuse hyperreflexia as well as bilateral jaw jerk and pectoralis reflexes. Electroencephalography showed generalized disorganization and slowing of background activity when the patient was awake.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2011,27,nejm-case-2011-27,A 17-Year-Old Boy with Abdominal Pain and Weight Loss,"Dr. Nina Mayer (Medicine–Pediatrics): A 17-year-old boy was seen in the pediatric gastroenterology clinic of this hospital because of abdominal pain and weight loss. The patient had been well until approximately 6 weeks earlier, when intermittent crampy abdominal pain developed. Approximately 3 weeks later, nonbloody diarrhea developed and lasted for a week, associated with one episode of emesis. Thereafter, abdominal pain occurred daily, was predominantly located in the right lower quadrant, radiated to the right flank, and was associated with lower back discomfort, borborygmi, and constipation. During the fourth week of illness, after the diarrhea had resolved, the patient saw his primary care physician. Serum levels of glucose, alanine aminotransferase, and thyrotropin were normal, as were tests of renal function. Tests for tissue trans-glutaminase IgA antibodies, hepatitis A virus, hepatitis C virus, and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative. Results of tests for serum antibodies to Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) were consistent with past infection; testing was positive for hepatitis B virus surface antibody and negative for hepatitis B surface antigen, indicating immunity or past infection. Other results are shown in Table 1. Culture of a stool specimen and examination of stool specimens for ova and parasites, leukocytes, and occult blood were negative. Two weeks later, the patient was seen in the pediatric gastroenterology clinic at this hospital. He rated the abdominal pain at 5 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He reported one bowel movement of hard stool daily, and one episode of blood streaking on the stool after straining, with no mucus. He reported that he had lost 18.2 kg during the previous 2 years. The first 11 to 12 kg was intentional; however, during the 6 weeks before this evaluation, additional weight loss had occurred unintentionally. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) had reportedly decreased from 27.0 (>95th percentile for his age) to 20.5 (25th to 50th percentile). He reported night sweats with chills but no fever. The patient had visited relatives in Haiti approximately 4 years earlier for 1 week; he reported no exposure to persons with respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms while there or recently. Skin tests for tuberculosis were reportedly negative before and after that trip. He took no medications, his immunizations were up to date, and he had no allergies. He was born in the United States and had lived in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast states. He was a high-school student and participated in sports; he had been sexually active with three female partners and reportedly always used condoms; he had no history of sexually transmitted infections. His mother had died at 52 years of age from complications of diabetes and hypertension; his father was well at 60 years of age; a brother had been incarcerated; and his older sister, with whom he lived, was healthy. On examination, the patient appeared well. The weight was 59.9 kg (28th percentile for his age); vital signs were normal. The abdomen was soft, mildly distended with fullness in the right lower quadrant, and mildly tender to deep palpation in the right and left lower quadrants, without rebound or guarding. The external rectal examination was normal; the patient declined an internal rectal examination. The remainder of the examination was normal. A stool specimen was guaiac-negative. The next day, an upper gastrointestinal radiographic series with a small-bowel follow-through examination showed normal small bowel, abundant stool in the colon, and irregular luminal narrowing in the cecum. The luminal narrowing could have been caused by underdistention or inflammatory changes. Two weeks later, the patient returned to this hospital for gastrointestinal endoscopic examinations. He reported recent night sweats and chills and no fevers. He was taking polyethylene glycol daily for constipation and magnesium citrate in preparation for endoscopy. On examination, he was well-appearing, thin, and muscular. The vital signs were normal. The abdomen was firm, most notably in the right lower quadrant, with mild tenderness to palpation on the right side and epigastrium, without guarding or rebound. Firm, mobile masses were palpable in the right lower quadrant; the liver and spleen were not palpable. The remainder of the examination was normal. Levels of electrolytes, glucose, bilirubin, lipase, and amylase were normal, as were tests of renal function; other test results are shown in Table 1. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed normal esophageal and gastric mucosa and mild inflammation and friability in the second part of the duodenum, features that were consistent with duo-denitis. Colonoscopic examination showed a non-thrombosed external hemorrhoid and a normal-appearing rectum and rectosigmoid colon; the instrument could not be advanced past the sigmoid colon. Radiographs of the abdomen showed a loop of mildly dilated jejunum with no evidence of obstruction and were otherwise normal. Computed tomographic (CT) colonography, performed before and after the intravenous and oral administration of contrast material, revealed soft-tissue peritoneal implants throughout the abdomen, most pronounced along the liver surface and sigmoid colon, a finding suggestive of peritoneal carcino-matosis. Mildly prominent lymph nodes were noted in the mesentery. The colon was filled with stool, limiting evaluation for mucosal lesions. The patient was admitted to the hospital. A skin test for tuberculosis was performed. During the first 2 days of hospitalization, the temperature rose to 38.9°C. A blood culture was negative. Pathological examination of the biopsy specimens of the esophageal, gastric, and duodenal tissue revealed mild nonspecific lymphocytosis of the esophageal squamous mucosa and the duodenal mucosa. Laxatives were administered, which resulted in the production of guaiac-negative liquid stool and lessening of the abdominal discomfort. On the third and fourth days, induration at the site of the tuberculin skin test measured 20 mm in diameter. CT of the chest, after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed a multilobulated confluent mass (4.5 cm by 1.8 cm by 6.0 cm) in the superior mediastinum. The mass was posterior to the manubrium of the sternum and anterolateral to the trachea and extended inferiorly to the level of the carina, with mass effect on the superior vena cava and azygos vein. It had low attenuation centrally and enhancement peripherally, similar to the peritoneal implants. Multiple small, patchy, nodular air-space opacities up to 8 mm in diameter in both lungs had a predominantly upper-lobe distribution that was most prominent at the apexes. There was a precarinal lymph node (1.2 cm in short-axis dimension) and no hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy. There was layering of a small right pleural effusion. CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis after the intravenous and oral administration of contrast material showed multiple low-density peritoneal implants on the liver surface and in the right abdomen and pelvis. On the fourth day, a repeat test for HIV was negative and examination of induced sputum was negative for acid-fast bacilli. The next day, bronchoscopic examination was normal; examination of bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid was unremarkable. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

The patient was well until 14 months before admission, when swelling of the left lower eyelid developed. He saw his physician; ophthalmic olopatadine and erythromycin were prescribed. Eleven months before admission, swelling and ery-thema of both lower eyelids and painful swelling between the right first and second metacarpals developed. Ibuprofen and cetirizine were prescribed. Two months later, pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea developed, and a pericardial rub was noted; a diagnosis of pericarditis was made. The patient was treated with ibuprofen, and symptoms resolved. One month later, the patient saw his physician because of persistent fatigue, myalgias, knee pain, and night sweats. He appeared ill; the pulse was 120 to 130 beats per minute, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Red-cell indexes, the platelet count, and the thyrotropin level were normal, and tests for Epstein– Barr virus IgG and heterophile antibodies were negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph reportedly revealed a mass. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of contrast material, reportedly revealed multifocal patchy pulmonary opacities and a cyst, 1 cm in diameter, in the left apex. Levofloxacin, iron supplements, and multivitamins were prescribed. During the next 3 weeks, malaise, nasal congestion, conjunctivitis, generalized pruritus, and worsening fatigue developed. Antihistamines, nasal glucocorti-coids, and ketotifen fumarate ophthalmic solution were prescribed. Seven months before this admission, intermittent fevers up to a temperature of 38.6°C developed that were associated with rigors, dyspnea, and swelling of the right hand; symptoms did not improve with ibuprofen. The patient was admitted to this hospital. On admission, the patient reported dyspnea in the morning and with exertion; nasal congestion, with clear mucus; diffuse myalgias; pruritic rashes on his cheeks; increased thirst and urination; unintentional weight loss of 3.6 kg over a period of 2 months; and joint pains involving the neck, shoulders, hips, ankles, and knees, which were worse in the morning. He reported no cough, back pain, or dysuria. He had a history of acne and allergic rhinitis. Medications included benzoyl peroxide and reti-noic acid. He had an allergy to penicillin (manifested by a rash). He was born in the northeastern United States to parents who had emigrated from Haiti. He was a college student and lived in a dormitory. He did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs, and he was not sexually active. His maternal grandmother had rheumatoid arthritis, and his aunt had died at 58 years of age of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). On examination, the temperature was 37.7°C; there was tenderness of the biceps tendons and palpable lymph nodes (≤1 cm) in the posterior cervical, axillary, and inguinal regions; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, total and direct bilirubin, and total protein were normal, as were tests of renal function; testing for rheumatoid factor, anti–citric citrullinated peptides (CCP) IgG antibodies, anti-La (SSB) antibodies, and hepatitis B and C viruses was negative. Other test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph was normal. A transthoracic echo-cardiogram showed normal right and left ventricular function, an estimated ejection fraction of 64%, a small pericardial effusion (without evidence of tamponade), and an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 27 mm Hg. Urinalysis revealed trace proteinuria. Cultures of the blood and urine were sterile; examination of the stool showed no protozoa or Clostridium difficile toxin. The patient was discharged within 24 hours after admission, with instructions to take ibuprofen, iron, vitamins, and diphen-hydramine and to use a budesonide nasal inhaler. He was given a diagnosis of possible adult-onset Still’s disease. During the next 2 weeks, arthralgias of the right hand developed. Testing for a V617F mutation (1849G→T) in the Janus kinase 2 gene (JAK2) and for anti–U1-ribonucleoprotein (U1-RNP) au-toantibodies was negative; the level of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was normal. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Ibuprofen and prednisone, 15 mg daily, were prescribed. During the next month, a rash developed that was intermittently pruritic, and episodes of swelling of the hands occurred. On examination, the skin was dry, with hyperpigmented macules and papules measuring 2 to 5 mm in diameter on the buttocks, back, and arms; some were crusted and most were follicular. Pathological examination of a skin-biopsy specimen showed acute folliculitis. One month before this admission, fevers increased in frequency, with cough and recurrent arthralgias. On evaluation, the temperature was 39.2°C, there were acneiform papules on the back, and there was mild axillary lymphadenopathy. A chest radiograph was normal. Levels of complement were normal, and testing for antibodies to double-stranded DNA and La (SSB) was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Naproxen was prescribed. Four weeks later, at a follow-up visit, the patient reported some improvement in fevers but increasing cough and dyspnea on exertion, peri-orbital swelling and erythema, and edema of the hands and fingers. Examination revealed bilateral periorbital edema and erythema, palpable lymph nodes in the right neck (1.5 cm in diameter) and left axilla (2 cm in diameter), shotty inguinal lymph nodes, an acneiform rash on the trunk and shoulders with hyperpigmented postin-flammatory lesions, tender swelling of the small joints of the hands, and small effusions in both knees; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, total and direct bilirubin, total protein, alkaline phosphatase, lactic acid, N-terminal pro–B-type natri-uretic peptide, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and C1 inhibitor protein were normal, as were tests of thyroid and renal function and the partial-thromboplastin time; other test results are shown in Table 1. Later that day, respiratory symptoms worsened and the patient came to the emergency department. The pulse was 102 beats per minute, other vital signs were normal, and the physical examination was unchanged. A chest radiograph showed a patchy opacity at the left lung base. He was admitted to this hospital. Serologic testing for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2, bartonella, proteinase 3, myeloperoxidase, Jo-1, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and anti-mitochondrial antibodies was negative, as was testing for antibodies to proteinase 3, myeloper-oxidase, and Jo-1; other test results were pending. A nasopharyngeal culture was negative. CT of the chest revealed patchy, bilateral, multifo-cal, subpleural reticular and ground-glass opacities in the lungs, more in the lower lobes than in the upper lobes. Additional diagnostic testing and a diagnostic procedure were performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,10,nejm-case-2019-10,A 69-Year-Old Man with Progressive Dyspnea,"Dr. Sydney B. Montesi: A 69-year-old man was evaluated in the pulmonary clinic of this hospital because of progressive dyspnea. Ten years before this evaluation, the patient noticed labored breathing with activity, initially while he was climbing stairs and then while he was walking on level ground. He was evaluated at another hospital with a treadmill stress test and transthoracic echocardiography; the results of both studies were reportedly normal. The dyspnea abated, and the patient was in his usual state of health until 30 months before this evaluation, when fatigue, malaise, sore throat, rhinorrhea, and arthral-gias, including arm and chest pain, developed. He sought attention in the emergency department of the other hospital. The hemoglobin level was 13.6 mg per deciliter (reference range, 14.0 to 18.0). Levels of electrolytes and creatinine, results of liver-function tests, and the white-cell and platelet counts were normal. A chest radiograph (Fig. 1) showed moderately inflated lungs, with subcentimeter, faint nodular opacities in the upper lung zones. Azithromycin was prescribed. Dr. Jennifer F. Feneis: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material (Fig. 1), revealed diffuse sub-pleural reticulation, without honeycombing or traction bronchiectasis or bronchio-lectasis. The patient had a few bilateral, scattered, solid pulmonary nodules, measuring 3 to 6 mm in diameter. There was mild enlargement of a low right paratracheal lymph node (11 mm in short axis) and of a right hilar lymph node (14 mm), and aortic and coronary atherosclerosis was present. Dr. Montesi: Seventeen months before this evaluation, the patient was seen by his primary care physician at the other hospital for a several-week history of rhinor-rhea and a cough that was intermittently productive of green sputum. A radio-graph of the sinuses showed opacification of the right frontal sinus but no evidence of sinusitis. Twelve months before this evaluation, the patient reported the insidious onset of exertional dyspnea, which he had first noticed while he was climbing several flights of stairs.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2019,06,nejm-case-2019-06,"A 29-Year-Old Woman with Nausea, Vomiting, and Diarrhea","Dr. John A. Weems (Medicine): A 29-year-old woman was evaluated at a primary care clinic affiliated with this hospital because of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The patient had been in her usual state of good health until the day before presentation, when nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, muscle aches, and a mild nonproductive cough developed suddenly. She had no sinus congestion, sore throat, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain. Over the telephone on the morning before presentation, she reported that her symptoms were severe and had prevented her from attending work. However, when she was evaluated later in the day by a provider at her primary care clinic, she reported that she had had spontaneous improvement in the morning and felt well on arrival at the clinic. The patient had a history of exercise-induced asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, vitiligo, and genital warts. Two years before presentation, she had had negative screening tests for hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus. Fifteen months before presentation, she had received a diagnosis of influenza. During the months that followed, she had reported persistent bouts of fatigue and excessive sleepiness that had resulted in two motor vehicle accidents. During the first event, which had occurred 13 months before presentation, the patient fell asleep while driving and her car crossed into the other lane, over the curb, and into an open space beside the road. She did not collide with any other vehicles or structures and had no trauma. During the second event, which had occurred 7 months before presentation, the patient collided with a turning vehicle. She did not lose consciousness, and the airbags did not deploy. After the crash, she had intermittent painful episodes of muscle spasms in her neck and low back that limited her range of motion. She was too fatigued to seek medical attention until the day after the collision. The patient subsequently underwent evaluation at her primary care clinic. Her score on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale was 20, with scores ranging from 0 (low-normal daytime sleepiness) to 24 (excessive daytime sleepiness). She was referred for a formal sleep study. In addition, she received prescriptions for naproxen and cyclobenzaprine and completed outpatient physical therapy, and her muscle spasms diminished. The patient had not undergone any surgical procedures. Medications included omeprazole, varenicline, naproxen, and cyclobenzaprine. Hydro-codone–acetaminophen had caused nausea. The patient was adopted, and her family history was unknown. She lived in an urban neighborhood in New England with her daughter, brother, and sister. She worked two full-time jobs, as a school counselor and a bartender. She smoked one pack of cigarettes weekly and had done so for 17 years, and she reportedly drank two to three alcoholic beverages weekly. On physical examination, the temperature was 36.8°C, the pulse 106 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 117/91 mm Hg. The weight was 63.5 kg, the height 170 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 21.9. The patient appeared to be well. She had no diaphoresis or rashes, needle marks, or scars. The pupils were equal and reactive, the mucous membranes were moist, and the abdomen was soft, with no tenderness on palpation. Results of liver-function tests were normal, and testing for urinary human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. Just before the conclusion of the office visit, the patient reported a history of use of nonpre-scribed oxycodone–acetaminophen tablets and requested initiation of therapy with injectable intramuscular naltrexone. Urine toxicology screening was ordered, and oral naltrexone was prescribed. A follow-up visit was planned for 6 days later, but the patient did not complete the urine toxicology screening or return to the clinic for her scheduled follow-up. However, 2 months later, she requested a referral for psychotherapy because of increased symptoms of stress. Four months after she requested the referral and 6 months after presentation, the patient was seen in the outpatient psychology clinic of this hospital, where additional history was obtained. She reported poor sleep, low energy, loss of interest in enjoyable activities, feelings of guilt, increased appetite, and a sensation that her legs were heavy and difficult to move. She also report-ed intermittent episodes of heightened energy, pressured speech, racing thoughts, and excessive spending. She had no history of hallucinations or thoughts of harming herself or others. At the psychology clinic, the patient reported that she had begun to use illicit drugs — including marijuana, oral opioids, cocaine, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine — when she was in middle school. She had continued to use multiple substances for 5 years but had abruptly discontinued when she became pregnant, at 19 years of age. She did not use illicit drugs for 8 years after the birth of her daughter but then resumed regular use of oral opioids 3 years before presentation, when she began to work at a bar where drugs were frequently available. Since then, she had used escalating amounts of oral oxycodone to satisfy increased cravings and prevent withdrawal symptoms. The patient reported that she used 120 mg of oxycodone per day and spent approximately $3000 per month on oxycodone. She had missed work because of withdrawal symptoms, and she worried that she would lose custody of her daughter because of her drug use. She had never been hospitalized for opioid use or had an overdose. On several occasions, she had used non-prescribed buprenorphine, which had alleviated her withdrawal symptoms and cravings, but she had never tried buprenorphine treatment that had been prescribed by a health care provider. In addition, on several occasions, she had tried to initiate treatment with injectable intramuscular naltrexone but had been unable to abstain from opioid use long enough to receive the treatment. A plan was made for the patient to continue with outpatient cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness exercises, and a follow-up visit with her primary care physician was scheduled. One month later, the patient was seen by her primary care physician. Oral-fluid toxicology screening was positive for oxycodone, buprenor-phine, benzoylecgonine, and cocaine; testing of the saliva was negative for fentanyl. A diagnosis and management decisions were made. ",{},Severe opioid use disorder. ,Oxycodone and cocaine use. ,Oxycodone and cocaine use. ,0
NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2009,06,nejm-case-2009-06,"A 37-Year-Old Woman with Vertigo, Facial Weakness, and a Generalized Seizure","Dr. Sang-Woo (Steve) Han (Neurology): A 37-year-old woman was seen in the emergency department of this hospital because of a seizure. Four months earlier, episodes of vertigo began to occur several times a week that lasted up to several hours and were associated with nausea and vomiting. She was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital; meclizine was prescribed, and she was instructed to follow up with her primary care physician. During the next 3 months, she had episodes of vertigo several times per week that were associated with tinnitus, diminished hearing, a sense of fullness in her right ear, and difficulty walking. The results of otoscopic and audiographic examinations by an otolaryngologist were normal, with no cranial-nerve deficits; a diagnosis of endolymphatic hydrops was made, and a low-salt diet was recommended. Five weeks before admission, computed tomographic (CT) scanning of the sinuses revealed mild mucosal thickening of the maxillary sinuses with mild inflammatory changes in the ethmoid sinus. Tri-amterene and hydrochlorothiazide were begun and meclizine was continued, with partial relief of symptoms. One month before admission, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed a focus of enhancement, 2 mm in diameter, in the deep right internal auditory canal, a finding consistent with an intracanalicular schwannoma, and several foci of hyperintensity on T2-weighted images in the frontal white matter and subinsular cortex bilaterally, findings consistent with nonspecific gliosis. Formal vestibular testing with electrocochleography and otolaryngol-ogy follow-up were scheduled. Approximately 2 weeks later (2 weeks before admission), the patient awoke one morning with right-sided facial weakness. Three days before admission, another episode of dizziness occurred. On the morning of admission, the patient’s daughter found her on a couch, unresponsive, with shaking extremities and drooling. The movements lasted approximately 5 minutes. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was taken to the emergency department of another hospital. On arrival, the patient had regained consciousness; she recalled fatigue and a disturbance in balance immediately before the seizure but no headache.  On examination, the patient was agitated, confused, and fearful. The temperature was 37.1°C, the blood pressure 114/78 mm Hg, the pulse 122 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The height was 157.5 cm, and the weight 44.5 kg. She was able to follow simple commands; her speech was garbled. There was a right facial droop; the deep-tendon reflexes were 3+ throughout, and spasticity and clonus were evident in the right leg. A complete blood count; levels of serum glucose, electrolytes, calcium, potassium, and magnesium; and liver- and renal-function tests were normal. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Lorazepam and phenytoin were administered intravenously. CT of the head, without the administration of contrast material, showed no intracerebral hemorrhage. After the CT scan, the patient had severe pain in the left hip, and morphine sulfate and additional lorazepam were given. She was transferred to this hospital by ambulance approximately 7 hours after her arrival at the other hospital. The patient’s mother reported that the patient had recently had a headache, ear pain, and left hip pain and that her appetite had been poor. There was a history of a febrile seizure in childhood. Six years earlier, she had had a traumatic fracture of the left hip; 3 years after that, a total hip replacement was performed because of osteonecrosis. She had had a tonsillectomy, a cone biopsy of the cervix, and cesarean sections. Amenorrhea had developed 18 months earlier. A test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) had been negative. She was of native Alaskan heritage and had been adopted as an infant. Her children were healthy; there was no information about her other biologic relatives. She was single, lived with her three children, and worked in sales. She drank alcohol daily, smoked cigarettes, and did not use illicit drugs. She had possible allergies to codeine and penicillin. Medications included meclizine, triamterene, and hydrochlorothiazide. On examination, the patient was initially somnolent but arousable; she later became agitated, belligerent, and uncooperative. The temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 95/64 mm Hg, the pulse 100 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Her affect ranged from angry to tearful. She was oriented to self but not to place or time. Dentition was poor; the abdomen was soft with diffuse mild tenderness, and the remainder of the general physical examination was normal. Her speech was fluent. There was asymmetry in the facial muscles, with right-sided weakness. The pupils were reactive; the extraocular movements were intact, with horizontal nystagmus and saccadic breakdown of pursuit, without ptosis. Hearing was intact; the tongue protruded in the midline, and there was mild dysarthria. Other cranial-nerve functions and attention, memory, and ability to make calculations could not be assessed. There was limitation of movement in the left leg because of hip pain; motor strength was otherwise normal. The arms and legs were hyperreflexic; plantar reflexes were extensor. Posture, stance, stride, and arm swing were markedly impaired. She walked with her feet inverted and on her toes, with small steps. The complete blood count; levels of serum electrolytes, glucose, bilirubin, and protein; and liver- and renal-function tests were normal. Serum and urine pregnancy testing was negative. Analysis of the urine was normal except for a toxicology screening, which was positive for opiates. Radio-graphs of the chest, hip, pelvis, and foot were normal. MRI of the brain, performed after the administration of lorazepam, was limited by motion-related artifacts but revealed hyperintensities of the medial temporal lobes on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images bilaterally and in the posterior gyri recti, more prominently on the left side than on the right. There was nearly complete opacification of the right maxillary sinus. She was admitted to the Neurology Service. During the first 3 days, the patient remained agitated, belligerent, and confused, requiring the use of leather physical restraints. Phenytoin, magnesium, acyclovir, folate, thiamine, a trans-dermal nicotine patch, and dalteparin were administered. Lorazepam and olanzapine were given for agitation, and hydromorphone and morphine sulfate as needed for pain. On the third hospital day, the patient was evaluated by a psychiatrist. She was somnolent and confused and not oriented to place or time, with poor memory. She was easily distracted, with slurred and slowed speech and tangential thought. The C-reactive protein level was 23.2 mg per liter (normal range, <8.0); the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, electro-lyte levels, and electroencephalography were normal. Olanzapine was discontinued and haloperi-dol administered. On the fourth hospital day, her mental status improved and the restraints were removed; she was pleasant and engaged, with linear thought, recall of three of three objects at 5 minutes, and knowledge of past presidents. Extraocular movements were intact, and there was no nystagmus. There was weakness of the right lower facial muscles and increased extensor tone in both legs, the ankles were plantar flexed, and the feet were inverted. Motor strength was normal, although it was difficult to fully assess in the left leg because of hip pain. The sensory examination was normal. There was hyperreflexia in the arms and legs and sustained clonus in the left ankle, and the plantar reflexes were extensor. The gait was abnormal because of hypertonia, with circumduc-tion of the left leg to avoid dragging the foot. A lumbar puncture was performed (Table 1). Cytologic examination of the fluid revealed increased lymphocytes, which were predominantly mature-appearing. A tuberculin skin test was negative. Flow cytometry showed T cells with a CD4:CD8 ratio of 3:4. Repeated MRI revealed extensive, multifocal regions of nodular enhancement involving the leptomeninges and ependyma, along the lenticulostriate vessels, hippocampi, and optic nerves bilaterally, within the left rectus gyrus, along the optic chiasm and pituitary stalk, and within the right internal auditory canal. Hy-perintensities of the mesial temporal lobes and left rectus gyrus were again noted on T2-weighted and FLAIR images. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck were normal. On the seventh hospital day, MRI of the spine revealed enhancing leptomeningeal nodules involving the cervical spinal cord and conus med-ullaris, as well as parenchymal involvement in the cervical spinal cord. CT scanning of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, slight thickening of the bronchial walls, and small retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes. The antinuclear-antibody (ANA) test was positive at 1:320 in a speckled pattern. Serum levels of thyrotropin, pro-lactin, and follicle-stimulating hormone were normal, and a rapid plasma reagin test was negative. Acyclovir and dalteparin were stopped. A transbronchial biopsy of the lung on the 12th day revealed mild nonspecific interstitial fibrosis without evidence of granulomas or cancer. The patient was discharged later that day at her request, pending the results, and was readmitted 3 days later. Biopsies of the dura and brain were performed the next day; pathological examination of the biopsy specimens revealed normal cortex and meninges. The serum level of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was 36 U per liter (normal range, 7 to 46). A diagnostic procedure was performed.

NEJM case records of the massachusetts general hospital,2012,21,nejm-case-2012-21,"A 27-Year-Old Man with Fatigue, Weakness, Weight Loss, and Decreased Libido","Dr. Fernando M. Contreras (Medicine): A 27-year-old man with a history of obesity was seen in the endocrinology clinic at this hospital because of fatigue, myalgias, weakness, weight loss, and loss of libido. Thirteen months before presentation, the patient reported weighing 108.9 kg (body-mass index [BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], 35.4) and began aerobic exercises, 2 hours daily, and a calorie-restricted diet (2400 kcal daily), resulting in a loss of 36.3 kg in 10 months. Two months before evaluation, arm weakness, numbness and aching in his legs, decreased libido with loss of morning erections, and a faint lacy rash on his legs developed. He reportedly stopped aerobics, began lifting weights, and increased his caloric intake, without improvement in his symptoms. On evaluation by his physician at another hospital, the white-cell and differential counts and blood levels of calcium, lipids, prolactin, thyrotropin, and vitamin D were normal; testing for IgA auto-antibodies to transglutaminase and screening tests for antinuclear antibodies, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), viral hepatitis (types A, B, and C), and Lyme disease were negative; and testing for parvovirus suggested past infection. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Topical testosterone gel was prescribed. During the next 3 weeks, additional consultations and testing were obtained. Serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein and complement (C3 and C4) were normal; testing for autoantibodies to double-stranded DNA, rheumatoid factor, Ro (SSA), and La (SSB) were negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis reportedly revealed multiple small gas bubbles in the mediastinum (a finding consistent with pneumomediastinum), decreased intraabdominal and intrapelvic fat, and opacities suggestive of stool throughout the colon. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the pituitary gland was normal. An MRI scan of the abdomen and liver, obtained after the administration of gadolinium, reportedly showed higher signal intensity in the liver than in the spleen, with no evidence of masses, iron overload, ascites, or lymphadenopathy. Approximately 5 weeks before this presentation, the patient was admitted to the other hospital because of a submandibular abscess in the neck, associated with dental caries. The abscess was incised and drained, and antibiotics were administered, with improvement. Pathological examination of a biopsy specimen of a lymph node showed areas of infarction, necrosis, and acute inflammation, without evidence of cancer. Culture of the tissue grew alpha-hemolytic streptococci. He was discharged on the third hospital day. The patient reportedly stopped exercising but continued to lose weight. Echocardiography revealed normal left ventricular size and function, and a small pericardial effusion, without tam-ponade. Two weeks after discharge, a biopsy of the liver was performed; pathological examination of a specimen showed moderate hepatic sidero-sis, mostly involving macrophages but with a minor hepatocellular component. He was referred to the endocrinology clinic at this hospital. The patient reported fatigue, intermittent abdominal pain, constipation (one bowel movement weekly for months), swelling in his feet, and decreased testicular size. Pubertal development and previous sexual function had been normal. He had asthma. Medications included transder-mal testosterone gel, gabapentin, morphine sulfate as needed for pain, and albuterol by inhalation as needed for asthma. He had no allergies. He had stopped smoking and drinking 1 year earlier. He did not use illicit drugs, including anabolic steroids. He lived with his girlfriend and was receiving disability payments because of his illness; he owned rabbits. His father had type 2 diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, and hepatitis C virus infection; his mother had anemia; and his son and half-siblings were well. There was no family history of autoimmune disease. On examination, the patient was cachectic (Fig. 1), with bitemporal wasting. The abdomen was flat and nontender, with striae without pigmentation; the feet were slightly edematous, with a blanching erythematous macular rash on the dorsal surface. Proximal muscles were weak, with severe wasting in the thighs. The pubic-hair distribution was classified as Tanner stage 5; phallus length was 4 cm, and testicular volume was 15 ml (estimated) bilaterally. Urinalysis and blood levels of globulin, phosphorus, vitamin B12, thyroxine, and leptin were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Twelve days later, on evaluation by a rheuma-tologist, the patient reported diffuse pain (especially in the feet), which he rated at 8 on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. On examination, the blood pressure was 103/55 mm Hg, the pulse 56 beats per minute, the temperature 36.6°C, and the weight 51.3 kg (BMI, 16.7). There was poor dentition, severe diffuse muscle tenderness, edematous ankles, decreased strength (4 out of 5) in the ankles and lower legs, nonblanching macular erythematous rash on the thighs, and decreased sensation of light touch over the legs. Testing for antinuclear antibodies was positive at a 1:40 dilution, in a speckled pattern; blood levels of C3, C4, vitamin C, cryoglobulins, and immunoglobulins were normal, as were serum protein electrophoresis and urinalysis; and screening for other autoantibodies, antibodies to HIV, and urinary Bence Jones proteins was negative. The patient declined admission for further evaluation. On follow-up 6 days later, the weight had decreased to 50.2 kg (BMI, 16.3); the patient was admitted to this hospital. Examination revealed painful pitting (1+) edema to the mid-shins; tenderness of the Achilles’ tendons; xero-sis of the legs with nearly platelike scaling, blanchable eczematous erythema on the feet and legs, sparse petechiae and reticulate violaceous discoloration, vertical striae on the abdomen, mild hyperkeratosis with fissuring of both soles, and diminished hair growth on the lower legs. Strength was diminished in the legs more than in the arms; the proximal and distal muscles were affected. Sensation and reflexes were normal. Blood levels of carcinoembryonic antigen and tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies were normal, as were protein electrophoresis and immunofixation; testing for cryoglobulins and urine porphobilinogens was negative; additional test results are shown in Table 1. Pathological examination of a skin-biopsy specimen was thought to be consistent with morphea. Neuromuscular electromyography revealed bilateral peroneal mononeuropathies, a finding consistent with a focal demyelinating process. The patient was discharged on the second hospital day. Additional testing was performed (Table 1). One month after discharge, examination of biopsy specimens of the sural nerve and skeletal muscle revealed a mild demyelinating neu-ropathy and myopathic and neurogenic changes in the muscle. Five days later, the patient felt weak while showering; after lying down, he was unable to arise. Emergency medical services personnel were called. On examination, the capillary blood glucose was reportedly 26 mg per deciliter; glucose was administered intravenously, with a followup level of 88 mg per deciliter. He was taken to the other hospital. Respirations were normal. The blood pressure was 108/80 mm Hg, the pulse 53 beats per minute, and the temperature 32.1°C. The weight was 40.8 kg (BMI, 13.3). He was alert and cachectic, with a decubitus ulcer on the sacrum. An electrocardiogram revealed a sinus rate of 43 beats per minute, with T-wave abnormalities in the inferior and anterolateral leads. A chest radiograph showed subcutaneous emphysema of the visualized lower portion of the neck, soft-tissue air deep to the right clavicle, and a small amount of pneumomediastinum parallel to the trachea. The activated partial-thromboplastin time and the troponin I level were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. A warming blanket was applied, and dexamethasone, vanco-mycin, imipenem, warmed normal saline, glu-cose, and narcotic analgesics were administered. The temperature rose to 34.6°C. He was transferred to this hospital. On arrival, the patient reported diffuse weakness and persistent constipation, with no anorexia; he was on a low-carbohydrate, 2000-kcal diet. His girlfriend had noted jaundiced skin the day before. Respirations were normal. The blood pressure was 114/76 mm Hg, the pulse 42 beats per minute, the temperature 34.6°C, and the weight 42.9 kg (BMI, 14.0). He was cachectic and had a depressed affect. The oral mucosa was dry. The abdomen was scaphoid (i.e., it had a concave anterior wall) and soft, with a palpable liver edge 3 cm below the costal margin; a lymph node was palpated in the right inguinal region. The skin was slightly jaundiced, with a bleeding laceration on the head, a healed laceration on the arm, petechiae and edema (1+) of the legs, and a stage II sacral decubitus ulcer. The extremities were cool to palpation. Levels of fibrinogen, calcium, magnesium, lactic acid, ammonia, vitamin B12, folate, thyrotropin, thyroxine, troponin T, ceru-loplasmin, and alpha1-antitrypsin were normal; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 43 beats per minute and T-wave abnormalities in the inferior and anterolateral leads. A barium-swallow examination was normal. CT of the chest revealed extensive pneumomediastinum and associated subcutaneous emphysema. Lung windows revealed bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities, without air bronchograms, and diffuse, bilateral bronchial-wall thickening, with a thin-walled cyst or bulla in the right lower lobe. Soft-tissue windows were notable for marked cachexia and a loss of subcutaneous fat. After review of the patient’s history, findings on examination, and test results, a diagnosis was made.
