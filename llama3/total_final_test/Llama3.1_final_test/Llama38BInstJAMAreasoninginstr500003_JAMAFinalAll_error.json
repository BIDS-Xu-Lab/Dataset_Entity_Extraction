He reported that the lesion had been asymptomatic but was increasing in size, with progression from his face to anterior chest. He received a diagnosis of primary salivary duct carcinoma of the hard palate 1 year prior and had been receiving treatment with oral bicalutamide and radiotherapy. A partially regressive change of the palatal tumor was noted radiographically during regular follow-up 3 months previously. On clinical examination, a hemorrhagic and erythematous plaque with multiple purpuric-to-blackish infiltrative papules and nodules extending from cheek, lateral neck, to the interclavicular area was found (Figure 1). An incisional biopsy from the infiltrative nodule on cheek was performed and submitted for histopathologic analysis. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ",
