He had no known ocular history. At presentation, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/100 OD and 20/50 OS. Intraocular pressures were normal bilaterally and pupils were equally reactive. Examination of the right eye was unremarkable except for moderate cataract. The left-eye slitlamp examination was remarkable for a shallow but quiet anterior chamber and moderate cataract. Dilated fundus examination of the left eye revealed shallow peripheral serous choroidal detachments, bullous inferior macula-involving retinal detachment with shifting fluid, and diffuse hyperpigmented lesions involving the macula and superior fundus that corresponded to areas of nodular retinal pigment epithelium thickening on optical coherence tomography (Figure 1). These hyperpigmented lesions were associated with hyperautofluorescence and blockage on fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography. No retinal breaks were seen on scleral depressed examination. Ultrasound biomicroscopy demonstrated 360° ciliochoroidal effusion. Axial length was 24.30 mm OD and 24.32 mm OS.

She was receiving oral antidiabetic agents, and her blood glucose level was 110 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555). Physical examination findings were consistent with left lower-motor-neuron type of facial nerve palsy. She was conscious and well oriented, with no other relevant clinical signs or focal neurological deficits. There was no history of prior COVID-19 infection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was requested, with clinical suspicion of metastasis in view of mildly elevated CA125 levels. The results of MRI of the brain did not reveal any neuroparenchymal or meningeal lesions. However, both maxillary sinuses showed mucosal thickening, which was intermediate to hypointense on T2-weighted imaging and hypointense on T1-weighted imaging with postcontrast enhancement.

The patient was lost to follow-up and re-presented 5 months later with an enlarged crusting and ulcerating lesion of the right temple/brow (Figure 1A). On ocular examination, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/100 OD and 20/125 OS due to cataracts, pupils reacted normally without afferent pupillary defect, and ocular motility was full. He had mild proptosis in the right eye and right lower eyelid retraction. Orbicularis strength was intact and symmetric in both eyes. MRI of the orbits, face, and neck with and without contrast showed a 6.1 × 5.7 × 4.0-cm mass with erosion through the right sphenoid wing, involvement of the lacrimal gland, and abutment of the lateral rectus (Figure 1B). In discussing treatment strategies for the orbital component of the disease, the patient was strongly against an orbital exenteration. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Stage T3N1M0 recurrent cutaneous SCC of the face", "predict": "\n1.

A normal funduscopic examination was documented prior to cataract surgery. At the time of initial presentation to her local retina specialist 1 week following her cataract surgery, the patient had severe pain and redness. Her visual acuity was light perception. An examination revealed a 2-mm hypopyon and dense vitreous haze with no view of the retina. She was treated for presumed endophthalmitis with a vitreous tap and intravitreal injections of vancomycin (1 mg/0.1 mL), ceftazidime (2.2 mg/0.1 mL), and dexamethasone (0.4 mg/0.1 mL). The vitreous sample obtained at the time of treatment grew Staphylococcus caprae susceptible to vancomycin. At time of examination in our clinic 4 weeks following treatment, the patient was receiving topical steroid and cycloplegic drops. Her best-corrected visual acuity had improved to 20/70. Examination showed a deep and quiet anterior chamber with a well-positioned intraocular lens without any plaques or deposits on the lens capsule.

Her symptoms began after relocation to California and occurred more frequently at her home. However, she could not discern any environmental or dietary triggers. She reported pruritus and swelling, which were usually moderate but occasionally severe, prompting several emergency department visits. During an emergency department visit, she was diagnosed with acute parotitis based on clinical and radiographic findings of diffuse gland edema, without salivary stones or masses. Her symptoms responded to oral prednisone bursts and diphenhydramine, but not to second-generation antihistamines or montelukast. Her workup included immune serology and total immunoglobulin (Ig) E measurements, all of which were within normal limits. A differential blood cell count revealed 10% eosinophils (normal, <6%) and an absolute eosinophil count 500/µL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). Titers for antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, anti-Ro (SS-A), and anti-La (SS-B) were negative. Sialendoscopy of her right parotid and left submandibular glands found no obstructing stones or strictures. Concurrent steroid irrigation did not provide any substantial benefit. An open biopsy of the right parotid tail revealed nonspecific inflammatory changes and otherwise normal parenchyma.

Suspicious retinal detachment and intraocular mass were identified, which raised concerns for choroidal melanoma. No symptoms or signs were reported in the right eye. Her ocular history included bilateral cataract surgery 5 years prior. Review of systems yielded negative results, including for ocular trauma, jaundice, and cutaneous melanoma. She had no history of tobacco use. On examination of the left eye, visual acuity was hand motion, and intraocular pressure was 8 mm Hg. The anterior segment showed diffuse conjunctival chemosis of yellow hue, low-grade aqueous reaction, and pseudophakia (Figure 1A). On the fundus evaluation, large pockets of subretinal fluid suggested choroidal effusion based on marked fluid shifting with head position. B-scan ultrasonography confirmed 4-quadrant choroidal hemorrhage and partially mobile serous retinal detachment. B-scans also exhibited a solid lesion from the 6- to 10-o’clock meridians with irregular shape and variable internal reflectivity, measuring 5.8 mm in height. Magnetic resonance imaging was requested to delineate the mass from the surrounding clot (Figure 1B).

Four weeks following receipt of immunotherapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab, he developed acute abdominal pain in the setting of a rapidly rising lactic acid dehydrogenase levels, prompting hospital admission. Imaging results showed mild disease progression (new ascites and periportal metabolic lymph node). Splenic infarct and portal/splenic vein thrombi were identified as etiologies of his acute pain and were presumed to be secondary to hypercoagulable state of malignancy. Over the next 3 days, he had rising serum creatinine (sCr) levels (baseline, approximately 1 mg/dL [to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4]). The initial workup included ultrasonography and urinalysis. Ultrasonography results showed abnormal intraparenchymal flow to both kidneys without evidence of kidney artery stenosis. Urine studies were consistent with prerenal etiology, while the presence of casts suggested acute tubular necrosis. Nephrotoxic medications (omeprazole/pantoprazole) were discontinued. The top differential diagnoses at this juncture included contrast-induced nephropathy or immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)–induced acute interstitial nephritis, and empirical high dose steroids were prescribed. Despite observation and steroid treatment, his sCr levels continued to increase over the next 5 days, peaking at 5.8 mg/dL, and the patient progressed into anuric kidney failure, requiring hemodialysis. This prompted a kidney biopsy for definitive diagnosis (Figure). One week later, he received encorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor.1 Two weeks later, the patient’s kidney function began to improve, and hemodialysis was discontinued.

Hence, to assess the dynamic structural changes during swallowing, we performed swallowing dynamic computed tomography (SD-CT), which can reveal moving structures by creating a dynamic-volume data set during swallowing.1,2 Comparison of the reconstructed SD-CT images at rest (Figure 1A) and on swallowing (Figure 1B) revealed that the superior thyroid notch and the right superior border of the thyroid cartilage contacted the hyoid bone internally during maximum laryngeal elevation on swallowing. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Clicking larynx", "predict": "\n1. **Cricothyroid joint dysfunction**\n2. **Laryngeal web**\n3. **Laryngeal cyst**\n4. **Laryngeal carcinoma**\n5. **Laryngeal paralysis**\n6. **Laryngeal edema**\n7. **Laryngeal trauma**\n8. **Laryngeal fracture**\n9. **Laryngeal osteophyte**\n10. **Laryngeal saccular cyst**\n\n**Reranked Differential Diagnoses:**\n\n1. **Laryngeal osteophyte**\n2. **Laryngeal web**\n3. **Laryngeal cyst**\n4. **Laryngeal carcinoma**\n5. **Laryngeal fracture**\n6. **Laryngeal trauma**\n7. **Laryngeal paralysis**\n8. **Laryngeal edema**\n9. **Cricothyroid joint dysfunction**\n10. **Laryngeal saccular cyst**", "topic": "['Otolaryngology', 'Swallowing and Dysphagia']"}

The rheumatoid factor level (18 IU/mL [normal range, <14 IU/mL]) and C-reactive protein level (26 mg/L [normal range, 0-5 mg/L]) were elevated. In addition, Lyme IgG, IgM, and reflex Western blot assays were positive for antibodies. The patient denied travel to Lyme-endemic regions, tick bites, or rashes. The patient started oral prednisone therapy for possible rheumatoid arthritis (RA)–associated nodular scleritis, doxycycline therapy for positive Lyme studies, and was referred to a rheumatologist for further RA evaluation. Two weeks after presentation and initiation of oral prednisone therapy, the patient noted improvement in pain, but the scleral nodules and hyperemia persisted. Therefore, subconjunctival triamcinolone acetonide (0.5 mL of 40 mg/mL) was administered to the left eye. Further confirmatory RA workup by rheumatology did not reveal other systemic findings thought to be associated with RA on review of symptoms or clinical examination. The patient's back pain was associated with her herniated disc. Subsequently, the patient’s examination results showed new scleral thinning of the left eye with persistence of the scleral nodules (Figure 1). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Mycobacterium infectious scleritis", "predict": "\n1.

There was no family history of congenital birthmarks or neurofibromatosis type 1 or 2. Physical examination revealed a well-appearing boy with normal vital signs and Fitzpatrick type III skin type. On the left lower back, there was a 15 × 5-cm indurated skin-colored to yellow, firm, multinodular plaque with hypertrichosis, extending from the midline to the left lower flank (Figure, A). There were additional blue-gray patches on the back and right hip, as well as a small café au lait macule on the right lower back. Limited neurologic examination was within normal limits. A 4-mm punch biopsy was performed for further diagnostic evaluation (Figure, B-D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Neurocristic hamartoma", "predict": "\n1. Congenital melanocytic nevus\n2.

The mass had been slowly enlarging and he had been experiencing mild intermittent pain, but no additional symptoms were reported. His medical history was significant for several episodes of upper respiratory infection during the previous winter season, and he previously had an adenotonsillectomy several years prior and bilateral ear tubes placed 1 year before presentation. Physical examination showed a mildly tender, nonmobile, left parotid mass near the angle of the mandible with no overlying skin changes or drainage around the mass. There was no lymphadenopathy or other lesions noted in the neck area, and cranial nerve VII was fully intact. Ultrasonography results of the neck showed a left 1.5-cm preauricular nodular mass with internal and marginal vascularity. A neck magnetic resonance imaging study without contrast performed at an outside institution revealed the 1.5-cm heterogeneous intraparotid nodule that was predominantly isotense to glandular tissue on T1 images with vague hypointensity of a small irregular central region, as well as vague hyperintensity on T2 images. He subsequently underwent fine needle aspiration biopsy to assess the lesion, which demonstrated benign-appearing salivary gland tissue and clusters of myoepithelial cells. The mass was continuing to enlarge, and the patient’s pain was increasing in that area, so the decision was made to perform left superficial parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve. Intraoperatively, the left parotid mass was noted to be just below the lower branches of the facial nerve. The excised parotid mass was sent to the pathology department for analysis. Gross examination of the specimen demonstrated a 1.6 × 1.5 × 1.1–cm tan-white, well-circumscribed lesion that was partially surrounded by salivary gland parenchyma (Figure, A). Histologic examination of the nodule was performed (Figure, B and C). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Sclerosing polycystic adenoma", "predict": "\n1. Pleomorphic adenoma\n2. Warthin tumor\n3.

Four years earlier, he started taking lenalidomide, 10 mg/d (28-day cycle), to treat worsening anemia; after 2 cycles of treatment, he became transfusion independent. Since then, he has remained stable with the same dose and schedule of lenalidomide without significant adverse effects. The presenting skin lesions developed 1 month before presentation and began as small pustules that rapidly transformed into painful ulcers. He was treated with valacyclovir for a presumed diagnosis of shingles, but the lesions did not improve. Because of suspected necrotizing fasciitis, he underwent incision and drainage of the lesions. Cultures from the surgical specimen grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus hemolyticus. However, the lesions continued to worsen despite vancomycin and additional debridement. Thus, he was transferred to our facility. Physical examination showed multiple cutaneous ulcers with gray undermined borders and red papules of varying depths involving the chest, back, and upper extremity; lesions were as large as 9 × 15 cm. A complete blood cell count showed a white blood cell count of 16.2 × 103/μL (to convert to 109/L, multiply by 1.0) with an absolute neutrophil count of 12.7 × 103/μL, hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0), and platelet count of 262 × 103/μL with no circulating blasts. Results of additional laboratory studies, including blood culture and tests for herpes zoster virus (via polymerase chain reaction), antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were all negative. Additionally, the patient also had hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for which he was taking lisinopril and simvastatin, respectively. Pathologic sampling from skin lesions demonstrated a dense dermal infiltrate with predominantly neutrophils along with reactive histiocytes, fibroblasts, and angioplasia (Figure, A).

More recently, the patient’s parents noted that she developed stridor while sleeping and while at rest, prompting the family to present for medical attention. Previous workup, including pulmonary function testing, was concerning for an upper airway obstructive process, for which she was referred to otolaryngology. In-office flexible videostroboscopy revealed a mass in the distal cervical trachea that appeared nearly obstructive. Chest radiography confirmed the presence of an approximately 1.5-cm, well-circumscribed soft tissue mass within the cervical trachea. Direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy were performed in the operating room under general anesthesia. This demonstrated an exophytic, pedunculated mass that emanated from the anterior wall of the cervical trachea (Figure 1A and B). The patient was intubated via Seldinger technique to bypass the mass, with a 4.0-mm cuffed endotracheal tube loaded over a 0-degree Hopkins endoscope (Figure 1C).

She also reported bilateral rhinorrhea, congestion, and right frontal and temporal headaches. Active medical issues included hypertension, very poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, tobacco use, and asthma. Her brother and father both had a history of chronic orbital swelling. Vital signs were unremarkable, and examination of the right eye showed moderate chemosis, injected conjunctiva, and periorbital edema. Both eyes were proptotic, right worse than left. She had normal bilateral extraocular movements, pupillary light reflexes, and gross vision. Computed tomography with contrast revealed bilateral ethmoid and frontal sinus opacification and right worse than left orbital fat stranding (Figure 1A). Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast demonstrated both enlargement and enhancement of bilateral extraocular muscles, especially the right superior rectus (Figure 1B). Initially she was started on antibiotic therapy. Right nasal biopsy, right endoscopic sinus surgery, and right anterior superior orbital tissue biopsy were performed. Intraoperatively, the sinus mucosa demonstrated only edema and mild secretions, but there was no necrosis or purulence. Both orbital and nasal cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Orbital biopsy showed nodular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates without evidence of fungal infection or necrosis (Figure 1C). Further workup revealed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, total IgG, and IgG4 levels and normal white blood cell count, thyroid-stimulating hormone, angiotensin-converting enzyme, lysozyme, antinuclear antibody, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) levels. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "IgG4-related disease", "predict": "\n1.

He previously received failed systemic and radiation therapy for tumor stage mycosis fungoides (MF). He had received 11 courses of extended beam radiation therapy, including 3 courses of total skin irradiation of 24 to 30 Gy, and focal irradiation to the left posterior thigh and hip/buttock with 2.5/3 Gy to 12.5/24 Gy, respectively, and the right posterior thigh and hip with 2 Gy to 20 and 26 Gy, respectively. Seven years before this visit, he underwent a reduced-intensity, matched, unrelated donor, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). His post-transplant course was complicated by severe chronic graft vs host disease of the skin, eyes, and gut, for which he received systemic corticosteroid therapy, tacrolimus, methotrexate, and long-term extracorporeal photopheresis. Three years after the HSCT, he developed chronic ulcerations on the hips, back, and arms at the site of previously irradiated tumors, as well as multiple friable, hemorrhagic, and bleeding nodules on bilateral hips and his forearms while receiving treatment with corticosteroids and extracorporeal photopheresis. He underwent several debulking procedures and excision biopsies of the nodules, which revealed granulation tissue on histology. In this latest visit, physical examination revealed recurrent hemorrhagic and friable nodules on his left lateral hip and left lateral buttock (Figure 1). Similar nodules were noted on his right hip and forearm. The patient underwent repeated debulking and biopsy. He was also treated with micafungin, amphotericin B, levofloxacin, dapsone, acyclovir, pentamidine, penicillin VK, and posaconazole. Positron emission tomography (PET) computed tomography (CT) results did not show evidence of visceral or extracutaneous disease. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Angiosarcoma", "predict": "\n1.

He had noticed the rash a few days after receiving the second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna). He denied itching, weeping, bleeding, or discharge from the rash or the nipple. He had a history of metabolic syndrome treated with antihypertensives and oral hypoglycemics. The physical examination showed a morbidly obese White man. The skin examination showed a 19 × 10-cm pink, fallacious purple color deep-infiltrated papule in the left breast and a similar 15 × 7-cm papule under the left clavicle (Figure, A). The breast examination was notable for bilateral gynecomastia and inverted left nipple without any palpable lumps. No lymphadenopathy was noted either. His laboratory results showed stage 2 chronic kidney disease. Results of a viral panel including hepatitis A, B, and C and HIV were negative. The punch biopsy of the skin showed a diffuse island of atypical cells in the dermis (Figure, B).

He had a pink macule on his left cheek at birth, which became raised and discolored around age 3 to 4 weeks. He was diagnosed with a capillary hemangioma, and propranolol was started at age 1 month with progression despite dosage increases. Topical timolol was tried without improvement; oral prednisolone decreased the size of the lesion, but was poorly tolerated and discontinued. An ophthalmic evaluation at an outside hospital was concerning for amblyopia because of anisohypermetropia, greater on the left, and a left esotropia and hypertropia. A magnetic resonance image revealed an orbital mass surrounding the left lateral rectus muscle with mass effect on the globe and extension into the eyelid, pterygopalatine fossa, and cheek. Given the risk of amblyopia, the patient underwent 2 embolization and debulking procedures of the orbital and cheek components of the lesion, which were positive for glucose transporter 1 on pathology. However, the esotropia abruptly worsened after the second debulking. At age 3 years, he presented to the clinic with a persistent cheek and orbit lesion, dense amblyopia, large-angle monocular esotropia and hypertropia, and proptosis of the left eye.

He had no medical history or family history of cancer and was not a smoker. In the absence of other suggestive symptoms, as well as a normal physical examination that did not reveal any enlarged cervical lymph nodes or oropharyngeal or neck mass and an unremarkable nasoendoscopic examination, a diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux was made. The patient was advised to try conservative management with dietary advice and proton pump inhibitors, and a clinical review was scheduled in 6 weeks. The patient only returned 3 months later when his hoarseness became worse. Repeat nasoendoscopy now showed left vocal cord palsy in the paramedian position. In the absence of a history of trauma and associated neurological or systemic symptoms, the main concern was an underlying tumor that impinged on the vagus nerve at various points or its recurrent branch. Results of a computed tomographic (CT) scan showed an ill-defined soft tissue mass, which was likely nodal disease, at the left supraclavicular (Figure 1), as well as the prevertebral and paravertebral region, which partially encased the left common carotid, left subclavian, and left vertebral arteries. This was along the expected course of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve and likely accounted for the left vocal cord palsy. However, the primary site of disease remained unclear.

On admission, she was afebrile and normotensive; laboratory results were notable for an elevated creatinine level of 1.43 mg/dL (reference range, 0.40-1.30 mg/dL) (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 92 × 103/μL [reference range, 140-440 × 103/μL] [conversion to ×109 per liter is 1:1). She developed diarrhea 1 day after admission. Fecal leukocytes were absent. Stool antigen test results for cryptosporidium, giardia, and rotavirus were negative. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results for campylobacter, norovirus, salmonella, shigella, Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli 1 and 2, Vibrio cholerae, and Yersinia enterocolitica in the stool were negative. Antigen and toxin test results for Clostridium difficile in the stool were positive. Total body skin examination was notable for 1- and 3-cm tender, round perianal ulcers with a clean base. Another 4-mm round ulcer was present at the superior intergluteal cleft (Figure, A). There were no ocular or oral ulcers. A biopsy specimen of a perianal ulcer border was obtained for histopathologic analysis (Figure, B-D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cytomegalovirus infection", "predict": "\n1.

Following an upper respiratory tract infection 1 month prior, he developed disseminated red, scaly patches and a progressive eruption of hyperpigmented and hypopigmented patches of skin. He had occasional nonbloody loose stools but no fevers or vomiting. Although he was otherwise well, his growth had fallen from the 75th to the 25th percentile for height and weight over the preceding 9 months, and he could speak only 2 words. His medical history was notable for atopic dermatitis and diarrhea in infancy that prompted allergy testing at age 6 months; he was subsequently diagnosed with milk, egg, and peanut allergies. His parents avoided feeding him these foods, providing him only soy-based milk and formula, with improvement of dermatitis, until age 1 year. Since then his diet had consisted of multiple rice milk feeds daily, supplemented only with pureed fruits and vegetables, pasta, snack puffs, and sunflower butter. The patient had no history of meconium ileus or family history of cystic fibrosis. There was no recent travel and no changes to the home environment. On presentation, the patient was irritable, with normal vital signs. He displayed prominent scrotal swelling and pitting edema of the legs bilaterally. Skin examination was notable for erythematous, denuded patches with peeling scale and reticulate hyperpigmentation, accentuated on the abdomen, back, diaper area, and extensor extremities (Figure; left panel).

She was born in 1973 at 38th week of gestation followed by a normal delivery (weight, 3.15 kg and head circumference, 42 cm) to nonconsanguineous parents. The head size was normal at birth, and no other abnormalities were seen during her infancy. At age 2 years, her parents noticed that she had delayed motor and language milestones. She experienced a progressive developmental delay such as reduction of head growth, loss of acquired communication, and loss of motor functions between ages 9 and 12 years. The severity of scoliosis increased with age, and she became a wheelchair user at age 18 years. She was referred to us at age 40 years with the characteristic features of growth deceleration (height, 142 cm; weight, 22 kg; body mass index, 11 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]), apraxia, left-sided hemiplegia, spasticity, sleep apnea, constipation, osteoporosis, hypoalgesia, and repetitive hand tapping (Video).

Multiple prior office visits with referring ophthalmologists during which eyes were dilated showed normal results. Clinical examination revealed 180° of left interior subconjunctival hemorrhage with overlying conjunctival elevation and mild fullness of the left lower eyelid (Figure 1A). Fixation was central, steady, and maintained bilaterally, with full ocular motility and absence of appreciable proptosis. Penlight anterior segment examination demonstrated normally formed anterior segment structures without inflammation or hyphema in either eye, although the left eye exhibited a small intraocular lightly pigmented lesion at the 5-o'clock limbus.

The patient had a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome with insulin resistance and a migraine disorder and reported experiencing 1 to 2 migraine episodes per week since early high school. She believed that the neck mass made these episodes worse than normal. The patient was otherwise previously healthy until she developed an upper respiratory infection. Her physician noted visible swelling in the right neck and clinically interpreted the finding as enlarged lymph nodes associated with the infection. After 2 weeks, the neck swelling persisted despite the resolution of other symptoms. She was subsequently treated with a course of antibiotics, which did not result in any improvement. The mass slowly enlarged over the next 6 months. The patient reported new symptoms, including waxing and waning pain that radiated to the back of her neck, headaches, and intermittent dysphagia. She also noted periods during which the mass would fluctuate in size. Otolaryngologic examination findings were within normal limits except for a single, nontender, compressible right neck mass deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and extending into level V. The patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan prior to presentation at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center’s otolaryngology clinic. The scan showed a fatty-appearing tumor within the right carotid space. The patient underwent surgical excision, and a mass measuring 8.0 × 6.5 × 4.7–cm was removed from the carotid space (Figure, A). Additional material from the mass was excised at the level of the base of the skull. Gross pathologic examination demonstrated yellowish-brown, homogenous, lobular adipose tissue covered by a thin, tan, transparent membrane (Figure, A). Histopathologic examination showed relatively uniform univacuolar and multivacuolated, granular eosinophilic cells with centrally placed nucleoli (Figure, B and C).

Her mental state had deteriorated progressively over the previous 12 months, following the death of her father. After a period living alone, she had returned to the family home 4 months prior to her presentation and had been noted to be socially withdrawn, preoccupied, and distractible. Her family physician, suspecting a depressive episode, had prescribed citalopram up to a dosage of 40 mg once daily, to no effect. Her family subsequently sought advice from the family physician when the patient was noted to be speaking to herself, expressing concerns about people meaning her harm, and professing the belief that she could hear other peoples’ thoughts. The patient had been born in Sierra Leone after a complicated delivery and had traveled to the United Kingdom as a child with her family, who were fleeing from a civil war. On arrival in the United Kingdom, her family claimed asylum and moved into a small apartment in a high-rise building in central London. Although there was no reported developmental delay, she had struggled academically at school and was bullied for having overweight. She left school without qualifications at age 16 years and worked as a shop assistant. She left this job about a year prior to her referral to psychiatry after a period of sick leave following the death of her father. She was a nonsmoker, did not drink alcohol, and denied illicit drug use. A paternal relative was reported to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia. There was no comorbid physical illness. On review, the patient was kempt and had overweight. Eye contact was fleeting, and she presented as anxious, with a degree of psychomotor agitation. Her speech was normal in rate, volume, and tone, although tangential. There was no other evidence of thought disorder. She denied feeling low in mood or suicidal and was objectively euthymic. There was some sleep disturbance, with the patient reporting being fearful to go to sleep owing to persecutory beliefs regarding her neighbors. She reflected that over the preceding few months, she had experienced a sensation of detachment from her immediate environment, as though it was not real, making her world similar to that of a video game. She reported that in the apartment where she had previously been living, she had realized that something was amiss and had become convinced that the door number of her neighbor’s flat, number 6, signified that they meant her harm. She explained this was because 6 was associated with the number of the devil. She reported hearing her neighbors commenting negatively about her appearance. These distressing experiences prompted her to return to her family home, but she continued to hear her neighbors’ voices making derogatory comments about her appearance and began to hear them commenting on her actions and thoughts in the third person as well. On returning home, her paranoia regarding her previous neighbors worsened, resulting in her rarely leaving the house. The volume and frequency of derogatory auditory hallucinations also worsened, and she reported hearing the thoughts of others as well. There was a degree of insight, and although the patient was convinced of the reality of her experiences, she also saw the stress of losing her father as associated with her experiences and was accepting of input from mental health services. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Schizophrenia", "predict": "\n1.
