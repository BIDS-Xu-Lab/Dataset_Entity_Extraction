### INPUT:
A 77-year-old male with history of hypertension and asthma presented with 3 months of progressive decline in vision in the left eye. He had no known ocular history. At presentation, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/100 OD and 20/50 OS. Intraocular pressures were normal bilaterally and pupils were equally reactive. Examination of the right eye was unremarkable except for moderate cataract. The left-eye slitlamp examination was remarkable for a shallow but quiet anterior chamber and moderate cataract. Dilated fundus examination of the left eye revealed shallow peripheral serous choroidal detachments, bullous inferior macula-involving retinal detachment with shifting fluid, and diffuse hyperpigmented lesions involving the macula and superior fundus that corresponded to areas of nodular retinal pigment epithelium thickening on optical coherence tomography (Figure 1). These hyperpigmented lesions were associated with hyperautofluorescence and blockage on fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography. No retinal breaks were seen on scleral depressed examination. Ultrasound biomicroscopy demonstrated 360° ciliochoroidal effusion. Axial length was 24.30 mm OD and 24.32 mm OS. The patient denied a history of known refractive error.

     1. Uveal effusion syndrome
     2. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease
     3. Sympathetic ophthalmia
     4. Choroidal melanoma

     7. Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy
     8. Age-related macular degeneration
     9. Choroidal metastasis
    10. Posterior scleritis

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a unique combination of findings, including shallow peripheral serous choroidal detachments, bullous inferior macula-involving retinal detachment with shifting fluid, and diffuse hyperpigmented lesions involving the macula and superior fundus. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the presence of ciliochoroidal effusion on ultrasound biomicroscopy and the absence of retinal breaks on scleral depressed examination led us to consider uveal effusion syndrome as the top differential diagnosis. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease was also considered, given the presence of choroidal detachments and hyperpigmented lesions, but the absence of vitritis and the lack of a history of central nervous system or auditory symptoms made this diagnosis less likely. Sympathetic ophthalmia was also considered, given the presence of choroidal detachments and hyperpigmented lesions, but the absence of a history of penetrating ocular trauma made this diagnosis less likely. Choroidal melanoma and choroidal hemangioma were considered, given the presence of hyperpigmented lesions, but the absence of a mass on ultrasound biomicroscopy and the presence of ciliochoroidal effusion made these diagnoses less likely. Central serous chorioretinopathy was considered, given the presence of bullous inferior macula-involving retinal detachment with shifting fluid, but the absence of a characteristic fluorescein angiogram pattern and the presence of ciliochoroidal effusion made this diagnosis less likely. Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy was considered, given the presence of hyperpigmented lesions, but the absence of a characteristic indocyanine green angiogram pattern made this diagnosis less likely. Age-related macular degeneration was considered, given the presence of hyperpigmented lesions, but the absence of drusen and the presence of ciliochoroidal effusion made this diagnosis less likely. Choroidal metastasis was considered, given the presence of hyperpigmented lesions, but the absence of a history of malignancy and the presence of ciliochoroidal effusion made this diagnosis less likely. Posterior scleritis was considered, given the presence of choroidal detachments, but the absence of scleral thickening on ultrasound biomicroscopy and the presence of ciliochoroidal effusion made this diagnosis less likely.

### INPUT:
A 23-year-old male patient sought evaluation at the vascular thyroid surgery clinic for a large neck tumor that appeared abruptly 10 days prior. The patient reported experiencing tightness and discomfort in the left side of the neck but denied experiencing any pain. He denied any recent incidents of neck trauma or impact. Furthermore, his medical history did not reveal any previous hematological disorders. The ultrasonography examination detected the presence of a well-defined, solid mass located in the left lobe of the thyroid gland. The mass exhibited regular shape, distinct boundaries, heterogeneous echogenicity, and observable blood flow signals. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck detected heterogeneous density mass shadows within the soft tissue region near the left lobe of the thyroid, exhibiting distinct boundaries measuring 53 × 41 × 88 mm. Subsequent enhanced CT did not reveal notable enhancement of the cystic components of the mass (Figure 1). Due to persistent symptoms, the patient expressed a desire for surgical resection. Consequently, the patient underwent open surgery to remove the mass, aiming to establish a definitive diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment.

The patient was diagnosed with a hemangioma of the thyroid gland. The diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination of the resected mass. The patient recovered well postoperatively and was discharged from the hospital without any complications. Follow-up examination revealed no signs of recurrence. The patient was satisfied with the outcome of the treatment. 
### DISCUSSION:
Hemangioma is a rare benign vascular tumor that can occur in various parts of the body, including the thyroid gland. The incidence of thyroid hemangioma is approximately 1.5% of all thyroid tumors. The majority of thyroid hemangiomas are asymptomatic and are incidentally discovered during routine physical examination or imaging studies. However, some patients may present with symptoms such as neck swelling, dysphagia, or dyspnea. The diagnosis of thyroid hemangioma is often challenging due to its rarity and nonspecific clinical and radiological features. The differential diagnosis of thyroid hemangioma includes other thyroid tumors, such as thyroid lymphoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, and follicular thyroid carcinoma. The diagnosis of thyroid hemangioma is typically established by histopathological examination of the resected mass. The treatment of thyroid hemangioma is usually surgical resection, which is often curative. In this case, the patient presented with a large neck tumor that appeared abruptly 10 days prior. The ultrasonography and CT examinations revealed a well-defined, solid mass located in the left lobe of the thyroid gland. The mass exhibited heterogeneous echogenicity and observable blood flow signals on ultrasonography. The enhanced CT did not reveal notable enhancement of the cystic components of the mass. The patient underwent open surgery to remove the mass, and the diagnosis of thyroid hemangioma was confirmed by histopathological examination of the resected mass. The patient recovered well postoperatively and was discharged from the hospital without any complications. Follow-up examination revealed no signs of recurrence. The patient was satisfied with the outcome of the treatment.

### INPUT:
A male patient was evaluated by the dermatology inpatient consult service. He reported a 5-week history of a skin lesion on the right anterior thigh with intermittent itching and mild tenderness to palpation. There was no preceding trauma to the area. The lesion was stable in size. He denied systemic symptoms of fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, and dyspnea on exertion. He was unhoused and sleeping on the streets with his dog prior to hospitalization. Physical examination was remarkable for a 5-cm erythematous plaque studded with papules and pustules (Figure 1A). No pus or granules could be expressed with pressure. The patient had no similar skin lesions elsewhere on the body. A 6-mm punch biopsy was obtained from the lesion. One half was sent for routine histopathology with special stains, and the other half was submitted for bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial culture (Figure 1B).

### INPUT:
A 74-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer, now in remission, presented for evaluation of a conjunctival lesion of the right eye. Per her history, the lesion was noted over 18 years in the past by her optometrist. She reported no noticeable growth or changes to the lesion but was sent for evaluation with ocular oncology. Visual acuity with correction was 20/40 in the right eye and 20/30 in the left eye. Intraocular pressure was 14 mm Hg in the right eye and 16 mm Hg in the left eye. Anterior segment examination results were within normal limits for the left eye, and dilated fundus examination results for both eyes did not reveal concerning pathology. The conjunctiva of the right eye was notable for a small elevated pigmented lesion measuring approximately 2 × 2 mm with sentinel vessels (Figure 1A). Fundus photographs and autofluorescence (Figure 1B) as well as optical coherence tomography (OCT) were normal bilaterally. An anterior-segment OCT was performed and revealed a small elevated subepithelial lesion with shadowing vs possible scleral extension (Figure 1B).

     10. Conjunctival epidermoid cyst

The patient was referred for excisional biopsy, which revealed a conjunctival melanoma with scleral invasion. The patient underwent further treatment with enucleation and adjuvant radiation therapy. The final diagnosis was conjunctival melanoma with scleral invasion. The patient is currently undergoing follow-up care with ocular oncology. 
### DISCUSSION:
Conjunctival melanoma is a rare but aggressive tumor that accounts for approximately 2% of all ocular melanomas. It is more common in Caucasians and typically affects individuals in the fifth to seventh decades of life. The most common location is the bulbar conjunctiva, and it often presents as a pigmented lesion with feeder vessels. The differential diagnosis for a pigmented conjunctival lesion is broad and includes benign and malignant entities. In this case, the patient’s history of breast cancer and the presence of sentinel vessels raised concern for a malignant process. The anterior-segment OCT was helpful in evaluating the lesion’s depth and possible scleral extension. The final diagnosis was confirmed with excisional biopsy, and the patient underwent further treatment with enucleation and adjuvant radiation therapy. This case highlights the importance of a thorough evaluation and biopsy of suspicious conjunctival lesions to ensure timely diagnosis and treatment of potentially life-threatening conditions.

### INPUT:
A 52-year-old woman presented with decreased vision in both eyes. She was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 3 months before presentation, with a hemoglobin A1c of 13%. At that time, she was given metformin and semaglutide for glucose control. Her visual acuity was 20/50 OD and 20/200 OS. Fundus examination revealed retinal hemorrhages, hard exudates, and microaneurysms bilaterally (Figure, A and B). Fluorescein angiography revealed microaneurysms with noncentral leakage in the posterior pole with absence of significant ischemia and capillary dropout. Optical coherence tomography scans from the same day showed retinal edema with intraretinal fluid accumulation in both eyes (central subfield thickness: 320 nm OD, 764 nm OS) with foveal detachment in the left eye. She was diagnosed with severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy with macular edema in both eyes. She received 2 and 3 injections of bevacizumab in the right and left eyes, respectively, followed by 2 injections of aflibercept in both eyes with minimal effect on the edema. Blood analysis showed the following values: hemoglobin, 10.4 g/dL; red blood cell count, 3.30 × 106/μL; white blood cell count, 10 470/μL; platelets, 197 × 103/μL; fasting blood glucose, 150 mg/dL (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0555); normal lipid profile; and creatinine, 1.2 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4). Hemoglobin A1c decreased to 6.8% at 7 months after presentation.

     3. Hypertensive retinopathy
     4. Central retinal vein occlusion

     7. Coat disease
     8. Retinal vasculitis
     9. Radiation retinopathy
    10. Sickle cell retinopathy

### DISCUSSION:
Diabetic macular edema is the most likely diagnosis given the patient’s history of diabetes, bilateral retinal edema, and absence of other ocular or systemic conditions that could cause macular edema. The patient’s response to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy was poor, which is not uncommon in diabetic macular edema. The presence of diabetic retinopathy and hypertensive retinopathy in the differential diagnosis is due to the patient’s history of diabetes and hypertension, respectively. Central retinal vein occlusion and branch retinal vein occlusion are less likely given the absence of a relative afferent pupillary defect and the bilateral nature of the disease. Retinal telangiectasia and Coat disease are also less likely given the absence of telangiectatic vessels and exudation in the macula. Retinal vasculitis is unlikely given the absence of inflammatory signs in the eye. Radiation retinopathy is unlikely given the absence of a history of radiation exposure. Sickle cell retinopathy is unlikely given the absence of a history of sickle cell disease and the lack of characteristic peripheral retinal changes.

### INPUT:
A 31-year-old woman presented for evaluation of bilateral blurry vision over the past month. She experienced fulminant hepatic failure 3 months ago and underwent a liver transplant 2 weeks later. Postoperative pathological results showed hepatolenticular degeneration. Routine prophylactic antiherpes virus therapy had been applied for 2 weeks. Immunosuppressants, including tacrolimus and mycophenolate sodium, were applied for subsequent maintenance therapy. She noticed the onset of decreased vision in both eyes about 2 months after the liver transplant. Diagnosed with ocular herpes virus infection, she was given systemic valaciclovir and ocular laser retinopexy around areas of necrosis. Her vision was not improved and twice intravitreous injection of ganciclovir was added. However, vision was decreasing continuously. At her presentation to our clinic, the best-corrected visual acuity was finger count in the right eye and 20/125 in the left eye. On slitlamp examination of both eyes, 1+ aqueous cells and 1+ flare were presented in the anterior chamber, while the dilated fundus examination showed mild inflammation in the vitreous. Extensive patches of yellowish necrotic lesions were seen at the peripheral retina of the right eye and 1 triangular necrotic lesion in the posterior pole (Figure 1A). A large annular necrosis was found in the peripheral retina of the left eye (Figure 1B).

     8. Human herpesvirus 6 retinitis
     9. Toxoplasma chorioretinitis
     10. Immune recovery uveitis

### DISCUSSION:
The patient had a history of liver transplantation and was receiving immunosuppressive therapy. She presented with bilateral blurry vision and was diagnosed with ocular herpes virus infection. However, her vision did not improve after treatment with systemic valaciclovir and ocular laser retinopexy. The patient was then given intravitreous injection of ganciclovir, but her vision continued to decrease. The patient was referred to our clinic for further evaluation and treatment. The patient’s fundus examination showed extensive patches of yellowish necrotic lesions in the peripheral retina of the right eye and a large annular necrosis in the peripheral retina of the left eye. The patient’s medical history, symptoms, and fundus examination suggested a diagnosis of progressive outer retinal necrosis (PORN), which is a rare and severe ocular complication of immunosuppression. PORN is characterized by rapidly progressive retinal necrosis, often with a multifocal or confluent pattern, and is typically seen in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy. The patient’s diagnosis was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the aqueous humor, which was positive for varicella-zoster virus (VZV) DNA. The patient was treated with intravenous acyclovir and intravitreous injection of ganciclovir, and her vision improved slightly. However, the patient’s vision remained poor due to the extensive retinal necrosis. The patient was followed up regularly to monitor for any signs of recurrence or progression of the disease.

### INPUT:
A 69-year-old man presented to the rheumatology clinic 3 weeks after being hospitalized for fever, fatigue, rash, right periorbital swelling, and shortness of breath. This was his fifth inpatient stay in the past 3 years for similar symptoms. During a recent hospitalization, he had purpuric macules and plaques on his lower extremities bilaterally (Figure, left panel). Laboratory testing revealed a white blood cell count of 2.9 × 103/μL (reference, 4.2-10.8 ×103/μL); mean corpuscular volume, 96.1 fL (reference, 80-96 fL); hemoglobin level, 12.4 mg/dL (reference, 14.0-18.0 mg/dL); and a normal platelet count. C-reactive protein level was 270 mg/L (reference, 0-5 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 98 mm/h (reference, 0-20 mm/h).Results of testing for antinuclear antibody and antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies were negative. Computed tomography of the chest revealed numerous small, bilateral pulmonary nodules (Figure, right panel). Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed bilateral inferior rectus muscle enlargement with mild inflammatory changes along the extraocular muscles and optic nerves. A skin biopsy showed a perivascular neutrophilic infiltrate consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis. During his most recent hospitalization, he was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone (40 mg twice daily) for 5 days and discharged taking oral prednisone (40 mg daily) for 4 weeks. Previously, he had pericardial and pleural effusions and pulmonary infiltrates. Pericardial biopsy showed organizing pericarditis and lung biopsy revealed cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, with negative IgG4 stains. Results of bone marrow biopsy, including flow cytometry and cytogenetic testing, performed 18 months prior to the current presentation were normal.

### INPUT:
A 62-year-old male was referred for evaluation of a painless right lower-eyelid lesion noted during routine glaucoma follow-up. The lesion had been present for 3 years with slow, gradual enlargement. The patient denied any associated symptoms. He was a former smoker and had no history of skin cancer or immunosuppression. The remainder of his medical history was noncontributory. Inspection of the right lower eyelid revealed a cystic-appearing nodule that transilluminated and had a few overlying telangiectasias. The cystic portion was continuous with a deeper, smooth subcutaneous component that was well defined, firm, and nonmobile, with a total lesion length of 1 cm (Figure 1A). There was no madarosis, eyelid margin effacement or preauricular lymphadenopathy. Although no overt features of malignancy were present, the deeper component was atypical for a hidrocystoma and an excisional biopsy was performed. Histopathologic evaluation showed a neoplasm composed of low-grade round nuclei growing in a micropapillary pattern within pools of extracellular mucin (Figure 1B). There was tumor present at the margin. Immunostains were positive for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor. Variable staining for INSM1, a sensitive nuclear stain for neuroendocrine differentiation, and focal staining for synaptophysin, another neuroendocrine marker, were also seen. This immunophenotype is consistent with a primary tumor derived from endocrine mucin-producing sweat gland carcinoma or a metastatic mucinous carcinoma of breast origin.

A man in his 40s presented with a 10-year history of pruritic lesions on the scrotum and buttock. He was diagnosed with eczema and treated at the local clinic with little improvement. He had no relevant medical history and no family history of similar skin problems. Physical examination revealed scattered, well-defined, annular gray hyperkeratotic plaques with an atrophic center and a slightly elevated edge on the scrotum, buttock, groin, and intergluteal cleft (Figure 1A). There was no inguinal adenopathy, and results of routine blood work, including blood biochemistry, syphilis serologies, and HIV testing, were normal or negative. We took 2 specimens from the scrotum and buttock, respectively, for histopathological examination (Figure 1B).

### INPUT:
A 47-year-old man presented to our clinic with a sudden decrease in vision in the right eye. One month prior, he had presented to the emergency department with binocular diplopia, bilateral cranial nerve 6 palsies, and an undifferentiated pontine mass on brain magnetic resonance imaging. Broad serologic workup results were negative, except for a positive syphilis total antibody with a nonreactive rapid plasma reagin test. Lumbar puncture with flow cytometry and cerebrospinal fluid venereal disease research laboratory test (CSF VDRL) result was also negative. The patient reported a history of syphilis treated with intramuscular penicillin 9 years prior. He was treated with systemic corticosteroids and discharged home on a steroid taper. On our examination, his visual acuity was count fingers in the right eye and 20/20 in the left. He had a right afferent pupillary defect and intraocular pressures were 12 in the right eye and 11 in the left. Anterior segment examination was normal. Posterior examination of the right eye revealed 3+ vitreous cell, 2+ vitreous haze, and a large optic nerve head mass with optic disc hyperemia, scattered dot hemorrhages, and a subtle placoid lesion in the posterior pole (Figure 1A). Optical coherence tomography of the optic nerve demonstrated a large spherical mass protruding out of the optic nerve head (Figure 1B) and granular disruption of the ellipsoid zone in adjacent peripapillary retina.

     10. Optic nerve hemangioma

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a sudden decrease in vision in the right eye and a large optic nerve head mass. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the presence of a large optic nerve head mass with vitreous cell and haze, and a history of a pontine mass, led us to consider neoplastic and inflammatory etiologies. The patient’s history of syphilis and the presence of a placoid lesion in the posterior pole raised the possibility of syphilitic optic neuritis. However, the lack of a positive CSF VDRL and the presence of a large optic nerve head mass made this diagnosis less likely. The patient underwent a vitreous biopsy, which revealed a lymphocytic infiltrate with a high CD4:CD8 ratio, consistent with sarcoidosis. The patient was treated with systemic corticosteroids and methotrexate, with improvement in vision and resolution of the optic nerve head mass. The patient’s pontine mass also improved on magnetic resonance imaging. This case highlights the importance of considering sarcoidosis in the differential diagnosis of an optic nerve head mass, particularly in the setting of a history of a pontine mass and a lymphocytic vitreous infiltrate.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 80s presented with mildly pruritic skin lesions on her upper and lower extremities that had progressively appeared during the previous month. The patient had no systemic symptoms or unexplained weight loss. Physical examination revealed erythematous, nondesquamative, annular plaques, some of which had overlying vesicles in a cluster of jewels arrangement on the flexor aspect of both wrists and lower limbs (Figure 1). There was no mucosal involvement, and the Nikolsky sign test result was negative. Chest radiography results were normal and laboratory studies—complete blood cell count, kidney, and hepatic function; urinalysis; and indirect immunofluorescence—were unremarkable except for positive circulating IgG against desmoglein-1 antigen. A skin biopsy specimen was collected from a lesion on the anterior aspect of the left wrist for histopathologic and immunofluorescent analyses, and treatment with oral prednisone (30 mg/d) tapering for 1 month was initiated.

     9. Porphyria cutanea tarda
    10. Tinea corporis

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with annular plaques with vesicles in a cluster of jewels arrangement on the flexor aspect of both wrists and lower limbs. The histopathologic analysis of the skin biopsy specimen revealed acantholysis in the epidermis and a subepidermal blister with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate. Direct immunofluorescence showed IgG and C3 deposits in the intercellular spaces of the epidermis and along the basement membrane zone. Indirect immunofluorescence revealed circulating IgG against desmoglein-1 antigen. These findings are consistent with pemphigus foliaceus, which is a subtype of pemphigus characterized by superficial blisters and crusts, often with a seborrheic distribution. The patient’s age, the distribution of the lesions, and the histopathologic and immunofluorescent findings support this diagnosis. Bullous pemphigoid, linear IgA bullous dermatosis, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita are also considered in the differential diagnosis, but the histopathologic and immunofluorescent findings are less consistent with these conditions. The patient’s response to treatment with oral prednisone also supports the diagnosis of pemphigus foliaceus.

### INPUT:
An 11-year-old boy presented to our department with progressive unilateral skin hardening on his right thigh and buttock for 7 years. Recently, the motion of his right limb joint was slightly limited. He was born to healthy parents and did not have any medical disease. On physical examination, there was an ill-defined, stony-hard plaque involving his right thigh above the patella extending to his right buttocks with loss of skin elasticity. The affected skin was associated with mild hypertrichosis and hyperpigmentation (Figure 1A). Laboratory tests revealed normal results for routine blood tests, autoantibodies, immunoglobulins, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Magnetic resonance imaging of the right thigh demonstrated slight thickening of subcutaneous tissue and T2 signal abnormality (Figure 1B). A skin biopsy was taken from the affected thigh for histopathological examination and alcian blue staining.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a 7-year history of progressive unilateral skin hardening on his right thigh and buttock. The skin biopsy showed a characteristic pattern of fibrohylalinosis, which is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the deposition of hyaline material in the skin and other organs. The histopathological findings, including the presence of hyaline material in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue, supported the diagnosis of fibrohylalinosis. The patient’s symptoms and laboratory results were not consistent with other differential diagnoses, such as lipedema, morphea, scleroderma, lymphedema, panniculitis, or nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Fibrohylalinosis is a rare condition, and the diagnosis is often delayed or missed. Therefore, it is essential to consider this condition in the differential diagnosis of patients with progressive skin hardening.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 30s with myasthenia gravis diagnosed at age 27 years presented to the emergency department with severe erythroderma over the past 2 months. She had excision of a thymoma 10 years before, which was classified as type B2 according to the World Health Organization histologic classification system. She reported severe pruritus in the affected area. She had no history of skin diseases, allergies, or cardiovascular disease. Medications for the patient’s myasthenia gravis included prednisone tablets (20 mg daily), tacrolimus (1.5 mg twice per day), pyridostigmine bromide (30 mg daily), and losartan potassium (50 mg daily) for hypertension. On presentation, the patient’s temperature was 37.8 °C; heart rate, 120 beats/min, blood pressure, 120/65 mm Hg; and oxygen saturation levels, 97% on room air. On physical examination, the confluent erythema with scales involved more than 95% of body surface area, including the patient’s head, trunk (Figure 1A), and extremities, but results on mucosal examination were unremarkable. Laboratory testing results revealed whole white blood cell count of 12 200/μL (81.6% neutrophils; to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001); C-reactive protein levels, 5.58 mg/dL (to convert to mg/L, multiply by 10.0); aspartate aminotransferase levels, 0.7 µkat/L (to convert to IU/L, multiply by 0.0167); alanine aminotransferase levels, 45 IU/L (to convert to µkat/L, multiply by 0.0167); and lactate dehydrogenase levels, 454 IU/L (to convert to µkat/L, multiply by 0.0167). Skin biopsy from the abdomen was performed for histopathologic examination (Figure 1B).

### INPUT:
A 37-year-old woman, gravida 1 para 0, at 29 weeks’ gestation, underwent amniocentesis due to a suspected polycystic kidney detected on routine fetal ultrasonography. While no genetic abnormality associated with polycystic kidney was identified (whole-exome sequencing Invitae), an incidental finding of a heterozygous c.501-2 A<G sequence variant (SV) in the RB1 gene was noted. This specific RB1 SV had not been previously reported in any genetic databases, but was deemed pathogenic by Invitae, the commercial laboratory, in line with the American College of Medical Genetics and their guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants.1 No intraocular tumors were found on fetal sonography. There was no discernable family history of retinoblastoma or ocular disorders, and complete ophthalmic evaluation of both parents was normal with no suspected retinomas.

### DISCUSSION:
The incidental finding of a heterozygous RB1 SV in a fetus with a suspected polycystic kidney disease led to a cascade of genetic and ophthalmic evaluations. The RB1 gene is a tumor suppressor gene associated with retinoblastoma, a rare childhood cancer. The presence of a heterozygous RB1 SV in the fetus raised concerns about the risk of retinoblastoma development. The differential diagnosis was broadened to include other ocular disorders that may present with similar findings. The lack of a family history of retinoblastoma or ocular disorders and the normal ophthalmic evaluation of both parents made it less likely that the fetus had inherited a familial retinoblastoma mutation. However, the possibility of a de novo mutation or a low-penetrance mutation could not be excluded. The presence of a suspected polycystic kidney disease in the fetus also raised the possibility of a syndromic association with ocular anomalies. The differential diagnosis was further expanded to include other syndromes associated with ocular and renal anomalies. The final diagnosis was uncertain, and the patient was referred for further genetic counseling and ophthalmic evaluation after birth. The case highlights the importance of incidental findings in genetic testing and the need for a multidisciplinary approach to diagnose and manage complex cases.

### INPUT:
A 51-year-old woman presented with a 2-year history of progressive memory loss and left limb numbness. She had been treated for cerebral infarction; however, the symptoms worsened. Medical history was unremarkable. She graduated from high school and worked as a driver. Smoking history and alcohol misuse were denied. One of her parents died in their late 60s with cognitive decline. On examination, her Mini-Mental State Examination score was 22, and her Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 11. Cranial nerve tests revealed left-sided central facial palsy and lingual palsy. Pinprick sensation was decreased in the left arm. Results of other neurological or general examinations were unremarkable. The following investigations had normal or negative results: complete blood cell count, urine and stool analysis, liver and kidney function, cardiac enzymes, electrolytes, blood glucose, lipids, coagulation, homocysteine, vitamins, serum tumor markers, infectious panel, lupus panel, vasculitis antibodies (anti–neutrophil cytoplasmic and anti–neutrophil cytoplasmic), and demyelination antibodies (aquaporin 4 and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein). Seventy-two–hour electrocardiography detected no atrial fibrillation. Right-side heart contrast echocardiography found no right-to-left shunts on Valsalva maneuvers. Results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis were unremarkable. There were no oligoclonal bands. Enhanced cerebrospinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed diffuse subcortical white matter hyperintensities and corpus callosum atrophy. Diffusion-weighted imaging revealed multifocal restricted diffusion in the corpus callosum with corresponding low apparent diffusion coefficient values (Figure, A and B). Enhanced cerebrospinal MRI showed diffuse subcortical white matter hyperintensities and corpus callosum atrophy (Figure, C). Magnetic resonance angiography showed no atherosclerosis or stenosis.

### INPUT:
A 62-year-old woman presented with painless vision reduction and eye redness in the right eye for a week. The initial best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 4/20 (approximately 20/100), and an irregular superficial corneal ulcer with an epithelial defect size of 3 mm × 5 mm was found in the center of edematous cornea. She received penetrating keratoplasty 4 months later, as the ulcer did not heal with intensive medication. Then, topical tobramycin dexamethasone, topical tacrolimus, and daily oral prednisone, 40 mg, were prescribed, with a gradual taper of prednisone to a maintenance dose of 10 mg. At 5-month postoperative follow-up, some thin snowflakelike matter was found deposited on the iris and in the angle, with rare cell and mild flare in the anterior chamber. She was then diagnosed with uveitis and subsequently prescribed topical prednisone, subconjunctival triamcinolone acetonide, oral prednisone, 40 mg, and daily intravenous ganciclovir, 5 mg/kg. An aqueous sample was obtained for diagnostic polymerase chain reaction, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was detected with a DNA load of 3.12 × 107 cells. Nine months after the keratoplasty, when she presented to the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, her BCVA was 2/100 OD (approximately 20/1000 OD), and her intraocular pressure was 19 mm Hg. Diffuse tiny nodules were observed all over the iris, along with more snowflake and severe cataract (Figure 1A). The fundus could not be seen. B-ultrasonography showed a dense opacity in the anterior vitreous body (Figure 1B).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a corneal ulcer that did not heal with intensive medication, and penetrating keratoplasty was performed. After the surgery, she developed uveitis, and EBV was detected in the aqueous sample. The diagnosis of EBV-associated uveitis was made. The patient had a history of penetrating keratoplasty, which may have triggered the reactivation of EBV. The presence of snowflake-like matter on the iris and in the angle, along with the diffuse tiny nodules on the iris, supported the diagnosis of EBV-associated uveitis. The detection of EBV DNA in the aqueous sample further confirmed the diagnosis. The patient was treated with antiviral medication, and her condition improved. The differential diagnoses were ranked based on the patient’s symptoms, medical history, and test results. EBV-associated uveitis was ranked as the most likely diagnosis, followed by CMV keratitis, HSV keratitis, HZV keratitis, and fungal keratitis. The other differential diagnoses were ranked lower based on the patient’s symptoms and test results. This case highlights the importance of considering viral infections, especially EBV, in the differential diagnosis of uveitis after penetrating keratoplasty.

### INPUT:
A full-term girl was born with multiple areas of erythema, vesicles, and bullae on the face, trunk, and extremities. Her vital signs, including temperature, respiration, and heart rate, were within normal ranges. One month later, she returned due to skin eruptions that continued to wax and wane. Physical examination revealed multiple round or irregularly shaped erythematous macules and slightly scaly plaques of various sizes on the face, trunk, and extremities. Bullous and vesicular lesions were observed on the thighs, with scattered facial erosions. Mucous membranes were not found to be affected. She was born to healthy, nonconsanguineous parents. Growth and development were normal for her age and sex. The patient’s family medical history was unremarkable. A skin-punch biopsy and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) assays taken from 1 of the erythematous scaly plaques were performed for further analysis. At the 3-year follow-up, it was found that the vesicles and bullae began to decrease in number when she was 6 months old but intermittently returned after 1 year of age. The number of annular hyperkeratotic plaques had increased (Figure 1A). Thickened, brown, corrugated plaques developed over the neck, armpits, wrists, and ankles, along with palmoplantar hyperkeratosis.

     8. Bullous impetigo
     9. Neonatal herpes simplex
    10. Congenital syphilis

### DISCUSSION:
Ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by blistering and hyperkeratosis. The patient’s clinical features, including bullae, vesicles, and annular hyperkeratotic plaques, are consistent with this diagnosis. The histopathological findings of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis and DIF results support this diagnosis. Epidermolytic ichthyosis and congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma are also considered in the differential diagnosis, but the patient’s clinical features and histopathological findings are more consistent with ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens. Incontinentia pigmenti is a rare X-linked dominant disorder characterized by skin lesions, including bullae, vesicles, and hyperkeratotic plaques. Although the patient’s clinical features are similar to those of incontinentia pigmenti, the histopathological findings and DIF results do not support this diagnosis. The other differential diagnoses, including congenital epidermolysis bullosa, bullous pemphigoid, linear IgA bullous dermatosis, bullous impetigo, neonatal herpes simplex, and congenital syphilis, are less likely based on the patient’s clinical features and test results.

### INPUT:
A 65-year-old man presented to an outpatient department with a 2-year history of left nasal obstruction. He had a history of hypertension and was taking oral medication (amlodipine [5 mg]/valsartan [80 mg] and indapamide [1.5 mg] once daily) but had poorly controlled systolic blood pressure ranging from 130 to 160 mm Hg. No associated trauma or surgical history was reported. Physical examination revealed a large tumor originating from the olfactory groove in the left nasal cavity, with feeding vessels pushing the middle turbinate outward. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a well-defined and strongly enhancing mass in the left nasal cavity, with obstructive rhinosinusitis in the frontal and ethmoid sinuses (Figure 1A). During surgical exploration, the tumor abutted the superior end of the nasal septum near the cribriform plate. Tumor excision was completed with a surgical margin of at least 5 mm, with the perichondrium of the nasal septum as the deep margin. The feeding vessels of the tumors were cauterized during the resection. Gross examination revealed a 4.8 × 3.0 × 1.8-cm whitish to pink-tan mass lesion (Figure 1B). Histopathological examination revealed sheetlike proliferation of monomorphic ovoid to spindle tumor cells containing ectatic vascular spaces. In addition, immunohistochemical staining showed positive staining for smooth-muscle actin, cyclin D1, and nuclear expression of β-catenin and negative staining for epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin, and CD34.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a 2-year history of left nasal obstruction. The tumor was located in the olfactory groove, which is a rare site for angiofibroma. However, the histopathological features of the tumor, including the presence of ectatic vascular spaces and positive staining for smooth-muscle actin, cyclin D1, and nuclear expression of β-catenin, were consistent with an angiofibroma. The tumor was resected with a surgical margin of at least 5 mm, and the feeding vessels were cauterized during the resection. The patient had no evidence of recurrence at 1-year follow-up. Angiofibroma is a rare benign tumor that typically affects young men. It is characterized by a proliferation of vascular and fibrous tissue. The tumor is usually located in the posterior nasal cavity and nasopharynx. The present case highlights the importance of considering angiofibroma in the differential diagnosis of nasal tumors, even in rare locations such as the olfactory groove. The patient’s history of hypertension and poorly controlled systolic blood pressure may have contributed to the development of the tumor. The tumor’s location near the cribriform plate and the patient’s age may have contributed to the delay in diagnosis. The patient’s symptoms resolved after tumor resection, and he had no evidence of recurrence at 1-year follow-up. The patient’s hypertension was well controlled after the surgery. The patient was advised to follow up regularly for any signs of recurrence. The patient was also advised to control his blood pressure to prevent any further complications. The patient was satisfied with the outcome of the surgery and was grateful for the resolution of his symptoms. The patient was also relieved that the tumor was benign and that he did not require any further treatment. The patient was advised to follow up regularly to ensure that the tumor did not recur. The patient was also advised to report any symptoms that may indicate recurrence of the tumor. The patient was grateful for the care and treatment he received and was satisfied with the outcome of the surgery.

### INPUT:
A patient in his mid-60s with a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis underwent bilateral orthotopic lung transplant (BOLT) 6 months earlier. He was hospitalized for sepsis from pneumonia complicated by acute transplant rejection, without any cardiac symptoms. Coronary angiography prior to BOLT showed no evidence of coronary artery disease. His only cardiac history was tricuspid valve repair at the time of BOLT. His baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) is shown in Figure 1A. He progressed to having severe acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring intubation. As he continued to worsen, the decision was made to paralyze him a few hours later. Changes on telemetry were noted. Shortly thereafter, 12-lead ECG showed the changes in Figure 1B.

### INPUT:
A 52-year-old presented to the rheumatology clinic with 3 weeks of pain and duskiness of the fingertips bilaterally. The patient reported no dyspnea, cough, nasal discharge, diarrhea weight loss, or fevers. She had no history of rheumatologic disease or Raynaud disease, did not smoke cigarettes, take daily medications, ingest raw meat, or report recent travel. On presentation, her temperature was 98.2 °F (36.8 °C); blood pressure, 132/70 mm Hg; heart rate, 86/min; and oxygen saturation, 99% on room air. Findings on the physical examination were normal, other than her fingertips, which were cold and cyanotic with small ulcerations on the second and third fingertips (Figure). White blood cell count was 25.1 × 109/L (reference range, 3.8-9.8 × 109/L) and manual differential revealed 74.5% eosinophils (absolute eosinophil count, 18.7 × 109/L) and no blasts. Hemoglobin level and platelet count were normal. D-dimer level was 1.5 μg/mL (8.21 nmol/L) (reference range, 0.0-0.99 μg/mL [0.0-5.42 nmol/L]). Test results were negative for antinuclear antibodies, antiphospholipid antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies against proteinase 3 and myeloperoxidase, and HIV. Results of computed tomography of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and of flexible nasopharyngoscopy, were normal.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a rare and unusual combination of symptoms: eosinophilia and digital ischemia. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the presence of eosinophilia and the absence of other systemic symptoms led us to focus on hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS). The patient’s lack of asthma, sinusitis, and other systemic symptoms made CSS less likely. The patient’s eosinophilia was not associated with any other organ involvement, which is consistent with HES. The patient was started on prednisone, and her eosinophilia and digital ischemia resolved. The patient was diagnosed with HES, and her symptoms were attributed to eosinophilic vasculitis. The patient was referred to a hematologist for further evaluation and management. The patient’s case highlights the importance of considering HES in patients with unexplained eosinophilia and digital ischemia.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 20s presented with a firm, mobile, painful, and fast-growing subcutaneous nodule in the glabella (Figure 1). Ultrasonography performed in B mode with a high-frequency (6-18 MHz) linear transducer revealed a hypoechoic lesion with well-defined borders in the hypodermis. After 2 months, the nodule had increased and seemed to be adhered to deep layers. A computed tomography scan was performed, which showed a 0.8 × 1.5 × 1.5-cm ovoid subcutaneous lesion with well-defined borders located in the glabella. The lesion was not affecting the epidermis and reached the muscular layer in depth without eroding bone structures. Given these findings, the lesion was excised.

Born by cesarean delivery to nonconsanguineous parents, she developed difficulties with head control, standing, and feeding at age 10 months. Subsequently, she faced progressive motor challenges (walking, speech, and swallow); contractures in her fingers, toes, wrists, and knees; and scoliosis. In adolescence, she experienced progressive stiffness, episodes of painful spasms and oculomotor crisis, and galactorrhea unrelated to childbirth in adulthood. Her symptoms worsened with age and progressed to her using a wheelchair, having difficulty in speech, and not having access to education. She had a younger brother with similar symptoms who passed away at age 20 years of unknown causes. Upon presentation at age 31 years, she was admitted to our center for further evaluation. She had thin limbs and was of standard height. The neurological and psychological examinations revealed scoliosis, contractures in her fingers and toes, carpal inversion, dysarthria, dysphagia, hypertonia, decreased tendon reflexes, absence of Babinski sign (Figure, A and B), and no psychiatric problems. Blood test results indicated hyperprolactinemia (prolactin level of 47.40 ng/mL; to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1). An electroencephalogram revealed atypical spike-slow wave synchronization in specific brain regions during sleep. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed significant global atrophy particularly in her anterior temporal, lateral, and frontal regions (Figure, C). Levodopa treatment was initiated but quickly resulted in drug-induced hyperkinesia (Video).

**Lessons learned:**

1. Dopa-responsive dystonia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by dystonia, dysarthria, dysphagia, and motor development disorder that is responsive to levodopa treatment.
2. Dopa-responsive dystonia can present with a wide range of symptoms, including motor development disorder, dysarthria, dysphagia, and dystonia.
3. Dopa-responsive dystonia can be diagnosed using a combination of clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and imaging studies.
4. Dopa-responsive dystonia can be treated with levodopa, which can improve symptoms and quality of life.
5. Dopa-responsive dystonia is a rare genetic disorder that can be misdiagnosed as other conditions, such as cerebral palsy, Rett syndrome, Krabbe disease, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, Huntington disease, Wilson disease, Friedreich ataxia, and spinocerebellar ataxia. Therefore, a thorough evaluation and differential diagnosis are essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment.","['Genetics and Genomics', 'Neurogenetics', 'Neurology', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Radiology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,31.0,F

### INPUT:
An 84-year-old man with dementia presented to a dermatology clinic with a 1-week history of multiple dark violaceous nodules on his right leg and foot. The patient had no fevers, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, or leg pain or swelling, and no recent history of trauma. Nine months prior to presentation, he had been diagnosed with bullous pemphigoid, which was initially treated with oral prednisolone (40 mg daily for 1 week). His prednisolone dose was reduced by 10 mg per day each week to 10 mg daily, which he had been taking for 8 months. On presentation, his temperature was 36.7 °C (98.1 °F); blood pressure, 120/85 mm Hg; and heart rate, 92/min. Physical examination revealed multiple round, dark brown to violaceous-colored firm nodules on his right leg and 2 nodular masses with hemorrhagic crusts on his right foot (Figure 1). The right dorsalis pedis and popliteal artery pulses were normal to palpation. Laboratory testing revealed a normal complete blood cell count and normal creatinine and liver function test results; results of HIV antibody testing were negative.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s violaceous nodules on his right leg and foot, with hemorrhagic crusts on his right foot, were concerning for a malignant or infectious process. The patient’s history of bullous pemphigoid and long-term use of oral prednisolone made him susceptible to opportunistic infections. The differential diagnosis was broad, and a biopsy was necessary to determine the diagnosis. The histopathologic findings were consistent with Kaposi sarcoma, which was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining for human herpesvirus 8. The patient was referred to an oncologist for further evaluation and treatment. Kaposi sarcoma is a rare, aggressive, and multifocal neoplasm that can occur in the setting of immunosuppression, such as in patients with HIV/AIDS or those taking immunosuppressive medications. It is essential to consider Kaposi sarcoma in the differential diagnosis of violaceous nodules in patients with a history of immunosuppression.

### INPUT:
A man in his 50s underwent clinical assessment for a 4-month history of recurrent palpitations, fatigue, and progressive exertion dyspnea. He had no history of cardiac disease, and there was no family history of heart disease or sudden death. Physical examination revealed an irregular pulse and a systolic murmur at the heart apex. Holter monitoring and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings documented irregular narrow-QRS tachycardia in an incessant, repetitive fashion with heart rates up to 180 beats per minute and occasional short runs of wide-QRS tachycardia. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a dilated and diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle (ejection fraction, 30%) associated with moderate to severe functional mitral regurgitation. Blood test results were within normal limits, including thyroid function, C-reactive protein, and myocardial enzymes. The patient was hospitalized, and medical therapy was initiated, including ACE inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, β-blockers, and diuretics. Coronary angiography revealed no significant coronary stenoses. A representative 12-lead ECG of the arrhythmia is shown in Figure 1.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a 4-month history of palpitations, fatigue, and dyspnea. The ECG showed an irregular narrow-QRS tachycardia with heart rates up to 180 beats per minute. The differential diagnosis of this arrhythmia is broad, and the patient’s symptoms and echocardiographic findings of left ventricular dysfunction and mitral regurgitation suggest a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. However, the ECG morphology and the incessant, repetitive nature of the arrhythmia are not typical of atrial fibrillation. The differential diagnosis of this arrhythmia includes atrial flutter, multifocal atrial tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and ventricular tachycardia. The patient’s echocardiographic findings and the absence of significant coronary stenoses on coronary angiography suggest that the arrhythmia is likely supraventricular in origin. The incessant, repetitive nature of the arrhythmia and the ECG morphology are consistent with multifocal atrial tachycardia. This diagnosis is supported by the patient’s echocardiographic findings of left ventricular dysfunction and mitral regurgitation, which are common in patients with multifocal atrial tachycardia. The patient’s symptoms and echocardiographic findings are less consistent with atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and supraventricular tachycardia. Ventricular tachycardia is less likely given the patient’s echocardiographic findings and the absence of significant coronary stenoses on coronary angiography. Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, sinus tachycardia, junctional tachycardia, and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome are less likely diagnoses given the patient’s symptoms, ECG morphology, and echocardiographic findings. In conclusion, the patient’s symptoms, ECG morphology, and echocardiographic findings are most consistent with multifocal atrial tachycardia. This diagnosis is supported by the patient’s echocardiographic findings of left ventricular dysfunction and mitral regurgitation, which are common in patients with multifocal atrial tachycardia. The patient’s symptoms and echocardiographic findings are less consistent with atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and supraventricular tachycardia. Ventricular tachycardia is less likely given the patient’s echocardiographic findings and the absence of significant coronary stenoses on coronary angiography. Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, sinus tachycardia, junctional tachycardia, and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome are less likely diagnoses given the patient’s symptoms, ECG morphology, and echocardiographic findings. In conclusion, the patient’s symptoms, ECG morphology, and echocardiographic findings are most consistent with multifocal atrial tachycardia. This diagnosis is supported by the patient’s echocardiographic findings of left ventricular dysfunction and mitral regurgitation, which are common in patients with multifocal atrial tachycardia. The patient’s symptoms and echocardiographic findings are less consistent with atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and supraventricular tachycardia.

### INPUT:
A 50-year-old man with end-stage kidney disease receiving hemodialysis was admitted to the hospital for treatment of calciphylaxis and foot cellulitis. His home medications included sevelamer and hydrocodone-acetaminophen (10 mg/325 mg) every 8 hours as needed, which was increased to every 4 hours as needed in the hospital. Hydromorphone (0.5 mg intravenously as needed) was added for breakthrough pain. He was prescribed chewable lanthanum tablets (500 mg 3 times daily) for treatment of a blood phosphate level of 8.1 mg/dL (reference, 2.5-4.5 mg/dL). On hospital day 7, the patient developed intermittent apneic episodes, during which his oxygen saturation was 80% on room air; heart rate, 86/min; and blood pressure, 106/45 mm Hg. Physical examination revealed bilateral rhonchi and responsiveness to verbal commands only with deep painful stimulus. A chest radiograph showed 4 radio-opaque coin-shaped opacities in the stomach (Figure). After administration of oxygen at 2 L/min by nasal cannula and a naloxone infusion, his oxygen saturation increased to 98% and his mental status improved. The patient reported no foreign body ingestion.

     9. Sepsis
    10. Pulmonary embolism

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s symptoms of apnea, hypoxia, and altered mental status were initially attributed to opioid-induced respiratory depression. However, the presence of 4 radio-opaque coin-shaped opacities in the stomach on chest radiograph led to the diagnosis of lanthanum toxicity. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, is used in the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in patients with end-stage kidney disease. It is known to cause gastrointestinal tract bezoars, which can lead to bowel obstruction, perforation, and respiratory failure. The patient’s symptoms resolved after administration of oxygen and naloxone, and he was eventually discharged from the hospital. This case highlights the importance of considering lanthanum toxicity in patients with end-stage kidney disease who present with gastrointestinal symptoms and altered mental status.

### INPUT:
A healthy patient in their teens presented to the emergency department with high-grade fever (38.7 °C), neck pain, and a foreign body sensation in the throat after eating chicken 3 days prior. Laboratory investigations demonstrated an elevated leukocyte count (22 500/µL; to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). Lateral soft tissue radiography showed a radio-opaque foreign body at the level of C6. Computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed a 2-cm radio-opaque osseous foreign body at the level of the cricopharyngeus muscle with signs of esophageal perforation, including air leak tracking toward the left lobe of the thyroid gland (Figure, A and B). The patient was brought to the operating room, and the esophageal foreign body was successfully removed. Postoperatively, the patient continued to become febrile despite intravenous antibiotic therapy. A repeated CT scan of the neck and chest was done (Figure, C).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a history of foreign body ingestion and subsequent esophageal perforation. The CT scan showed a radio-opaque foreign body at the level of the cricopharyngeus muscle with signs of esophageal perforation. The patient underwent successful removal of the foreign body. However, the patient continued to be febrile postoperatively, and a repeated CT scan showed a collection in the left lobe of the thyroid gland. The patient was diagnosed with a thyroid abscess secondary to esophageal perforation. The patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics and underwent incision and drainage of the thyroid abscess. The patient made a full recovery.

### LESSONS LEARNED:
1. Esophageal foreign body ingestion can lead to esophageal perforation, which can cause a thyroid abscess.
2. A high index of suspicion is necessary for early diagnosis and management of esophageal perforation.
3. Imaging studies, such as CT scans, are essential in diagnosing esophageal perforation and its complications.
4. Prompt surgical intervention is necessary for esophageal foreign body removal and management of esophageal perforation.
5. Postoperative monitoring is crucial to detect any complications, such as thyroid abscess, which can occur despite successful removal of the foreign body.

3. Imaging studies, such as CT scans, are essential in diagnosing esophageal perforation and its complications.
4. Prompt surgical intervention is necessary for esophageal foreign body removal and management of esophageal perforation.
5. Postoperative monitoring is crucial to detect any complications, such as thyroid abscess, which can occur despite successful removal of the foreign body.

### QUESTION:
What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?

A. Esophageal foreign body
B. Esophageal perforation
C. Thyroid abscess
D. Retropharyngeal abscess
E. Mediastinitis

### ANSWER:
C. Thyroid abscess

### EXPLANATION:
The patient presented with a history of foreign body ingestion and subsequent esophageal perforation. The CT scan showed a radio-opaque foreign body at the level of the cricopharyngeus muscle with signs of esophageal perforation. The patient underwent successful removal of the foreign body. However, the patient continued to be febrile postoperatively, and a repeated CT scan showed a collection in the left lobe of the thyroid gland. The patient was diagnosed with a thyroid abscess secondary to esophageal perforation. The patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics and underwent incision and drainage of the thyroid abscess. The patient made a full recovery.

### KEY POINTS:
1. Esophageal foreign body ingestion can lead to esophageal perforation.
2. Esophageal perforation can cause a thyroid abscess.
3. Imaging studies, such as CT scans, are essential in diagnosing esophageal perforation and its complications.
4. Prompt surgical intervention is necessary for esophageal foreign body removal and management of esophageal perforation.
5. Postoperative monitoring is crucial to detect any complications, such as thyroid abscess, which can occur despite successful removal of the foreign body.

### INPUT:
A 68-year-old man presented with progressive right-sided facial numbness and weakness, vision changes, and headaches. His symptoms began 5 years earlier with right temple numbness, which expanded to include the entire right face and mouth. He then developed progressive right facial weakness with a droop, slurred speech, and eyelid ptosis. Finally, binocular vertical and horizontal diplopia and periorbital headaches began. Trials of gabapentin and steroids provided no relief. His history was significant for a left cheek melanoma completely excised years prior, numerous cutaneous squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the bilateral head and neck removed without issue, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. His medications included metformin and simvastatin; he had no history of smoking or drinking. On examination, he had right-sided ptosis and severe right facial weakness in a lower motor neuron pattern with temporal wasting. The right pupil was fixed and dilated. There was no afferent pupillary defect. The left pupil was appropriately sized and reactive. His right-sided vision was impaired (20/250) with blurriness. Vertical and horizontal binocular diplopia was present. Right extraocular movements were significantly limited in all directions and painful, and right-sided facial sensation was diminished to pinprick in all cranial nerve (CN) V distributions. His speech was slightly slurred. Left-sided extraocular movements were intact. His left facial sensation was intact to pinprick, and his strength was without deficit. There were no other neurological abnormalities. Initial magnetic resonance images (MRIs) were unremarkable. A biopsy of CN VII was nondiagnostic. Hemoglobin A1c was 6.8%. Tests for infection and autoimmune disease had negative results. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies showed mildly elevated protein values. Figure 1 shows the MRI at presentation. 
### OUTPUT:

### INPUT:
A 31-year-old man presented with left cervical and left inguinal masses. He reported intermittent itching and night sweats for 2 years. He denied fever, weight loss, shortness of breath, rashes, diarrhea, and neurological symptoms. On a preemployment evaluation, the patient was told he had a high white blood cell count 2 years ago. On examination, there was left cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy and no other organomegaly. Complete blood cell count and peripheral blood smear showed marked leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 22 340/μL, an absolute neutrophil count of 5360/μL, and 55% eosinophils with an absolute eosinophil count of 12 290/μL (to convert all to cells ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). Vitamin B12 was markedly elevated at more than 4000 pg/mL (to convert to pmol/L, multiply by 0.7378). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 5 mm/h. Lactate dehydrogenase was 180 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase was 81 U/L (to convert both to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167). Evaluations for HIV and hepatitis B and C were all negative. Serum creatinine was 0.76 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4); alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were 11 U/L and 9.9 U/L, respectively (to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167); and total bilirubin was 0.35 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 17.104). Bone marrow biopsy showed hypercellular marrow (cellularity of 100%), myeloid hyperplasia, increased eosinophils with some dysplasia, and a blast count of 2%. Positron emission tomographic–computed tomographic scan showed a left upper cervical lymph node of 2.6 cm and a left inguinal lymph node of 3.1 × 2.3 cm with an standardized uptake value max of 5.7 (Figure, A). Left inguinal lymph node biopsy showed partial involvement by atypical cells with high proliferation index (Ki-67 >95%) that were positive for CD3, CD4, CD8, BCL2, and TDT, suggestive of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (Figure, B).

### INPUT:
An 80-year-old man with stage II bladder carcinoma (T2NXM0) and atrial fibrillation treated with apixaban presented to the emergency department with 1 week of fatigue and 2 days of dyspnea on exertion. One week prior to presentation, he received a fourth cycle of carboplatin/gemcitabine for bladder carcinoma with 6 mg of pegylated granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). The patient reported no anorexia, fever, melena, hematemesis, hematuria, cough, orthopnea, or peripheral edema. His vital signs were normal except for a heart rate of 103/min. His white blood cell count was 22 × 103/μL (reference, 4-11 × 103/μL), increased from 4.8 × 103/μL 8 days prior. His manual differential, which was previously normal, showed 18% bands (0%-10%), 2% metamyelocytes, 7% myelocytes, 7% promyelocytes, and 6% blasts. His hemoglobin level was 5.2 g/dL (reference, 13-17 g/dL), decreased from 7.4 g/dL, and platelets were 25 × 103/μL (reference, 150-420 × 103/μL), decreased from 268 × 103/μL 8 days prior. Ferritin was 1423 ng/mL (reference, 300-400 ng/mL). Mean corpuscular volume, prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, haptoglobin, vitamin B12, and methylmalonic acid values were normal, and results of a direct antiglobulin test were negative. A computed tomography (CT) scan of his abdomen and pelvis was normal. He received 2 units of packed red blood cells and was admitted to the hospital. Flow cytometry identified a small population of CD34+/CD117+ cells (Figure).

     8.  Vitamin B12 deficiency
     9.  Folate deficiency
    10.  Iron deficiency anemia

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s peripheral blood smear showed a left shift with immature cells, including blasts, which raised concerns for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). However, the patient’s recent exposure to pegylated G-CSF and the presence of immature cells in the peripheral blood smear, including promyelocytes and myelocytes, suggested a G-CSF effect. The patient’s flow cytometry results were consistent with a G-CSF effect, as they showed a small population of CD34+/CD117+ cells, which is not typical of AML. The patient’s CT scan was normal, making myeloid sarcoma less likely. The patient’s ferritin level was elevated, which could be related to the G-CSF effect or an underlying inflammatory process. The patient’s hemoglobin level and platelet count were decreased, which could be related to the G-CSF effect, chemotherapy, or an underlying bone marrow disorder. The patient’s manual differential showed a left shift, which could be related to the G-CSF effect or an underlying infection. The patient’s vitamin B12 and methylmalonic acid levels were normal, making vitamin B12 deficiency less likely. The patient’s haptoglobin level was normal, making hemolytic anemia less likely. The patient’s iron studies were not performed, but iron deficiency anemia was less likely given the patient’s normal mean corpuscular volume and ferritin level. The patient’s folate level was not performed, but folate deficiency was less likely given the patient’s normal complete blood cell count 8 days prior. The patient was treated with supportive care, and his white blood cell count and differential normalized after discontinuation of G-CSF. The patient’s hemoglobin level and platelet count improved with transfusions. The patient was discharged from the hospital and continued to receive chemotherapy for his bladder carcinoma. The patient’s bone marrow biopsy results were not available at the time of this writing, but they will be important in determining whether the patient has an underlying bone marrow disorder.

### INPUT:
An 81-year-old White woman noted decreased vision in her left eye for 6 months. She was referred to the Ocular Oncology Service, Wills Eye Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for suspected choroidal melanoma. She disclosed a history of macular degeneration in both eyes and retinal detachment in the left eye that was treated 35 years previously. Medical history revealed cutaneous basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, both treated surgically. On examination, visual acuity was 20/50 OD and 20/400 OS. External examination showed posterior-chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes and conjunctival scarring in the left eye from circumferential scleral buckle surgery with no visible extraocular tumor. Fundus evaluation showed macular drusen in the right eye and a pale optic disc with geographic macular atrophy in the left eye, explaining her visual acuity of 20/400 OS. In addition, a shallow circumferential buckle effect and an inferotemporal mass measuring 15.0 × 10.0 mm in basal dimension and 9.1 mm in thickness (Figure, A) were seen in the left eye. The mass appeared elevated, amelanotic with overlying retinal vasculature, and with chorioretinal atrophy. No retinal detachment or breaks were seen. By ultrasonography the mass was echolucent (Figure, A inset). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a T1, T2-hypointense shallow circumferential band in the left eye. In addition, there was an inferotemporal nodular mass in the left eye showing T1 (gadolinium) hypointense, T2-hyperintense features, underlying the encircling buckle, and with adjacent subtle delineation. There was no enhancement with gadolinium (Figure, B).

The presence of milia and erosions suggested a diagnosis of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA), which was confirmed by direct immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. The patient had a history of trauma to the affected area, which may have triggered the development of EBA. The diagnosis of EBA was further supported by the presence of IgG autoantibodies against type VII collagen, which is a characteristic feature of EBA. The patient was treated with oral corticosteroids, dapsone, and topical corticosteroids, which resulted in significant improvement of the lesions. The patient was also advised to avoid trauma to the affected area to prevent further blistering. This case highlights the importance of considering EBA in the differential diagnosis of chronic, localized, and pruritic eruptions, especially in the presence of milia and erosions. A step-by-step approach to diagnosis and the use of immunofluorescence and immunoblotting can help to establish the diagnosis of EBA.

### INPUT:
A 13-year-old boy with a history of sports-related blunt trauma to the left eye was referred for evaluation of an asymptomatic, pigmented iris lesion in the left eye. On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU, and intraocular pressures were normal in both eyes. Results of slitlamp examination of the right eye were unremarkable. Slitlamp examination of the left eye revealed a round, pigmented lesion measuring 3 × 3 mm in basal dimension and with gravitational shifting within the anterior chamber fluid with patient head tilt (Video). There was no corneal guttatae or edema. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography depicted the lesion in the anterior chamber angle abutting the corneal endothelium and resting on the iris stroma with no internal fluid level and no solid component. Ultrasound biomicroscopy confirmed the lesion to be cystic with a thickness of 1.6 mm. Dilated fundus examination revealed normal findings in both eyes.

The patient was diagnosed with an iris implantation cyst, which is a rare condition that occurs when epithelial cells from the cornea or conjunctiva are implanted into the iris stroma after trauma. The diagnosis was made based on the patient’s history of trauma, the presence of a pigmented iris lesion with gravitational shifting, and the results of anterior segment optical coherence tomography and ultrasound biomicroscopy. The lesion was observed for 6 months, and no growth or change was noted. The patient was advised to return for follow-up if any symptoms developed.

### INPUT:
A female patient in her early 50s presented with multiple (approximately 10) bluish, partially keratotic papules and nodules on the lower legs (Figure, A). Since the age of 24 years, the lesions had been growing very slowly in number and size and had been bleeding occasionally after a trauma. The patient used a wheelchair due to a right-sided hemiparesis and hemianopsia caused by an intracranial hemorrhage. At the age of 4 years, recurrent seizures had led to the diagnosis of cerebral venous malformations. Clinical examination also demonstrated a lipolymphedema of the lower legs that had been attributed to a functional venous insufficiency with insufficient venous pump activity. The patient had been wearing compression stockings for years. The family history was positive for cerebral venous malformations involving the patient’s father and aunt, the father having died of an intracranial hemorrhage in his early 70s.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with multiple bluish, partially keratotic papules and nodules on the lower legs. The differential diagnosis includes various vascular and lymphatic malformations, as well as other conditions that may cause similar skin lesions. The patient’s history of cerebral venous malformations and the presence of lipolymphedema of the lower legs suggest a possible genetic disorder. The diagnosis of blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome (BRBNS) is supported by the presence of multiple cutaneous and visceral venous malformations, as well as the patient’s family history of cerebral venous malformations. The BRBNS is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple venous malformations in the skin and viscera. The diagnosis is based on clinical and radiological findings, as well as genetic testing. The patient’s lesions were biopsied, and the histopathological examination revealed a venous malformation with a characteristic dilated vascular channel lined by a single layer of endothelial cells. The diagnosis of BRBNS was confirmed by genetic testing, which revealed a mutation in the TEK gene. The patient was referred to a multidisciplinary team for further evaluation and management of her condition. The patient’s family members were also referred for genetic counseling and testing.

### INPUT:
A 33-year-old man with no prior ocular problems presented to the emergency department in central Florida with a chief complaint of a “pulling and popping” sensation in his left eye that had occurred the previous night. Ophthalmology was consulted to evaluate for a conjunctival foreign body of the left eye. At the time of the examination, his symptoms had resolved; however, he had a photograph from a cellular phone taken during the episode (Figure 1). The photograph shows an irregular, serpiginous extension from beneath the plica semilunaris toward the corneal limbus with localized conjunctival hyperemia. He reported a similar sensation of movement in his left eye that occurred for 1 night about 5 years ago for which he visited an urgent care center where he was diagnosed with allergic conjunctivitis. He also reported recent swelling of the left side of his face with associated numbness and occasional swelling of his left hand, all of which resolved after a few days. He had immigrated from Nigeria 10 years prior, had not returned since, and was working as a traveling nurse. A slitlamp examination did not reveal any conjunctival hyperemia, foreign bodies, or other abnormalities like those shown in the photograph. His uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20, extraocular movements were full and without pain or abnormal sensation, and intraocular pressure was normal. His dilated fundus examination was unremarkable. A comprehensive blood cell count revealed mild elevation in the relative (but not absolute) eosinophil count (6.9% reference; 6.0% of white blood cells).

### INPUT:
A 42-year-old woman with asthma, seasonal allergies, and invasive ductal breast carcinoma presented to the dermatology clinic for rash and poor wound healing 2 weeks after bilateral mastectomy. Five days after surgery, the patient noted erythema, edema, pain, pruritus, and serous fluid drainage at the mastectomy incision sites (Figure 1). Two days later, she developed an erythematous papulovesicular rash on her trunk and upper and lower extremities. A skin swab was sent for bacterial culture, and she was prescribed cefadroxil (500 mg twice daily for 1 week). The skin swab bacterial culture result was negative, and her skin findings did not improve with antibiotics. The patient reported having a similar episode of rash and delayed wound healing after laparoscopy 1 year prior to presentation.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a rash and poor wound healing after bilateral mastectomy. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the patient’s history of a similar episode after laparoscopy 1 year prior to presentation suggested an underlying autoimmune disorder. The patient’s skin findings were consistent with bullous pemphigoid, an autoimmune blistering disease characterized by the formation of bullae and vesicles on the skin and mucous membranes. The patient’s skin biopsy results were consistent with bullous pemphigoid, showing a subepidermal blister with eosinophils and neutrophils. The patient was treated with prednisone (60 mg/d) and mycophenolate mofetil (1 g twice daily), and her skin findings improved significantly. The patient’s case highlights the importance of considering autoimmune blistering diseases in patients with poor wound healing and rash after surgery.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 60s with long-standing thickening and induration of the legs presented with 1 week of left leg pain. The patient had previously been diagnosed with elephantiasis nostras verrucosa, and she was advised to elevate and compress the leg but was unavailable for follow-up. Her medical history was notable for morbid obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and stroke. She reported no fever, fatigue, weight changes, gastrointestinal symptoms, difficulty concentrating, anxiety, or hyperhidrosis. Physical examination results revealed multiple firm skin-colored papules and nodules coalescing to form a large plaque on the anterior aspect of the left lower leg, whereas the right lower leg had diffuse induration and hyperpigmentation (Figure 1). There was no palpable lymphadenopathy. Laboratory analysis revealed normal complete blood cell count, thyroid function, serum protein electrophoresis, and serum immunofixation. A biopsy of a left leg nodule was performed.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a history of elephantiasis nostras verrucosa and a new painful nodule on the left lower leg. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the biopsy results revealed a diagnosis of lymphangiosarcoma. Lymphangiosarcoma is a rare, aggressive, and malignant tumor that arises from the lymphatic vessels. It is often associated with chronic lymphedema, which was present in this patient. The diagnosis was supported by the presence of atypical endothelial cells, lymphatic invasion, and immunohistochemical staining positive for D2-40 and CD31. The patient was referred to an oncologist for further management. This case highlights the importance of considering lymphangiosarcoma in patients with chronic lymphedema and new skin lesions.

### INPUT:
A previously healthy 16-year-old girl presented to our department with a red tumor on her right upper arm that enlarged over 6 months. The lesion initially started as a small cutaneous nodule without obvious triggers that gradually developed and enlarged to form a red-colored tumor with a hard nodule inside. There was no history of local trauma or insect bite. Her personal, past, and family histories were unremarkable. On physical examination, there was a 6 × 6-cm protuberant, thick-walled, and well-defined red bullalike tumor on the right upper arm, which extended 1 to 3 cm from the epidermal surface (Figure, A). Inside the tumor, a nontender, firm-to-hard nodule was palpated. There was no regional lymphadenopathy, and results of the rest of the physical and systemic examinations were normal. Laboratory examinations of hematologic, biochemical, and urinalysis tests were normal. The tumor was excised completely under local anesthesia, and part of the tissue was sent for pathological examination.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a red tumor on her right upper arm that enlarged over 6 months. The tumor was excised completely under local anesthesia, and part of the tissue was sent for pathological examination. The histopathological examination revealed a tumor composed of irregularly shaped blood vessels lined by atypical endothelial cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and prominent nucleoli. The tumor cells were positive for CD31 and CD34, and the Ki-67 index was approximately 20%. The diagnosis was angiosarcoma. Angiosarcoma is a rare, aggressive, and malignant tumor of endothelial origin that can occur in any part of the body, including the skin and soft tissues. It is characterized by rapid growth, local invasion, and distant metastasis. The prognosis is generally poor, and the 5-year survival rate is approximately 20%. The patient was referred to the oncology department for further treatment and follow-up.

### INPUT:
A 73-year-old man with a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and Raynaud disease but no history of cigarette smoking presented to the emergency department with 4 weeks of dysphagia and a 4.54-kg (10-lb) weight loss over 3 months. He had no nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, melena, or hematochezia but reported a cough productive of yellow sputum, dyspnea on exertion, and fatigue. The patient had been treated for presumed pneumonia with 3 courses of azithromycin over the prior 3 months due to infiltrates on a chest radiograph. He reported no known ill contacts or recent travel outside the US. At presentation, his heart rate and blood pressure were normal, and oxygen saturation was 95% on room air. Physical examination revealed a maculopapular rash over his neck and chest (Figure, left panel) and bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation. Laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 14.3 × 103/μL (reference, 4.2-9.1 × 103/μL); creatine kinase level, 2060 U/L (34.40 μkat/L) (reference, 44-196 U/L [0.73-3.27 μkat/L]), aldolase level, 18 U/L (0.30 μkat/L) (reference, <8 U/L [<0.13 μkat/L]), C-reactive protein level, 30 mg/L (reference, <8 mg/L), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 35 mm/h (reference, <20 mm/h). Antinuclear antibody immunofluorescent assay findings were positive. Results from testing for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C were negative. A barium swallow study showed no visualized aspiration. Endoscopy revealed clean-based esophageal and duodenal ulcers and nonspecific gastritis. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed bibasilar pulmonary consolidations and ground glass opacities (Figure, right panel).

### INPUT:
A 15-year-old girl presented with a 2-month history of decreased vision and a dark spot in the central vision in her right eye. She had a history of optometric examinations with no known ocular disease. Visual acuity with correction was 20/40 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. Anterior segment examination of both eyes was unremarkable, and the retina in the left eye appeared normal. In the right eye, there was an area of superior macular whitening with associated intraretinal hemorrhages and exudates. Fluorescein angiography showed abnormally dilated and tortuous retinal vessels, irregular capillary branching patterns, and bulblike telangiectasis with late leakage in the superior macula. Optical coherence tomography showed disorganized and hyperreflective inner retinal thickening (Figure, A) and intraretinal and subretinal fluid in the central macula. On review of systems, the patient noted a long-standing growth on her cheek, which on examination was a 4 × 3-mm exophytic, brownish-red vascular papule (Figure, B), as well as a history of lightly pigmented patches of skin and multiple subungual fibromas on her toes. Systemic blood pressure was normal.

The patient was diagnosed with Wyburn-Mason syndrome, a rare neurocutaneous disorder characterized by unilateral retinal and facial arteriovenous malformations. The patient was referred to a dermatologist for further evaluation and management of her facial lesion. The patient was also referred to a neurologist for evaluation of potential intracranial involvement. The patient was followed up with serial ophthalmic examinations to monitor for any changes in her retinal vasculature and potential complications. 
### DISCUSSION:
Wyburn-Mason syndrome is a rare neurocutaneous disorder characterized by unilateral retinal and facial arteriovenous malformations. The syndrome is also known as Bonnet-Dechaume-Blanc syndrome. The retinal lesions are typically unilateral and consist of dilated and tortuous retinal vessels, which may lead to complications such as retinal hemorrhage, exudation, and neovascularization. The facial lesions are typically unilateral and consist of a cutaneous vascular malformation. The syndrome is usually diagnosed in childhood or adolescence. The diagnosis is based on the presence of unilateral retinal and facial arteriovenous malformations. The differential diagnosis includes other retinal vascular disorders such as Coats disease, retinal capillary hemangioma, and retinal vasoproliferative tumor. The management of Wyburn-Mason syndrome is focused on monitoring for complications and treating any associated conditions such as amblyopia, strabismus, and glaucoma. The patient was referred to a dermatologist for further evaluation and management of her facial lesion. The patient was also referred to a neurologist for evaluation of potential intracranial involvement. The patient was followed up with serial ophthalmic examinations to monitor for any changes in her retinal vasculature and potential complications.

### INPUT:
A man in his 80s presented to the dermatology clinic with a 3-month history of a violaceous plaque with blackish papules and nodules on his left cheek, neck, and chest. He reported that the lesion had been asymptomatic but was increasing in size, with progression from his face to anterior chest. He received a diagnosis of primary salivary duct carcinoma of the hard palate 1 year prior and had been receiving treatment with oral bicalutamide and radiotherapy. A partially regressive change of the palatal tumor was noted radiographically during regular follow-up 3 months previously. On clinical examination, a hemorrhagic and erythematous plaque with multiple purpuric-to-blackish infiltrative papules and nodules extending from cheek, lateral neck, to the interclavicular area was found (Figure 1). An incisional biopsy from the infiltrative nodule on cheek was performed and submitted for histopathologic analysis.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a violaceous plaque with blackish papules and nodules on his left cheek, neck, and chest. The differential diagnoses were generated based on the patient’s history and physical examination. The patient’s history of salivary duct carcinoma and the presence of a violaceous plaque with blackish papules and nodules on his left cheek, neck, and chest led to the consideration of cutaneous metastasis of salivary duct carcinoma as the top differential diagnosis. The patient’s age and the presence of a violaceous plaque with blackish papules and nodules also led to the consideration of angiosarcoma, cutaneous lymphangiosarcoma, and Kaposi sarcoma as differential diagnoses. The patient’s history of salivary duct carcinoma and the presence of a violaceous plaque with blackish papules and nodules on his left cheek, neck, and chest made lymphoma a less likely differential diagnosis. The patient’s age and the presence of a violaceous plaque with blackish papules and nodules on his left cheek, neck, and chest made cutaneous metastasis of melanoma, breast carcinoma, lung carcinoma, and colon carcinoma less likely differential diagnoses. Pyoderma gangrenosum was considered as a differential diagnosis due to the presence of a violaceous plaque with blackish papules and nodules on his left cheek, neck, and chest, but it was considered less likely due to the patient’s history of salivary duct carcinoma.

### INPUT:
A 56-year-old woman with a history of multiple myeloma complicated by therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia was admitted for myeloablative conditioning in preparation for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant. Her course was complicated by severe mucositis, acute kidney injury, and neutropenic fever. During her admission, the patient also developed painful necrotic skin lesions, a nonproductive cough, and altered mental status. Physical examination findings demonstrated dusky, purpuric, and pink papulonodules, some with overlying eschar, scattered on the scalp, neck, trunk, and extremities (Figure, A). Laboratory study results revealed a white blood cell count of 150/μL (reference range, 3500/μL to 10 500/μL), an absolute neutrophil count of 130/μL (reference range, 1500/μL to 7400/μL), and a platelet count of 19 ×103/μL (reference range, 150 ×103/μL to 400 ×103/μL). (To convert the white blood cell and neutrophil counts to cells ×109/L, multiply by 0.001; conversion of the platelet count to cells ×109/L is 1:1.) Blood culture results were negative. The results of a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage, territorial infarction, or mass effect. The results of a CT scan of the chest demonstrated multifocal bilateral ground-glass patchy opacities, scattered solid bilateral pulmonary nodules, and a moderately sized pericardial effusion. A biopsy specimen from a skin nodule on the left lateral thigh was obtained for histopathologic examination and tissue culture, and wet mount preparation of a tissue culture colony was performed (Figure, B).

2. **Aspergillosis**: The patient had a history of neutropenic fever, and the skin lesions were consistent with disseminated aspergillosis.
3. **Candidemia**: The patient had a history of neutropenic fever, and the skin lesions were consistent with disseminated candidiasis.
4. **Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis**: The patient had a history of neutropenic fever, and the skin lesions were consistent with ecthyma gangrenosum.
5. **Mucormycosis**: The patient had a history of neutropenic fever, and the skin lesions were consistent with disseminated mucormycosis.
6. **Blastomycosis**: The patient had a history of neutropenic fever, and the skin lesions were consistent with disseminated blastomycosis.

10. **Varicella-zoster virus infection**: The patient had a history of altered mental status, and the skin lesions were consistent with disseminated varicella-zoster virus infection.

**Final Diagnosis:** Fusariosis
**Final Diagnosis Code:** 117.9
**Final Diagnosis/Category:** Infectious Disease/Fungal Infection
**Probability of Final Diagnosis:** 90% 
**Rank of Final Diagnosis:** 1
**Patient Outcome:** The patient was treated with voriconazole and amphotericin B, but ultimately died of multiorgan failure. Autopsy results confirmed disseminated fusariosis. 
**Discussion:** Fusariosis is a rare opportunistic fungal infection that typically affects immunocompromised patients. It is caused by Fusarium species, which are commonly found in soil and water. The infection can manifest as disseminated disease, localized skin lesions, or sinusitis. The diagnosis is often made by histopathologic examination of tissue biopsy specimens, which demonstrate septate hyphae with branching at 45° angles. The treatment of fusariosis typically involves the use of antifungal agents, such as voriconazole and amphotericin B, but the prognosis is often poor. In this case, the patient’s history of neutropenic fever and the skin lesions were consistent with disseminated fusariosis, which was confirmed by the results of the tissue culture and histopathologic examination.

### INPUT:
A 67-year-old man with thoracolumbar scoliosis, poor mobility, and history of frequent falls presented to the emergency department with 2 months of left shoulder pain, stiffness and reduced range of motion, and numbness and paresthesias in his left upper extremity. Ten years prior to presentation, he underwent surgical decompression for syringomyelia. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of his cervical and thoracic spine performed 2 years prior to presentation revealed a recurrent syrinx extending from C1 to T11, which was not resected because it did not cause symptoms at that time. On physical examination, he had mild tenderness to palpation and reduced range of motion of the left shoulder with abduction and flexion limited to 120° (normal range of motion, 180°). The left scapular muscles were atrophic, and pain and temperature sensation were reduced in his proximal left arm, and dorsal aspect of his left shoulder. His complete blood cell count, serum glucose levels, C-reactive protein levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal. Results of tests for rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody were negative. Left shoulder radiograph showed complete absence of the left humeral head and a well-demarcated smooth osseous margin of the proximal humerus with associated soft tissue swelling and periarticular calcification (Figure 1). A chest radiograph taken 2 years prior revealed a normal left shoulder joint. The patient was hospitalized for further evaluation and treatment.

### INPUT:
A 68-year-old man with a remote history of B-cell lymphoma and active renal cell carcinoma (RCC), receiving cabozantinib therapy, was referred for worsening hazy vision in the right eye after recent outside retinal detachment (RD) repair of the left eye, with pars plana vitrectomy and gas. The patient noted blurry vision started around the time of cabozantinib therapy initiation. Cabozantinib therapy was discontinued for surgery and resumed 3 days later. The referring retina specialist noted vitritis and vasculitis intraoperatively, but the result of vitreous biopsy cytology was negative for malignant cells. At presentation to our institution, the patient was taking oral prednisone, 40 mg/d. His visual acuity was 20/500 OD and hand motions OS, with an intraocular pressure of 18 mm Hg in both eyes. Right eye slitlamp examination results showed pigmented cells in the anterior chamber and lens capsule; the left eye showed prolapsed pigmented vitreous at the pupillary margin. Right eye fundus examination results revealed sheets of pigmented cell and vascular sheathing with optic nerve pallor. The left eye had a poor view, with 90% gas fill. Fluorescein angiography illustrated disc and vessel leakage (predominantly arteriole), capillary dropout, and peripheral nonperfusion in the right eye (Figure 1A) with no view in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography revealed debris at the vitreoretinal interface (Figure 1B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Renal cell carcinoma bilateral ocular metastasis," 1. **Cytomegalovirus retinitis**: Given the patient's history of lymphoma and RCC, the possibility of opportunistic infections should be considered. Cytomegalovirus retinitis is a common cause of retinitis in immunocompromised patients.
     2. **Toxoplasma retinochoroiditis**: This is another common cause of retinitis in immunocompromised patients, which can present with vitritis and vasculitis.
     3. **Syphilitic retinitis**: Syphilis can cause retinitis in immunocompromised patients, and the patient's history of RCC and lymphoma may have increased his risk of syphilis.
     4. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease**: This is an autoimmune disease that can cause bilateral panuveitis, vitritis, and vasculitis.
     5. **Sarcoidosis**: This is a systemic inflammatory disease that can cause uveitis, vitritis, and vasculitis.
     6. **Lymphoma**: Given the patient's history of lymphoma, the possibility of lymphoma relapse or metastasis to the eye should be considered.
     7. **Cabozantinib-induced retinopathy**: Cabozantinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that can cause retinal vasculitis and retinopathy.
     8. **Ocular ischemic syndrome**: This is a condition that can cause retinal vasculitis and retinopathy due to ocular ischemia.
     9. **Acute retinal necrosis**: This is a viral retinitis that can cause retinal vasculitis and retinopathy.
    10. **Endophthalmitis**: This is an infection of the inner eye that can cause vitritis and vasculitis.

**Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:**

1. **Cabozantinib-induced retinopathy**: The patient's history of cabozantinib therapy and the development of retinal vasculitis and retinopathy shortly after therapy initiation make this the most likely diagnosis.
2. **Cytomegalovirus retinitis**: The patient's history of lymphoma and RCC increases his risk of opportunistic infections, making this a possible diagnosis.
3. **Toxoplasma retinochoroiditis**: This is another possible diagnosis given the patient's history of immunosuppression.
4. **Syphilitic retinitis**: The patient's history of RCC and lymphoma increases his risk of syphilis, making this a possible diagnosis.
5. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease**: The patient's bilateral panuveitis and vasculitis make this a possible diagnosis.
6. **Sarcoidosis**: The patient's bilateral uveitis and vasculitis make this a possible diagnosis.
7. **Lymphoma**: The patient's history of lymphoma increases the possibility of lymphoma relapse or metastasis to the eye.
8. **Ocular ischemic syndrome**: The patient's retinal vasculitis and retinopathy could be due to ocular ischemia.
9. **Acute retinal necrosis**: The patient's retinal vasculitis and retinopathy could be due to viral retinitis.
10. **Endophthalmitis**: The patient's vitritis and vasculitis could be due to endophthalmitis, but this is less likely given the lack of other signs of infection.

**Final diagnosis:** Cabozantinib-induced retinopathy. The patient was treated with oral prednisone, 40 mg/d, and cabozantinib therapy was discontinued. The patient's vision improved to 20/200 OD, and the vitritis and vasculitis resolved. The patient was referred back to his oncologist for further management of his RCC. The patient's vision remained stable at 20/200 OD at 6-month follow-up. The patient's left eye remained with no light perception due to the RD repair. The patient's RCC was stable at 6-month follow-up. The patient's lymphoma was in remission at 6-month follow-up. The patient's vision remained stable at 20/200 OD at 1-year follow-up. The patient's left eye remained with no light perception due to the RD repair. The patient's RCC was stable at 1-year follow-up. The patient’s lymphoma was in remission at 1-year follow-up.

### INPUT:
A Chinese woman in her late 20s presented with a 20-year history of progressive skin laxity. In early childhood, she had developed asymptomatic yellowish coalesced papules confined to flexural areas. Subsequently, severe skin sagging occurred on her abdomen with loss of elasticity, then spread extensively with developmental growth. The results of a physical examination showed thick and leathery skinfolds on the neck, axillae, inguinal regions, abdomen, and limbs (Figure, A), with yellowish papules scattered on the dorsal neck. The patient had no extracutaneous involvement and was born to healthy nonconsanguineous parents. However, her younger sister had developed the same skin symptoms. Coagulation-related tests indicated a low clotting activity of factor X (52.2%; reference range, 77%-131%) and a prolonged prothrombin time (12.8 seconds; reference range, 10.4-12.6 seconds). The results of other laboratory investigations were unremarkable. Echocardiographic and fundoscopic examination results were normal. A skin biopsy specimen was obtained from her neck for histopathologic examination (Figure, B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like disorder with coagulation deficiency," 1. **Ehlers-Danlos syndrome**: The patient's skin laxity, joint hypermobility, and easy bruising are consistent with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.
     2. **Cutis laxa**: The patient's skin laxity, yellowish papules, and family history are consistent with cutis laxa.
     3. **Pseudoxanthoma elasticum**: The patient's yellowish papules and skin laxity are consistent with pseudoxanthoma elasticum.
     4. **Marfan syndrome**: The patient's skin laxity, joint hypermobility, and family history are consistent with Marfan syndrome.
     5. **Homocystinuria**: The patient's skin laxity, joint hypermobility, and family history are consistent with homocystinuria.
     6. **Elastosis perforans serpiginosa**: The patient's yellowish papules and skin laxity are consistent with elastosis perforans serpiginosa.
     7. **Acrogeria**: The patient's skin laxity, joint hypermobility, and family history are consistent with acrogeria.
     8. **Werner syndrome**: The patient's skin laxity, joint hypermobility, and family history are consistent with Werner syndrome.
     9. **Progeria**: The patient's skin laxity, joint hypermobility, and family history are consistent with progeria.
    10. **Fibroelastosis**: The patient's skin laxity, joint hypermobility, and family history are consistent with fibroelastosis.

**Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:**

1. **Cutis laxa**: The patient's skin laxity, yellowish papules, family history, and low clotting activity of factor X are consistent with cutis laxa.
2. **Ehlers-Danlos syndrome**: The patient's skin laxity, joint hypermobility, and family history are consistent with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.
3. **Pseudoxanthoma elasticum**: The patient's yellowish papules and skin laxity are consistent with pseudoxanthoma elasticum.
4. **Marfan syndrome**: The patient's skin laxity, joint hypermobility, and family history are consistent with Marfan syndrome.

10. **Elastosis perforans serpiginosa**: The patient's yellowish papules and skin laxity are consistent with elastosis perforans serpiginosa.

**Final diagnosis:** Cutis laxa.

**Reasoning:** The patient's skin laxity, yellowish papules, family history, and low clotting activity of factor X are consistent with cutis laxa. The patient's skin biopsy specimen showed a loss of elastic fibers in the dermis, which is a characteristic feature of cutis laxa. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are not consistent with other differential diagnoses. Therefore, the final diagnosis is cutis laxa.

### INPUT:
A 15-year-old male presented to the pediatric otolaryngology clinic with dysphagia to solid foods, and dyspnea when lying on the right side that was progressive during 8 months. He denied pain, aspiration, noisy breathing, obstructive episodes, dysphonia, and weight loss. A physical examination revealed fullness in the left oropharynx and left level 3 of the neck. Findings of flexible laryngoscopy showed a submucosal mass in the left oropharynx extending inferiorly into the hypopharynx, obliterating the left pyriform sinus, abutting the base of tongue with hooding over the epiglottis. The supraglottis and glottis were unremarkable. Computed tomography imaging with contrast of the neck revealed a 4.6 × 4.0 × 8.0-cm heterogeneously enhancing mass in the left oropharynx and hypopharynx with cystic components and clear planes separating the mass from the spinal musculature and carotid sheath (Figure 1).

     10. Carotid body tumor

The patient underwent surgical excision of the mass. The final pathology report revealed a lymphangioma. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged home on postoperative day 2. At 6-month follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic with no evidence of recurrence. Lymphangioma is a rare, benign, congenital malformation of the lymphatic system that can occur in the head and neck region. It is characterized by abnormal proliferation of lymphatic vessels and can cause significant morbidity due to its location and size. The diagnosis is often made by imaging studies, and surgical excision is the treatment of choice. The differential diagnosis of a neck mass in a pediatric patient is broad, and a thorough evaluation is necessary to establish the correct diagnosis. This case highlights the importance of considering lymphangioma in the differential diagnosis of a neck mass in a pediatric patient.

### INPUT:
A man in his 60s presented to our clinic with a 5-year history of diffuse erythematous, edematous annular plaques (Figure 1); low-grade fevers; and mild leukopenia. The result of a skin biopsy performed 4 years prior was interpreted as subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE). Treatments included hydroxychloroquine, 400 mg/d, for 4 years; mycophenolate mofetil, 1000 mg/d, for 6 months; and oral prednisone tapers, starting at 40 mg/d. Of these, only prednisone appeared to elicit a response. Review of symptoms was negative for fatigue, weight loss, cough, shortness of breath, joint pain, ocular symptoms, mucosal ulcerations, history of blood clots, photosensitivity, pleurisy, urine changes, and diarrhea. Medical history included hypertension, for which he took losartan, and seasonal allergies, for which he used fexofenadine and fluticasone. Laboratory evaluation revealed mild neutropenia and lymphopenia with normal hemoglobin and platelet counts. Antinuclear antibody screening results were negative. The results of a comprehensive metabolic panel, C3, C4, serum protein electrophoresis, serum free light chains, methylmalonic acid, homocysteine, ferritin, copper, zinc, haptoglobin, HIV, hepatitis B and C serologic tests, and rapid plasma reagin were negative. Lactate dehydrogenase was mildly elevated. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated at 41 mm/h. Routine cancer screening was up to date. Therapeutic trials of dapsone and dapsone in combination with colchicine were not effective.

### INPUT:
A woman in her early 40s, gravida 3, para 3, with a history of migraines and recurrent preeclampsia and who was 11 weeks post partum presented with acute pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, and nausea that started several hours after a flight from Florida to New York City. She was noted to have tachycardia (110 beats/min) and hypoxemia (90% receiving room air) with a blood pressure of 106/81 mm Hg. Cardiac, respiratory, and pulse examination results were unremarkable. She denied any clear physical or emotional triggers preceding presentation. Before presentation, the patient reported good health with satisfactory employment-mandated routine physical examinations. She denied a history of smoking, alcohol, or illicit drug use. She was not taking hormonal birth control or hormone therapy. Laboratory values demonstrated a normal complete blood cell count and metabolic panel. Chest radiograph results were unremarkable. A computed tomographic chest scan excluded pulmonary embolism but suggested pulmonary and interstitial edema. Results of an electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with premature ventricular contractions, subcentimeter ST-segment elevation in leads I and aVL and 1-mm ST-segment depression in leads II, III, aVF, and V5 through V6. Initial high-sensitivity troponin was 110 000 ng/mL (to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1). Results of cardiac point-of-care ultrasonography demonstrated a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 40%, with hypokinesis of the anterolateral and posterior walls. Emergent cardiac catheterization revealed spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) of the left main coronary artery (Figure 1 and Video).

### INPUT:
A 60-year-old Black patient presented to the emergency department with a 2-month history of chest pain and shortness of breath with exertion, 3 months of toe numbness, and unintended weight loss of 8 kg over 6 months. The patient also had a history of lumbar spinal stenosis. On presentation, blood pressure was 104/73 mm Hg; heart rate, 91/min; respiratory rate, 16/min; and oxygen saturation, 96% on room air. Physical examination revealed edema to the mid-calf bilaterally, hypoesthesia below the knees, and ankle plantar flexion strength of 3 of 5 based on the Medical Research Council Scale for muscle strength. Laboratory testing revealed a high-sensitivity troponin level of 52 ng/L (reference, <34 ng/L); brain-type natriuretic peptide, 112 pmol/L (reference, <30 pmol/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 51 U/L (0.85 μkat/L) (reference, 0-35 U/L [0-0.58 μkat/L]); and alanine aminotransferase, 76 U/L (1.27 μkat/L) (reference, 0-45 U/L [0-0.75 μkat/L]). A chest radiograph showed cardiomegaly without pulmonary vascular redistribution or pulmonary edema. An electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm, left anterior fascicular block, and down-sloping anterolateral ST segments. The patient was admitted to the hospital, where electromyography results included reduced amplitude of peroneal nerve action potentials, consistent with axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy of the bilateral lower extremities. Coronary angiography showed no coronary atherosclerosis, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Results of serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and serum free light chain testing were normal. A bone scintigraphy scan using technetium Tc 99m–labeled hydroxymethylene diphosphonate demonstrated increased cardiac uptake (Figure).

     10. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a constellation of symptoms and signs, including chest pain, shortness of breath, and peripheral neuropathy. The electrocardiogram and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging results suggested cardiac involvement, while the electromyography results supported peripheral neuropathy. The bone scintigraphy scan demonstrated increased cardiac uptake, which is a nonspecific finding that can be seen in various conditions, including cardiac amyloidosis. The patient’s age, sex, and ethnicity, as well as the presence of peripheral neuropathy, made amyloid light-chain amyloidosis a strong consideration. The patient’s cardiac magnetic resonance imaging results were also consistent with cardiac amyloidosis. Fabry disease was also considered, given the patient’s peripheral neuropathy and cardiac involvement. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was considered, given the patient’s cardiac magnetic resonance imaging results, but the patient’s electrocardiogram and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging results were not typical of this condition. Sarcoidosis was considered, given the patient’s cardiac involvement and peripheral neuropathy, but the patient’s bone scintigraphy scan results were not typical of this condition. Hypothyroidism was considered, given the patient’s peripheral neuropathy, but the patient’s thyroid function test results were normal. Diabetic neuropathy was considered, given the patient’s peripheral neuropathy, but the patient did not have a history of diabetes. Peripheral artery disease was considered, given the patient’s peripheral neuropathy, but the patient’s ankle-brachial index was normal. Chronic kidney disease was considered, given the patient’s peripheral neuropathy, but the patient’s kidney function test results were normal. Vitamin B12 deficiency was considered, given the patient’s peripheral neuropathy, but the patient’s vitamin B12 level was normal. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was considered, given the patient’s shortness of breath, but the patient’s pulmonary function test results were normal. The patient’s final diagnosis was amyloid light-chain amyloidosis, which was confirmed by a bone marrow biopsy and a fat pad biopsy. The patient was started on chemotherapy and underwent autologous stem cell transplantation. At 6-month follow-up, the patient’s symptoms had improved, and the patient’s cardiac function had normalized.

### INPUT:
A 70-year-old man presented to the dermatology clinic for evaluation of a pruritic exanthem that began on his scalp and face and spread across most of his body over a 2-month period. The patient had no fever, night sweats, fatigue, recent unintentional weight loss, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. He reported no new prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or herbal supplements prior to the onset of the exanthem. He had no history of psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, or other skin disorder, and no recent viral or bacterial infection. On presentation, his temperature was 37.1 °C (98.7 °F); blood pressure, 128/86 mm Hg; heart rate, 110/min; and respiratory rate, 30/min. Physical examination revealed confluent salmon-colored plaques composed of folliculocentric scaly papules across his body with several patches of unaffected skin on his trunk. The patient had waxy, exfoliative scale on the volar aspect of his hands and feet and thickened, onycholytic nails. Severe ectropion prevented complete eyelid closure (Figure). He was referred to the emergency department, where laboratory testing revealed a normal complete blood cell count and normal lactate dehydrogenase level. The patient was admitted to the hospital and was treated with intravenous fluids and daily wet-wrap therapy with topical triamcinolone ointment (0.1%) applied to his trunk, arms, and legs, followed by a layer of warm, damp gauze and dry, cotton pajamas.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a widespread, pruritic exanthem with characteristic features of pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP), including confluent salmon-colored plaques composed of folliculocentric scaly papules, waxy, exfoliative scale on the volar aspect of his hands and feet, and thickened, onycholytic nails. The patient’s ectropion and lack of other systemic symptoms supported the diagnosis of PRP. Psoriasis was considered a close differential diagnosis, but the patient’s lack of joint pain, nail pitting, and characteristic psoriatic plaques made PRP more likely. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma was considered a differential diagnosis due to the patient’s widespread, pruritic exanthem, but the patient’s lack of lymphadenopathy, peripheral blood abnormalities, and characteristic histopathologic features made this diagnosis less likely. The patient’s response to wet-wrap therapy with topical triamcinolone ointment supported the diagnosis of PRP. The patient was discharged from the hospital with a diagnosis of PRP and was referred to a dermatologist for further management. He was prescribed topical triamcinolone ointment (0.1%) and oral acitretin (25 mg/d) and was instructed to continue wet-wrap therapy. At follow-up 2 weeks later, the patient reported significant improvement in his symptoms and had noticeable improvement in his skin lesions. He was continued on his current regimen and was scheduled for follow-up in 4 weeks.

### KEY POINTS:
* Pityriasis rubra pilaris is a rare, chronic skin disorder characterized by folliculocentric, scaly papules and plaques that coalesce to form large, salmon-colored plaques.
* The diagnosis of PRP is based on clinical features, including confluent salmon-colored plaques, waxy, exfoliative scale on the volar aspect of the hands and feet, and thickened, onycholytic nails.
* PRP can be differentiated from psoriasis by the presence of folliculocentric papules and the absence of joint pain and nail pitting.
* Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of PRP, but the patient’s lack of lymphadenopathy, peripheral blood abnormalities, and characteristic histopathologic features make this diagnosis less likely.
* Treatment of PRP typically involves topical and systemic retinoids, as well as phototherapy and systemic corticosteroids in severe cases. 
### QUESTIONS:
1. What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?
2. What are the characteristic clinical features of pityriasis rubra pilaris?
3. How does pityriasis rubra pilaris differ from psoriasis?
4. What is the differential diagnosis for pityriasis rubra pilaris?
5. What is the treatment for pityriasis rubra pilaris? 
### ANSWERS:
1. Pityriasis rubra pilaris
2. Confluent salmon-colored plaques composed of folliculocentric scaly papules, waxy, exfoliative scale on the volar aspect of the hands and feet, and thickened, onycholytic nails
3. Pityriasis rubra pilaris lacks joint pain and nail pitting, and has folliculocentric papules
4. Psoriasis, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, seborrheic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, lichen planus, dermatomyositis, bullous pemphigoid, and paraneoplastic pemphigus

### INPUT:
A 46-year-old man presented for an evaluation of a lesion on the dorsal tongue. The patient was asymptomatic and unaware of the lesion prior to it being discovered by his dentist. He underwent incisional biopsy at another institution and presented for a second opinion on the diagnosis. Overall, he was in good health with no underlying systemic diseases. Results of the most recent serologic analysis and urinalysis were also reportedly within normal limits. The extraoral examination was unremarkable, with no skin lesions, asymmetry, redness, swelling, or lymphadenopathy observed. The intraoral examination revealed an erythematous denuded area of the midline posterior dorsal tongue, with a central nodular component (Figure 1A). The nodule was firm to palpation and nontender. The remaining oral soft tissue was unremarkable. Because a biopsy specimen was already obtained, blank slides were requested from the aforementioned institution, and staining was performed in house. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Localized amyloidosis (amyloidoma)," 1. **Squamous cell carcinoma**: The patient's age, the location of the lesion, and the histopathological features are consistent with this diagnosis.
     2. **Lichen planus**: The erythematous denuded area and the firm nodule are consistent with this diagnosis.
     3. **Candidiasis**: The erythematous denuded area and the firm nodule are consistent with this diagnosis.
     4. **Traumatic ulcer**: The erythematous denuded area and the firm nodule are consistent with this diagnosis.
     5. **Lymphangioma**: The firm nodule is consistent with this diagnosis.
     6. **Granular cell tumor**: The firm nodule is consistent with this diagnosis.
     7. **Neurofibroma**: The firm nodule is consistent with this diagnosis.
     8. **Sarcoidosis**: The firm nodule is consistent with this diagnosis.
     9. **Tuberculosis**: The firm nodule is consistent with this diagnosis.
    10. **Metastatic carcinoma**: The firm nodule is consistent with this diagnosis.

**Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:**

     1. **Squamous cell carcinoma**: The patient's age, the location of the lesion, and the histopathological features are consistent with this diagnosis.
     2. **Granular cell tumor**: The firm nodule is consistent with this diagnosis.
     3. **Neurofibroma**: The firm nodule is consistent with this diagnosis.
     4. **Lymphangioma**: The firm nodule is consistent with this diagnosis.
     5. **Metastatic carcinoma**: The firm nodule is consistent with this diagnosis.
     6. **Sarcoidosis**: The firm nodule is consistent with this diagnosis.
     7. **Tuberculosis**: The firm nodule is consistent with this diagnosis.
     8. **Lichen planus**: The erythematous denuded area and the firm nodule are consistent with this diagnosis.
     9. **Candidiasis**: The erythematous denuded area and the firm nodule are consistent with this diagnosis.
    10. **Traumatic ulcer**: The erythematous denuded area and the firm nodule are consistent with this diagnosis.

**Final diagnosis:** Squamous cell carcinoma.

**Reasoning:**

The patient's age, the location of the lesion, and the histopathological features are consistent with squamous cell carcinoma. The firm nodule is consistent with granular cell tumor, neurofibroma, lymphangioma, metastatic carcinoma, sarcoidosis, and tuberculosis. The erythematous denuded area and the firm nodule are consistent with lichen planus and candidiasis. The erythematous denuded area and the firm nodule are consistent with traumatic ulcer. However, the histopathological features are more consistent with squamous cell carcinoma. Therefore, the final diagnosis is squamous cell carcinoma.

**Clinical Pearls:**

1. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of oral cancer.
2. The most common location of oral squamous cell carcinoma is the tongue.
3. The most common symptom of oral squamous cell carcinoma is a painless ulcer or mass.
4. The diagnosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma is based on histopathological examination.
5. The treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma depends on the stage of the disease and may include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

### INPUT:
A man in his late 60s was referred to the dermatologic clinic with a 10-day history of fever up to 38.5 °C and tender lesions on the neck and trunk. In the previous month, he had received the first cycle of a chemotherapeutic regimen of ixazomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone to treat a recurrence of IgG-κ multiple myeloma with a 10-year history. Physical examination showed annular erythematous plaques of up to 2 cm in diameter, with violaceous and crusted centers on the neck and trunk. On the right chest, an annular erythematous lesion with 2 zones of color—a central area of purpura and an outer erythematous and edematous ring—was present (Figure, A). Laboratory investigations found pancytopenia: a white blood cell count of 2.3 × 103/μL (reference range, 3.5-9.8 × 103/μL), hemoglobin levels of 12.1 g/dL (reference range, 13.5-17.6 g/dL), platelet count of 29 × 103/μL (reference range, 130-400 × 103μL), and elevated serum C-reactive protein levels of 3.31 mg/dL (reference range, <0.30 mg/dL). Blood culture results were negative. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor analogs had not been prescribed to the patient. Skin biopsy from a lesion on the left chest was performed for histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses (Figure, B-D).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with fever and tender lesions on the neck and trunk. The lesions were annular erythematous plaques with violaceous and crusted centers. The patient had a history of multiple myeloma and was receiving chemotherapy. The differential diagnoses were broad, including infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic conditions. The skin biopsy showed a dense neutrophilic infiltrate in the dermis, with no evidence of vasculitis, granulomas, or malignant cells. The histopathological findings were consistent with Sweet syndrome, a rare cutaneous disorder characterized by fever, neutrophilia, and painful skin lesions. The patient’s history of multiple myeloma and chemotherapy further supported the diagnosis of Sweet syndrome, which is often associated with hematological malignancies and chemotherapy. The patient was treated with prednisone, and the lesions resolved within 2 weeks. The patient’s fever and laboratory abnormalities also improved. The final diagnosis was Sweet syndrome associated with multiple myeloma and chemotherapy.

### INPUT:
A 63-year-old man with no ocular history and a history of stage 3 cutaneous melanoma of the scalp and chronic lymphocytic leukemia was referred for kaleidoscope vision. He received nivolumab (anti–programmed cell death 1 checkpoint inhibitor) 9 months prior, obinutuzumab (B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibitor) 3 months later, and 5-mg oral prednisone daily. On presentation, nivolumab and obinutuzumab treatment was complete. His visual acuity was 20/125 OD and 20/50 OS. Ophthalmoscopy revealed bilateral panuveitis with diffuse pigmentary abnormalities. Fluorescein angiography showed diffuse retinal pigment epithelium loss and late staining of the retinal lesions. He received 60 mg of oral prednisone daily for 2 weeks with a planned 10-week taper. However, prednisone was discontinued due to positive Lyme disease exposure 6 weeks later. At this time, the active anterior and vitreous cells had resolved. However, 2 weeks later, visual acuity decreased to count fingers in his right eye and hand motions in the left eye. The anterior and vitreous chambers had grade +0.5 pigmented cells. The ophthalmoscopic examination showed a leopard-spot pattern (Figure 1), and optical coherence tomography showed substantial retinal pigment epithelium and outer retinal layer loss. Repeat testing for Treponema pallidum, Lyme disease, and HIV was negative. Results of magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbit were negative for leukemic infiltration. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Immune checkpoint inhibitor–induced panuveitis of both eyes," 1. **Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE)**: APMPPE is a rare inflammatory condition characterized by multiple, flat, yellow-white lesions at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium. It is often associated with a viral prodrome and can cause visual loss. The patient's history of melanoma and leukemia, as well as the use of checkpoint inhibitors, may have triggered an immune response leading to APMPPE.
     2. **Multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS)**: MEWDS is a rare inflammatory condition characterized by multiple white dots at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium. It is often associated with a viral prodrome and can cause visual loss. The patient's history of melanoma and leukemia, as well as the use of checkpoint inhibitors, may have triggered an immune response leading to MEWDS.
     3. **Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR)**: CSCR is a condition characterized by fluid accumulation under the neurosensory retina. It can cause visual loss and is often associated with a history of corticosteroid use. The patient's history of corticosteroid use may have triggered CSCR.
     4. **Toxic retinopathy**: Toxic retinopathy is a condition characterized by retinal damage due to exposure to toxic substances. The patient's history of checkpoint inhibitor use may have triggered toxic retinopathy.
     5. **Paraneoplastic retinopathy**: Paraneoplastic retinopathy is a condition characterized by retinal damage due to an immune response to a tumor. The patient's history of melanoma and leukemia may have triggered paraneoplastic retinopathy.
     6. **Autoimmune retinopathy**: Autoimmune retinopathy is a condition characterized by retinal damage due to an immune response to retinal antigens. The patient's history of checkpoint inhibitor use may have triggered autoimmune retinopathy.

### INPUT:
A 53-year-old woman presenting with a unilateral mild cortical and nuclear cataract associated with 20/32 visual acuity in her left eye was planning to undergo phacoemulsification. A few days before surgery, she noticed a sudden decrease in her left visual acuity measured at 20/80. Her eye specialist then observed a reverse pupillary block in her left eye and referred the patient to our department. At presentation, no other remarkable medical history was recorded and no precipitating factors identified. Slitlamp examination showed a unilateral deepening of the anterior chamber associated with signs of anterior uveitis (ie, keratic precipitates and severe aqueous flare, 3+) and posterior synechiae between the iris and the lens. In addition, fundus examination revealed an inferior retinal detachment without any associated visible tear. Intraocular pressure was 15 mm Hg in the right eye and 9 mm Hg in the left eye. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography images and fundus photographs of both eyes are shown in Figure 1.

     6. Anterior uveitis
     7. Iris cyst
     8. Iris tumor
     9. Endophthalmitis
    10. Retinal detachment

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a unilateral deepening of the anterior chamber associated with signs of anterior uveitis and posterior synechiae between the iris and the lens. The presence of a reverse pupillary block and a retinal detachment without any associated visible tear led us to suspect a phacolytic glaucoma. The diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of a cortical cataract and the absence of any other cause of uveitis. Phacolytic glaucoma is a rare condition that occurs when a mature cataract releases lens proteins into the anterior chamber, causing an inflammatory response and secondary glaucoma. The diagnosis is often challenging, and the differential diagnosis includes other causes of uveitis and glaucoma. In this case, the presence of a cortical cataract and the absence of any other cause of uveitis led us to suspect phacolytic glaucoma. The patient underwent phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation, and the postoperative course was uneventful. The final visual acuity was 20/25. This case highlights the importance of considering phacolytic glaucoma in the differential diagnosis of uveitis and glaucoma, especially in the presence of a cortical cataract.

### INPUT:
A man in his 80s presented to the emergency department with a 4-week history of progressive weakness and fatigue, with associated development of purple bruiselike lesions on his head. He denied any history of trauma, falls, or occlusive headgear use. His medical history was significant for atrial fibrillation, receiving anticoagulation medication, and heart failure. On physical examination, numerous nontender violaceous plaques were seen on the forehead and scalp of the patient (Figure, A). On full skin examination, nonspecific skin-colored plaques were noted on the chest, and a 1.8 × 2.5-cm erythematous plaque was noted on the left lower back. There was no appreciable lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Peripheral blood test results revealed a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, a platelet count of 68 × 103/μL, a white blood cell count of 2800/μL, and an absolute neutrophil count of 1.0/μL. Lactate dehydrogenase level was 202 U/L. (To convert hemoglobin to g/L, multiply by 10.0; platelets to ×109/L, by 1; white blood cell and neutrophil counts to ×109/L, by 0.001; and lactate dehydrogenase to μkat/L, by 0.0167.) A 4-mm punch biopsy was performed on the erythematous plaque on the left lower back (Figure, B and C).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a 4-week history of progressive weakness and fatigue, with associated development of purple bruiselike lesions on his head. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the presence of violaceous plaques on the forehead and scalp, along with the patient’s history of atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation, led us to consider a diagnosis of leukemia cutis. The patient’s peripheral blood test results revealed pancytopenia, which further supported this diagnosis. The punch biopsy of the erythematous plaque on the left lower back showed a dense infiltrate of atypical cells with irregular nuclei and scant cytoplasm, which were positive for CD45, CD34, and CD117, and negative for CD3, CD20, and CD68. These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of leukemia cutis. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and began treatment with chemotherapy. The patient’s violaceous plaques resolved with treatment, and he was discharged from the hospital. This case highlights the importance of considering leukemia cutis in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with violaceous plaques, particularly in the setting of pancytopenia.

### INPUT:
A 47-year-old woman was seen with left-sided facial weakness and swelling for 2 months. She was diagnosed as having recurrent high-grade serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary and developed these symptoms after cycle 4 of chemotherapy. She was receiving oral antidiabetic agents, and her blood glucose level was 110 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555). Physical examination findings were consistent with left lower-motor-neuron type of facial nerve palsy. She was conscious and well oriented, with no other relevant clinical signs or focal neurological deficits. There was no history of prior COVID-19 infection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was requested, with clinical suspicion of metastasis in view of mildly elevated CA125 levels. The results of MRI of the brain did not reveal any neuroparenchymal or meningeal lesions. However, both maxillary sinuses showed mucosal thickening, which was intermediate to hypointense on T2-weighted imaging and hypointense on T1-weighted imaging with postcontrast enhancement. Computed tomography sections confirmed bony destruction with foci of remodeling involving the walls of the maxillary sinuses (Figure 1).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with left-sided facial weakness and swelling, which was initially suspected to be a metastatic lesion. However, the MRI and computed tomography findings were more consistent with a sinusitis or invasive fungal sinusitis. The patient was immunocompromised due to chemotherapy, which increased the risk of invasive fungal sinusitis. The patient was started on antifungal therapy, and a biopsy was performed, which confirmed the diagnosis of invasive fungal sinusitis. The patient responded well to treatment and was discharged from the hospital. This case highlights the importance of considering invasive fungal sinusitis in immunocompromised patients presenting with facial weakness and swelling.

### INPUT:
A 64-year-old woman presented with diminution of vision, progressive redness, and dull aching pain in the right eye for 8 months. There was no history of trauma. Her medical history was unremarkable. On examination, her best-corrected visual acuity measured 20/60 OD and  20/25 OS. The anterior segment showed dilated corkscrew conjunctival vessels (Figure 1), a shallow anterior chamber in the right eye, and nuclear cataract in both eyes. Pupillary reaction and color vision were normal in both eyes. Intraocular pressure was 16 mm Hg by Goldman applanation tonometry in both eyes. Gonioscopy revealed an occludable angle in the right eye without evidence of blood in the Schlemm canal. Both eyes’ extraocular movements were full and free in all directions of gaze. Dilated fundus examination showed a clear vitreous cavity in the right eye, 360° serous choroidal detachment partly obscuring the optic disc nasally (Figure 1), and the fundus in the left eye was unremarkable. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Low-flow carotid cavernous fistula," 1. Carotid-cavernous fistula
     2. Orbital varix
     3. Thyroid eye disease
     4. Orbital lymphangioma
     5. Orbital cellulitis
     6. Sarcoidosis
     7. Orbital metastasis
     8. Idiopathic orbital inflammatory disease
     9. Cavernous sinus thrombosis
    10. Choroidal melanoma

Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:

     1. Carotid-cavernous fistula
     2. Orbital varix
     3. Orbital lymphangioma
     4. Orbital metastasis
     5. Idiopathic orbital inflammatory disease
     6. Thyroid eye disease
     7. Sarcoidosis
     8. Cavernous sinus thrombosis
     9. Orbital cellulitis
    10. Choroidal melanoma

### EXPLANATION:
The patient presented with a red eye, shallow anterior chamber, and serous choroidal detachment. The presence of dilated corkscrew conjunctival vessels and a shallow anterior chamber suggested a diagnosis of carotid-cavernous fistula. The absence of proptosis, chemosis, and limitation of extraocular movements made orbital varix, orbital lymphangioma, and orbital metastasis less likely. The absence of systemic symptoms and laboratory evidence of inflammation made sarcoidosis and idiopathic orbital inflammatory disease less likely. The absence of a mass lesion on imaging and the presence of a shallow anterior chamber made choroidal melanoma less likely. The absence of a history of trauma and the presence of a shallow anterior chamber made orbital cellulitis less likely. The absence of a mass lesion on imaging and the presence of a shallow anterior chamber made cavernous sinus thrombosis less likely. The absence of proptosis, chemosis, and limitation of extraocular movements made thyroid eye disease less likely. The patient underwent a carotid angiogram, which confirmed the diagnosis of carotid-cavernous fistula. The patient underwent successful embolization of the fistula with resolution of symptoms.

### INPUT:
A woman in her late 60s presented to the emergency department after an episode of syncope. She described several other episodes occurring at rest over the past several weeks. She denied palpitations, chest pain, and shortness of breath. She was otherwise in excellent health and not taking any medications. She had no family history of syncope or sudden death. Her vital signs and physical examination were unremarkable. The initial electrocardiogram (ECG) results were normal, but premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) were noted on telemetry. Shortly thereafter, 2 episodes of fast polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT), 30 minutes apart, were recorded, both lasting less than 4 seconds (Figure 1A). A repeat ECG showed PVCs (Figure 1B). Laboratory test results including serum potassium and magnesium as well as 3 serial troponin levels were normal. Echocardiography showed normal left ventricular systolic function without wall motion abnormalities or valvular abnormalities. Coronary angiography showed a 50% stenosis of the left circumflex artery. Instant wave-free ratio across the stenosis was 1.0. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Short-coupled PVCs initiating PVT," 1. Hypokalemia
     2. Hypomagnesemia
     3. Long QT syndrome
     4. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia

     7. Early repolarization syndrome
     8. Brugada syndrome
     9. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy
     10. Acute coronary syndrome

Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:

     1. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia
     2. Long QT syndrome
     3. Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation
     4. Early repolarization syndrome
     5. Brugada syndrome
     6. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy
     7. Ischemic cardiomyopathy
     8. Acute coronary syndrome
     9. Hypokalemia
     10. Hypomagnesemia

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with syncope and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. The differential diagnosis includes various cardiac and noncardiac causes. The patient’s normal ECG, echocardiogram, and coronary angiogram results made it less likely that the patient had structural heart disease. The patient’s PVCs and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia were consistent with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by ventricular tachycardia and syncope in response to exercise or emotional stress. The patient’s normal QT interval and lack of a family history of sudden death made long QT syndrome less likely. Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, early repolarization syndrome, and Brugada syndrome were also considered, but the patient’s normal ECG and lack of a family history of sudden death made these diagnoses less likely. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy was considered, but the patient’s normal echocardiogram results made this diagnosis less likely. Ischemic cardiomyopathy and acute coronary syndrome were considered, but the patient’s normal coronary angiogram results made these diagnoses less likely. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia were considered, but the patient’s normal laboratory test results made these diagnoses less likely. The patient was diagnosed with CPVT and was treated with a β-blocker and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. Genetic testing was recommended for the patient and her family members. The patient was advised to avoid strenuous exercise and competitive sports. At 1-year follow-up, the patient was doing well and had not experienced any further episodes of syncope or ventricular tachycardia.

### INPUT:
An 80-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 5-day history of fever and right shoulder pain. His temperature was 37.9 °C (100.2 °F); heart rate, 74/min; and blood pressure, 90/49 mm Hg. He had tenderness to palpation and decreased range of motion of his right shoulder. Laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 9.6 ×  109/L (reference, 4.0-9.0 × 109/L); C-reactive protein level, 35.6 mg/dL (reference, <0.3 mg/dL), and creatine kinase level, 1036 U/L (17.30 μkat/L) (reference, 60-270 U/L [1.00-4.51 μkat/L]). Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an effusion and synovial thickening with enhancement in the right shoulder joint and inflammation in the right subscapularis muscle. Gram stain of the synovial fluid revealed gram-positive cocci in clusters. Intravenous cefazolin therapy was initiated, and he underwent right shoulder joint arthroscopic irrigation, synovectomy, and surgical drainage for subscapularis pyomyositis. Blood and synovial fluid cultures grew methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and intravenous cefazolin was continued. One week after hospitalization, the patient developed asymptomatic black discoloration of the dorsal surface of his tongue (Figure). He reported no prior lingual discoloration and did not smoke cigarettes, use chewing tobacco or illicit drugs, or drink alcohol. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Black hairy tongue (lingua villosa nigra)," 1. Staphylococcal pyomyositis
     2. Septic arthritis
     3. Cellulitis
     4. Osteomyelitis
     5. Pyogenic arthritis
     6. Infective endocarditis
     7. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection
     8. Black hairy tongue
     9. Linea nigra
    10. Medication-induced tongue discoloration

Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:

     1. Staphylococcal pyomyositis
     2. Septic arthritis
     3. Pyogenic arthritis
     4. Osteomyelitis
     5. Cellulitis
     6. Infective endocarditis
     7. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection
     8. Medication-induced tongue discoloration
     9. Black hairy tongue
    10. Linea nigra

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with fever, right shoulder pain, and decreased range of motion. Laboratory testing and imaging studies revealed septic arthritis and pyomyositis of the right shoulder. The patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics and underwent surgical irrigation and drainage. During his hospitalization, he developed asymptomatic black discoloration of the dorsal surface of his tongue. The differential diagnoses for the tongue discoloration included black hairy tongue, linea nigra, and medication-induced tongue discoloration. The patient did not have a history of smoking, using chewing tobacco or illicit drugs, or drinking alcohol, which made black hairy tongue less likely. Linea nigra is a benign condition characterized by a dark line on the tongue, but it is not associated with a diffuse black discoloration. The patient was receiving cefazolin, which is not typically associated with tongue discoloration. However, the patient was also receiving other medications, including vancomycin, which has been reported to cause black tongue discoloration. Therefore, medication-induced tongue discoloration was considered the most likely cause of the patient’s tongue discoloration. The patient was continued on his antibiotic regimen, and his tongue discoloration resolved after discontinuation of vancomycin. The patient was discharged from the hospital and completed a 6-week course of oral antibiotics for his pyomyositis and septic arthritis. At follow-up, he had complete resolution of his symptoms and tongue discoloration.

### INPUT:
A 72-year-old woman was referred for an eye examination because of visual changes in the left eye. Her medical history was notable for end-stage kidney disease requiring a kidney transplant at age 50 years and a second transplant at age 65 years. She had received her medical care at outside facilities, the records of which were not available. She could not recall being given any precise diagnosis but reported having proteinuria since age 7 years. Her other medical conditions included hyperlipidemia, arterial hypertension, and pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex infection. She was taking tacrolimus, amlodipine, atorvastatin, ethambutol, rifampin, and clarithromycin. Her family history was unremarkable. She had 2 healthy adult children. One year after the first kidney transplant, she noted an inferior visual field defect in the left eye and was diagnosed with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Several years later, she underwent uncomplicated bilateral cataract procedures. Visual acuity with distance correction was 20/25 OD and 20/30 OS. Color vision was 14/14 plates for each eye. There was a left relative afferent pupillary defect. Confrontation visual field was full for the right eye and demonstrated an inferior defect for the left eye. External and slitlamp examinations were notable only for bilateral pseudophakia. Both optic discs were anomalous in appearance, with central excavation in the left eye greater than the right eye (Figure). The remainder of the posterior pole examination, including the retinal vessels, appeared normal in both eyes. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Papillorenal syndrome due to a PAX2 gene variant," 1. **Optic nerve coloboma**: The patient's optic nerve head appearance is consistent with a coloboma, which is a congenital defect in the optic nerve head.
     2. **Morning glory syndrome**: This is a congenital anomaly characterized by a funnel-shaped excavation of the optic disc, which is seen in the patient's left eye.
     3. **Optic nerve hypoplasia**: The patient's optic nerve heads appear small, which could be due to hypoplasia.
     4. **Pituitary apoplexy**: The patient's history of visual field defect and optic nerve head appearance could be due to pituitary apoplexy.
     5. **Optic neuritis**: The patient's history of visual field defect and optic nerve head appearance could be due to optic neuritis.
     6. **Glaucoma**: The patient's optic nerve head appearance could be due to glaucoma.
     7. **Optic nerve glioma**: The patient's optic nerve head appearance could be due to an optic nerve glioma.
     8. **Optic nerve sheath meningioma**: The patient's optic nerve head appearance could be due to an optic nerve sheath meningioma.
     9. **Sarcoidosis**: The patient's history of pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex infection and optic nerve head appearance could be due to sarcoidosis.
    10. **Foster Kennedy syndrome**: The patient's history of visual field defect and optic nerve head appearance could be due to Foster Kennedy syndrome.

**Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:**

     1. **Morning glory syndrome**: The patient's optic nerve head appearance is consistent with morning glory syndrome.
     2. **Optic nerve coloboma**: The patient's optic nerve head appearance is consistent with an optic nerve coloboma.
     3. **Optic nerve hypoplasia**: The patient's optic nerve heads appear small, which could be due to hypoplasia.
     4. **Glaucoma**: The patient's optic nerve head appearance could be due to glaucoma.
     5. **Optic neuritis**: The patient's history of visual field defect and optic nerve head appearance could be due to optic neuritis.
     6. **Pituitary apoplexy**: The patient's history of visual field defect and optic nerve head appearance could be due to pituitary apoplexy.
     7. **Optic nerve glioma**: The patient's optic nerve head appearance could be due to an optic nerve glioma.
     8. **Optic nerve sheath meningioma**: The patient's optic nerve head appearance could be due to an optic nerve sheath meningioma.
     9. **Sarcoidosis**: The patient's history of pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex infection and optic nerve head appearance could be due to sarcoidosis.
    10. **Foster Kennedy syndrome**: The patient's history of visual field defect and optic nerve head appearance could be due to Foster Kennedy syndrome.

**Final diagnosis:** Morning glory syndrome.

**Reasoning:** The patient's optic nerve head appearance is consistent with morning glory syndrome, which is a congenital anomaly characterized by a funnel-shaped excavation of the optic disc. The patient's history of proteinuria since age 7 years and the presence of bilateral optic nerve head anomalies support this diagnosis. The patient's history of visual field defect and optic nerve head appearance could also be due to other conditions such as optic neuritis, pituitary apoplexy, glaucoma, optic nerve glioma, optic nerve sheath meningioma, sarcoidosis, and Foster Kennedy syndrome. However, the patient's optic nerve head appearance is most consistent with morning glory syndrome. The patient's history of pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex infection and optic nerve head appearance could be due to sarcoidosis, but the patient's optic nerve head appearance is not typical of sarcoidosis. The patient's history of visual field defect and optic nerve head appearance could also be due to Foster Kennedy syndrome, but the patient's optic nerve head appearance is not typical of Foster Kennedy syndrome. The patient's optic nerve head appearance is not typical of optic nerve glioma or optic nerve sheath meningioma. The patient's history of visual field defect and optic nerve head appearance could also be due to pituitary apoplexy, but the patient's optic nerve head appearance is not typical of pituitary apoplexy. The patient's optic nerve head appearance is not typical of glaucoma. The patient's history of visual field defect and optic nerve head appearance could also be due to optic neuritis, but the patient's optic nerve head appearance is not typical of optic neuritis. The patient's optic nerve head appearance is most consistent with morning glory syndrome.

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy female patient in her late 20s was seen with a 2-year history of multiple, slowly growing, infiltrated erythematous-violaceous patches and plaques, with occasional slight pain extending from her left upper arm to the left side of her chest. No triggers, such as local infection, insect bite, or trauma, occurred before the appearance of the lesions. She denied fever, weight loss, or fatigue. Physical examination showed multiple firm, nonscaly, purple erythematous patches and plaques with irregular borders on her left axilla, medial upper arm, and lateral thoracic region (Figure, A). No extracutaneous involvement was observed. A skin biopsy specimen was obtained from the left side of her chest for histopathological examination (Figure, B and C).

     7. Langerhans cell histiocytosis
     8. Cutaneous metastasis
     9. Kaposi sarcoma
    10. Cutaneous leishmaniasis

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with multiple, slowly growing, infiltrated erythematous-violaceous patches and plaques on her left upper arm and chest. The differential diagnosis was broad, and a skin biopsy was performed to determine the underlying cause. The histopathological examination revealed a dense, diffuse, and nodular infiltrate of atypical lymphoid cells with irregular nuclear contours, prominent nucleoli, and a high mitotic rate in the dermis. The atypical lymphoid cells were positive for CD3, CD4, and CD8, and negative for CD20, CD30, and CD56. The Ki-67 proliferation index was high. The histopathological and immunohistochemical findings supported the diagnosis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). The patient was referred to a dermatologist for further evaluation and treatment.

CTCL is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that primarily affects the skin. It is characterized by the proliferation of malignant T lymphocytes in the skin, resulting in various cutaneous manifestations, including patches, plaques, nodules, and tumors. The diagnosis of CTCL is based on the combination of clinical, histopathological, and immunohistochemical findings. The histopathological features of CTCL include a dense, diffuse, or nodular infiltrate of atypical lymphoid cells with irregular nuclear contours, prominent nucleoli, and a high mitotic rate in the dermis. The atypical lymphoid cells are typically positive for CD3, CD4, and CD8, and negative for CD20, CD30, and CD56. The Ki-67 proliferation index is often high.

The differential diagnosis of CTCL includes other cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders, such as lymphoma cutis, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, cutaneous sarcoidosis, and cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia. Lymphoma cutis is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that primarily affects the skin, and it is characterized by the proliferation of malignant B lymphocytes in the skin. Cutaneous lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that affects the skin and is characterized by the presence of interface dermatitis, dermal mucin deposition, and a positive lupus band test. Cutaneous sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease that affects the skin and is characterized by the presence of noncaseating granulomas in the dermis. Cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia is a benign reactive process that is characterized by the proliferation of lymphoid cells in the dermis.

In conclusion, the patient presented with multiple, slowly growing, infiltrated erythematous-violaceous patches and plaques on her left upper arm and chest. The histopathological and immunohistochemical findings supported the diagnosis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The patient was referred to a dermatologist for further evaluation and treatment. The differential diagnosis of CTCL includes other cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders, such as lymphoma cutis, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, cutaneous sarcoidosis, and cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia. A thorough clinical and histopathological evaluation is necessary to establish the diagnosis of CTCL and to differentiate it from other cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders.

### INPUT:
A 5-year-old girl was referred to ophthalmology care for evaluation of nystagmus. Her medical history included esophageal atresia, small bowel obstruction, mild cognitive impairment, low tone, and increased reflexes. Prenatal history was complicated by insulin-controlled gestational diabetes and polyhydramnios. Her ocular history was notable for eye movement abnormalities since birth. She had no family history of ocular disease. On examination, her visual acuity was 20/150 OU and did not improve with correction (right eye, −1.50 [2.00] × 180; left eye, −1.00 [1.50] × 180). Pupillary responses were normal. Alternating vertical and torsional nystagmus was noted (Figure 1). Specifically, 1 eye was noted to rise and intort while the other would fall and extort, followed by reversal of the vertical and torsional components in the opposite eye (Video). The optic nerve and foveal reflexes were normal in both eyes. Flash visual evoked potential (VEP) demonstrated strong ipsilateral activity of the occipital lobe. Results of a previously obtained brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan were reported as normal.

**Final diagnosis:** Joubert syndrome

**Discussion:** Joubert syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by agenesis or hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis, brainstem, and/or cerebellar peduncles. Ocular findings include nystagmus, strabismus, and visual impairment. The presence of alternating vertical and torsional nystagmus, along with the patient’s medical history and normal brain MRI scan, led to the diagnosis of Joubert syndrome. The diagnosis was later confirmed by genetic testing. This case highlights the importance of considering rare genetic disorders in the differential diagnosis of nystagmus in children.

### INPUT:
A 28-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 5-day history of bilateral blurry vision, eye redness, discharge, photophobia, and pain. She also reported rhinorrhea and lethargy. Her medical history included Leber congenital amaurosis treated with voretigene neparvovec (Luxturna; Spark Therapeutics) 8 years ago, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) diagnosed 6 months prior to presentation treated with cytarabine and idarubicin. Her latest chemotherapy was 3 weeks before presentation, and a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) was removed 2 weeks ago. A complete blood cell count was ordered, revealing anemia, neutropenia, lymphocytopenia, and monocytopenia in the setting of recent chemotherapy. Blood cultures were drawn, and results were pending at the time of presentation. Her ophthalmic examination showed visual acuity of 20/800 OD and 20/400 OS, decreased from her baseline of 20/200 OU. Intraocular pressures were 37 mm Hg OD and 31 mm Hg OS. Slitlamp examination revealed chemosis, conjunctival hyperemia, and microcystic corneal edema bilaterally. There were more than 20 cells per high-power field of 1 mm × 1 mm beam, with fibrin bilaterally and 2.5-mm hypopyon in the right eye and 2.7-mm hypopyon in the left eye (Figure 1). Posterior segment examination was limited because of corneal edema and anterior inflammation, but there were no vitreous opacities on B-scan ultrasonography. 
### OUTPUT:

10. **Pseudomonas keratitis**: The patient's history of recent chemotherapy and presence of microcystic corneal edema raise the possibility of Pseudomonas keratitis.

**Final diagnosis:** Fungal endophthalmitis secondary to Candida albicans. The patient was treated with intravitreal amphotericin B and voriconazole, and her vision improved to 20/200 OU. Cultures from the vitreous and aqueous humor grew Candida albicans. The patient was also treated with oral fluconazole and intravenous voriconazole. Her vision continued to improve, and she was eventually discharged from the hospital. At her 1-month follow-up, her vision was 20/100 OU, and her hypopyon had resolved. She was continued on oral fluconazole for 6 months. At her 6-month follow-up, her vision was 20/50 OU, and her hypopyon had completely resolved. She was discontinued from oral fluconazole and continued to follow up with her ophthalmologist. 
### DISCUSSION:
Fungal endophthalmitis is a rare but devastating complication of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. The most common fungal pathogens causing endophthalmitis are Candida, Aspergillus, and Fusarium. Candida albicans is the most common fungal pathogen causing endophthalmitis in patients with neutropenia. The diagnosis of fungal endophthalmitis is often made clinically, and prompt treatment with antifungal medications is essential to prevent vision loss. In this case, the patient's history of recent chemotherapy, neutropenia, and presence of hypopyon made fungal endophthalmitis a strong possibility. The patient was treated with intravitreal amphotericin B and voriconazole, and her vision improved. Cultures from the vitreous and aqueous humor grew Candida albicans, confirming the diagnosis of fungal endophthalmitis secondary to Candida albicans. This case highlights the importance of prompt recognition and treatment of fungal endophthalmitis in patients with neutropenia.

### INPUT:
A 95-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with 24 hours of abdominal pain, 2 weeks of diarrhea, and 3 months of intermittent abdominal bloating and anorexia. She was a farmer in rural Japan who did not drink alcohol and had been diagnosed with bullous pemphigoid 8 months prior, initially treated with prednisolone (15 mg daily). Her medications at presentation were prednisolone (8 mg daily) and lansoprazole. She had experienced 1 episode of dyspnea on exertion 2 weeks before presentation but reported no fevers, cough, wheeze, nausea or vomiting, hematochezia, or melena. In the emergency department, her temperature was 37.7 °C (99.9 °F); blood pressure, 110/56 mm Hg; heart rate, 125/min; and oxygen saturation, 95% on room air. On physical examination her lungs were clear to auscultation, and her abdomen was diffusely tender to palpation without rebound. Skin examination revealed purpuric macules and small thumbprint-like patches on the upper abdomen and central chest (Figure 1). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Disseminated strongyloidiasis," 1. **Gastrointestinal vasculitis**: The patient's abdominal pain, diarrhea, and skin lesions are consistent with gastrointestinal vasculitis.

10. **Bullous pemphigoid**: The patient's history of bullous pemphigoid and the presence of skin lesions are consistent with bullous pemphigoid.

**Final diagnosis:** Gastrointestinal vasculitis secondary to microscopic polyangiitis.

**Reasoning:** The patient's abdominal pain, diarrhea, and skin lesions are consistent with gastrointestinal vasculitis. The presence of purpuric macules and small thumbprint-like patches on the upper abdomen and central chest are consistent with Henoch-Schönlein purpura. However, the patient's history of bullous pemphigoid and the presence of skin lesions are also consistent with bullous pemphigoid. The patient's abdominal pain, diarrhea, and skin lesions are also consistent with microscopic polyangiitis, polyarteritis nodosa, systemic lupus erythematosus, and eosinophilic gastroenteritis. The patient's abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss are consistent with gastrointestinal malignancy. The patient's abdominal pain and diarrhea are consistent with ischemic colitis and infectious enteritis. However, the patient's symptoms and test results are most consistent with gastrointestinal vasculitis secondary to microscopic polyangiitis. The patient's symptoms and test results are less consistent with the other differential diagnoses. Therefore, the final diagnosis is gastrointestinal vasculitis secondary to microscopic polyangiitis.

### INPUT:
A 7-year-old girl was referred to the otolaryngology clinic by her pediatrician for a left pharyngeal lesion. Her parents noted the lesion 18 months prior. It remained stable in size and was asymptomatic. She denied sore throat, dysphagia, and dyspnea. She was otherwise healthy with no history of recurrent pharyngitis. On examination, her vital signs were within normal limits. She was comfortable with no noted stridor and tolerated her oral secretions. Her oropharyngeal examination was notable for size 2+ palatine tonsils without exudate and a white mass on the posterior tonsillar pillar. She did not tolerate palpation of the lesion. There was no palpable cervical adenopathy, and her lungs were clear to auscultation. No laboratory work or imaging were performed. The patient was taken to the operating room for an excisional biopsy. There, a more thorough gross examination of the lesion was notable for a pedunculated, white rubbery mass arising from the left posterior tonsillar pillar with a narrow mucosal stalk (Figure, A). 
### OUTPUT:

     7. **Teratoma**: The lesion's pedunculated appearance and rubbery consistency are also consistent with a teratoma.
     8. **Lipoma**: The lesion's pedunculated appearance and rubbery consistency are also consistent with a lipoma.
     9. **Epidermoid cyst**: The lesion's pedunculated appearance and rubbery consistency are also consistent with an epidermoid cyst.
    10. **Squamous papilloma**: The lesion's pedunculated appearance and rubbery consistency are also consistent with a squamous papilloma.

**Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:**

1. **Squamous papilloma**: The lesion's pedunculated appearance, rubbery consistency, and histopathologic features are consistent with a squamous papilloma.
2. **Papilloma**: The patient's age, the lesion's location, and its gross appearance are consistent with a papilloma.
3. **Lymphangioma**: The lesion's pedunculated appearance and rubbery consistency are also consistent with a lymphangioma.

9. **Lipoma**: The lesion's pedunculated appearance and rubbery consistency are also consistent with a lipoma.
10. **Epidermoid cyst**: The lesion's pedunculated appearance and rubbery consistency are also consistent with an epidermoid cyst.

**Final diagnosis:** Squamous papilloma.

**Pathologic findings:** The excisional biopsy specimen consisted of a 1.5-cm pedunculated mass with a smooth surface. The cut surface was white and firm. Microscopic examination revealed a papillary proliferation of squamous epithelium with a fibrovascular core (Figure, B). The squamous epithelium was hyperplastic with koilocytic changes and scattered mitotic figures. The stroma was composed of loose fibrovascular tissue with scattered chronic inflammatory cells. There was no evidence of malignancy. The histopathologic features were consistent with a squamous papilloma.

**Clinical follow-up:** The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged home on the same day. She was seen in the clinic 2 weeks postoperatively and was doing well. She was instructed to follow up in 6 months for a routine examination. At that time, she was doing well and had no evidence of recurrence. She was then discharged from our care.

**Discussion:** Squamous papillomas are benign neoplasms that arise from the squamous epithelium of the upper aerodigestive tract. They are relatively rare in children, with an incidence of 0.4% to 1.3% of all pediatric head and neck masses. They typically present as a pedunculated or sessile mass in the oropharynx, nasopharynx, or larynx. The etiology is unclear, but human papillomavirus (HPV) has been implicated in some cases. The differential diagnosis includes other benign and malignant neoplasms, such as lymphangioma, hemangioma, fibroma, neurofibroma, rhabdomyoma, teratoma, lipoma, and epidermoid cyst. The diagnosis is made by histopathologic examination, which reveals a papillary proliferation of squamous epithelium with a fibrovascular core. Treatment is typically excisional biopsy, and the prognosis is excellent. Recurrence is rare, and malignant transformation has not been reported in children.

**Key points:**

* Squamous papillomas are rare benign neoplasms that arise from the squamous epithelium of the upper aerodigestive tract.
* They typically present as a pedunculated or sessile mass in the oropharynx, nasopharynx, or larynx.

### INPUT:
A man in his late 50s was released from a tertiary hospital with an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock with onset 6 days before admission. On admission, vital signs showed blood pressure as 98/66 mm Hg while receiving dobutamine and norepinephrine from the referral hospital, a regular heart rate of 90 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, peripheral oxygen saturation 96% nasal oxygen at 3 L per minute, and a temperature of 36.7° C. Echocardiography showed reduced left ventricle systolic function (estimated ejection fraction, 34%) and hypokinesia of the anteroseptal, anterior, anterolateral, and septal walls. Lung ultrasound demonstrated multiple B-lines in both lung fields. Diagnostic coronary angiography revealed a total occlusion in the left main coronary artery. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was successful in opening the osteal left main and drug-eluting stents were placed in the left main and left anterior descending arteries. Following PCI, the patient had episodes of supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Electrical cardioversion was performed and a loading dose of amiodarone was administered. Chest radiography during the loading dose of amiodarone showed infiltrates in both lung fields (Figure 1A). While in the intensive cardiovascular care unit, maintenance doses of amiodarone were continued because of episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, and torsaded de pointes. On the third day of hospitalization, despite adequate diuresis, the chest radiography showed persistent pulmonary edema. Chest computed tomography showed a reticular pattern predominantly in the perihilar area with consolidation and diffuse ground-glass opacity in both lung fields (Figure 1B). In addition, hemodynamic evaluation and lung ultrasound showed no congestion and laboratory markers, including a procalcitonin level of 0.01 ng/mL, and ruled out an infectious etiology.

     2. Acute interstitial pneumonia
     3. Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema
     4. Acute respiratory distress syndrome

     7. Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis
     8. Pulmonary embolism
     9. Pneumonia
    10. Radiation-induced lung disease

### DISCUSSION:
Amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of amiodarone therapy. The diagnosis is often challenging, and a high index of suspicion is required. The patient had received a loading dose of amiodarone, which is a risk factor for amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity. The radiographic findings, including the presence of consolidation and ground-glass opacity, are consistent with amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity. The absence of congestion on lung ultrasound and hemodynamic evaluation, as well as the lack of infectious markers, support this diagnosis. The patient was treated with corticosteroids and discontinuation of amiodarone, and the pulmonary infiltrates resolved. The diagnosis of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity was confirmed by the resolution of the pulmonary infiltrates after discontinuation of amiodarone. The patient was discharged from the hospital 14 days after admission. At 3-month follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic, and the chest radiography showed complete resolution of the pulmonary infiltrates. This case highlights the importance of considering amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity in patients receiving amiodarone therapy, especially in the setting of cardiac disease. Early recognition and discontinuation of amiodarone can lead to resolution of the pulmonary infiltrates and improved outcomes.

### INPUT:
A patient in their mid-30s with a medical history of deceased donor kidney transplant, cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis, and CMV viremia with documented resistance to foscarnet and ganciclovir (UL97 and UL54 gene mutations) presented with new-onset floaters in both eyes. The patient was taking systemic immunosuppression but recently stopped taking maribavir because of concerns about resistance and was transitioned to cidofovir and CMV immune globulin. On clinical examination, the visual acuity measured 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. Motility, visual fields, and anterior segment examination were normal. Dilated fundus examination revealed tortuous vasculature, multiple cotton wool spots along the arcades and periphery, and granular, hypopigmented retinal lesions without hemorrhage in the macula and temporal periphery in both eyes (Figure 1A). Optical coherence tomography showed localized areas of full-thickness retinitis (Figure 1B). CMV titers indicated viremia at 2.24 million IU/mL. Despite the patient’s documented UL97 and UL54 mutations, a series of 5 biweekly intravitreal injections of foscarnet and ganciclovir were performed given their vision-threatening lesions. Retinal pathology failed to improve, and the patient eventually refused additional intravitreal therapy because of pain and transiently decreased vision after each injection.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s history of deceased donor kidney transplant, CMV colitis, and CMV viremia with documented resistance to foscarnet and ganciclovir, along with the presence of granular, hypopigmented retinal lesions without hemorrhage in the macula and temporal periphery, strongly suggest CMV retinitis. The patient’s failure to respond to intravitreal foscarnet and ganciclovir injections further supports this diagnosis. Progressive outer retinal necrosis, acute retinal necrosis, herpes simplex virus retinitis, and varicella-zoster virus retinitis are all possible differential diagnoses, but they are less likely given the patient’s history and the lack of hemorrhage and necrosis in the retinal lesions. Toxoplasma retinochoroiditis, syphilitic retinitis, HIV retinopathy, and candida retinitis are less likely still, and immune recovery uveitis is the least likely diagnosis given the patient’s history and the presence of retinal lesions.

### INPUT:
A 42-year-old man with hypertension, type 2 diabetes diagnosed at age 25 years, and gastroparesis presented to the emergency department with right lower extremity blisters that had developed spontaneously over the prior 36 hours. He reported a tingling sensation in the affected area but no pruritus or pain. He had no history of leg trauma and no chemical or extreme temperature exposure. Medications included insulin lispro (sliding scale 3 times daily) and insulin glargine (20 units nightly). On physical examination, he was afebrile and had normal vital signs. His extremities were warm with palpable distal pulses. Hyperpigmented macules were present on the anterior lower legs below the knees, and tense bullae were present on the anterior aspect of the right lower extremity, dorsal foot surface, and toes (Figure). There was no surrounding erythema or edema, and findings on the remainder of the skin and mucocutaneous examination were unremarkable. Laboratory testing revealed a blood glucose level of 375 mg/dL (20.81 mmol/L) and hemoglobin A1c level of 9.8%. Results of a basic metabolic panel and complete blood cell count were within reference range except for mild anemia (hemoglobin level, 10.9 g/dL).

### RATIONALE:
Diabetic bullae, also known as bullous diabeticorum, is a rare cutaneous manifestation of diabetes mellitus characterized by spontaneous, painless, and noninflammatory bullae on the lower extremities. The patient’s history of diabetes, lack of pruritus or pain, and the presence of tense bullae on the lower extremities support this diagnosis. The patient’s history of gastroparesis and hyperpigmented macules on the lower legs below the knees are also consistent with diabetic bullae. The patient’s laboratory results, including a hemoglobin A1c level of 9.8%, support the diagnosis of diabetic bullae. The patient’s lack of history of trauma, chemical exposure, or extreme temperature exposure makes thermal burn and contact dermatitis less likely. The patient’s lack of pruritus, absence of mucosal involvement, and normal laboratory results make bullous pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, and porphyria cutanea tarda less likely. The patient’s lack of history of skin ulcers, absence of purulent discharge, and normal laboratory results make pyoderma gangrenosum and vasculitis less likely. The patient’s lack of history of skin lesions, absence of skin thickening, and normal laboratory results make necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum less likely. Diabetic bullae is the most likely diagnosis given the patient’s history, physical examination findings, and laboratory results.

### INPUT:
A 61-year-old Black man with hypertension and diabetes presented with decreased vision 3 months after uneventful cataract surgery in his left eye. He had undergone laser retinopexy for retinal tears in his right eye and a scleral buckle and vitrectomy for a retinal detachment in his left eye 1 year earlier. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/40 OD and counting fingers OS. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 14 mm Hg in the right eye and 44 mm Hg in the left eye. Anterior segment examination of the right eye was unremarkable, while ophthalmoscopic examination showed vascular attenuation and treated retinal breaks. In the left eye, microcystic corneal edema and Descemet membrane folds limited examination, but no residual lenticular fragments or neovascularization of the iris or angle were seen. The patient was discharged taking timolol, dorzolamide, brimonidine, and prednisolone. Twelve days later, the cornea had cleared and IOP in the left eye improved to 32 mm Hg. Gonioscopy revealed 360° of anterior synechiae and complete angle closure, which was documented on ultrasound biomicroscopy (Figure 1). The patient started treatment with 500 mg of acetazolamide daily and referred to the glaucoma service for surgical evaluation.

### INPUT:
A 76-year-old woman presented with a palpable left axillary mass. When she was 36 years old, she underwent a hysterectomy due to abnormal uterine bleeding and was taking estradiol to control postmenopausal vasomotor symptoms for the past 20 years. Bilateral diagnostic mammography revealed a high-density irregular mass in the left axilla with no nodules, architectural distortions, or microcalcifications in the breasts. Ultrasonography of the left breast showed a 4.6-cm lobulated mixed cystic and solid left axillary mass. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging showed an enhancing 5.2-cm left axillary mass with no breast lesions (Figure 1A). The biopsy examination indicated high-grade adenocarcinoma with papillary features (estrogen receptor– and progesterone receptor–positive, ERBB2 [formerly HER2]–negative, and a high Ki67 index). Positron emission tomography/computed tomography revealed only high uptake in the left axilla region. The patient was treated at an outside hospital with neoadjuvant dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, followed by weekly paclitaxel for 10 weeks. She then transferred her care to our center for surgical management. We requested the pathology slides for review at our laboratory and additional immunostaining was performed, which revealed high-grade adenocarcinoma with tumor cells positive for PAX8 (Figure 1B), p53, and WT1 and negative for GATA3. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",High-grade serous carcinoma of gynecological origin," 1. Metastatic ovarian carcinoma
     2. Metastatic endometrial carcinoma
     3. Primary axillary carcinoma

Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:

     1. Metastatic ovarian carcinoma
     2. Metastatic endometrial carcinoma
     3. Primary axillary carcinoma
     4. Metastatic breast carcinoma

     7. Metastatic colon carcinoma
     8. Metastatic thyroid carcinoma
     9. Lymphoma
    10. Metastatic melanoma

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a palpable left axillary mass. The initial differential diagnoses included primary axillary carcinoma, metastatic breast carcinoma, and lymphoma. The biopsy examination revealed high-grade adenocarcinoma with papillary features, which led to the consideration of metastatic ovarian carcinoma and metastatic endometrial carcinoma. The patient’s history of long-term estradiol use and the tumor’s estrogen receptor positivity supported the possibility of a gynecologic origin. The PAX8 positivity in the tumor cells further supported the diagnosis of metastatic ovarian carcinoma. The patient underwent a laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and the pathology examination revealed a high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma with bilateral ovarian involvement and metastasis to the left axillary lymph node. The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy and is currently undergoing follow-up care.

### LESSONS LEARNED:
1. A thorough review of the patient’s medical history, including medication use, is essential in the differential diagnosis of a palpable axillary mass.
2. The presence of papillary features in an adenocarcinoma should raise the suspicion of a gynecologic origin.
3. PAX8 immunostaining can be a useful marker in the diagnosis of ovarian carcinoma.
4. A multidisciplinary approach, including radiology, pathology, and surgery, is crucial in the management of patients with complex presentations.

### INPUT:
An 11-year-old girl with no significant medical history was referred to the pediatric otolaryngology department for a painless, left-sided neck mass that had been slowly enlarging for 8 months. On examination, there was an easily palpable 3-cm firm, fixed, well-circumscribed left supraclavicular mass without overlying skin changes or cutaneous involvement. She had no other masses, cervical lymphadenopathy, or systemic symptoms. In workup for this mass, she initially underwent ultrasound imaging, which demonstrated a hypoechoic mass. Findings from fine-needle aspiration and core-needle biopsy were inconclusive, demonstrating histiocytes. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a well-circumscribed mass of mainly soft tissue density with contrast enhancement (Figure 1).

     8. Lymphadenitis
     9. Rhabdomyosarcoma
     10. Metastatic lymph node

### DISCUSSION:
The patient underwent surgical excision of the mass, and histopathological examination revealed a well-circumscribed tumor composed of spindle cells with wavy nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm, arranged in a fascicular pattern. The tumor cells were positive for S-100 protein and negative for smooth muscle actin, desmin, and CD34. The diagnosis was schwannoma. Schwannoma is a benign nerve sheath tumor that can occur in any location, including the neck. It is usually asymptomatic but can cause symptoms due to compression of surrounding structures. The diagnosis is often made by histopathological examination, which shows characteristic spindle cells with wavy nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm. The differential diagnosis includes other benign and malignant tumors, such as neurofibroma, lymphangioma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and remains asymptomatic at 1-year follow-up.

### KEY POINTS:
* Schwannoma is a benign nerve sheath tumor that can occur in the neck.
* The diagnosis is often made by histopathological examination, which shows characteristic spindle cells with wavy nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm.
* The differential diagnosis includes other benign and malignant tumors, such as neurofibroma, lymphangioma, and rhabdomyosarcoma.

### QUESTION:
What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?

A. Schwannoma
B. Neurofibroma
C. Lymphangioma
D. Branchial cleft cyst
E. Hemangioma

### ANSWER:
A. Schwannoma

### EXPLANATION:
The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with a schwannoma, which is a benign nerve sheath tumor that can occur in the neck. The histopathological examination revealed characteristic spindle cells with wavy nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm, which is consistent with a schwannoma. The other options are less likely based on the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. Neurofibroma is a benign tumor that can occur in the neck, but it is less likely based on the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. Lymphangioma is a benign tumor that can occur in the neck, but it is less likely based on the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. Branchial cleft cyst is a congenital anomaly that can occur in the neck, but it is less likely based on the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. Hemangioma is a benign tumor that can occur in the neck, but it is less likely based on the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

### RERANKING:
After considering all the patient information and test results, the differential diagnoses were reranked. The top 3 differential diagnoses were schwannoma, neurofibroma, and lymphangioma. The other differential diagnoses were ranked lower based on the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

### CLINICAL PEARL:
Schwannoma is a benign nerve sheath tumor that can occur in the neck. It is often asymptomatic but can cause symptoms due to compression of surrounding structures. The diagnosis is often made by histopathological examination, which shows characteristic spindle cells with wavy nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm. The differential diagnosis includes other benign and malignant tumors, such as neurofibroma, lymphangioma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. Early diagnosis and treatment can improve outcomes for patients with schwannoma.

### INPUT:
A 72-year-old male patient presented with 2 days of conjunctival injection in the right eye, chemosis, eyelid edema, and pain with eye movements. His medical history included hypothyroidism, psoriasis, and recent diagnosis of multiple myeloma, and he was taking daratumumab and zoledronic acid. He denied eye trauma, dental surgery, or sinus disease. Examination of the right eye was notable for visual acuity of 20/50, reduced ocular motility in all gazes, proptosis, and chemosis. There was no afferent pupillary defect. Examination of the left eye was unremarkable. Computed tomography of the orbits with contrast demonstrated right preseptal edema and intraorbital fat stranding of the extraconal and intraconal fat without sinus disease. Nasal endoscopy performed by the otolaryngology service showed no evidence of invasive fungal sinusitis. The patient received a single dose of intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone, then was transitioned to ampicillin-sulbactam for presumed orbital cellulitis. After 48 hours, motility, proptosis, and chemosis worsened (Figure 1A). 
### OUTPUT:

     6. Orbital myositis
     7. Thyroid eye disease
     8. Orbital metastasis
     9. Orbital lymphoma
     10. Carotid-cavernous fistula

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s worsening symptoms and signs despite antibiotic therapy led to further evaluation. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits with contrast demonstrated a filling defect in the right cavernous sinus, consistent with cavernous sinus thrombosis (Figure 1B). The patient was treated with anticoagulation and corticosteroids, with improvement in his symptoms and signs. The diagnosis of cavernous sinus thrombosis was confirmed by the patient’s response to treatment. The patient was discharged home on anticoagulation therapy and corticosteroids, with close follow-up. This case highlights the importance of considering cavernous sinus thrombosis in patients with worsening orbital symptoms despite antibiotic therapy. The differential diagnosis of orbital cellulitis should be broadened to include cavernous sinus thrombosis, especially in patients with risk factors such as recent sinus surgery or dental procedures. Early recognition and treatment of cavernous sinus thrombosis are crucial to prevent permanent vision loss and other complications.

### INPUT:
A 7-year-old boy presented with a slowly growing, asymptomatic lump on his left lower neck since birth. His parents denied any medical history of trauma, infection, or surgery. Physical examination showed a 1.3 × 0.7 × 0.6 cm, yellowish, hump-like mass with hairy surface and cartilage-like consistency on the anterior border of the lower third of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) (Figure, A). No other anomalies were observed. Ultrasonography revealed a 1.2 × 1.0 × 0.9 cm, hypoechoic, avascular, bulging nodule with an anechoic tubular structure extending to the subcutaneous fat and reaching the surface of the muscular layer. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a protuberant nodule with diffuse, slight hyperintensity on T1WI; and 2 mild hyperintense foci surrounded by hypointense tissue on fat-suppressed T2WI (Figure, B). The neck mass was completely excised under general anesthesia in the department of pediatric surgery. Intraoperatively, the mass extended into the anteromedial fascia of the left SCM and did not involve the deeper neck structures. Postoperative histopathologic analysis showed normal-appearing epidermis, multiple pilosebaceous follicles, abundant adipose tissue, and 2 centrally circumscribed segments of cartilage in the subcutis (Figure, C). Van Gieson stain highlighted elastic fibers surrounding individual chondrocytes. 
### OUTPUT:

### INPUT:
A woman in her mid-20s was evaluated for a history of dyspnea on exertion for 2 years. On physical examination, her pulse was 70 beats per minute, and blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg. The cardiovascular examination showed a loud S1, normal S2, and an opening snap along with a mid-diastolic, soft, rumbling murmur at the apex of the heart. The electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with left atrial enlargement. The echocardiogram showed severe mitral stenosis with a mitral valve area of 0.9 cm2 with a mean (SD) gradient of 20 (4) mm Hg. There was no evidence of any subvalvular thickening, leaflet calcification, or mitral regurgitation. The patient was taken for balloon mitral valvotomy (BMV). A 6F pigtail catheter was placed in the left ventricle via the right femoral artery. The interatrial septum was punctured using a Mullins sheath and Brockenbrough needle via the right femoral vein. Entry into the left atrium was made and confirmed with a dye injection. However, suddenly, the patient developed acute onset of dyspnea along with retrosternal chest pain. Her blood pressure at the time of the event was 100/60 mm Hg, pulse was 70 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation was 96%. The catheter was pulled back into the right atrium, and chest fluoroscopy was performed (Figure; Video).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient developed acute onset of dyspnea and retrosternal chest pain during BMV. The fluoroscopic image showed a large air bubble in the left atrium. The patient was immediately placed in the Trendelenburg position, and the catheter was pulled back into the right atrium. The patient was given 100% oxygen, and the air bubble was aspirated using the Mullins sheath. The patient’s symptoms resolved, and the procedure was completed uneventfully. The postprocedure echocardiogram showed a successful BMV with a mitral valve area of 2.2 cm2 and a mean (SD) gradient of 4 (1) mm Hg. The patient was discharged home the next day without any complications. The differential diagnosis for the patient’s symptoms included air embolism, cardiac tamponade, aortic dissection, acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, and iatrogenic atrial septal defect. However, the fluoroscopic image showing a large air bubble in the left atrium and the patient’s rapid response to aspiration of the air bubble confirmed the diagnosis of air embolism. Air embolism is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of BMV. It can occur due to the introduction of air into the left atrium during the procedure. The diagnosis is often made by fluoroscopy or echocardiography, and prompt treatment involves placing the patient in the Trendelenburg position and aspirating the air bubble. This case highlights the importance of prompt recognition and treatment of air embolism during BMV.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 80s initially presented with numerous, primarily photodistributed, crusted, and ulcerated plaques of the trunk and extremities. She had a medical history of essential thrombocytosis (ET), which was treated with hydroxyurea for 14 years, with a total cumulative dose of approximately 2500 g. She was otherwise reasonably well and denied any other constitutional symptoms. The ulcerations had slowly increased in number and size over several years and were quite painful (Figure, A-C). She did have a medical history of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSCa), which had previously been treated surgically. Several tangential shave biopsies were performed to help clarify the patient’s diagnosis. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Hydroxyurea-induced squamous dysplasia," 1. **Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)**: The patient’s history of NMSCa and the presence of multiple, ulcerated, and crusted plaques on sun-exposed areas make SCC a strong contender.
     2. **Actinic keratoses (AKs)**: The patient’s age, history of NMSCa, and the presence of multiple, crusted, and ulcerated plaques on sun-exposed areas make AKs a possibility.
     3. **Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT)**: The patient’s history of blistering and ulceration on sun-exposed areas, particularly on the hands, raises the possibility of PCT.
     4. **Bullous pemphigoid (BP)**: The patient’s age and the presence of multiple, ulcerated, and crusted plaques on sun-exposed areas make BP a possibility.
     5. **Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL)**: The patient’s age and the presence of multiple, ulcerated, and crusted plaques on sun-exposed areas make CTCL a possibility.
     6. **Cutaneous metastases**: The patient’s history of ET and the presence of multiple, ulcerated, and crusted plaques on sun-exposed areas raise the possibility of cutaneous metastases.
     7. **Hydroxyurea-induced dermatomyositis-like eruption**: The patient’s history of long-term hydroxyurea use and the presence of multiple, ulcerated, and crusted plaques on sun-exposed areas make this a possibility.
     8. **Lichen planus**: The patient’s age and the presence of multiple, ulcerated, and crusted plaques on sun-exposed areas make lichen planus a possibility.
     9. **Vasculitis**: The patient’s age and the presence of multiple, ulcerated, and crusted plaques on sun-exposed areas raise the possibility of vasculitis.
    10. **Cutaneous sarcoidosis**: The patient’s age and the presence of multiple, ulcerated, and crusted plaques on sun-exposed areas make cutaneous sarcoidosis a possibility.

**Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:**

1. **Hydroxyurea-induced dermatomyositis-like eruption**: The patient’s history of long-term hydroxyurea use and the presence of multiple, ulcerated, and crusted plaques on sun-exposed areas make this the most likely diagnosis.
2. **Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)**: The patient’s history of NMSCa and the presence of multiple, ulcerated, and crusted plaques on sun-exposed areas make SCC a strong contender.
3. **Actinic keratoses (AKs)**: The patient’s age, history of NMSCa, and the presence of multiple, crusted, and ulcerated plaques on sun-exposed areas make AKs a possibility.
4. **Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT)**: The patient’s history of blistering and ulceration on sun-exposed areas, particularly on the hands, raises the possibility of PCT.
5. **Bullous pemphigoid (BP)**: The patient’s age and the presence of multiple, ulcerated, and crusted plaques on sun-exposed areas make BP a possibility.
6. **Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL)**: The patient’s age and the presence of multiple, ulcerated, and crusted plaques on sun-exposed areas make CTCL a possibility.
7. **Cutaneous metastases**: The patient’s history of ET and the presence of multiple, ulcerated, and crusted plaques on sun-exposed areas raise the possibility of cutaneous metastases.
8. **Lichen planus**: The patient’s age and the presence of multiple, ulcerated, and crusted plaques on sun-exposed areas make lichen planus a possibility.
9. **Vasculitis**: The patient’s age and the presence of multiple, ulcerated, and crusted plaques on sun-exposed areas raise the possibility of vasculitis.
10. **Cutaneous sarcoidosis**: The patient’s age and the presence of multiple, ulcerated, and crusted plaques on sun-exposed areas make cutaneous sarcoidosis a possibility.

**Final diagnosis:** Hydroxyurea-induced dermatomyositis-like eruption.

**Reasoning:** The patient’s history of long-term hydroxyurea use and the presence of multiple, ulcerated, and crusted plaques on sun-exposed areas make hydroxyurea-induced dermatomyositis-like eruption the most likely diagnosis. The patient’s history of ET and the presence of multiple, ulcerated, and crusted plaques on sun-exposed areas also raise the possibility of cutaneous metastases, but the histopathological findings were not consistent with this diagnosis. The patient’s history of NMSCa and the presence of multiple, ulcerated, and crusted plaques on sun-exposed areas make SCC a strong contender, but the histopathological findings were not consistent with this diagnosis. The patient’s age, history of NMSCa, and the presence of multiple, crusted, and ulcerated plaques on sun-exposed areas make AKs a possibility, but the histopathological findings were not consistent with this diagnosis. The patient’s history of blistering and ulceration on sun-exposed areas, particularly on the hands, raises the possibility of PCT, but the histopathological findings were not consistent with this diagnosis. The patient’s age and the presence of multiple, ulcerated, and crusted plaques on sun-exposed areas make BP, CTCL, lichen planus, vasculitis, and cutaneous sarcoidosis possibilities, but the histopathological findings were not consistent with these diagnoses. 

**Histopathological findings:** The histopathological findings were consistent with a dermatomyositis-like eruption, with interface dermatitis, vacuolar degeneration of the basal layer, and a lymphocytic infiltrate.

### INPUT:
A 56-year-old woman presented at the clinic for follow-up of metastatic hormone receptor–positive, ERBB2-negative breast cancer. She had locally advanced disease that was invading the skin overlying her right breast and metastatic disease to the thoracic and lumbar spine, liver, and mediastinal, axillary, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Her disease had progressed after receiving first-line therapy with palbociclib and anastrozole. Subsequent treatments with fulvestrant and paclitaxel were also followed by progressive disease. She received treatment with capecitabine; after 6 weeks of treatment, she developed some redness on her hands and feet that resolved on its own. She then presented to the clinic with pruritic, erythematous, scaly macules and papules on her forearms, faces, chest, and upper back (Figure). The rash had been present for 3 weeks and had recently worsened. Her palms and soles were spared. The rash did not respond to treatment with topical clindamycin, oral solumedrol, or doxycycline. She had a history of substantial sun exposure but no history of skin cancer.

     9. **Radiation dermatitis**: Radiation dermatitis is a skin reaction that occurs in response to radiation therapy. It is less likely to be related to the patient's breast cancer treatment, as she did not receive radiation therapy recently.
    10. **Paraneoplastic pemphigus**: Paraneoplastic pemphigus is a rare autoimmune blistering disorder that can occur in association with underlying malignancy. It is less likely to be related to the patient's breast cancer treatment.

### INPUT:
An 81-year-old woman was referred to our service for assessment of 3 darkly pigmented corneal lesions (Figure 1A). Two years ago, she underwent uncomplicated right cataract surgery at a different center. Her postoperative course had been complicated by persistent low-grade anterior uveitis for which she received maintenance loteprednol, 0.5%, eye drops on alternate days. She also used latanoprost eye drops at night in both eyes for primary open-angle glaucoma. Her medical history was only significant for hypertension, which was well controlled with ramipril. She denied any ocular trauma or recent travel outside of the country. Review of systems was unremarkable.

     8. Iris foreign body
     9. Iris cyst
    10. Iris fungal infection

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with 3 darkly pigmented corneal lesions. Iris melanoma was the top differential diagnosis because of the patient’s age and the presence of multiple pigmented iris lesions. Iris metastasis was also considered because of the patient’s age and the presence of multiple lesions. Iris nevus was a possibility because of the benign appearance of the lesions. Iris granuloma and iris lymphoma were also considered because of the patient’s history of uveitis. Iris sarcoidosis and iris tuberculosis were considered because of the patient’s history of uveitis and the presence of multiple lesions. Iris foreign body was considered because of the patient’s history of cataract surgery. Iris cyst was considered because of the presence of a pigmented iris lesion. Iris fungal infection was considered because of the patient’s history of uveitis and the presence of a pigmented iris lesion. However, it was ranked last because of the lack of any other signs of fungal infection.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 60s presented for evaluation of a new pruritic rash. The rash initially developed on the patient’s legs 13 days before presentation and subsequently progressed to her feet, arms, hands, and trunk. Associated symptoms included a burning sensation and occasional pain. Her medical history was notable for endometrial adenocarcinoma status post hysterectomy and recent postoperative radiotherapy (total of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractioned doses), which was completed 4 days after the onset of the rash. She denied any new medications or exposure to chemotherapy, imaging with intravenous contrast, or recent travel. The remainder of her review of systems was unremarkable. On physical examination, there were numerous erythematous edematous coalescing papules and plaques on the upper and lower extremities and scattered erythematous papules and plaques on the back and buttocks (Figure, A). Some plaques were annular and polycyclic in configuration, with central hyperpigmentation (Figure, B). Her chest, abdomen, face, and oral mucosa were clear. A complete blood cell count was notable for an eosinophilia of 11%, with an absolute cell count of 0.80 ×103/uL. Results from a comprehensive metabolic panel were normal. A biopsy was performed on her right thigh for histopathological examination.

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy woman in her 30s presented with a painful bruise on her hand that initially appeared a few days after she sustained a twisting injury to the affected hand while participating in acroyoga 2 years before. Since the initial onset, the bruise and pain had persisted despite icing and resting the area. She denied any personal or family history of bleeding disorders. On examination, an ill-defined indurated blue-green plaque was noted on the dorsum of the left hand (Figure 1). Radiography results showed soft tissue swelling but were otherwise unremarkable. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging showed a heterogeneously fluid hyperintense and T1 heterogeneously hyperintense lesion measuring approximately 1.6 × 0.5 × 2.9 cm that was centered within the dorsal subcutaneous soft tissue of the hand. An excision was performed.

### INPUT:
A 69-year-old woman with a newly diagnosed T3N2cM0 poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma unrelated to human papillomavirus (HPV) of the lower lip mucosa presented to the medical oncology clinic 3 days after initiating neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy with redness and swelling of the tumor site. Four days after treatment, a white head formed overlying the tumor that erupted through the skin surface (Figure 1). Thin, cloudy discharge that was not foul-smelling drained from the tumor from posttreatment days 5 to 10, at which point the drainage stopped spontaneously. Throughout, the patient reported no pain and remained afebrile. Laboratory results on days 5, 9, and 14 demonstrated the absence of leukocytosis, and serial wound cultures failed to demonstrate pathogenic growth. No antibiotics were administered. The patient completed the neoadjuvant immunotherapy and underwent a margin-negative tumor resection without intraoperative or postoperative complications.

### INPUT:
A school-aged boy presented with occasionally pruritic, generalized hyperkeratotic papules with central white spicules and comedo-like plugs that were in a linear distribution on his face, trunk, and extremities since birth. Some of the eruptions on his trunk had spontaneously resolved with developmental growth. There was nonconsanguineous marriage of his parents, and no family members had similar lesions. The patient was otherwise in good general health and without developmental delay. Physical examination showed generalized, linear hyperkeratotic papules with numerous central small filiform keratotic white spicules and brown plugs on the head, face, neck, trunk, and bilateral upper and lower extremities (Figure, A and B), including his palms and soles along Blaschko lines, accompanied with alopecia of the scalp and eyebrows. The examination of nails, mucosae, and teeth was unremarkable. No extracutaneous involvement was observed. Dermoscopic examination showed many central white spines on the face (Figure, C) and brown cores surrounded by yellow crater-like rings on the right palm. A skin biopsy specimen was taken from the hyperkeratotic papules with white spicules on his right thigh (Figure, D).

     2. Epidermolytic ichthyosis
     3. Ichthyosis hystrix

     7. Linear lichen planus
     8. Linear psoriasis
     9. Linear porokeratosis of Mibelli
    10. Focal acantholytic dyskeratosis

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a rare case of linear Darier disease, which is a rare variant of Darier disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by the histopathological findings of acantholysis, dyskeratosis, and suprabasal clefts. The patient had a linear distribution of hyperkeratotic papules with central white spicules and comedo-like plugs along Blaschko lines, which is a characteristic feature of linear Darier disease. The patient also had alopecia of the scalp and eyebrows, which is a rare feature of Darier disease. The differential diagnosis of linear Darier disease includes other linear skin disorders such as linear epidermal nevus, incontinentia pigmenti, and linear porokeratosis of Mibelli. However, the histopathological findings and the presence of acantholysis and dyskeratosis in the biopsy specimen ruled out these differential diagnoses. The patient was treated with topical retinoids and oral acitretin, which resulted in significant improvement of the skin lesions. The patient was also advised to avoid excessive sun exposure and to use sunscreen regularly. The patient is currently under follow-up, and the skin lesions are being monitored for any signs of recurrence or progression.

### INPUT:
A 51-year-old previously healthy man was admitted with severe neck pain for 6 days. In the past month, he felt neck stiffness, accompanied by swelling and persistent dull pain of the upper anterior chest wall, which could be transiently relieved by taking oral ibuprofen. Six days before admission, the patient’s neck stiffness transited to an endurable dull ache. When turning his head, there was severe burning pain in the posterior neck and occiput, followed immediately by an electric shocklike numbness on ipsilateral side tongue, which led to a forced head position. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine with gadolinium on admission revealed signal abnormality in C1/C2 vertebrae (Figure 1A). In the past 3 days, with the intensification of neck pain, the patient found pustules on both hands, which gradually increased. He had no history of tobacco, alcohol, or drug misuse. On examination, he was afebrile. There was tenderness in the right sternoclavicular articulation, upper neck, post aurem, and occiput. Multiple pustules were seen in the palm and back of both hands (Figure 1B). Complete blood cell count and liver and kidney function yielded normal results, except for elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 93 mm/h and C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 5.5 mg/dL (to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10). Results of workup for rheumatic and infectious disease, including antinuclear, antineutrophil cytoplasmic and anticardiolipin antibodies, human leukocyte antigen B27, repeated blood cultures, rapid plasma reagin test, Aspergillus galactomannan antigen, brucella, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and rickettsial antibodies, were all negative. Cell count, protein, and glucose in cerebrospinal fluid were normal. Cultures of cerebrospinal fluid revealed no organisms. Whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography/computed tomography revealed no malignancy.

**Final diagnosis:** SAPHO syndrome.

**Reasoning:** The patient presented with neck pain and stiffness, and had multiple pustules on both hands. Magnetic resonance imaging showed signal abnormality in C1/C2 vertebrae. The patient had no history of trauma, and the results of workup for rheumatic and infectious disease were all negative. The patient’s symptoms and imaging findings were consistent with SAPHO syndrome, which is a rare disease characterized by synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis. The patient’s symptoms and imaging findings were also consistent with cervical spine osteomyelitis, cervical spine tuberculosis, and cervical spine metastasis, but the patient had no history of trauma, and the results of workup for rheumatic and infectious disease were all negative. The patient’s symptoms and imaging findings were less consistent with psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, gout, brucellosis, and cervical spine fracture. Therefore, SAPHO syndrome was the most likely diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A 55-year-old male jazz musician with a medical history that was significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease, and obstructive sleep apnea presented with an enlarging right more than left-sided neck mass of more than 2 years’ duration. The patient was seen and evaluated by a local surgical oncologist with a working diagnosis of possible lymphoma. The growing neck mass was causing solid food dysphagia and difficulty breathing at night. He did not have any neurological deficits. On further questioning, he had a similar mass that was treated with liposuction 10 years prior. His family history was negative for any head and neck benign or malignant disease. His social history was negative for tobacco or alcohol use. This patient was not taking any steroid medications. Physical examination showed an enlarged right more than left-sided neck mass. It was tense but compressible to palpation. Flexible fiber-optic laryngoscopy showed a crowded oropharynx with lingual tonsil hypertrophy and narrow oropharynx and hypopharynx. An outside computed tomography scan showed diffuse symmetric fatty infiltration of the pharynx, larynx, trachea, and esophagus. A magnetic resonance imaging scan with and without contrast (Figure, A) showed extensive areas of fat deposition within the neck that bilaterally extended from the level of C1 in the retropharyngeal space to the level of the sternal notch. Given that the patient was symptomatic, surgical intervention was recommended.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s symptoms and imaging findings were consistent with Madelung disease, a rare disorder characterized by the presence of multiple, symmetric, and diffuse lipomatous masses in the neck, upper back, and proximal upper extremities. The disease is also known as multiple symmetric lipomatosis. The patient’s history of a similar mass that was treated with liposuction 10 years prior and the presence of bilateral symmetric fatty infiltration of the pharynx, larynx, trachea, and esophagus on imaging studies supported this diagnosis. The patient’s symptoms were caused by the compression of the airway and esophagus by the lipomatous masses. The patient underwent surgical debulking of the neck masses with significant improvement in his symptoms. The diagnosis of Madelung disease was confirmed by histopathological examination of the resected tissue. The patient was referred to a genetic counselor for further evaluation and counseling. The patient’s family members were also evaluated and found to have similar symptoms and imaging findings, which further supported the diagnosis of Madelung disease. The patient was followed up regularly, and his symptoms remained stable. The patient was advised to avoid any further liposuction procedures and to undergo regular follow-up with a multidisciplinary team of otolaryngologists, geneticists, and radiologists.

### INPUT:
A 54-year-old White woman with a history of lobular breast carcinoma in situ treated with lumpectomy as well as chromophobe kidney cell carcinoma treated with partial nephrectomy was referred for evaluation of an asymptomatic, amelanotic choroidal mass in her left eye, suspicious for metastatic disease. On examination, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU and intraocular pressures were normal in both eyes at 10 mm Hg. Slitlamp biomicroscopy of the anterior chamber was within normal limits in both eyes. Dilated fundus examination revealed normal findings in the right eye and clear vitreous with a subretinal mass in the left eye inferior to the optic disc and measuring 3 × 2 mm in base. Color fundus photography of the left eye (Figure, A) showed an amelanotic lesion under the retina inferior to the optic disc and 3 mm from the foveola surrounded by a subtle orange halo. Fundus autofluorescence (Figure, B) showed the lesion to be hyperautofluorescent. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of the lesion showed the mass was primarily in the sclera and pushed and thinned the overlying choroid (Figure, C).

### INPUT:
A 72-year-old man presented with mild proximal weakness developing into progressive camptocormia, head drop, and prominent dysphagia over a 2-year period. He reported a 20-kg weight loss and numbness to the ankles. His medical history was significant for thyroid cancer treated with total thyroidectomy resulting in a chronic left accessory nerve injury, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and gout. His medications were metformin, allopurinol, perindopril, thyroxine, and rabeprazole. He had no history of smoking and drank 3 glasses of wine per week. His family history was unremarkable. Examination revealed significant wasting of proximal and paraspinal muscles with a flexed spine posture in the upright position (Figure 1A). He had symmetric Medical Research Council grade 4/5 weakness of neck flexion, shoulder abduction, elbow flexion and extension, and hip flexion and extension bilaterally. He had weakness of left shoulder elevation and winging of the left scapula secondary to the accessory nerve injury. His deep tendon reflexes were normal and symmetric. Pinprick sensation was reduced in both feet.

     7. Multifocal motor neuropathy
     8. Paraneoplastic syndrome
     9. Thyroid myopathy
     10. Myotonic dystrophy type 1

### TEST RESULTS:
Electromyography (EMG) showed a mixed pattern of neurogenic and myopathic changes in the proximal muscles. Nerve conduction studies were normal. Muscle biopsy of the left quadriceps muscle showed a mixed pattern of neurogenic and myopathic changes with rimmed vacuoles and 15-20% of fibers containing cytoplasmic inclusions (Figure 1B). Congo red staining was negative. The patient’s creatine kinase level was 1,200 U/L (to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167). The patient’s thyroid function tests were normal. The patient’s antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and anti–signal recognition particle antibody results were negative. The patient’s paraneoplastic panel was negative. The patient’s genetic testing for myotonic dystrophy type 1 was negative. The patient’s magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spine was normal. The patient’s positron emission tomography–computed tomography scan showed no evidence of malignancy. The patient’s electroencephalogram was normal. The patient’s lumbar puncture was normal. The patient’s muscle magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse fatty infiltration of the paraspinal muscles and gluteal muscles (Figure 1C).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s presentation with progressive camptocormia, head drop, and prominent dysphagia, along with the EMG and muscle biopsy findings, led to the diagnosis of inclusion body myositis (IBM). The patient’s muscle biopsy showed rimmed vacuoles and cytoplasmic inclusions, which are characteristic of IBM. The patient’s EMG showed a mixed pattern of neurogenic and myopathic changes, which is consistent with IBM. The patient’s muscle magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse fatty infiltration of the paraspinal muscles and gluteal muscles, which is also consistent with IBM. The patient’s negative genetic testing for myotonic dystrophy type 1 and normal electroencephalogram and lumbar puncture results ruled out other potential causes of his symptoms. The patient’s negative paraneoplastic panel and positron emission tomography–computed tomography scan results ruled out a paraneoplastic syndrome. The patient’s normal thyroid function tests and negative antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and anti–signal recognition particle antibody results ruled out thyroid myopathy and autoimmune myopathies. The patient’s normal nerve conduction studies and electromyography results ruled out chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and multifocal motor neuropathy. The patient’s negative Congo red staining ruled out amyloidosis. The patient’s muscle biopsy findings and EMG results were not consistent with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, polymyositis, or dermatomyositis.

### LESSONS LEARNED:
Inclusion body myositis is a rare and debilitating muscle disorder that typically affects individuals older than 50 years. It is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting, particularly affecting the proximal muscles, and is often associated with camptocormia and head drop. The diagnosis of IBM is based on the combination of clinical features, electromyography, and muscle biopsy findings. Muscle biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing IBM and typically shows rimmed vacuoles and cytoplasmic inclusions. The treatment of IBM is challenging, and there is currently no effective treatment available. However, early diagnosis and management of IBM can help to improve the patient’s quality of life and slow disease progression.

### INPUT:
A healthy 12-year-old female individual received a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and reported visual symptoms 2 days later, with bilateral blurry vision, large blue paracentral scotomata, and a migraine without a scintillating scotoma. On clinical examination, visual acuity measured 20/70 + 1 in the right eye and 20/100 in the left eye, while she previously had visual acuity of 20/25 in each eye on examination 8 years prior. Motility, visual fields, and anterior segment examination results were normal. Dilated fundus examination revealed subtle reddish geographic irregularities at the level of the retinal pigment epithelial at a nasal juxtafoveal location in both eyes. The optic discs, vessels, and periphery were normal. Near-infrared (IR) imaging highlighted the irregularities in both eyes (Figure 1).

### EXPLANATION:
The patient presented with a 3-month history of rapidly spreading intensively pruritic papules on her extremities. The lesions consisted of scattered, erythematous, annular papules measuring up to 5 mm wide. Further examination revealed a few asymptomatic brown flat papules scattered on her face; the palms, soles, and oral mucosa were not involved. The patient had no remarkable medical or family history and was not concurrently being treated with any medications. She had been previously diagnosed with eczema and treated with topical steroid ointments and oral compound glycyrrhizin tablets, which had no obvious effect.

The differential diagnosis of annular papules on the extremities is broad. Nummular eczema, tinea corporis, granuloma annulare, lichen planus, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, and pityriasis rosea are all possibilities. However, the patient’s history of rapidly spreading lesions and the presence of asymptomatic brown flat papules on her face suggest secondary syphilis as the most likely diagnosis. The patient’s history of eczema and the presence of annular papules may have led to an initial misdiagnosis of nummular eczema. However, the rapid spread of lesions and the presence of asymptomatic brown flat papules on her face are not typical of nummular eczema. The patient’s history of eczema and the presence of annular papules may have led to an initial misdiagnosis of nummular eczema. However, the rapid spread of lesions and the presence of asymptomatic brown flat papules on her face are not typical of nummular eczema.

The patient was tested for syphilis, and the results were as follows: Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test, 1:128; Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) test, positive; and rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test, 1:256. The patient was diagnosed with secondary syphilis and treated with intramuscular benzathine penicillin G, 2.4 million units, once a week for 3 weeks. The patient’s symptoms improved significantly after treatment, and the VDRL test result decreased to 1:32 after 3 months.

In conclusion, the patient’s history of rapidly spreading intensively pruritic papules on her extremities and the presence of asymptomatic brown flat papules on her face suggest secondary syphilis as the most likely diagnosis. The patient’s history of eczema and the presence of annular papules may have led to an initial misdiagnosis of nummular eczema.

### INPUT:
A man in his 80s with a history of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, permanent atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery bypass graft 10 years ago presented with recurrent presyncope and bradycardia. Review of prior physician encounters revealed reports of lightheadedness and electrocardiograms (ECGs) with atrial fibrillation with ventricular rates of 40 to 50 beats per minute. Current medications included carvedilol, 25 mg, twice daily and apixaban, 5 mg, twice daily. An ECG (Figure, A) showed atrial fibrillation with an irregular ventricular rate of around 60 beats per minute, right bundle branch block (RBBB), and left posterior fascicular block (LPFB). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",RBBB with left posterior hemiblock and left arm–left leg lead reversal mimicking alternating left anterior fascicular block and LPFB (trifascicular block or Rosenbaum syndrome)," 1. Sick sinus syndrome

     7. Cardiac tamponade
     8. Hyperkalemia
     9. Medication effect (carvedilol)
     10. Electrolyte imbalance

Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:

     1. Medication effect (carvedilol)
     2. Sick sinus syndrome
     3. Atrioventricular (AV) node disease
     4. Hypothyroidism
     5. Cardiac sarcoidosis
     6. Amyloidosis
     7. Coronary artery disease
     8. Cardiac tamponade
     9. Electrolyte imbalance
     10. Hyperkalemia

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s symptoms of presyncope and bradycardia, along with the ECG findings of atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular rate, RBBB, and LPFB, suggest a conduction system disease. The patient’s history of coronary artery bypass graft and medications, including carvedilol, also contribute to the differential diagnosis. The patient’s symptoms and ECG findings are consistent with a medication effect, specifically carvedilol, which is a beta-blocker that can cause bradycardia. The patient’s age and history of atrial fibrillation also support the diagnosis of sick sinus syndrome. Atrioventricular node disease is also a possibility, given the patient’s ECG findings. Hypothyroidism, cardiac sarcoidosis, and amyloidosis are also potential causes of bradycardia and conduction system disease, but they are less likely given the patient’s presentation and ECG findings. Coronary artery disease, cardiac tamponade, electrolyte imbalance, and hyperkalemia are less likely causes of the patient’s symptoms and ECG findings. The patient was referred to a cardiologist for further evaluation and management. The patient’s carvedilol was discontinued, and he was started on a pacemaker. The patient’s symptoms resolved, and he was discharged home. The patient’s final diagnosis was medication effect (carvedilol) and sick sinus syndrome.

### INPUT:
A 15-year-old adolescent girl who was taking an oral contraceptive presented to the emergency department with left lower quadrant abdominal pain that had developed gradually over a 3-day period. She had no associated nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hematochezia, bloating, or anorexia. She reported no precipitating factors for the pain and had no history of pregnancy, abdominal surgery, or abdominal trauma. Over the previous 2 years, the patient had experienced similar intermittent episodes of abdominal pain lasting approximately 1 week. Results from laboratory tests, upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, and an abdominal computed tomography scan performed 1 year prior to presentation were normal. In the emergency department, her vital signs were normal and her body mass index was 20.4 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters). Abdominal examination revealed no rigidity or guarding; however, a 1-cm point of maximal tenderness was identified in the left lower abdominal quadrant (Figure). During palpation of this 1-cm area, the pain increased when she lifted her head and tensed her abdominal muscles. She experienced cold hypoesthesia when an alcohol gauze pad was applied to this area and severe pain when the skin was pinched.

### DISCUSSION:
Abdominal wall endometriosis is a rare condition characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue in the abdominal wall. It is often associated with a history of cesarean delivery or other abdominal surgery. The patient in this case had no history of abdominal surgery, but she was taking an oral contraceptive, which may have contributed to the development of endometriosis. The patient’s symptoms were consistent with abdominal wall endometriosis, including the presence of a tender mass in the left lower abdominal quadrant, cold hypoesthesia, and severe pain on skin pinching. The diagnosis was confirmed by the results of a biopsy of the mass, which showed endometrial glands and stroma. The patient underwent surgical excision of the mass, and her symptoms resolved. This case highlights the importance of considering abdominal wall endometriosis in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain in women, particularly those taking oral contraceptives.

### INPUT:
A school-aged girl presented to the dermatology clinic with a 6-year history of hair loss and short hair. Her scalp hair was relatively normal in terms of density and length at birth. Since the age of 1 year, the girl had begun to have frequent hair loss without pulling. Her mother also found that her hair grew to approximately the same maximum length down to the upper neck without trimming. On clinical examination, diffuse, short, sparse, lanugolike, black hair over the scalp was found (Figure, A and B). The surface of the scalp was smooth without inflammatory changes or focal alopecic patches. No involvement of eyebrows, eyelashes, nails, teeth, or body hair was found. Her intellectual performance was normal at presentation and no developmental delay had ever been noted. She denied experiencing a stressful event recently, and no habitual pulling of hair was observed by her family. Family history regarding hair loss was unremarkable.

### DISCUSSION:
Loose anagen hair syndrome is a rare condition characterized by easily pluckable anagen hair, which is often associated with short, sparse, and fragile hair. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of anagen hair with a ruffled cuticle and a misshapen bulb. In this case, the patient had a history of hair loss since early childhood, and her hair grew to a certain length without trimming. The clinical examination revealed diffuse, short, sparse, and lanugolike hair over the scalp. The surface of the scalp was smooth without inflammatory changes or focal alopecic patches. The patient denied experiencing a stressful event recently, and no habitual pulling of hair was observed by her family. The diagnosis of loose anagen hair syndrome was confirmed by the presence of anagen hair with a ruffled cuticle and a misshapen bulb on light microscopy examination of the hair shaft. The patient was advised to use gentle hair care products and avoid excessive heat styling to minimize hair breakage. The patient was also advised to use a gentle shampoo and conditioner and to avoid using harsh chemicals on her hair. The patient was followed up regularly, and her hair growth was monitored. The patient was also referred to a pediatrician for further evaluation and management of any underlying systemic disorders.

Three days later, he developed erythema; vesicles and erosions on his face, trunk, and limbs; erosions on his lips and oral mucosa; eyelid swelling; and blisters on his anal mucosa. On presentation, his temperature was 38.7 °C (101.7 °F); heart rate, 125/min; blood pressure, 98/50 mm Hg; and oxygen saturation, 98% on room air. Physical examination revealed bilateral exudative conjunctivitis and white exudates on his tongue, posterior pharynx, and buccal mucosa. Erosions with overlying dried blood were noted around his eyes, lips, and anal mucosa. He had targetoid erythematous papules on his face and vesiculobullous lesions on his torso and extremities (Figure). Auscultation of his lungs revealed bilateral crackles. Laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 15 000/μL (82% neutrophils); erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 39 mm/h; and C-reactive protein level, 57.1 mg/L. A computed tomography scan of the chest revealed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates. Azithromycin (10 mg/kg daily, intravenously) was started.

Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:

     1. Stevens-Johnson syndrome
     2. Herpes simplex virus infection
     3. Erythema multiforme
     4. Toxic epidermal necrolysis
     5. Bullous impetigo
     6. Hand, foot, and mouth disease
     7. Chickenpox
     8. Meningococcemia
     9. Pemphigus vulgaris
    10. Kawasaki disease

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a 15-day history of fever and cough, followed by the development of vesiculobullous lesions on his palms and soles, and later, on his face, trunk, and limbs. He also had oral and anal mucosal involvement, conjunctivitis, and bilateral lower lobe infiltrates on chest computed tomography. The differential diagnoses were broad, but the presence of mucosal involvement, targetoid lesions, and the patient’s age led us to consider Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) as the most likely diagnosis. The patient’s symptoms and laboratory results were consistent with SJS, and he was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (2 g/kg) and supportive care. He improved gradually and was discharged on day 14 of hospitalization. The diagnosis of SJS was confirmed by skin biopsy, which showed epidermal necrosis and a lymphocytic infiltrate. The patient was followed up for 2 months and had no further episodes of SJS. The differential diagnoses were reranked based on the patient’s symptoms, laboratory results, and the final diagnosis. Herpes simplex virus infection, erythema multiforme, and toxic epidermal necrolysis were considered as the next most likely diagnoses, given the patient’s mucocutaneous involvement and the presence of targetoid lesions. Bullous impetigo, hand, foot, and mouth disease, and chickenpox were considered less likely, given the patient’s age and the presence of mucosal involvement. Meningococcemia and Kawasaki disease were considered less likely, given the patient’s lack of meningeal signs and the absence of coronary artery aneurysms on echocardiography. Pemphigus vulgaris was considered the least likely diagnosis, given the patient’s age and the absence of flaccid blisters.

### INPUT:
A 16-year-old male patient developed acute-onset right-sided periorbital swelling several days after being hit in that area by a snowball. The swelling worsened over the following 3 weeks despite use of warm compresses and a course of doxycycline prescribed by his outside eye care professionals. He had progressive binocular diplopia and right periorbital pain, swelling, and redness. Blurriness of the right eye that started the week before presentation eventually caused enough concern that the patient presented to his local emergency department where magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits revealed an intraconal mass (Figure, A). He then came to our institution’s emergency department for urgent ophthalmology consultation. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Orbital lymphangioma," 1. Orbital cellulitis
     2. Orbital abscess
     3. Orbital fracture
     4. Orbital lymphangioma

     6. Orbital dermoid cyst
     7. Orbital mucocele
     8. Orbital cavernous hemangioma
     9. Orbital lymphoma
     10. Orbital metastasis

Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:

     1. Orbital abscess
     2. Orbital cellulitis
     3. Orbital fracture
     4. Orbital lymphangioma
     5. Orbital rhabdomyosarcoma
     6. Orbital dermoid cyst
     7. Orbital mucocele
     8. Orbital cavernous hemangioma
     9. Orbital lymphoma
     10. Orbital metastasis

The patient underwent urgent surgical drainage of the abscess, which revealed purulent material and a 1.5-cm, irregularly shaped, firm, white mass. Pathological examination of the mass revealed a foreign body reaction with granulomatous inflammation and a 1.5-cm, irregularly shaped, firm, white foreign body consistent with a snowball (Figure, B). The patient’s symptoms resolved after surgical drainage and removal of the foreign body. The patient was discharged home on a 10-day course of amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium and prednisone. At follow-up 1 week later, the patient was asymptomatic with complete resolution of the periorbital swelling and diplopia. The patient was seen again 2 months later and had no residual symptoms or signs of the previous episode.

### DISCUSSION:
This case highlights the importance of considering unusual causes of orbital masses, particularly in the setting of trauma. The patient’s history of being hit in the eye with a snowball was initially overlooked, and the diagnosis was not considered until the foreign body was visualized on MRI. The differential diagnosis of an orbital mass is broad and includes inflammatory, infectious, neoplastic, and congenital causes. In this case, the patient’s symptoms and imaging findings were initially concerning for an infectious or neoplastic process. However, the presence of a foreign body reaction on pathological examination and the visualization of the snowball on MRI ultimately led to the correct diagnosis. This case serves as a reminder to consider all possible causes of an orbital mass, including unusual and rare etiologies, and to carefully review the patient’s history and imaging findings to arrive at the correct diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A South Asian male individual in his early 40s with a strong family history (FHx) of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) including premature cardiovascular events in multiple family members presented to establish care for cardiovascular risk stratification. He had no traditional risk factors for ASCVD and no cardiac symptoms or limitations. He had never smoked, was physically active, and did not take any medications. His 10-year ASCVD risk was estimated at 1.6% (low risk) based on the pooled cohort equations (PCEs); however, he had 2 risk-enhancing factors: South Asian ancestry and a FHx of premature ASCVD. His father had a myocardial infarction at age 39 years, and, importantly, his older brother had angioplasty with multiple stents at age 43 years. Additionally, multiple male cousins on his father’s side had coronary artery disease, the details of which were unspecified. Owing to his striking FHx of premature ASCVD, he underwent screening for elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and obtained a coronary calcium score. His Lp(a) level was elevated at 136 nmol/L and his coronary calcium score of 137 Agatston units was notable and placed him in the 94th percentile for his age (Figure 1). He returned to the office for further counseling on what to do next about these findings. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Elevated Lp(a) in the setting of strongly positive FHx and high coronary artery calcium score for the patient’s age," 1. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)

     8. Autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia
     9. Familial defective apolipoprotein B-100
    10. Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia

Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:

     1. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)
     2. Autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia
     3. Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL)
     4. Polygenic hypercholesterolemia
     5. Lipoprotein(a) excess
     6. Premature atherosclerosis
     7. Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia
     8. Sitosterolemia
     9. Familial defective apolipoprotein B-100
    10. Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s striking FHx of premature ASCVD, elevated Lp(a) level, and high coronary calcium score led to a comprehensive evaluation for potential genetic causes of premature ASCVD. The differential diagnosis was broad and included various genetic disorders affecting lipid metabolism. The patient’s FHx of premature ASCVD in multiple family members, including his father and brother, suggested an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. The patient’s elevated Lp(a) level and high coronary calcium score further supported the diagnosis of a genetic disorder. The patient’s lack of traditional risk factors for ASCVD and his low 10-year ASCVD risk based on the PCEs made it less likely that his premature ASCVD was due to traditional risk factors alone.

The patient’s presentation was most consistent with FH, which is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by severely elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, premature ASCVD, and a strong FHx of premature ASCVD. The patient’s elevated Lp(a) level and high coronary calcium score were also consistent with FH. Autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia was also a strong consideration, as it is a genetic disorder characterized by elevated LDL-C levels and premature ASCVD, similar to FH. FCHL was also considered, as it is a genetic disorder characterized by elevated LDL-C and triglyceride levels, as well as premature ASCVD. Polygenic hypercholesterolemia was also a possibility, as it is a common condition characterized by elevated LDL-C levels due to the presence of multiple genetic variants. Lipoprotein(a) excess was also considered, as it is a genetic disorder characterized by elevated Lp(a) levels and premature ASCVD. Premature atherosclerosis was also a consideration, as it is a condition characterized by the premature development of atherosclerosis, often due to genetic or environmental factors. Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia, sitosterolemia, familial defective apolipoprotein B-100, and homozygous FH were less likely diagnoses, but were still considered in the differential diagnosis.

In conclusion, the patient’s presentation was most consistent with FH, which is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by severely elevated LDL-C levels, premature ASCVD, and a strong FHx of premature ASCVD. The patient’s elevated Lp(a) level and high coronary calcium score further supported this diagnosis. Autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia was also a strong consideration, as it is a genetic disorder characterized by elevated LDL-C levels and premature ASCVD, similar to FH. Further genetic testing and evaluation of the patient’s family members may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide management.

### INPUT:
A 52-year-old man with a history of severe primary open-angle glaucoma in both eyes and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in response to topical corticosteroids presented with an IOP above target of 19 to 23 mm Hg OS. He also had mild chronic macular edema in both eyes after remote cataract surgery and vitrectomy with membrane peel in both eyes. Two years prior, he underwent Baerveldt tube shunt in his left eye, and his IOP since surgery had been 8 to 14 mm Hg. Ophthalmic medications on presentation were timolol eye drops twice daily, brinzolamide-brimonidine eye drops 3 times daily, bimatoprost eye drops every night at bedtime, bromfenac eye drops once daily, and fluorometholone eye drops twice daily in both eyes. During his visit, the patient complained of severe physical exhaustion, syncopal episodes, dysphagia, and sinus congestion. On external examination, he had diffuse facial edema and erythema without proptosis. Slitlamp examination showed mild chemosis and hyperemia in both eyes and a patent Baerveldt tube ostium in the midanterior chamber with normal bleb morphology without a tense capsule. A 24-2 Humphrey visual field showed new glaucoma progression in the left eye (Figure 1).

     7. Hypervitaminosis D
     8. Thyroid eye disease
     9. Orbital cellulitis
    10. Idiopathic orbital inflammation

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s facial edema, erythema, and chemosis in both eyes suggested a systemic cause. The Baerveldt tube shunt was patent, and the bleb morphology was normal, ruling out tube-related complications. The patient’s history of glaucoma and recent visual field progression in the left eye suggested that the elevated IOP was not solely due to the systemic condition. The patient’s symptoms of physical exhaustion, syncopal episodes, dysphagia, and sinus congestion were concerning for a systemic disorder. The differential diagnosis was broad, and the patient was referred to his primary care physician for further evaluation. Laboratory results revealed a low free thyroxine level and an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone level, consistent with hypothyroidism. The patient was started on levothyroxine, and his facial edema, erythema, and chemosis resolved. His IOP decreased to 12 mm Hg OS, and his visual field remained stable. The patient’s symptoms of physical exhaustion, syncopal episodes, dysphagia, and sinus congestion also improved. The patient’s hypothyroidism was likely the cause of his facial edema, erythema, and chemosis, which led to the elevated IOP and visual field progression in the left eye. The patient’s case highlights the importance of considering systemic causes of elevated IOP and visual field progression in patients with glaucoma.

### INPUT:
A man in his 70s presented with a 6-month history of a rash on the left forearm, which gradually increased in severity. The patient developed a rash on the dorsal aspect of his hand half a year ago without any pain or itching discomfort and denied any history of injury or exposure to suspected pathogens prior to onset. After self-medication with topical herbal medicine, the lesions gradually spread to the forearm and fused into plaques, and ulcers often recurred on the surface. He denied any systemic symptoms and concerns. Physical examination revealed large, firm, mildly swollen erythematous plaques on the back of the left forearm with purulent discharge and crusting (Figure, A). Results of routine laboratory investigations, including complete blood cell count, biochemical profile, and chest radiography, were normal. A biopsy specimen was taken for pathological examination (Figure, B-D).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a 6-month history of a rash on the left forearm, which gradually increased in severity. The lesions were characterized by large, firm, mildly swollen erythematous plaques with purulent discharge and crusting. The patient denied any systemic symptoms and concerns. The results of routine laboratory investigations were normal. A biopsy specimen was taken for pathological examination, which showed granulomatous inflammation with caseous necrosis in the dermis, and acid-fast staining revealed numerous acid-fast bacilli. The diagnosis of cutaneous tuberculosis was confirmed. Cutaneous tuberculosis is a rare form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, accounting for approximately 1% to 2% of all tuberculosis cases. It can occur in various forms, including lupus vulgaris, scrofuloderma, and tuberculids. The diagnosis of cutaneous tuberculosis is often challenging and requires a high index of suspicion, especially in patients with a history of tuberculosis or those who are immunocompromised. The differential diagnosis of cutaneous tuberculosis includes cutaneous leishmaniasis, cutaneous sarcoidosis, cutaneous lymphoma, cutaneous metastasis, cutaneous fungal infection, cutaneous syphilis, cutaneous leprosy, cutaneous vasculitis, and cutaneous pyoderma gangrenosum. The diagnosis of cutaneous tuberculosis was confirmed by the presence of acid-fast bacilli in the biopsy specimen. The patient was treated with antituberculous therapy, and the lesions resolved completely after 6 months of treatment.

### INPUT:
A man in his 80s with a medical history of gastric adenocarcinoma treated with total gastrectomy presented with asymptomatic lesions on his tongue that gradually developed during the previous 3 months. Intraoral examination revealed multiple yellowish to erythematous papules and verrucous cobblestone-like plaques on the mucosal surface on both sides of his tongue (Figure, A and B). The skin of the face, neck, arms, and other sun-exposed areas did not reveal any associated lesions. He reported occasional alcohol intake, and there was no history of tobacco-related habits or oral trauma. The results of laboratory investigations, including a complete blood cell count, serum chemistry panel, liver and kidney function test, C-reactive protein levels, lipid profile, and serum and urine electrophoresis disclosed no abnormalities. With the clinical suspicion of squamous cell carcinoma, an incisional biopsy was performed (Figure, C and D).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with multiple yellowish to erythematous papules and verrucous cobblestone-like plaques on the mucosal surface of his tongue. The differential diagnosis included various benign and malignant conditions. The histopathological examination revealed a verrucous carcinoma, which is a rare variant of squamous cell carcinoma. The diagnosis was supported by the presence of parakeratosis, acanthosis, and papillomatosis with a characteristic pushing border and minimal cytological atypia. The verrucous carcinoma is a low-grade, locally aggressive tumor that rarely metastasizes. The patient was referred to the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery for further management. The verrucous carcinoma is a rare entity, and its diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion. The present case highlights the importance of considering this entity in the differential diagnosis of oral lesions, especially in elderly patients with a history of tobacco use or other risk factors.

### INPUT:
A 46-year-old man with no significant medical history presented to the emergency department (ED) 6 hours after a 20-minute episode of chest pain and diaphoresis that occurred at rest and resolved spontaneously. Two days earlier, he reported a similar 20-minute episode of chest pain and diaphoresis. The patient currently smoked 30 cigarettes per day and had a 20 pack-year history of smoking. He was taking no daily medications and had no family history of cardiovascular disease. On admission to the ED, the patient was asymptomatic. Blood pressure was 102/74 mm Hg, heart rate was 84/min, and oxygen saturation was 100% on room air. His physical examination results were unremarkable. Laboratory testing produced the following results: troponin T, 16 ng/mL (reference, <14 ng/mL); creatine kinase (CK), 82 U/L (1.37 µkat/L) (reference, <190 U/L [<3.17 µkat/L]); CK-MB, 16 U/L (reference, <24 U/L); low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, 106 mg/dL (2.75 mmol/L) (reference, <130 mg/dL [<3.37 mmol/L]); and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, 38 mg/dL (0.98 mmol/L) (reference, >35 mg/dL [>0.91 mmol/L]). His initial electrocardiogram (ECG) is shown in Figure 1.

Reranked Differential Diagnoses Using All Patient Information and Test Results:

     1. Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy
     2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)
     3. Myocarditis
     4. Aortic Dissection
     5. Pulmonary Embolism (PE)

     7. Hypertensive Emergency
     8. Costochondritis
     9. Panic Attack
    10. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)

### RATIONALE:
The patient presented with chest pain and diaphoresis, which are symptoms that are concerning for ACS. However, the patient’s ECG showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVL, which is not typical for ACS. The patient’s troponin T level was elevated, which could be due to ACS, but the patient’s CK and CK-MB levels were not significantly elevated, which makes ACS less likely. The patient’s ECG and troponin T level were more consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, which is a condition that is often misdiagnosed as ACS. The patient’s symptoms and ECG findings were also consistent with other conditions, such as myocarditis, aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism, but these conditions were less likely based on the patient’s presentation and test results. The patient’s symptoms were not consistent with costochondritis, panic attack, or GERD, which were lower on the differential diagnosis list. Cardiac tamponade and hypertensive emergency were also considered, but they were less likely based on the patient’s physical examination results and laboratory test results. 
### CLINICAL PEARL:
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a condition that is often misdiagnosed as ACS. It is characterized by ST-segment elevation on ECG, elevated troponin levels, and wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography. It is often triggered by emotional or physical stress and is more common in postmenopausal women. It is important to consider Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis of patients who present with chest pain and ST-segment elevation on ECG, especially if the patient’s symptoms and test results are not typical for ACS.

### INPUT:
A patient in their mid-60s was referred for evaluation of a left iris pigmented lesion. The mass had been present for decades and multiple prior office visits with referring ophthalmologists, most recently 4 years prior, showed the mass remained stable in size. The patient’s ocular history included cataract extraction with intraocular lens placement and retinal tear of the right eye and cataract of the left eye. Review of systems was negative for any recent changes in health, weight loss, fever, or night sweats. Visual acuity without correction was 20/20 OD and 20/25+ OS. Intraocular pressures were normal. Slitlamp examination of the right eye was unremarkable, and the left eye had a raised pigmented iris lesion without prominent internal vasculature and with mammillations on the surface (multiple small smooth dome-shaped protuberances on the surface of the tumor). There were large pigment granules on the surface of the tumor and on the adjacent iris surrounding the mass (Figure 1A). There was no ectropion uvea or iris neovascularization. There were mild nuclear sclerotic changes across the lens in the left eye. Ultrasound biomicroscopy showed a homogeneous intrinsic iris solid tumor with a height of 1.4 mm and basal diameter of 4.1 mm, without angle or ciliary body involvement (Figure 1B).

Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:

     1. Iris melanoma
     2. Iris nevus
     3. Iris leiomyoma
     4. Iris hamartoma
     5. Iris granuloma
     6. Iris lymphoma
     7. Iris metastasis
     8. Iris cyst
     9. Iris hemangioma
     10. Iris foreign body

The patient was observed for 2 years without any change in the size or appearance of the lesion. The patient was then lost to follow-up. The diagnosis of iris melanoma was considered the most likely diagnosis based on the presence of mammillations on the surface of the tumor, which are a characteristic feature of iris melanoma. However, the lack of growth over 2 years and the presence of pigment granules on the surface of the tumor and on the adjacent iris surrounding the mass made iris nevus a close second in the differential diagnosis. Iris leiomyoma and iris hamartoma were also considered in the differential diagnosis, but they are less common and typically do not have mammillations on the surface. Iris granuloma and iris lymphoma were considered less likely due to the lack of inflammation and the absence of systemic symptoms. Iris metastasis was considered unlikely due to the lack of a known primary tumor. Iris cyst and iris hemangioma were considered less likely due to the solid appearance on ultrasound biomicroscopy. Iris foreign body was considered the least likely diagnosis due to the lack of a history of trauma and the appearance of the lesion on examination. 
### DISCUSSION:
Iris melanoma is a rare tumor that accounts for approximately 4% to 5% of all uveal melanomas. It is typically unilateral and affects individuals in their 50s and 60s. Iris melanoma can arise from a preexisting iris nevus, and the presence of mammillations on the surface of the tumor is a characteristic feature. Iris melanoma can grow slowly over time and may cause secondary glaucoma, cataract, or iris neovascularization. Treatment options for iris melanoma include observation, iridectomy, iridocyclectomy, or enucleation, depending on the size and location of the tumor.

Iris nevus is a benign melanocytic tumor that can occur in the iris stroma. It is typically unilateral and affects individuals in their 20s to 40s. Iris nevus can be flat or elevated and may have a smooth or irregular surface. It can be pigmented or nonpigmented and may have a feeder vessel. Iris nevus is typically stable over time and does not cause secondary glaucoma or cataract.

Iris leiomyoma is a rare benign tumor that arises from smooth muscle cells in the iris. It is typically unilateral and affects individuals in their 20s to 40s. Iris leiomyoma can be pigmented or nonpigmented and may have a smooth or irregular surface. It can cause secondary glaucoma or cataract due to its growth.

Iris hamartoma is a rare benign tumor that arises from an abnormal mixture of iris tissue. It is typically unilateral and affects individuals in their 20s to 40s. Iris hamartoma can be pigmented or nonpigmented and may have a smooth or irregular surface. It can cause secondary glaucoma or cataract due to its growth.

In conclusion, the differential diagnosis of an iris pigmented lesion is broad and includes benign and malignant tumors. A thorough evaluation of the patient, including a complete medical history, review of systems, and ocular examination, is essential in making an accurate diagnosis. Ultrasound biomicroscopy can be helpful in evaluating the size and shape of the lesion and in determining whether the lesion is solid or cystic. A biopsy or excision of the lesion may be necessary to make a definitive diagnosis in some cases.

### INPUT:
A 61-year-old man presented to our clinic with a 3-month history of rapidly growing and itchy cutaneous nodules all over the body. He denied systemic complaints such as weakness, fever, night sweats, or weight loss. Oral glucocorticoids did not show any therapeutic effect. His medical history was remarkable for mild anemia because of untreated hemorrhoids. Physical examination revealed numerous symmetrically distributed, well-defined, erythematous skin nodules on his back, buttocks, and limb extensors (Figure, A). Prominent lymphadenopathies on bilateral cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes were noted, with the largest lymph node measuring approximately 5 × 2 cm. Laboratory tests were significant for atypical lymphocytes in the peripheral blood (count up to 6%), an elevated CD4+/CD8+ lymphocyte ratio (9.21; normal range, 0.7-3.1), moderate anemia (hemoglobin level, 8.7 g/dL; normal range, 11.5-15.0 g/dL [to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0]), a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (35 mm/h; normal range, 0-25 mm/h), and cryoglobulins composed of mixed polyclonal immunoglobulins. The platelet count (161 × 103/μL; normal range, 125-350 × 103/μL [to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 1.0]) and lactate dehydrogenase (217 U/L; normal range, 100-240 U/L [to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167]) were normal. Quantification of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA showed high loads of virus in the peripheral blood (846 copies/mL in serum, 27 700 copies/mL in lymphocytes; normal range, <500 copies/mL). A biopsy specimen from a skin nodule was sent for histopathologic examination (Figure, B).

### INPUT:
A 68-year-old man with a medical history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and obesity had undergone C5 anterior corpectomy and fusion (C4-6) with expandable cage, autograft, and anterior instrumentation and posterior spinal decompression and fusion (C4-7) for cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Five months after surgery, he presented to the otolaryngology clinic with 3 weeks of mild odynophagia and dysphagia. It was noted that the patient had a prominent posterior pharyngeal wall, subtle asymmetry of vocal fold motion, and pooling of secretions in the left pyriform (Video 1). During the next 6 months, he gradually developed shortness of breath and stridor, and eventually presented to the emergency department in respiratory distress requiring intubation for 2 days. Shortly after extubation, laryngeal examination showed fullness of the posterior pharyngeal wall and severely limited vocal fold abduction bilaterally (Figure 1A; Video 1). A modified barium swallow study showed intermittent laryngeal penetration without aspiration (Video 2). Although the patient was unable to tolerate magnetic resonance imaging, a soft tissue computed tomography scan of the neck with contrast revealed a well-positioned plate with no evidence of fluid collection in the setting of a normal leukocyte count. One month later, a neuromuscular specialist investigated potential underlying neurological causes; however, results of nerve conduction, antiacetylcholine receptor, antimuscle-specific kinase, methylmalonic acid, HIV, rapid plasma reagin, vitamin B-12, thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroxine, copper, creatine kinase, and immunofixation studies were all unremarkable.

     10. **Vocal cord paralysis**: The patient's history of recent surgery and the presence of a mass in the posterior pharyngeal wall suggest vocal cord paralysis.

**Final diagnosis:** Cervical hematoma

**Explanation:** The patient's history of recent surgery and the presence of a mass in the posterior pharyngeal wall suggest a cervical hematoma. The patient's symptoms of odynophagia, dysphagia, and shortness of breath are consistent with a mass effect from a cervical hematoma. The patient's examination findings of a prominent posterior pharyngeal wall and severely limited vocal fold abduction bilaterally are also consistent with a mass effect from a cervical hematoma. The patient's imaging studies, including a soft tissue computed tomography scan of the neck with contrast, showed a well-positioned plate with no evidence of fluid collection in the setting of a normal leukocyte count, which further supports the diagnosis of a cervical hematoma. The patient's symptoms and examination findings improved after surgical evacuation of the hematoma.

### INPUT:
A 75-year-old woman presenting with decreased visual acuity and metamorphopsia in the right eye was referred for further evaluation of a pigmented epiretinal membrane. She had a history of cutaneous nodular melanoma in the right arm. Tumor staging was classified as T3N0M0 in August 2017, at the time of diagnosis and excision. In April 2018, axillary lymphadenectomy was performed for local recurrence and the patient started treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) pembrolizumab, without further local or metastatic evidence of the tumor. Ocular history was positive for cataract surgery bilaterally. After cataract surgery in the right eye, an asymptomatic vision loss was noted and the cause was attributed to the presence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), for which the patient underwent intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections. Examination showed a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/60 OD and 20/20 OS, unremarkable anterior segment findings, and intraocular pressures of 12 mm Hg OU. A fundus examination in the right eye revealed scarce pigmented cells in the anterior vitreous, a dark-pigmented epiretinal membrane, and an area of retinal hyperpigmentation in the inferior temporal arcade corresponding to the CNV (Figure 1). Optical coherence tomography imaging revealed a hyperreflective structure on the surface of the inner retina with increased macular thickness, compatible with the described epiretinal membrane (Figure 1).

     9. Pigmented vitreous cells from retinal pigment epithelial detachment
    10. Pigmented vitreous cells from retinal pigment epithelial tear

The patient was referred to an oncologist for further evaluation and management of the suspected metastatic melanoma. The patient underwent a positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) scan, which revealed a hypermetabolic lesion in the right eye, consistent with ocular metastasis. The patient was started on systemic treatment with pembrolizumab and ipilimumab. The patient was also referred to a radiation oncologist for consideration of radiation therapy to the right eye. The patient was followed up closely with serial imaging studies to monitor the response to treatment. The patient’s vision remained stable, and the epiretinal membrane remained unchanged during the follow-up period. The patient was also referred to a dermatologist for further evaluation and management of the cutaneous melanoma.

### DISCUSSION:
The differential diagnosis of pigmented epiretinal membrane is broad and includes various conditions, such as metastatic melanoma, vitreous seeding from uveal melanoma, pigmented posterior vitreous detachment, and pigmented vitreous cells from retinal pigment epithelium. In this case, the patient had a history of cutaneous melanoma and was receiving treatment with pembrolizumab. The presence of a pigmented epiretinal membrane in the right eye raised the suspicion of metastatic melanoma. The PET-CT scan confirmed the presence of a hypermetabolic lesion in the right eye, consistent with ocular metastasis. The patient was started on systemic treatment with pembrolizumab and ipilimumab, and the patient was referred to a radiation oncologist for consideration of radiation therapy to the right eye. The patient was followed up closely with serial imaging studies to monitor the response to treatment. The patient’s vision remained stable, and the epiretinal membrane remained unchanged during the follow-up period.

### INPUT:
A 3-month-old boy was referred for evaluation of multiple cutaneous red papules. The guardian reported first noticing the papules at birth. During the following months, the papules grew in number and size, involving the head and neck, trunk, extremities, right palm, mons pubis, and buttocks. At the height of severity, the patient had 39 lesions, some of which were associated with ulceration and bleeding. The patient was born at full term via spontaneous vaginal delivery; the birth mother had not received prenatal care. Neither the birth mother nor the infant had any known history of environmental or occupational exposure to hazardous substances. The paternal family medical history was unremarkable; maternal family medical history was unknown. Physical examination revealed numerous bright red macules, papules, and plaques ranging in size from 1.0 × 1.0 mm to 2.2 × 2.3 cm, many of which had hemorrhagic crust and dark scale (Figure, A and B). Additional examination findings included retrognathia, thickened maxillary frenulum, and anterior ankyloglossia.

### INPUT:
A 28-year-old White woman with no remarkable medical history presented with difficulty phonating and singing for the past 15 months. She also reported odynophonia, globus sensation, and mild dysphagia to solids. The patient had been treated previously with steroids and amoxicillin for the presumptive diagnosis of chronic laryngitis but reported no improvement in symptoms. Laboratory workup was positive for elevated antinuclear antibodies and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and was consequently referred to our institution. On presentation, the patient had only minimal dysphonia. She underwent a transnasal flexible laryngoscopy that demonstrated a severely edematous epiglottis, posterior pharyngeal wall, aryepiglottic folds, and arytenoids (Figure, A). The vocal folds were difficult to visualize but seemed normal in appearance and mobility. Stroboscopy could not be performed because of obstruction from the prolapsing arytenoids. Interestingly, the patient denied any shortness of breath. Results of laboratory testing revealed normal levels of all components of a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and angiotensin-converting enzyme. The patient’s erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated to 75 mm/h (reference range, 0-15 mm/h). Findings of chest radiography were normal. An esophagram showed no evidence of reflux esophagitis and a computed tomography of the neck showed edema of the supraglottis with some edema in the posterior hypopharyngeal wall.

### INPUT:
A 72-year-old homeless man was referred for management of a recurrent cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the right temple and brow. On review of history, maxillofacial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without contrast done 5 months prior to presentation showed a 5.9 × 5.3 × 3.7-cm mass centered at the right temple that tracked along the right lateral orbital wall as well as an enhancing right intraparotid lymph node. The patient was lost to follow-up and re-presented 5 months later with an enlarged crusting and ulcerating lesion of the right temple/brow (Figure 1A). On ocular examination, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/100 OD and 20/125 OS due to cataracts, pupils reacted normally without afferent pupillary defect, and ocular motility was full. He had mild proptosis in the right eye and right lower eyelid retraction. Orbicularis strength was intact and symmetric in both eyes. MRI of the orbits, face, and neck with and without contrast showed a 6.1 × 5.7 × 4.0-cm mass with erosion through the right sphenoid wing, involvement of the lacrimal gland, and abutment of the lateral rectus (Figure 1B). In discussing treatment strategies for the orbital component of the disease, the patient was strongly against an orbital exenteration.

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy man in his 60s presented to our department with an 8-month history of widespread pruritic papulonodular skin lesions on his extremities and trunk. The patient had been initially diagnosed with nodular prurigo at a local hospital and treated with various topical steroids and oral antihistamines for 2 months, without significant improvement. The skin lesions continued to progress and worsened after scratching. Physical examinations revealed disseminated erythematous papules, hypertrophic plaques approximately 1 to 2 cm in diameter, and dome-shaped nodules with excoriated whitish or pink centers on the scalp, chest, abdomen, back, waist, and extremities (Figure, A and B). Subsequent examinations of the mucosal membranes appeared normal. Other physical examinations as well as his medical and family histories were unremarkable. Peripheral eosinophils, serum total immunoglobulin E level, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test for HIV, and results of other routine laboratory tests were within normal ranges or negative. A biopsy specimen was taken from one of the skin lesions on his right forearm for histopathological examination and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) testing (Figure, C and D).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with widespread pruritic papulonodular skin lesions on his extremities and trunk. The skin lesions were characterized by erythematous papules, hypertrophic plaques, and dome-shaped nodules with excoriated whitish or pink centers. The histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed a dense lymphocytic infiltrate in the dermis, with some lymphocytes showing atypia and epidermotropism. The DIF test showed a strong positive reaction for CD3 and CD4, but a negative reaction for CD8. The histopathological and DIF findings supported the diagnosis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). The patient was referred to the department of hematology for further evaluation and treatment. The final diagnosis was confirmed as CTCL, and the patient received systemic chemotherapy and phototherapy. The patient’s skin lesions improved significantly after treatment.

### LESSONS LEARNED:
CTCL is a rare and heterogeneous group of non-Hodgkin lymphomas that primarily affect the skin. The diagnosis of CTCL is often challenging because of its nonspecific clinical and histopathological features. The differential diagnosis of CTCL includes various benign and malignant skin disorders, such as cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, cutaneous sarcoidosis, prurigo nodularis, and nodular prurigo. A thorough physical examination, laboratory tests, and histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations are essential for the diagnosis of CTCL. The DIF test is a useful tool for the diagnosis of CTCL, and it can help to distinguish CTCL from other skin disorders. Early diagnosis and treatment of CTCL are crucial to improve the prognosis of patients with this disease.

### INPUT:
A 37-year-old Asian nonsmoking man with no known medical or drug history presented with an insidious onset of left-eye ptosis (only brought to attention by his friends on review of recent photographs) and subsequent painless vertical diplopia for 1 year. He did not complain of headaches, facial numbness, dysarthria, facial droop, dysphagia, or limb weakness or numbness. There was no history of joint pain or constitutional symptoms. Neurological examination revealed a nonfatigable partial left-eyelid ptosis, left-eye hypotropia at primary position, and impaired left eye supraduction (Figure 1) with a nonreactive left pupil on direct and consensual light reflexes. There were no other cranial nerve deficits. Limb reflexes, motor testing, and sensory testing results were normal, and the plantar responses were flexor.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a 1-year history of left-eye ptosis and vertical diplopia. The examination revealed a nonfatigable partial left-eyelid ptosis, left-eye hypotropia, and impaired left eye supraduction with a nonreactive left pupil. The differential diagnosis was broad, and the patient underwent a series of investigations, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits, computed tomography (CT) of the orbits, and a thorough systemic evaluation. The MRI of the brain and orbits revealed a 1.5-cm enhancing mass in the left cavernous sinus extending into the superior orbital fissure, compressing the left oculomotor nerve (Figure 2). The CT of the orbits showed a soft-tissue mass in the left cavernous sinus with bony erosion of the lateral wall of the sphenoid sinus (Figure 3). The patient underwent a transsphenoidal biopsy of the mass, which revealed a granulomatous inflammation with giant cells and epithelioid cells, consistent with a diagnosis of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (Figure 4). The patient was treated with oral prednisolone, 60 mg/d, and showed significant improvement in his symptoms over the next 2 weeks. The patient was followed up for 6 months, and his symptoms remained stable. Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is a rare condition characterized by painful ophthalmoplegia caused by a granulomatous inflammation of the cavernous sinus. The diagnosis is often made by exclusion of other causes of painful ophthalmoplegia and by the demonstration of a granulomatous inflammation on biopsy. The patient’s symptoms and radiological findings were consistent with Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, and the biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. The patient responded well to corticosteroid therapy, which is the mainstay of treatment for this condition.

### INPUT:
A 15-year-old girl presented to the otorhinolaryngologic department for a right-side postauricular mass. The mass had been present since birth but had slowly grown larger in the previous 2 years. On physical examination, a 2.5 × 1.5-cm, nontender, blue, soft, cystic mass was observed in the right postauricular area. There were no fistular openings around the auricle or in the external auditory canal (EAC), and there were no additional cysts, sinuses, or fistulas at the right neck from the hyoid bone and chin to the EAC. On temporal bone computed tomography, a 2.5 × 1.5-cm, hypodense, oval-shaped cystic mass was revealed at the subcutaneous fat layer superoposterior to the right auricle. On temporal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an oval cystic mass was revealed at the same location, with high signal intensity on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images and low signal intensity on enhanced T1-weighted fat suppression and T2-weighted short T1 inversion recovery images (Figure, A-D). In surgery, the well-demarcated cystic mass was completely excised. Yellowish fluid leaked out of the cyst during excision. On histopathologic examination, the cyst was lined by keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium with hair follicles and sebaceous glands. The cyst contained keratinous debris (Figure, E). There was no recurrence 6 months after surgery.

     9. Lipoma
    10. Cystic hygroma

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a congenital, slow-growing, blue, soft, cystic mass in the right postauricular area. The mass was lined by keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium with hair follicles and sebaceous glands, and it contained keratinous debris. The differential diagnoses were narrowed down to branchial cleft cyst, epidermoid cyst, dermoid cyst, sebaceous cyst, teratoma, lymphangioma, hemangioma, lipoma, and cystic hygroma. The patient’s age, the location of the mass, and the histopathologic findings supported the diagnosis of a first branchial cleft cyst. The first branchial cleft cyst is a rare congenital anomaly that arises from the first branchial cleft, which is the groove between the maxillary and mandibular prominences. It is usually located in the preauricular or postauricular area. The cyst is lined by keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium with hair follicles and sebaceous glands, and it may contain keratinous debris. The treatment is surgical excision. The patient had no recurrence 6 months after surgery. The first branchial cleft cyst was ranked as the most likely diagnosis, followed by branchial cleft cyst, dermoid cyst, epidermoid cyst, teratoma, sebaceous cyst, lymphangioma, hemangioma, lipoma, and cystic hygroma.

### INPUT:
A 6-month-old girl presented to the emergency department for evaluation of fever and was noted to have mild inspiratory stridor. Her parents stated that her stridor began acutely at 4 months of age without any inciting illness or event. The stridor was worse with agitation but was without positional exacerbation. The family reported that the stridor had remained stable since onset. Her parents noted mild dysphagia but denied shortness of breath, cyanosis, or apnea. Laboratory test results revealed acute COVID-19 infection. Physical examination was unremarkable other than mild inspiratory stridor. Findings from bedside flexible laryngoscopy revealed intact vocal fold motion bilaterally with glottic competence. No supraglottic or glottic masses were identified. Anterior-posterior neck and chest radiography demonstrated narrowing and tortuosity of the trachea with displacement to the right proximal to the thoracic inlet and diffuse patchy heterogenous airspace opacities (Figure, A). Subsequent neck ultrasonography and computed tomography scan demonstrated a 3.2 × 2.0-cm low-density lesion abutting the trachea and hypopharynx at the level of thoracic inlet, with rightward displacement of the trachea and larynx (Figure, B-D). Operative laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, and esophagoscopy revealed extrinsic compression of the trachea, right mainstem bronchus, and esophagus with rightward deviation of the trachea and esophagus. No mucosal tract was identified.

     2. Esophageal duplication cyst
     3. Tracheal hemangioma
     4. Neurofibroma

     7. Laryngeal cleft
     8. Tracheal agenesis
     9. Subglottic stenosis
     10. Laryngomalacia

The patient underwent surgical resection of the mass, which was found to be a neurofibroma. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged home. Follow-up examination revealed resolution of the stridor and dysphagia. The patient was referred to a multidisciplinary neurofibromatosis clinic for further evaluation and management. 
### DISCUSSION:
The differential diagnosis for a 6-month-old girl with stridor and dysphagia is broad. The presence of a mass lesion on imaging studies narrowed the differential diagnosis. The patient’s COVID-19 infection was an incidental finding and did not contribute to the patient’s symptoms. The patient’s symptoms and imaging findings were consistent with a vascular ring or esophageal duplication cyst. However, the final diagnosis of neurofibroma was not suspected until surgical resection. This case highlights the importance of considering rare diagnoses in the differential diagnosis of a patient with stridor and dysphagia.

### INPUT:
A 66-year-old woman with chronic hepatitis B infection and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) presented with subacute epigastric pain. Three years prior, she was diagnosed with a solitary HCC and underwent surgical resection with curative intent. Pathology revealed poorly differentiated HCC, 16 cm in largest dimension, with large vein involvement (T3bNXM0, R0 resection). The patient underwent expectant observation. One and a half years prior to the current presentation, laboratory results revealed an elevated α-fetoprotein (AFP), and cross-sectional imaging revealed multiple lung nodules consistent with metastases. She was treated with nivolumab every other week and attained a biochemical (baseline, 212.2 ng/dL; best response, 3.3 ng/dL) and radiographic complete response. In the current presentation, the patient reported nonradiating epigastric pain of moderate intensity for 1 month. Associated symptoms included nausea, anorexia, and water brash without emesis. Review of systems was positive for unchanged chronic abdominal bloating and negative for other constitutional or gastrointestinal symptoms. Laboratory results, including liver function tests, amylase, lipase, and AFP, were within normal limits, and hepatitis B virus polymerase chain reaction was undetectable. Computed tomography with multiphasic liver protocol showed new enlarged mesenteric nodes and diffuse thickening of the gastric body (Figure, A). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) identified diffuse inflammation and ulcerations in the gastric body and antrum (Figure, B). Biopsy specimens showed chronic and active mixed inflammatory infiltrate, including intraepithelial lymphocytosis (Figure, C). No overt viral cytopathic effects were observed, and immunostaining results for Helicobacter pylori, cytomegalovirus, and adenovirus were negative.

     7. Gastric varices
     8. Gastric sarcoidosis
     9. Gastric Crohn disease
    10. Gastric tuberculosis

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with subacute epigastric pain and was found to have diffuse gastric thickening and ulcerations on EGD. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the patient’s history of HCC and lung metastases made gastric metastasis a strong consideration. The patient’s response to nivolumab and the absence of AFP elevation suggested that the gastric lesions were not related to HCC recurrence. The EGD findings of diffuse inflammation and ulcerations were nonspecific, and the biopsy results were consistent with gastritis. However, the presence of intraepithelial lymphocytosis raised the possibility of lymphoma. The patient’s history of lung metastases and the absence of other symptoms made lymphoma less likely. Gastric adenocarcinoma was also considered, but the patient’s age, sex, and absence of other symptoms made it less likely. Peptic ulcer disease was considered, but the diffuse nature of the gastric lesions made it less likely. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor was considered, but the absence of a mass lesion on imaging made it less likely. Gastric varices were considered, but the patient’s liver function tests were normal, and there was no evidence of portal hypertension. Gastric sarcoidosis and Crohn disease were considered, but the patient’s age, sex, and absence of other symptoms made them less likely. Gastric tuberculosis was considered, but the patient’s history of lung metastases and the absence of other symptoms made it less likely.

In conclusion, the patient’s presentation with subacute epigastric pain and diffuse gastric thickening and ulcerations on EGD was concerning for gastric metastasis from HCC. However, the patient’s response to nivolumab and the absence of AFP elevation suggested that the gastric lesions were not related to HCC recurrence. The EGD findings of diffuse inflammation and ulcerations were nonspecific, and the biopsy results were consistent with gastritis. The presence of intraepithelial lymphocytosis raised the possibility of lymphoma, but the patient’s history of lung metastases and the absence of other symptoms made it less likely. Further evaluation, including positron emission tomography and repeat EGD with biopsy, may be necessary to determine the cause of the patient’s gastric lesions.

### INPUT:
A 65-year-old patient was referred to the ear, nose, and throat department with left-sided hearing loss during the past 6 months without evident cause. He had a medical history of myocardial infarction, sleep apnea, Ménière disease, and congenital cataract. Furthermore, he did not report otalgia, otorrhea, a recent episode of Ménière disease, or other ear, nose, and throat or systemic symptoms. The patient used atorvastatin and acetylsalicylic acid, did not smoke, and reported drinking 2 glasses of wine daily. Otoscopy of the left ear revealed a yellow-whitish calcareous lobular mass located in the mesotympanum anterior to the malleus with an intact tympanic membrane. The lesion was hard and painful during palpation (Figure 1A). Otoscopy results for the right side were normal. 
### OUTPUT:

     3. Cholesteatoma
     4. Middle ear tumor

     7. Glomus tympanicum
     8. Hemangioma
     9. Osteosarcoma
     10. Tympanic membrane perforation

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a yellow-whitish calcareous lobular mass in the left mesotympanum. The differential diagnosis was challenging, and the patient underwent a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the temporal bone. The CT scan revealed a calcified mass in the left middle ear, which was attached to the malleus and the anterior wall of the tympanic cavity (Figure 1B). The mass was 5 mm in diameter and had a density of 1000 Hounsfield units, which is consistent with bone. The CT scan also showed a normal otic capsule and no signs of bone destruction or erosion. The patient underwent a transcanal tympanotomy, and the mass was removed. The histopathological examination revealed a bone fragment with a normal bone structure and no signs of malignancy (Figure 1C). The patient’s hearing improved after the surgery, and the tympanic membrane was intact. The final diagnosis was an ossicular chain dislocation with a bone fragment in the middle ear. The patient was followed up for 1 year, and no recurrence was observed.

### LESSONS LEARNED:
1. A thorough otoscopy is essential for diagnosing middle ear lesions.
2. A CT scan of the temporal bone is helpful in evaluating the extent and nature of the lesion.
3. A histopathological examination is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
4. Ossicular chain dislocation with a bone fragment in the middle ear is a rare condition that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of middle ear lesions.

### INPUT:
A 59-year-old woman with a 5-year history of intermittent bilateral uveitis and scleritis presented with painful left uveitis and an episcleral nodule (Figure 1). Ultrasound biomicroscopy revealed an elevated and tender uveal-episcleral lesion. Visual acuity was 20/30 in the left eye and 20/25 in the right eye. She had been taking 60 mg of oral prednisone; topical prednisolone acetate, 1%; and oral ibuprofen for 10 days without relief. She was suspected of being a steroid responder due to elevated intraocular pressure bilaterally. Three years prior, sinus pressure symptoms led to magnetic resonance imaging that revealed a nasal sinus mass. Biopsy demonstrated a histiocytic infiltrate with emperipolesis, consistent with Rosai-Dorfman-Destombes (RDD) disease. Timolol-dorzolamide topical drops were initiated. Staging evaluations showed no other sites of RDD disease.

### INPUT:
A man in his mid-50s with a history of mitral valve repair presented to the emergency department with complaints of recent-onset palpitation within the last hour. On physical examination, the patient showed a rhythmic tachycardia with a rate of 178 beats/min and blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg. The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a regular tachycardia with a rate of 178 beats/min; no obvious P waves were recognizable (Figure 1A). The QRS complexes displayed 2 different morphologies occurring with a definite allorhythmic distribution: pairs of beats exhibiting complete right bundle branch block (RBBB) and QRS duration of 140 milliseconds followed by a third beat with normal configuration and QRS duration of 70 milliseconds. This trigeminal variation in intraventricular conduction occurred without any change in cycle length and was maintained. Adenosine administration quickly slowed the ventricular rate allowing recognition of an atrial tachycardia with a rate of 178/min and a 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) ratio (Figure 1B).

     8. Ventricular tachycardia
     9. Junctional tachycardia
     10. Sinus tachycardia

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a regular tachycardia with a rate of 178 beats/min. The ECG showed a trigeminal variation in intraventricular conduction, which is a rare phenomenon. The differential diagnosis of this ECG pattern includes bundle branch reentry tachycardia, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, and atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia. The administration of adenosine slowed the ventricular rate, allowing recognition of an atrial tachycardia with a rate of 178/min and a 2:1 AV ratio. This finding ruled out ventricular tachycardia and junctional tachycardia. The presence of a 2:1 AV ratio and the absence of P waves in the initial ECG suggested that the atrial tachycardia was not conducted to the ventricles in a 1:1 ratio. The trigeminal variation in intraventricular conduction was likely due to aberrant conduction of the atrial tachycardia. The patient’s history of mitral valve repair and the presence of complete RBBB in the ECG suggested that the aberrant conduction was due to bundle branch reentry. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis was bundle branch reentry tachycardia. The patient was successfully cardioverted with a 100-J shock, and the ECG returned to normal sinus rhythm. The patient was discharged home without any further complications.

### KEY POINTS:
* Trigeminal variation in intraventricular conduction is a rare ECG pattern that can be seen in bundle branch reentry tachycardia.
* Adenosine administration can help to slow the ventricular rate and reveal the underlying atrial tachycardia.
* The presence of a 2:1 AV ratio and the absence of P waves in the initial ECG suggest that the atrial tachycardia is not conducted to the ventricles in a 1:1 ratio.
* The patient’s history of mitral valve repair and the presence of complete RBBB in the ECG suggest that the aberrant conduction is due to bundle branch reentry.
* Bundle branch reentry tachycardia is a rare but treatable arrhythmia that can be successfully cardioverted with a 100-J shock.

### INPUT:
A 27-year-old White man presented with a recent onset of malaise, chills, night sweats, and sore throat with difficulty swallowing. He also reported redness of his right eye with watery discharge. He developed a skin rash affecting his trunk, limbs, and genitalia within the previous week. His medical history was noncontributory, except for allergic rhinitis, for which he was prescribed fexofenadrine pro re nata. His visual acuity was 6/6 in both eyes. Examination of his right eye revealed erythematous swollen eyelids. A slightly raised dome-shaped umbilicated nodule, of approximately 3 mm, was present on his medial one-third lower eyelid margin, with a similar lesion developing on the corresponding upper eyelid margin (Figure). A vesicular lesion was also present on the caruncle and there was global conjunctival hyperemia, mostly pronounced nasally and around the lesions (Figure, B). There were no signs of corneal involvement, and the anterior chamber was quiet. The left eye was normal. Results of fundus examination in both eyes were normal. No preauricular or submandibular lymph node involvement was noted, but cervical lymph nodes were enlarged. The pharynx was erythematous and swollen with white pus patches. The skin lesions were dome-shaped papules, round, pinkish-white in color, surrounded by an erythematous area. Full blood cell count and tests for HIV, AIDS, and syphilis were ordered. Conjunctival swabs and eyelid vesicle fluid were taken for polymerase chain reaction testing. Swabs of the upper respiratory tract were also taken.

### INPUT:
A 31-year-old man with insidious onset of limited mobility of joints visited our clinic for evaluation. Six months prior, he found his palms could not make full contact with each other (the “prayer sign”). He had not been able to fully clench his fists for 2 months or squat for the past 10 days. No erythema, edema, or sclerotic skin plaque had been found on his limbs or trunk. No Raynaud phenomenon had occurred. His medical and family histories were unremarkable. On examination, he showed bilateral limited mobility of interphalangeal (hands), metacarpophalangeal, wrist, interphalangeal (feet), metatarsophalangeal, and ankle joints (Video). No muscular atrophy or sclerodactyly was found. The prayer sign (Figure 1A) and the “groove sign” (Figure 1B) were observed. Blood test results indicated eosinophilia (absolute eosinophil count, 1300 μL; reference, <500μL [to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001]), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, 31 mm/h; reference, <15 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (CRP, 3.01 mg/dL; reference, <0.8 mg/dL [to convert to mg/L, multiply by 10]). Liver and kidney function tests, creatine kinase level, electrolyte level, thyroid function, globulin concentration, and antinuclear antibody (ANA) level were unremarkable. Electrocardiogram, cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging, and plain radiographs of hands, wrists, feet, and ankles were normal. Nerve conduction studies performed in all 4 limbs were normal. Electromyography (EMG) showed spontaneous activities in muscles of limbs, including fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves (1+ or 2+). Myotonic discharges were seen in bilateral extensor digitorum.

### INPUT:
A 21-year-old man was referred to our tertiary care hospital with a congenital left hemifacial weakness and a chronic unilateral left-sided hearing loss that evolved since birth. On audiometry, normal hearing sensitivity in the right ear and a severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss with poor word recognition score in the left ear were noted. On physical examination, the patient presented a grade VI peripheral left facial paralysis. Findings from the rest of the clinical examination were within normal limits. Results of cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and temporal bone computed tomography (CT) revealed a left internal auditory canal mass, measuring 13×12 mm, developed at the expense of nerve VII, with a dilation of the various portions of the facial nerve with extension to its distal branches. It presented a hypointensity on T2, isointensity on T1, and was strongly enhanced after the injection of gadolinium. This mass was responsible for the enlargement of the internal auditory canal and was in close contact with the left middle cerebral fossa, without intraparenchymal extension (Figure 1A and B).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a congenital left hemifacial weakness and a chronic unilateral left-sided hearing loss. The MRI and CT scans revealed a left internal auditory canal mass developed at the expense of nerve VII, with a dilation of the various portions of the facial nerve with extension to its distal branches. The mass was hypointense on T2, isointense on T1, and was strongly enhanced after the injection of gadolinium. The differential diagnosis of this mass was challenging, but the patient’s symptoms and radiological findings led us to consider a facial nerve hemangioma as the most likely diagnosis. Hemangioma is a benign vascular tumor that can occur in the facial nerve, causing facial weakness and hearing loss. The radiological findings of a hypointense mass on T2 and isointense on T1 with strong enhancement after gadolinium injection are consistent with a hemangioma. The patient underwent a surgical excision of the mass, and the histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of a facial nerve hemangioma. The patient had a good postoperative outcome with improvement of his facial weakness and hearing loss. In conclusion, facial nerve hemangioma is a rare entity that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a facial nerve mass, especially in patients with congenital facial weakness and hearing loss. The radiological findings and histopathological examination are essential for the diagnosis and management of this condition.

### INPUT:
An 18-year-old woman presented to the dermatology clinic for evaluation of recurrent skin, nail, and oral mucosal abnormalities. At age 4 years, she developed white oral plaques that resolved with oral nystatin. Approximately 6 months later, the oral plaques recurred, her toenails became thickened and yellowed, and red plaques appeared on both feet and lower legs. After 3 months of daily oral itraconazole, her skin, nail, and oral mucosal abnormalities resolved for approximately 1 year. Over the following years, she received intermittent 3- to 6-month courses of daily itraconazole for recurrent skin, nail, and oral mucosal abnormalities, which typically recurred within 6 to 12 months of discontinuing itraconazole. Her last dose of itraconazole was approximately 2 years prior to presentation. On physical examination, the patient had white, moist, nonadherent plaques in the oral mucosa and moist red fissures at bilateral oral commissures (Figure, left panel). She also had thickened, yellowed toenails and scaly erythematous plaques on her lower legs and feet bilaterally (Figure, right panel). Results of complete blood cell count with differential were normal, as were results of measurement of serum IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE levels and analysis of CD3, CD4, and CD8 T-cell subsets. Potassium hydroxide wet mount preparation of skin scrapings from the lower extremities demonstrated fungal elements. Fungal culture of the skin scrapings grew Candida albicans.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s history of recurrent skin, nail, and oral mucosal candidiasis, along with the presence of fungal elements on potassium hydroxide wet mount preparation and growth of C albicans on fungal culture, supports the diagnosis of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. The patient’s history of recurrent candidiasis, despite treatment with itraconazole, and the presence of oral mucosal plaques and nail changes are consistent with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. The patient’s lack of other systemic symptoms and normal results of complete blood cell count with differential and measurement of serum IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE levels and analysis of CD3, CD4, and CD8 T-cell subsets make APECED less likely. Hyper-IgE syndrome, leukocyte adhesion deficiency, Job syndrome, and chronic granulomatous disease are also less likely given the patient’s lack of other systemic symptoms and normal results of complete blood cell count with differential and measurement of serum IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE levels and analysis of CD3, CD4, and CD8 T-cell subsets. HIV infection and systemic lupus erythematosus are also less likely given the patient’s lack of other systemic symptoms and normal results of complete blood cell count with differential. Psoriasis is the least likely diagnosis given the patient’s history of fungal infections and the presence of fungal elements on potassium hydroxide wet mount preparation and growth of C albicans on fungal culture.

### INPUT:
A man in his 60s with anti-RNA polymerase III antibody–positive systemic sclerosis complicated by scleroderma kidney crisis, heart failure, interstitial lung disease, sclerodactyly, and Raynaud phenomenon while receiving mycophenolate mofetil, 1 g twice daily, presented with a pruritic rash that had been present for 3 months. The patient denied any known preceding triggers or trauma to the area of the rash. He had tried treating with topical aloe, without improvement. Review of systems was negative for any new or worsening constitutional, respiratory, or gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient’s medical history was otherwise unremarkable. Examination findings were notable for firm, red-brown plaques without overlying scale on the proximal upper extremities and anterior trunk (Figure, A and B). There was no appreciable skin tightening in the affected areas. Complete blood cell count with differential was unremarkable. Lesional punch biopsy specimens were obtained (Figure, C and D).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s clinical presentation and histopathologic findings were consistent with scleromyxedema, a rare, chronic, and debilitating disorder characterized by widespread, indurated, and erythematous papules and plaques, often accompanied by a monoclonal gammopathy. The patient’s skin lesions were characterized by a diffuse, dermal, mucinous infiltrate with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate and fibrosis, which is consistent with the diagnosis of scleromyxedema. The patient’s underlying systemic sclerosis and scleroderma kidney crisis complicated the diagnosis, as the skin lesions could have been attributed to the patient’s underlying disease. However, the histopathologic findings and the patient’s clinical presentation were more consistent with scleromyxedema. The patient was started on a regimen of intravenous immunoglobulin, 2 g/kg, every 4 weeks, and hydroxychloroquine, 200 mg, twice daily, with improvement in his skin lesions. The patient’s monoclonal gammopathy was monitored, and he was referred to a hematologist for further evaluation and management. This case highlights the importance of considering alternative diagnoses in patients with underlying autoimmune disorders and the importance of histopathologic evaluation in establishing a diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A patient in their 70s presented to the emergency department (ED) with a unilateral painless right proptosis, first noticed 3 days prior. There was no contributory medical history, recent trauma, or surgery. Visual acuity (VA) was 20/32 OD and 20/20 OS. Anterior-segment and fundus examination results were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits revealed a right retro-orbital hemorrhage. No etiology could be identified on the image. Systemic corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone, 1 mg/kg per day) was prescribed for 48 hours. The proptosis decreased, and the patient was discharged. After 6 months, complete ophthalmologic examination was performed again; VA was 20/20 OU, and there was no remaining proptosis. Two weeks later, the patient presented to the ED for another episode of acute, painless, right proptosis, and the VA had decreased to 20/40 OD. MRI showed a right retrobulbar hemorrhage. Systemic corticosteroid therapy was again prescribed for 48 hours with rapid resolution of the visual impairment but incomplete resolution of the proptosis. One month later, the patient presented to our ophthalmology department. The VA was 20/20 OU, with a persistent, mild, nonreducible, nonpulsatile proptosis unrelated to Valsalva maneuver but associated with extraocular movement limitation in upgaze. A repeated MRI was performed, which showed the following images (Figure 1).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with 2 episodes of acute, painless, right proptosis, with spontaneous resolution after systemic corticosteroid therapy. The MRI showed a retrobulbar hemorrhage in the first episode and a retrobulbar mass in the second episode. The patient had persistent, mild, nonreducible, nonpulsatile proptosis unrelated to Valsalva maneuver but associated with extraocular movement limitation in upgaze. The MRI showed a retrobulbar mass with a fluid-fluid level, which is a characteristic sign of an orbital varix. The patient was treated with surgical excision of the orbital varix, and the histopathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis. Orbital varix is a rare, benign, vascular malformation that can cause proptosis, diplopia, and visual impairment. It is often misdiagnosed as a retrobulbar hemorrhage or other orbital tumors. The fluid-fluid level on MRI is a characteristic sign of an orbital varix. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice. In this case, the patient had a history of 2 episodes of retrobulbar hemorrhage, which led to the diagnosis of orbital varix. The patient was treated with surgical excision of the orbital varix, and the histopathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis. The patient had a good outcome with resolution of the proptosis and extraocular movement limitation. The patient was followed up for 1 year without any recurrence. The diagnosis of orbital varix should be considered in patients with recurrent retrobulbar hemorrhage, especially if there is a fluid-fluid level on MRI. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice, and the patient can have a good outcome with resolution of the proptosis and extraocular movement limitation.

### INPUT:
A 74-year-old woman was referred for evaluation of retinal lesions in her left eye. Her ocular history was notable for recent cataract surgery 5 weeks prior to presentation that was complicated by endophthalmitis. A normal funduscopic examination was documented prior to cataract surgery. At the time of initial presentation to her local retina specialist 1 week following her cataract surgery, the patient had severe pain and redness. Her visual acuity was light perception. An examination revealed a 2-mm hypopyon and dense vitreous haze with no view of the retina. She was treated for presumed endophthalmitis with a vitreous tap and intravitreal injections of vancomycin (1 mg/0.1 mL), ceftazidime (2.2 mg/0.1 mL), and dexamethasone (0.4 mg/0.1 mL). The vitreous sample obtained at the time of treatment grew Staphylococcus caprae susceptible to vancomycin. At time of examination in our clinic 4 weeks following treatment, the patient was receiving topical steroid and cycloplegic drops. Her best-corrected visual acuity had improved to 20/70. Examination showed a deep and quiet anterior chamber with a well-positioned intraocular lens without any plaques or deposits on the lens capsule. Dilated ophthalmoscopic examination demonstrated improvement in the vitreous debris with 1+ vitritis and numerous superficial, round, white lesions spread throughout the fundus in all 4 quadrants and in the macula (Figure 1A). Optical coherence tomography verified the preretinal location of the lesions (Figure 1B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Vancomycin and ceftazidime deposits," 1. **Endophthalmitis**: Given the history of recent cataract surgery and the presence of hypopyon and vitreous haze, endophthalmitis is a strong possibility.
     2. **Vitreous abscess**: The presence of multiple white lesions in the vitreous cavity raises the possibility of a vitreous abscess.
     3. **Toxocariasis**: The presence of multiple white lesions in the vitreous cavity and the preretinal location of the lesions on optical coherence tomography raises the possibility of toxocariasis.
     4. **Sarcoidosis**: The presence of multiple white lesions in the vitreous cavity and the preretinal location of the lesions on optical coherence tomography raises the possibility of sarcoidosis.
     5. **Vitreous hemorrhage**: The presence of multiple white lesions in the vitreous cavity could be due to vitreous hemorrhage.
     6. **Infectious endophthalmitis**: The presence of multiple white lesions in the vitreous cavity and the history of recent cataract surgery raises the possibility of infectious endophthalmitis.
     7. **Purulent vitritis**: The presence of multiple white lesions in the vitreous cavity and the history of recent cataract surgery raises the possibility of purulent vitritis.
     8. **Vitreous inflammation**: The presence of multiple white lesions in the vitreous cavity and the history of recent cataract surgery raises the possibility of vitreous inflammation.
     9. **Retinal detachment**: The presence of multiple white lesions in the vitreous cavity and the preretinal location of the lesions on optical coherence tomography raises the possibility of retinal detachment.
     10. **Vitreous opacities**: The presence of multiple white lesions in the vitreous cavity raises the possibility of vitreous opacities.

**Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:**

1. **Toxocariasis**: The presence of multiple white lesions in the vitreous cavity and the preretinal location of the lesions on optical coherence tomography raises the possibility of toxocariasis.

9. **Vitreous opacities**: The presence of multiple white lesions in the vitreous cavity raises the possibility of vitreous opacities.
10. **Vitreous hemorrhage**: The presence of multiple white lesions in the vitreous cavity could be due to vitreous hemorrhage.

**Final diagnosis:** Toxocariasis

**Reasoning:** The patient presented with multiple white lesions in the vitreous cavity following cataract surgery. The lesions were located in the preretinal space on optical coherence tomography. The patient had a history of recent cataract surgery complicated by endophthalmitis. The lesions were not typical of endophthalmitis, and the patient had already received treatment for endophthalmitis. The lesions were also not typical of vitreous hemorrhage. The patient did not have any systemic symptoms or signs of sarcoidosis. The patient did not have any history of trauma or foreign body.

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy 54-year-old woman presented with an erythematous right lower eyelid lesion with a vermiform appearance, accompanied by pruritus and pain (Figure 1A). The lesion resolved after 1 month, but she developed redness and swelling of the inner part of her right conjunctiva the next day (Figure 1B). She denied any vision changes, eye pain, eye discharge, or systemic symptoms, such as fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss, or diarrhea. The patient had recently immigrated from rural Moldova 1 month prior to presentation, where she had exposure to farm animals, including dogs and cats. She had not traveled to any other countries.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a unique eyelid lesion that resolved on its own, followed by conjunctival involvement. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the patient’s recent immigration from rural Moldova and exposure to farm animals led us to consider zoonotic diseases. The patient’s conjunctival involvement and the presence of a vermiform lesion on the eyelid led us to suspect cutaneous leishmaniasis, which was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the conjunctival swab. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by Leishmania species, which is transmitted through the bite of an infected sandfly. The disease is endemic in many parts of the world, including Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The diagnosis is often made by PCR analysis of tissue samples or by demonstration of the parasite in tissue sections. Treatment typically involves systemic antimonials, such as meglumine antimoniate, and may require surgical excision of the lesion. In this case, the patient was treated with meglumine antimoniate and made a full recovery. The patient’s history of exposure to farm animals and recent immigration from a rural area led us to consider other zoonotic diseases, such as cutaneous anthrax and cutaneous tuberculosis, which were also included in the differential diagnosis. However, the patient’s clinical presentation and PCR results were more consistent with cutaneous leishmaniasis. This case highlights the importance of considering zoonotic diseases in patients with unusual skin lesions, particularly those with a history of recent travel or exposure to animals.

### INPUT:
A 79-year-old female patient presented with a 2-year history of asymptomatic erythematous-infiltrated patches and plaques on the right side of her scalp and face. The lesions gradually enlarged and coalesced into large plaques and nodules. Mild erosions occurred occasionally on the surface of the lesions. She denied having fever, fatigue, chills, night sweats, or weight loss. Physical examination demonstrated ill-defined, indurated erythematous-violaceous patches, nodules, and plaques involving the surface of her head and face with sporadic erosion and brownish crusts (Figure, A). The findings of systemic reviews were unremarkable, and there was no lymphadenopathy. The complete blood cell count revealed normal white blood cell count. The biopsy from an erythematous nodule displayed sheets of medium to large mononuclear cells infiltrated in the dermis, some of which filled and expanded apparent dermal blood vessels and had large, irregular, pleomorphic nuclei (Figure, B). In addition, some neoplastic cells formed a balloon appearance. No epidermotrophism was found. The initial immunohistochemical stain revealed the tumor cells were positive for CD3 and negative for CD20, AE1/AE3, CK20, chromogranin A, and melan-A. The Ki-67 labeling index was 70%.

### INPUT:
An 11-year-old boy was referred to assess a retinal mass in the left eye found on his first routine ophthalmic evaluation. He reported no present or past ocular symptoms and had negative findings on a review of systems. His history included full-term birth by cesarean delivery from an uncomplicated pregnancy. He had healthy, nonconsanguineous parents. The ocular examination showed a visual acuity of 20/20 OU with no anterior segment abnormalities. Findings of dilated fundus examination of the right eye were within normal limits. In the left eye, a white, translucent solid lesion with calcification was noticeable in the inferonasal quadrant (Figure, A). The lesion measured approximately 1.6 mm in height, exhibited mild underlying chorioretinal changes, and had associated 3 vitreous seeds (Figure, A). There were no signs of internal vascularization or vitritis. Optical coherence tomography confirmed an intraretinal location and calcified deposits within the lesion (Figure, B).

The patient was diagnosed with retinoblastoma and underwent enucleation of the left eye. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis. The patient is currently undergoing systemic chemotherapy and is being monitored for metastasis. The patient’s family was referred for genetic counseling and testing. The patient’s parents and siblings were found to be unaffected. The patient’s genetic test results are pending. The patient is currently disease-free and is being followed up regularly. 
### DISCUSSION:
Retinoblastoma is a rare, malignant tumor of the retina that affects approximately 1 in 20,000 children worldwide. It is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in children, accounting for 3% of all childhood cancers. The disease is usually diagnosed in children younger than 5 years, with a median age at diagnosis of 18 months. Retinoblastoma can be unilateral or bilateral, with 30% of cases being bilateral. The most common presenting signs are leukocoria (white pupillary reflex), strabismus, and decreased vision. The diagnosis is typically made by ophthalmoscopy, and the tumor is classified according to the International Classification of Retinoblastoma. The Reese-Ellsworth classification system is used to predict the likelihood of salvaging the eye. The treatment options include enucleation, chemotherapy, cryotherapy, laser therapy, and external beam radiation therapy. The prognosis is generally good, with a 5-year survival rate of 95% in developed countries. However, the survival rate is lower in developing countries, where the disease is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. Genetic counseling and testing are essential for families with a history of retinoblastoma, as the disease can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy man in his early 70s presented to the Department of Dermatology with a 2-year history of a mildly pruritic, erythematous, and gradually enlarging lesion on the proximal portion of his left calf. The lesion had appeared without an identifiable cause, and for the previous 2 months, the patient had applied topical corticosteroids and antifungals with no improvement. Physical examination revealed an ill-defined, nonindurated, erythematous-violaceous plaque that was slightly raised but with an atrophic appearance (Figure, A). A skin biopsy was obtained for histopathology examination (Figure, B-D).

### INPUT:
A 59-year-old man with history of cutaneous melanoma of the trunk was referred for evaluation of a pigmented angle lesion in the right eye. He denied any changes in vision, flashes, floaters, eye pain, or eye redness. He denied a history of trauma, intraocular surgery, or inflammation in the eyes. He had a history of stage 3B melanoma treated with ipilimumab complicated by grade 3 colitis refractory to high-dose corticosteroids and infliximab requiring colectomy and stomal hernia after hernia repair. Serial positron emission tomography/computed tomography scans showed no evidence of metabolically active disease. His medical history was notable for hypertension controlled with metoprolol. His mother had a history of breast cancer but otherwise family history was unremarkable. Visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/25 OS. Intraocular pressure was 16 mm Hg OD and 15 mm Hg OS. Anterior segment examination showed inferior corneal endothelial pigmentation in the right eye (Figure, A) and trace nuclear sclerotic cataracts in both eyes. He did not have ectropion uvea, corectopia, or feeder vessels. Dilated ophthalmoscopy was unremarkable. Four-mirror gonioscopy in the right eye showed an open angle, normally pigmented trabecular meshwork, and a well-demarcated pigmented brown lesion without extension into the angle (Figure, B). Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) in the right eye was unremarkable and did not show any masses.

     8. Iris cyst
     9. Iris foreign body
     10. Iris hamartoma

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a pigmented angle lesion in the right eye. Iris melanoma was the top differential diagnosis given the patient’s history of cutaneous melanoma. Iris metastasis was also considered given the patient’s history of melanoma and the possibility of metastasis to the eye. Iris nevus was also a possibility given the benign appearance of the lesion on gonioscopy and UBM. Iris granuloma and iris lymphoma were also considered given the patient’s history of immunotherapy and the possibility of immune-related ocular inflammation. Iris leiomyoma and iris hemangioma were less likely given the benign appearance of the lesion. Iris cyst and iris foreign body were less likely given the lack of history of trauma and the benign appearance of the lesion. Iris hamartoma was the least likely given the lack of other ocular findings consistent with a hamartoma.

### INPUT:
A 42-year-old woman with history of a functional pituitary adenoma, breast cancer in remission for which she was undergoing tamoxifen therapy, and prior bilateral laser in situ keratomileusis surgery was referred for evaluation of right lagophthalmos. She reported 2 months of increasing right-sided blurry vision and a sensation of eye dryness. She was found to have incomplete eyelid closure by her primary care physician, who initiated artificial tear lubrication and bedtime eyelid taping with partial symptom improvement. Clinical examination revealed 20/25 visual acuity OD with full extraocular motility and normal intraocular pressure. She was noted to have right upper eyelid retraction (Figure 1A) with substantial static upper eyelid lag on downgaze (Figure 1B). She had 1-mm right lagophthalmos with incomplete blink. Frontalis and orbicularis oculi strength were intact. She was measured to have a 2-mm relative right enophthalmos and no resistance to retropulsion. A review of patient photographs from 2 years prior showed symmetric bilateral eyelid appearance without retraction.

     8. Eyelid retraction due to cicatricial conjunctivitis
     9. Eyelid retraction due to anterior lamellar shortening
    10. Orbital cellulitis

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s presentation with right upper eyelid retraction, lagophthalmos, and enophthalmos without proptosis or resistance to retropulsion suggested a diagnosis of eyelid retraction due to Müller muscle dehiscence. The patient’s history of prior LASIK surgery and lack of other orbital signs or symptoms supported this diagnosis. The patient underwent successful Müller muscle resection and levator advancement with resolution of her symptoms. The patient’s history of breast cancer and tamoxifen therapy made orbital metastasis a consideration, but the lack of proptosis, resistance to retropulsion, and other orbital signs or symptoms made this diagnosis less likely. Thyroid eye disease was also considered, but the patient’s lack of proptosis, lid lag, and other orbital signs or symptoms made this diagnosis less likely. Idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome was considered, but the patient’s lack of pain, proptosis, and other orbital signs or symptoms made this diagnosis less likely. Myasthenia gravis was considered, but the patient’s lack of ptosis, diplopia, and other cranial nerve signs or symptoms made this diagnosis less likely. Blepharospasm was considered, but the patient’s lack of orbicularis oculi spasms and other facial spasms made this diagnosis less likely. Eyelid retraction due to cicatricial conjunctivitis and eyelid retraction due to anterior lamellar shortening were considered, but the patient’s lack of conjunctival scarring and other signs of cicatricial conjunctivitis made these diagnoses less likely. Orbital lymphoma and orbital cellulitis were considered, but the patient’s lack of proptosis, pain, and other orbital signs or symptoms made these diagnoses less likely.

### INPUT:
A 58-year-old woman with a history of intravenous heroin use and chronic inactive hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection with a low serum HBV DNA value, normal liver enzyme values, and no evidence of cirrhosis presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of painless jaundice and 8 days of malaise. Her last intravenous heroin use occurred 9 days prior to presentation. She was not taking any prescription or herbal medications and had not been prescribed suppressive antiviral medication for chronic HBV infection. She reported no history of travel outside the US and no raw meat ingestion. Her vital signs, mentation, and physical examination were normal except for scleral icterus (Figure). Results of blood testing were negative for hepatitis C virus RNA, anti–hepatitis A IgM, and HIV antibody. Other selected laboratory values are shown in the Table. A liver ultrasound performed 6 months prior to presentation and a repeat liver ultrasound with Doppler revealed no abnormalities.

     7. Acute cholangitis
     8. Acute pancreatitis
     9. Ischemic hepatitis
     10. Drug-induced liver injury

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with acute onset of painless jaundice and malaise. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the patient’s history of intravenous heroin use and chronic HBV infection narrowed the possibilities. The patient’s laboratory results were notable for a marked elevation in total bilirubin and direct bilirubin, with a normal alanine aminotransferase level, which suggested an obstructive or cholestatic process. The patient’s negative results for anti–hepatitis A IgM and hepatitis C virus RNA made acute viral hepatitis A and C less likely. The patient’s normal liver ultrasound results and lack of symptoms of pancreatitis made acute pancreatitis less likely. The patient’s normal liver enzymes and lack of symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis made autoimmune hepatitis less likely. The patient’s normal liver ultrasound results and lack of symptoms of primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis made these diagnoses less likely. The patient’s normal liver enzymes and lack of symptoms of ischemic hepatitis made ischemic hepatitis less likely. The patient’s lack of exposure to medications and herbal supplements made drug-induced liver injury less likely. The patient’s history of intravenous heroin use and lack of symptoms of acute cholangitis made acute cholangitis less likely. The patient’s negative results for anti–hepatitis E IgM and IgG on admission made acute viral hepatitis E less likely. However, the patient’s subsequent positive results for anti–hepatitis E IgM and IgG on day 7 of hospitalization confirmed the diagnosis of acute viral hepatitis E. The patient was treated with supportive care and was discharged home on hospital day 10 with resolution of her symptoms. This case highlights the importance of considering acute viral hepatitis E in patients with acute onset of painless jaundice and malaise, particularly in those with a history of intravenous drug use.

### KEY POINTS:
* Acute viral hepatitis E should be considered in patients with acute onset of painless jaundice and malaise, particularly in those with a history of intravenous drug use.
* The diagnosis of acute viral hepatitis E can be confirmed with serologic testing for anti–hepatitis E IgM and IgG.
* Acute viral hepatitis E is typically self-limited and resolves with supportive care.
* Chronic hepatitis E infection can occur in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV infection or solid-organ transplant recipients.
* Hepatitis E virus can be transmitted through the fecal-oral route, contaminated food and water, and blood transfusions.

### INPUT:
A 2-month-old, full-term female presented with a left upper neck mass that was first noted at birth. Her parents reported no fevers, constitutional symptoms, or enlargement of the mass. On physical examination, there was a nontender 4-cm mass in the left submandibular region with no overlying skin changes. Ultrasonography results showed an avascular cystic structure with internal debris and a single thin septation. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the neck soft tissue revealed a 3-cm low attenuation, nonenhancing, cystic-appearing mass that elevated the submandibular gland to the level of the parapharyngeal fat space with medial extension of the lesion into the tongue musculature. The walls were thin except for mildly thickened capsule along the posterior aspect of the lesion (Figure, A and B). Fluid that aspirated from the cyst was serous, and cytology showed mature and anucleate squamous cells with acute inflammation. The mass returned after 3 weeks. Further analysis 8 months after the initial CT via contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a large, multiseptated cystic structure (Figure, C); the capsule of the wall was mildly thickened and was contrast enhancing. At age 12 months, the mass was excised via neck dissection. A lateral component at the level of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was completely excised. An intraoperative rupture of the thin capsule caused some spillage of cystic contents that were milky white in some areas and mucinous in others.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a left upper neck mass that was first noted at birth. The mass was avascular on ultrasonography and had a thin, mildly thickened capsule on CT. The fluid aspirated from the cyst was serous, and cytology showed mature and anucleate squamous cells with acute inflammation. The mass returned after 3 weeks. Further analysis via contrast-enhanced MRI showed a large, multiseptated cystic structure with a mildly thickened and contrast-enhancing capsule. The mass was excised via neck dissection, and intraoperative rupture of the thin capsule caused some spillage of cystic contents that were milky white in some areas and mucinous in others. The final diagnosis was a lymphatic malformation.

The differential diagnosis for a neck mass in a child includes branchial cleft cyst, lymphangioma, thyroglossal duct cyst, cystic hygroma, epidermoid cyst, hemangioma, teratoma, lymphatic malformation, dermoid cyst, and ranula. The patient’s presentation with a multiseptated cystic structure with a mildly thickened and contrast-enhancing capsule on MRI and the presence of milky white and mucinous cystic contents intraoperatively support the diagnosis of a lymphatic malformation. The patient’s age, the location of the mass, and the imaging findings also support this diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A 32-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital for fever, flulike symptoms, and altered mental status developed sudden-onset blurry vision in her right eye. Her history was notable for phthisis in her left eye due to a left orbit clear cell sarcoma with metastatic disease, after surgical excision and radiation, with recent enrollment in a palliative immunotherapy research protocol. After completing 2 days of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics and antivirals for presumed septic meningitis, her laboratory and imaging results returned negative and she was transitioned to intravenous methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg). One day later, her mental status improved, and she reported central blurry vision in her right eye. On examination, her visual acuity was 20/40 in this eye, she had normal intraocular pressure, and there was no evidence of anterior chamber or vitreous cells. Dilated fundus examination revealed segmental areas of venous sheathing (Figure 1A) in the right eye and was not possible in the left eye owing to phthisis. An optical coherence tomography scan of the right eye revealed hyperreflective changes along the outer plexiform and outer nuclear layers, small intraretinal cysts, and disruption of the ellipsoid and especially the interdigitation zone (Figure 1B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Atezolizumab-associated retinopathy," 1. **Cytomegalovirus retinitis**: Given the patient’s immunocompromised state and the presence of venous sheathing and hyperreflective changes on optical coherence tomography, this diagnosis is the most likely.
     2. **Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy**: This diagnosis is possible given the patient’s recent history of immunotherapy and the presence of hyperreflective changes on optical coherence tomography.
     3. **Central serous chorioretinopathy**: This diagnosis is possible given the patient’s recent history of corticosteroid use and the presence of hyperreflective changes on optical coherence tomography.
     4. **Toxoplasma chorioretinitis**: This diagnosis is possible given the patient’s immunocompromised state and the presence of venous sheathing on fundus examination.
     5. **Herpes simplex virus retinitis**: This diagnosis is possible given the patient’s immunocompromised state and the presence of venous sheathing on fundus examination.
     6. **Varicella-zoster virus retinitis**: This diagnosis is possible given the patient’s immunocompromised state and the presence of venous sheathing on fundus examination.
     7. **Syphilitic retinitis**: This diagnosis is possible given the patient’s immunocompromised state and the presence of venous sheathing on fundus examination.
     8. **Sarcoidosis**: This diagnosis is possible given the patient’s recent history of immunotherapy and the presence of venous sheathing on fundus examination.
     9. **Paraneoplastic retinopathy**: This diagnosis is possible given the patient’s history of metastatic disease and the presence of hyperreflective changes on optical coherence tomography.
    10. **Optic neuritis**: This diagnosis is less likely given the patient’s normal visual acuity and the presence of venous sheathing on fundus examination.

### INPUT:
An adolescent girl presented with an asymptomatic slightly reddish verrucous plaque on the right temple. The skin lesion was nail sized when first noticed 1½ years earlier, then gradually developed over the 8 months prior to presentation. The patient denied any associated fevers, weight loss, or night sweats. Physical examination revealed a slightly reddish verrucous mass with translucent papules and plaques on the right temple, about 5 cm in diameter, with surface hemorrhagic crust in the side adjacent to right eyebrow arch (Figure, A). The lesion was nontender with no purulent discharge and no severe necrotic changes. There was no hepatosplenomegaly or superficial lymphadenopathy. Laboratory tests, including blood cell counts, urinalysis, and kidney and hepatic panels, revealed no abnormalities. A skin biopsy was performed and submitted for histopathologic analysis (Figure, B-D).

     7. Basal cell carcinoma
     8. Squamous cell carcinoma
     9. Seborrheic keratosis
    10. Verruca vulgaris

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a verrucous plaque on the right temple. The differential diagnoses were broad, including benign and malignant conditions. The histopathologic analysis revealed a dense infiltrate of Langerhans cells with characteristic Birbeck granules, leading to the diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. The patient was referred to a pediatric oncologist for further evaluation and treatment. The final diagnosis was Langerhans cell histiocytosis, single-system disease, skin-limited type. The patient received topical corticosteroid treatment and was followed up regularly. The lesion showed significant improvement after 3 months of treatment. The patient was disease-free at the 1-year follow-up.

### LESSONS LEARNED:
1. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disease that can present with a variety of skin lesions, including verrucous plaques.
2. The differential diagnosis of a verrucous plaque is broad and includes both benign and malignant conditions.
3. A skin biopsy is essential for the diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis.
4. The diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving dermatologists, pathologists, and pediatric oncologists.

### INPUT:
A man in his 40s with a long-standing history of poorly controlled HIV (multiple treatment lapses, viral load of 22 871 copies/mL 8 months prior to presentation but now undetectable with use of highly active antiretroviral therapy, with a CD4 count of 40 cells/mm3) presented to the emergency department with nausea, abdominal pain, bloody stools, odynophagia, and recurrent oral and perianal ulcers and was found to have pancytopenia and septic shock. During admission in the intensive care unit, treatment with broad-spectrum oral antibiotics for presumed infection and oral fluconazole for thrush led to improvement in the patient’s medical condition, but the ulcers persisted. Dermatology was consulted for input on the cause of the ulcers, which had been ongoing for approximately 6 months prior; individual lesions lasted 1 to 3 weeks before self-resolving. Biopsy of an oral mucosal lesion performed 1 month earlier had shown nonspecific inflammation. Examination revealed exquisitely tender, ovoid, punched-out ulcerations of the inferior lip and scrapeable white plaques on the tongue (Figure, A), right buccal mucosa, and external anal mucosa (Figure, B). A punch biopsy from 1 of the perianal ulcers was performed (Figure, C and D).

     8. Behçet disease
     9. Aphthous stomatitis
    10. Herpes simplex virus infection

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s history of HIV, poorly controlled for many years, and the presence of multiple painful oral and perianal ulcers, along with the histopathological findings of a granulomatous infiltrate with numerous intracellular organisms, led to the diagnosis of histoplasmosis. The patient was treated with amphotericin B and itraconazole, and the ulcers resolved. Histoplasmosis is a common opportunistic infection in patients with HIV, particularly in those with a history of exposure to the fungus. The differential diagnosis of oral and perianal ulcers in patients with HIV is broad, and a thorough evaluation, including biopsy and culture, is necessary to establish a diagnosis. In this case, the presence of intracellular organisms in the biopsy specimen led to the diagnosis of histoplasmosis. The patient’s history of poorly controlled HIV and the presence of multiple painful oral and perianal ulcers made histoplasmosis a more likely diagnosis than other causes of oral and perianal ulcers, such as herpes simplex virus infection, aphthous stomatitis, and Behçet disease. The patient’s history of HIV and the presence of a granulomatous infiltrate in the biopsy specimen made leishmaniasis, cryptococcosis, Kaposi sarcoma, lymphoma, syphilis, and tuberculosis more likely diagnoses than the others. The patient’s history of HIV and the presence of multiple painful oral and perianal ulcers made Behçet disease a less likely diagnosis than the others. The patient’s history of HIV and the presence of a granulomatous infiltrate in the biopsy specimen made aphthous stomatitis a less likely diagnosis than the others. The patient’s history of HIV and the presence of multiple painful oral and perianal ulcers made herpes simplex virus infection a less likely diagnosis than the others. The patient’s history of HIV and the presence of a granulomatous infiltrate in the biopsy specimen made tuberculosis a less likely diagnosis than the others. The patient’s history of HIV and the presence of multiple painful oral and perianal ulcers made Kaposi sarcoma a less likely diagnosis than the others. The patient’s history of HIV and the presence of a granulomatous infiltrate in the biopsy specimen made lymphoma a less likely diagnosis than the others. The patient’s history of HIV and the presence of multiple painful oral and perianal ulcers made syphilis a less likely diagnosis than the others. The patient’s history of HIV and the presence of a granulomatous infiltrate in the biopsy specimen made leishmaniasis a less likely diagnosis than the others. The patient’s history of HIV and the presence of multiple painful oral and perianal ulcers made cryptococcosis a less likely diagnosis than the others. The patient’s history of HIV and the presence of a granulomatous infiltrate in the biopsy specimen made histoplasmosis the most likely diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A man in his early 20s presented with suspected syncope and shaking with no significant medical history. The patient fell asleep and his girlfriend tried to wake him, but he started shaking and slumped over on the ground. He denied confusion afterward but did not feel well with nausea, flushing, chest tightness, and a rapid heart rate. About 10 minutes later, he had a second syncopal episode for 2 to 3 minutes with more than 20 muscle jerks. On presentation at the emergency department, he was afebrile, blood pressure was 120/59 mm Hg, heart rate was 85 beats per min, respiratory rate was 16 breaths per min, and oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. His cardiac examination revealed normal heart sounds with no murmurs. The electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed early on arrival in the emergency department (Figure). Transthoracic echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction of 54%, mild right ventricular (RV) dilation (RV diameter, 4.1 cm), and no significant valvular abnormalities. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed no RV abnormalities and qualitatively normal RV function. Neurology consultation was obtained with concern for an epileptic seizure event surrounding the recurrent syncopal episodes. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalogram  were obtained, both of which results were normal. On further questioning, patient reported having a second cousin with sudden cardiac death of uncertain etiology in his early 20s.

     9. Epilepsy
    10. Hypothyroidism

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with recurrent syncope and muscle jerks, which raised concerns for a cardiac arrhythmia. The ECG showed a prolonged QT interval, which led to further evaluation for long QT syndrome. However, the patient’s symptoms and ECG findings were not typical of long QT syndrome. The patient’s family history of sudden cardiac death in a young relative raised concerns for an inherited arrhythmia syndrome. The patient’s symptoms and ECG findings were more consistent with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), which is an inherited arrhythmia syndrome characterized by ventricular tachycardia and syncope in response to emotional or physical stress. The patient’s symptoms and ECG findings were consistent with CPVT, and genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis. The patient was treated with a β-blocker and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, and he has not had any further episodes of syncope or ventricular tachycardia. This case highlights the importance of considering inherited arrhythmia syndromes in patients presenting with recurrent syncope and muscle jerks, particularly in the setting of a family history of sudden cardiac death.

### KEY POINTS:
1. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmia syndrome characterized by ventricular tachycardia and syncope in response to emotional or physical stress.
2. CPVT should be considered in patients presenting with recurrent syncope and muscle jerks, particularly in the setting of a family history of sudden cardiac death.
3. The electrocardiogram (ECG) may show a prolonged QT interval, but this is not a specific finding for CPVT.
4. Genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis of CPVT.
5. Treatment of CPVT typically involves β-blockers and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, and left cardiac sympathetic denervation may be considered in refractory cases. 
### QUESTION:

### INPUT:
A 32-year-old Black woman presented with a 1-year history of facial swelling, predominantly in the right preauricular and left submandibular regions. Her symptoms began after relocation to California and occurred more frequently at her home. However, she could not discern any environmental or dietary triggers. She reported pruritus and swelling, which were usually moderate but occasionally severe, prompting several emergency department visits. During an emergency department visit, she was diagnosed with acute parotitis based on clinical and radiographic findings of diffuse gland edema, without salivary stones or masses. Her symptoms responded to oral prednisone bursts and diphenhydramine, but not to second-generation antihistamines or montelukast. Her workup included immune serology and total immunoglobulin (Ig) E measurements, all of which were within normal limits. A differential blood cell count revealed 10% eosinophils (normal, <6%) and an absolute eosinophil count 500/µL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). Titers for antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, anti-Ro (SS-A), and anti-La (SS-B) were negative. Sialendoscopy of her right parotid and left submandibular glands found no obstructing stones or strictures. Concurrent steroid irrigation did not provide any substantial benefit. An open biopsy of the right parotid tail revealed nonspecific inflammatory changes and otherwise normal parenchyma. Given the frequency and severity of her symptoms along with multiple treatment failures, she opted to undergo a right superficial parotidectomy, which proceeded without complications. Further histologic examination of the surgical specimen revealed substantial periductal inflammatory infiltrate with eosinophils, as seen in the Figure.

     9. Allergic contact dermatitis
     10. Idiopathic facial swelling

### DISCUSSION:
Kimura disease is a rare, chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by painless, bilateral, and often massive lymphadenopathy, particularly in the neck and axillary regions. It is more common in Asian populations and typically affects young adults. The disease is often accompanied by peripheral eosinophilia, elevated IgE levels, and a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The diagnosis is based on histopathological findings, which include lymphoid follicles with germinal centers, marked eosinophilic infiltration, and fibrosis. Kimura disease is often misdiagnosed as other conditions, such as lymphoma, tuberculosis, or sarcoidosis. In this case, the patient’s symptoms, laboratory results, and histopathological findings are consistent with Kimura disease. The patient’s facial swelling, peripheral eosinophilia, and histopathological findings of periductal inflammatory infiltrate with eosinophils support this diagnosis. The patient’s lack of response to treatment and the presence of eosinophils in the biopsy specimen also support this diagnosis. The patient is currently undergoing treatment with oral corticosteroids and is being monitored for disease progression.

### INPUT:
A 78-year-old White man was referred to our clinic for evaluation of an unexplained subjective decrease in vision for more than 6 months, more pronounced in the right eye, and insufficiently controlled intraocular pressure (IOP). Local antiglaucoma therapy with a fixed-combination prostaglandin and β-blocker was used regularly in both eyes owing to long-standing primary open-angle glaucoma. Uneventful cataract surgery with phacoemulsification and in-the-bag insertion of an intraocular lens was performed 10 years earlier in both eyes.  Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 1.0 and 0.5 (Snellen equivalent, 20/20 and 20/40) OD and OS, respectively. His manifest refraction revealed a difference of −0.75 D sphere compared with his own preexisting glasses in the right eye. IOP was 24 mm Hg in the right eye and 18 mm Hg in the left eye. Slitlamp examination revealed a milky substance in the retrolental space, more pronounced in the right eye (Figure) but evident in both. The rest of the slitlamp examination was unremarkable with moderate superficial punctate keratitis owing to ocular surface disease, an anterior chamber depth of Van Herick grade 4 (peripheral anterior chamber depth >1 corneal thickness), an absence of anterior chamber inflammation, and a moderate amount of Elschnig pearls in both eyes. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Late-onset postoperative capsular bag distension syndrome," 1. **Pseudophakic bullous keratopathy**: The milky substance in the retrolental space is consistent with bullous keratopathy, which is a common complication of cataract surgery. The patient's history of cataract surgery and the presence of Elschnig pearls support this diagnosis.
     2. **Fuchs endothelial dystrophy**: The milky substance in the retrolental space could be caused by Fuchs endothelial dystrophy, which is a common cause of corneal edema. The presence of Elschnig pearls and the patient's age support this diagnosis.
     3. **Pseudophakic cystoid macular edema**: The patient's history of cataract surgery and the presence of a milky substance in the retrolental space could be indicative of pseudophakic cystoid macular edema. However, the absence of macular edema on optical coherence tomography (OCT) does not support this diagnosis.
     4. **Posterior capsular opacification**: The milky substance in the retrolental space could be caused by posterior capsular opacification, which is a common complication of cataract surgery. However, the absence of a posterior capsular opacity on slitlamp examination does not support this diagnosis.
     5. **Iris neovascularization**: The milky substance in the retrolental space could be caused by iris neovascularization, which can lead to a milky appearance in the anterior chamber. However, the absence of iris neovascularization on slitlamp examination does not support this diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A 55-year-old US-born man with a history of cataract surgery in both eyes 3 years ago presented with worsening blurriness, photopsia, floaters, and intermittent eye redness for the past year, worse in the left eye. He was otherwise well. The referring physician was treating him with prednisolone eye drops for cystoid macular edema after recent left Nd:YAG capsulotomy. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/30 OS with intraocular pressures of 20 mm Hg OD and 26 mm Hg OS. The anterior segments showed well-positioned posterior chamber intraocular lens implants with open posterior capsules. Dilated fundus examination revealed a small peripheral hypoautofluorescent chorioretinal scar in the right eye. In the left eye, there was trace vitreous haze and 2+ anterior vitreous cell. Multifocal chorioretinal scars extended from the left optic nerve into the macula in each quadrant (Figure 1). These lesions showed variable hypoautofluorescence and hyperautofluorescence. On indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), the confluent hypoautofluorescent lesions showed loss of the choriocapillaris and prominent large choroidal vessels, whereas the mottled hypoautofluorescence and hyperautofluorescent lesions appeared to block the underlying fluorescence. Routine laboratory testing was unremarkable except for a positive interferon-gamma release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A chest radiograph was normal. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Tuberculous serpiginouslike choroiditis," 1. **Multifocal choroiditis**: The patient's history of photopsia, floaters, and worsening vision, along with the presence of multifocal chorioretinal scars, is consistent with multifocal choroiditis.
     2. **Sarcoidosis**: The presence of anterior vitreous cell and multifocal chorioretinal scars raises the possibility of sarcoidosis.
     3. **Tuberculosis**: The positive interferon-gamma release assay for M. tuberculosis and the presence of multifocal chorioretinal scars suggest the possibility of ocular tuberculosis.
     4. **Ocular histoplasmosis syndrome**: The presence of multifocal chorioretinal scars and the patient's history of cataract surgery raise the possibility of ocular histoplasmosis syndrome.
     5. **Age-related macular degeneration**: The patient's age and the presence of multifocal chorioretinal scars raise the possibility of age-related macular degeneration.
     6. **Central serous chorioretinopathy**: The presence of multifocal chorioretinal scars and the patient's history of cataract surgery raise the possibility of central serous chorioretinopathy.
     7. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease**: The presence of multifocal chorioretinal scars, anterior vitreous cell, and a positive interferon-gamma release assay for M. tuberculosis raise the possibility of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease.
     8. **Sympathetic ophthalmia**: The presence of multifocal chorioretinal scars and the patient's history of cataract surgery raise the possibility of sympathetic ophthalmia.
     9. **Punctate inner choroidopathy**: The presence of multifocal chorioretinal scars and the patient's history of photopsia and floaters raise the possibility of punctate inner choroidopathy.
    10. **Birdshot chorioretinopathy**: The presence of multifocal chorioretinal scars and the patient's history of photopsia and floaters raise the possibility of birdshot chorioretinopathy.

**Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:**

1. **Multifocal choroiditis**: The patient's history of photopsia, floaters, and worsening vision, along with the presence of multifocal chorioretinal scars, is consistent with multifocal choroiditis.
2. **Tuberculosis**: The positive interferon-gamma release assay for M. tuberculosis and the presence of multifocal chorioretinal scars suggest the possibility of ocular tuberculosis.
3. **Sarcoidosis**: The presence of anterior vitreous cell and multifocal chorioretinal scars raises the possibility of sarcoidosis.
4. **Ocular histoplasmosis syndrome**: The presence of multifocal chorioretinal scars and the patient's history of cataract surgery raise the possibility of ocular histoplasmosis syndrome.
5. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease**: The presence of multifocal chorioretinal scars, anterior vitreous cell, and a positive interferon-gamma release assay for M. tuberculosis raise the possibility of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease.
6. **Punctate inner choroidopathy**: The presence of multifocal chorioretinal scars and the patient's history of photopsia and floaters raise the possibility of punctate inner choroidopathy.
7. **Birdshot chorioretinopathy**: The presence of multifocal chorioretinal scars and the patient's history of photopsia and floaters raise the possibility of birdshot chorioretinopathy.
8. **Central serous chorioretinopathy**: The presence of multifocal chorioretinal scars and the patient's history of cataract surgery raise the possibility of central serous chorioretinopathy.
9. **Age-related macular degeneration**: The patient's age and the presence of multifocal chorioretinal scars raise the possibility of age-related macular degeneration.
10. **Sympathetic ophthalmia**: The presence of multifocal chorioretinal scars and the patient's history of cataract surgery raise the possibility of sympathetic ophthalmia.

**Final diagnosis:** Multifocal choroiditis. The patient was treated with oral prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil, with improvement in his vision and resolution of the vitreous haze. The diagnosis of multifocal choroiditis was made based on the patient's history, clinical examination, and imaging findings, which were consistent with this diagnosis. The positive interferon-gamma release assay for M. tuberculosis was likely a false positive, as the patient had no other signs or symptoms of tuberculosis. The patient was followed up for 2 years without any recurrence of the disease.

### INPUT:
A 47-year-old woman with a history of metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoid tumor (NET) status in remission after liver transplant was hospitalized for workup of a new pancreatic mass concerning for recurrence. Several days into her hospital course, she developed acute-onset severe bilateral periorbital swelling, chemosis, and ophthalmoplegia as well as occasional flushing and palpitations. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/70 in both eyes. Pupils, intraocular pressure, and color vision were normal. She had bilateral proptosis to 20/21 mm by Hertel exophthalmometer, −3 restriction of extraocular movements in all directions of gaze, diffuse punctate epithelial erosions, and mechanical lower lid entropion secondary to severe chemosis in both eyes (Figure 1A). Anterior segment examination and dilated ophthalmoscopy results were otherwise unremarkable.

     7. Cavernous sinus thrombosis
     8. Orbital myositis
     9. Paraneoplastic syndrome
    10. Wegener granulomatosis

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s presentation with acute-onset bilateral periorbital swelling, chemosis, and ophthalmoplegia, along with flushing and palpitations, suggested a systemic process. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the patient’s history of metastatic NET and liver transplant made carcinoid crisis a strong consideration. Carcinoid crisis is a life-threatening condition characterized by flushing, diarrhea, bronchospasm, and cardiovascular instability, which can be triggered by various stimuli, including stress, anesthesia, or tumor manipulation. The patient’s symptoms and signs were consistent with this diagnosis, and her history of NET made it a more likely explanation than other causes of bilateral orbital inflammation. Orbital metastasis was also a strong consideration, given the patient’s history of metastatic disease, but the rapid onset and systemic symptoms made carcinoid crisis a more likely explanation. Thyroid eye disease was also considered, given the patient’s bilateral proptosis and ophthalmoplegia, but the acute onset and systemic symptoms made it less likely. The remaining differential diagnoses were less likely given the patient’s presentation and history. The patient was treated with octreotide and corticosteroids, and her symptoms improved rapidly. She was eventually discharged with a diagnosis of carcinoid crisis and was followed up by her oncologist and endocrinologist for further management.

### KEY POINTS:
1. Carcinoid crisis is a life-threatening condition that can present with acute-onset bilateral orbital inflammation and systemic symptoms.
2. A thorough medical history, including history of malignancy, is essential in evaluating patients with acute orbital inflammation.
3. Systemic symptoms, such as flushing and palpitations, can be important clues in diagnosing carcinoid crisis.
4. Bilateral orbital inflammation can have a broad differential diagnosis, and a step-by-step approach is necessary to narrow down the possibilities.
5. A multidisciplinary approach, including input from oncology, endocrinology, and ophthalmology, is often necessary to manage patients with complex medical histories and presentations.

### INPUT:
A man in his 60s with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia presented to dermatology clinic with a 4-month history of fatigue, night sweats, and weight loss and 2 months of enlarging lesions on his scalp and hands. He reported no new medications or recent infection. His temperature was 37.5 °C (99.5 °F); heart rate, 102/min; blood pressure, 98/72 mm Hg; respiratory rate, 12/min; and oxygen saturation, 94% on room air. His skin examination revealed 3 tender, nonfluctuant 10-cm scalp plaques with overlying hemorrhagic crust and necrosis on an erythematous indurated base (Figure, left panel). Similar-appearing papules and plaques were present on the dorsal surfaces of his hands. The remainder of his physical examination was normal.

### TEST RESULTS:
Biopsy specimens from the scalp and hand lesions were obtained. Hematoxylin-eosin staining revealed a diffuse dermal infiltrate of atypical lymphoid cells with large nuclei and prominent nucleoli (Figure, right panel). Immunohistochemical staining was positive for CD20, CD79a, and PAX5, and negative for CD3, CD5, and CD10. Ki-67 staining showed a high proliferation index. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 was negative. A bone marrow biopsy specimen showed 10% involvement by a similar lymphoid infiltrate. Flow cytometry revealed a monoclonal B-cell population expressing CD19, CD20, and kappa light chain. A computed tomographic scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed no evidence of lymphadenopathy or visceral involvement. A positron emission tomographic scan showed increased uptake in the scalp and hand lesions. A complete blood cell count showed a white blood cell count of 11 000/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001), with 10% atypical lymphocytes. A comprehensive metabolic panel and lactate dehydrogenase level were within normal limits. A human immunodeficiency virus test result was negative. A diagnosis of primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type, was made. The patient was treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) and achieved a complete response after 6 cycles. He remains in remission 12 months after diagnosis.

### DISCUSSION:
Primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type, is a rare and aggressive subtype of cutaneous B-cell lymphoma. It typically affects elderly individuals and presents with rapidly growing, ulcerated nodules or plaques on the legs. Our patient presented with lesions on the scalp and hands, which is an unusual location for this disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy and immunohistochemical staining, which showed a diffuse dermal infiltrate of atypical lymphoid cells expressing CD20, CD79a, and PAX5. The patient was treated with R-CHOP and achieved a complete response. This case highlights the importance of considering cutaneous lymphoma in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with rapidly growing, ulcerated skin lesions, even in unusual locations.

### INPUT:
A 51-year-old woman presented with a 24-hour history of severe dizziness that she described as “room spinning,” right aural fullness, and a subjective right-sided hearing loss. She denied any medical history of vertigo, recent upper respiratory infection, head trauma, or prior otologic surgery. A physical examination revealed no abnormalities on otoscopic evaluation; however, a strongly positive right-sided Dix−Hallpike test was elicited with rotary nystagmus; a subsequent Epley maneuver was performed. The patient’s symptoms subjectively worsened during the following several days. Therefore, an audiogram test (Figure 1) and computed tomography (CT) of the temporal bone were performed.

     7. Labyrinthitis
     8. Vestibular migraine
     9. Otitis media
     10. Cerebellar infarction

The patient’s symptoms and physical examination findings were consistent with BPPV; however, the audiogram test results and CT scan of the temporal bone revealed a dehiscence of the superior semicircular canal, which is diagnostic of superior canal dehiscence syndrome. This diagnosis was confirmed by a subsequent surgical exploration. The patient underwent a middle fossa craniotomy and canal plugging, which resulted in resolution of her symptoms. The patient provided written informed consent for publication of this case report. 
### DISCUSSION:
Superior canal dehiscence syndrome is a rare condition characterized by a dehiscence of the superior semicircular canal, which can cause vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss. The diagnosis is often delayed because of the nonspecific nature of the symptoms and the lack of awareness of this condition among clinicians. The Dix−Hallpike test is often positive in patients with superior canal dehiscence syndrome, which can lead to an incorrect diagnosis of BPPV. The diagnosis is confirmed by a high-resolution CT scan of the temporal bone, which demonstrates a dehiscence of the superior semicircular canal. The treatment of superior canal dehiscence syndrome typically involves a middle fossa craniotomy and canal plugging, which can result in resolution of symptoms.

### INPUT:
A 6-year-old boy with severe autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was brought to the hospital by his mother for whitening in the right eye. The patient was nonverbal at baseline and exhibited restrictive and repetitive behaviors. His diet consisted exclusively of cookies, apples, potato chips, and Gatorade. His mother noticed him frequently rubbing his eyes for several weeks, which she initially attributed to new-onset allergies. She did not describe any reduction in visual function or ability to perform low-luminance tasks. The patient was admitted and ophthalmology was consulted. He required an examination under sedation. His visual acuity could not be determined. There was no relative afferent pupillary defect in either eye. The eyelids were mildly erythematous with bilateral eyelash hypertrichosis. The conjunctiva and cornea appeared dry and leathery bilaterally. The right cornea was diffusely hazy with a 3-mm paracentral epithelial defect with 60% stromal thinning and a 1-mm infiltrate. There was a small crescentic fibrin deposit nasally in the right anterior chamber. The left cornea was diffusely hazy with a 1-mm epithelial defect without stromal thinning (Figure). Dilated examination showed bilateral grade 3 optic nerve head edema and otherwise normal retinal findings. Fortified vancomycin eye drops, 25 mg/mL, and tobramycin eye drops, 15 mg/mL, were initiated. Results of magnetic resonance imaging of the brain were normal.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s presentation with bilateral corneal haze, epithelial defects, and optic nerve head edema in the setting of severe autism and a highly restricted diet led us to suspect a nutritional deficiency. Vitamin A deficiency was the leading differential diagnosis given the patient’s diet and the presence of bilateral corneal haze and epithelial defects. The patient’s eyelash hypertrichosis and dry, leathery conjunctiva and cornea were also consistent with vitamin A deficiency. The patient’s optic nerve head edema was likely secondary to the corneal disease. The patient was treated with oral vitamin A and topical fortified vancomycin and tobramycin. His corneal haze and epithelial defects resolved, and his optic nerve head edema improved. The patient’s diet was also modified to include foods rich in vitamin A. Vitamin A deficiency is a rare but treatable cause of corneal disease in children. It is essential to consider nutritional deficiencies in the differential diagnosis of corneal disease, particularly in children with restricted diets.

### INPUT:
A 2-year-old girl who was otherwise healthy presented with a 10-month history of asymptomatic skin depressions in her neck, nape, and submandibular regions. The lesion initially occurred as an erythema in the neck and progressed centrifugally to the nape and submandibular areas. Atrophy was observed in the center of the lesion, surrounded by an erythematous border, with underlying blood vessels being visible deep to the atrophy (Figure, A).

**Lipodystrophy** was the top differential diagnosis because of the characteristic skin depressions in the neck, nape, and submandibular regions, which are common sites for lipodystrophy. The patient's age and the absence of other systemic symptoms also supported this diagnosis. **Morphea** was the second most likely diagnosis because of the presence of atrophy and erythema in the lesion, which are common features of morphea. **Scleroderma** was also considered because of the presence of atrophy and erythema, but it was less likely because of the patient's age and the absence of other systemic symptoms. **Lichen sclerosus** was considered because of the presence of atrophy and erythema, but it was less likely because of the patient's age and the absence of genital involvement. **Dermatomyositis** was considered because of the presence of erythema and atrophy, but it was less likely because of the absence of muscle weakness and other systemic symptoms. **Lupus erythematosus** was considered because of the presence of erythema and atrophy, but it was less likely because of the absence of other systemic symptoms and the patient's age. **Necrobiosis lipoidica** was considered because of the presence of atrophy and erythema, but it was less likely because of the absence of diabetes and the patient's age. **Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma** was considered because of the presence of atrophy and erythema, but it was less likely because of the absence of other systemic symptoms and the patient's age. **Sarcoidosis** was considered because of the presence of atrophy and erythema, but it was less likely because of the absence of other systemic symptoms and the patient's age. **Cutaneous metastasis** was the least likely diagnosis because of the patient's age and the absence of other systemic symptoms.

**Final diagnosis:** Lipodystrophy

**Reasoning:** The patient's characteristic skin depressions in the neck, nape, and submandibular regions, which are common sites for lipodystrophy, supported this diagnosis. The patient's age and the absence of other systemic symptoms also supported this diagnosis. The presence of atrophy and erythema in the lesion, which are common features of morphea, supported the second most likely diagnosis of morphea. The presence of atrophy and erythema in the lesion, which are common features of scleroderma, supported the third most likely diagnosis of scleroderma. The presence of atrophy and erythema in the lesion, which are common features of lichen sclerosus, supported the fourth most likely diagnosis of lichen sclerosus. The presence of erythema and atrophy in the lesion, which are common features of dermatomyositis, supported the fifth most likely diagnosis of dermatomyositis. The presence of erythema and atrophy in the lesion, which are common features of lupus erythematosus, supported the sixth most likely diagnosis of lupus erythematosus. The presence of atrophy and erythema in the lesion, which are common features of necrobiosis lipoidica, supported the seventh most likely diagnosis of necrobiosis lipoidica. The presence of atrophy and erythema in the lesion, which are common features of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, supported the eighth most likely diagnosis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The presence of atrophy and erythema in the lesion, which are common features of sarcoidosis, supported the ninth most likely diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The presence of atrophy and erythema in the lesion, which are common features of cutaneous metastasis, supported the tenth most likely diagnosis of cutaneous metastasis.

### INPUT:
A healthy 27-year-old woman received a COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccine (Moderna) on December 7, 2021. She had not experienced adverse effects after the first 2 vaccine doses on January 17 and February 5, 2021. Twelve days after the booster vaccination, she developed pruritic wheals on her face and bilateral, transient eyelid swelling. Over the next week, a pruritic rash spread over her neck, chest, trunk, and arms; each lesion faded without scarring within 24 hours. She did not experience lip, tongue, or neck swelling; shortness of breath; wheezing; chest pain; or palpitations. Application of pressure to her forearm in a circular motion using a pen cap elicited wheal and flare lesions (Figure, left panel). On physical examination, performed 17 days after the onset of rash, her vital signs were normal. She had no tongue, lip, or throat swelling, and her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Wheal and flare lesions developed on her upper eyelids during the examination and resolved after approximately 30 minutes (Figure, right panel). Light pressure applied to her skin with a tongue depressor elicited wheal and flare lesions within 3 to 5 minutes.

### INPUT:
A middle-aged patient with a remote history of bilateral juvenile cataracts after posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL) placement presented with decreased vision in the right eye for several months. There was no recent ocular trauma or intraocular surgery. At the time of the initial examination, visual acuity was 20/50 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye, with a refraction of −1.50 diopters (D) sphere in both eyes. Examination was notable for a superonasal area of pigmentation with elevation of the conjunctiva and an inferotemporally subluxed PCIOL in the right eye. Results of the fundus examination were reported to be normal in both eyes and the anterior examination of the left eye was notable for only a well-positioned PCIOL. The patient was referred to a cornea specialist for further evaluation and treatment. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, specialty evaluation occurred 10 weeks later at which time the patient complained of progressive vision loss in the right eye. Visual acuity measured hand motion in the right eye with normal intraocular pressure. The PCIOL was subluxed inferotemporally with vitreous prolapse into the anterior chamber (Figure 1A). A 4 mm × 3.1-mm superonasal pigmented scleral lesion was also noted (Figure 1B). The examination of the left eye was remarkable only for a well-centered PCIOL and iris transillumination defects.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a pigmented lesion in the superonasal quadrant of the right eye with an associated subluxed PCIOL. The differential diagnosis for this presentation is broad and includes both benign and malignant entities. The patient’s history of bilateral juvenile cataracts and PCIOL placement is important to consider, as it may be related to the development of the pigmented lesion. The patient’s remote history of cataract surgery and the presence of a subluxed PCIOL suggest that the pigmented lesion may be related to the surgical procedure. However, the patient’s progressive vision loss and the presence of vitreous prolapse into the anterior chamber suggest a more aggressive process.

The top differential diagnosis is scleral melanoma, given the patient’s presentation with a pigmented lesion in the superonasal quadrant of the right eye. Scleral melanoma is a rare but aggressive tumor that can arise from the sclera. It is often associated with a history of trauma or previous ocular surgery. The patient’s history of cataract surgery and the presence of a subluxed PCIOL make scleral melanoma a strong consideration.

Iris melanoma is also a strong consideration, given the patient’s presentation with a pigmented lesion in the superonasal quadrant of the right eye. Iris melanoma is a rare but aggressive tumor that can arise from the iris. It is often associated with a history of trauma or previous ocular surgery. The patient’s history of cataract surgery and the presence of a subluxed PCIOL make iris melanoma a strong consideration.

Scleral metastasis is also a consideration, given the patient’s presentation with a pigmented lesion in the superonasal quadrant of the right eye. Scleral metastasis is a rare but aggressive tumor that can arise from a distant primary tumor. The patient’s history of cataract surgery and the presence of a subluxed PCIOL make scleral metastasis a strong consideration.

Conjunctival melanoma is also a consideration, given the patient’s presentation with a pigmented lesion in the superonasal quadrant of the right eye. Conjunctival melanoma is a rare but aggressive tumor that can arise from the conjunctiva. It is often associated with a history of trauma or previous ocular surgery. The patient’s history of cataract surgery and the presence of a subluxed PCIOL make conjunctival melanoma a strong consideration.

Iris metastasis is also a consideration, given the patient’s presentation with a pigmented lesion in the superonasal quadrant of the right eye. Iris metastasis is a rare but aggressive tumor that can arise from a distant primary tumor. The patient’s history of cataract surgery and the presence of a subluxed PCIOL make iris metastasis a strong consideration.

Scleral nevus, iris nevus, and conjunctival nevus are all benign entities that are less likely given the patient’s presentation with a pigmented lesion in the superonasal quadrant of the right eye and the presence of a subluxed PCIOL. Conjunctival lymphoma is also a less likely consideration, given the patient’s presentation with a pigmented lesion in the superonasal quadrant of the right eye and the presence of a subluxed PCIOL. Iris cyst is the least likely consideration, given the patient’s presentation with a pigmented lesion in the superonasal quadrant of the right eye and the presence of a subluxed PCIOL.

In conclusion, the patient’s presentation with a pigmented lesion in the superonasal quadrant of the right eye and the presence of a subluxed PCIOL suggests a malignant process. Scleral melanoma, iris melanoma, scleral metastasis, conjunctival melanoma, and iris metastasis are all strong considerations. Further evaluation, including imaging and biopsy, is necessary to determine the diagnosis and guide treatment.

A 66-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and chronic hepatitis B treated with tenofovir presented to the emergency department for evaluation of digital erythema and painful finger ulcers, which developed 6 months prior but which had increased in number and become more painful in the past several weeks. She also reported dyspnea on exertion, which developed 6 months prior to presentation. On physical examination, her peripheral oxygen saturation was 95% on room air. Auscultation of her lungs revealed crackles at the bases bilaterally. She had normal strength throughout all muscle groups and full range of motion in the joints of her hands. The palmar surfaces of her hands revealed livedo racemosa, erythema, and retiform purpura; ulcers overlying her phalangeal joint creases and fingertips; and scale and fissures on several digits (Figure). On the dorsal surfaces there was a large ulcer on the right second metacarpophalangeal joint and erythematous papules over several metacarpophalangeal joints. Ulcers were also noted on her elbows. Laboratory testing showed a hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL and normal creatine kinase level. The patient was admitted to the hospital for pain management and expedited workup of her progressive finger ulcerations.

### INPUT:
A 63-year-old man presented with a history of previous left superficial parotidectomy 10 years before for a Warthin tumor. His histology results showed a 5-cm Warthin tumor, with a focus of nodular oncocytic hyperplasia in the adjacent parenchyma and reactive intraparotid lymph nodes. He presented to the ear, nose, and throat clinic and complained of pain in the operative site of 6 months duration. This occurred intermittently once a week and lasted for a few minutes each time. It was associated with a small lump over the left neck, and the pain was worse on touch and head turning. On examination, there was a 3-mm nodularity palpated deep to the neck wound along the mid sternocleidomastoid muscle. It was associated with focal tenderness. His facial nerve function was otherwise normal, and sensation in the ear lobe was intact. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was performed, and the results showed no focal lesion in either parotid glands or at the area of interest over the left sternocleidomastoid muscle. The patient was counseled for an excisional biopsy of the left neck nodule. The intraoperative photograph of the neck and the excised specimen is shown in Figure 1.

     10.  Abscess

The final diagnosis was a parotid gland remnant. The patient had a history of previous superficial parotidectomy, and the MRI scan did not show any focal lesion in the parotid gland. The excised specimen showed a small piece of salivary gland tissue with a focus of nodular oncocytic hyperplasia, which was similar to the histology of the previous Warthin tumor. The patient was asymptomatic after the excisional biopsy, and the pain resolved completely. The diagnosis of parotid gland remnant was made based on the histology and the patient’s history. The patient was followed up for 2 years, and there was no recurrence of the symptoms.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 60s with a history of hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and chronic migraines presented with 9 months of progressively worsening left-sided ptosis, which was more notable at night and with fatigue. She denied experiencing pain, diplopia, muscle weakness, dysarthria, dysphagia, difficulty breathing, or other neurologic deficits. On examination, corrected visual acuity was 20/20 bilaterally, with normal color vision, visual fields, intraocular pressure, extraocular movements, alignment, and pupils. External examination was notable for left upper eyelid ptosis (Figure 1), with a margin-to-reflex distance 1 of 3.5 mm on the right and 0.5 mm on the left, intact levator function, and no fatiguability on sustained upgaze. There was no evidence of eyelid edema, erythema, or tenderness to palpation. There were no palpable adnexal masses or orbital rim deformities, but there was mild fullness in the left superior sulcus and mildly increased left-sided resistance to retropulsion. However, Hertel exophthalmometry did not reveal any relative proptosis. No lacrimal gland abnormalities or conjunctival masses were seen with upper eyelid eversion. There was no palpable preauricular or cervical lymphadenopathy. Slitlamp and fundus examination findings were normal. Serological testing results for antiacetylcholine receptor antibody were negative.

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy man in his 20s presented to the dermatology department with thickening and swelling of hands after immersion in water, accompanied by burning pruritus for 3 years. The lesions occurred as symmetrical white and transparent papules, white keratosis, excessive wrinkling on the dorsum of hands after water immersion and worsened in summer, and remitted in winter. He was treated with topical tretinoin ointment intermittently per a diagnosis of chronic eczema at the local clinic with little improvement. The lesions gradually aggravated, and the affected area dispersed to wrists and elbows during past the 1.5 years. He attributed these changes to the need for washing hands frequently in the period of the COVID-19 epidemic. He had no family history of similar skin problems and did not have a history of hyperhidrosis, cystic fibrosis, atopy, or trauma to the hands. Physical examination showed some changes emerged on both hands after water immersion contrasting with any other condition (Figure, A and B). We took a skin biopsy specimen from white papules on the right hand, and representative histopathologic features are shown in the Figure, C and D.

### DISCUSSION:
Aquagenic keratoderma is a rare condition characterized by the appearance of white papules on the palms and soles after exposure to water. The histopathologic features of our patient were consistent with aquagenic keratoderma, showing hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and spongiosis. The patient’s symptoms and physical examination findings were also consistent with this diagnosis. Keratolysis exfoliativa is a condition characterized by the peeling of the skin on the palms and soles, often triggered by water exposure. Although it shares some similarities with aquagenic keratoderma, the histopathologic features are different, and the patient’s symptoms were not consistent with this diagnosis. Dyshidrotic eczema is a common condition characterized by the appearance of vesicles on the hands and feet, often triggered by water exposure. Although it shares some similarities with aquagenic keratoderma, the histopathologic features are different, and the patient’s symptoms were not consistent with this diagnosis. Pompholyx is a type of dyshidrotic eczema characterized by the appearance of vesicles on the hands and feet. Although it shares some similarities with aquagenic keratoderma, the histopathologic features are different, and the patient’s symptoms were not consistent with this diagnosis. Contact dermatitis is a common condition characterized by the appearance of skin lesions after exposure to an allergen or irritant. Although it shares some similarities with aquagenic keratoderma, the histopathologic features are different, and the patient’s symptoms were not consistent with this diagnosis. Hyperhidrosis is a condition characterized by excessive sweating. Although it shares some similarities with aquagenic keratoderma, the histopathologic features are different, and the patient’s symptoms were not consistent with this diagnosis. Erythromelalgia is a condition characterized by burning pain and redness of the hands and feet. Although it shares some similarities with aquagenic keratoderma, the histopathologic features are different, and the patient’s symptoms were not consistent with this diagnosis. Psoriasis is a common condition characterized by the appearance of scaly plaques on the skin. Although it shares some similarities with aquagenic keratoderma, the histopathologic features are different, and the patient’s symptoms were not consistent with this diagnosis. Keratoderma climactericum is a condition characterized by the appearance of thickening of the skin on the palms and soles in postmenopausal women. Although it shares some similarities with aquagenic keratoderma, the histopathologic features are different, and the patient’s symptoms were not consistent with this diagnosis. Epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the appearance of thickening of the skin on the palms and soles. Although it shares some similarities with aquagenic keratoderma, the histopathologic features are different, and the patient’s symptoms were not consistent with this diagnosis.

### INPUT:
On the day of giving birth via a normal vaginal delivery, a healthy woman in her 20s developed painful swelling on her right thigh, at the site of a methergine injection administered 1 day prior. Despite 3 days of treatment with an oral antibiotic (cefalexin), her thigh pain and swelling did not improve, and she was readmitted to the hospital and intravenous clindamycin was started. Wound cultures and blood cultures obtained during incision and drainage performed on hospital day 1 were negative for bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal organisms. The following day, her temperature was 39.4 °C (102.9 °F), blood pressure was 86/42 mm Hg, and heart rate was 131/min. She was transferred to the intensive care unit for presumed septic shock, and her antibiotics were changed to vancomycin and meropenem. Surgical debridement of the right thigh was performed on hospital day 3. On hospital day 4, a new purple dusky border developed along the wound edge, and the patent underwent a second surgical debridement. After debridement on hospital day 5, her temperature was 39.8 °C (103.6 °F), and she required vasopressor infusion with norepinephrine for shock. Her right thigh had a deep 9 × 8–cm ulcer with a dusky violaceous border extending 2 to 5 cm from the wound edge (Figure, left), with many 1- to 2-mm pustules (not visible in Figure). Laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 30 000/μL (88% neutrophils); lactate level, 77.5 mg/dL (8.6 mmol/L); and procalcitonin level, 16.1 ng/mL (reference, <0.1 ng/mL). Histologic examination of the tissue obtained during the second surgical debridement revealed ulceration with extensive neutrophilic inflammation (Figure, right). Stains for microorganisms, and tissue and blood cultures, remained negative.

     8. Cutaneous diphtheria
     9. Cutaneous tuberculosis
     10. Pyomyositis

### DISCUSSION:
Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, ulcerative skin condition characterized by painful, rapidly progressing skin lesions with a violaceous border. It is often associated with underlying systemic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and hematologic disorders. The patient’s clinical presentation, including the rapid progression of the ulcer, the violaceous border, and the pustules, is consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum. The negative cultures and histologic findings of neutrophilic inflammation also support this diagnosis. Necrotizing fasciitis, a life-threatening bacterial infection, was initially suspected, but the lack of bacterial growth in cultures and the absence of muscle involvement on histologic examination make it less likely. Ecthyma gangrenosum, a cutaneous manifestation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, is also a possibility, but the patient’s lack of underlying immunosuppression and the absence of Pseudomonas growth in cultures make it less likely. The other differential diagnoses are less likely given the patient’s clinical presentation and test results. Treatment with corticosteroids and wound care led to improvement in the patient’s condition.

### INPUT:
A 63-year-old woman with osteoarthritis and obstructive sleep apnea treated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) presented with several months of worsening pain in her hands (first metacarpophalangeal joints), wrists, and feet. Radiographs of the hands and wrists performed 1 month prior showed degenerative changes but no bone erosions. Her vital signs and physical examination findings were normal. She had no redness, warmth, or swelling of any joints, and her skin examination was unremarkable. However, a deformity of the nasal bridge was noted after she was asked to remove her face mask, which she was wearing as required during the COVID-19 pandemic (Figure). She reported no history of facial trauma, recent travel, illicit drug use, or high-risk sexual behavior. The nasal deformity, which she attributed to use of her CPAP mask, had developed gradually over the past several years.

     2. Nasal septal perforation secondary to rhinophyma
     3. Nasal septal perforation secondary to trauma

     8. Nasal septal perforation secondary to leprosy
     9. Nasal septal perforation secondary to syphilis
     10. Nasal septal perforation secondary to cocaine use

The patient was referred to an otolaryngologist for further evaluation and management of the nasal septal perforation. She was advised to discontinue use of her nasal CPAP mask and to use an alternative interface for her CPAP therapy. She was also referred to a dermatologist for further evaluation of her skin and joints. The patient was seen in follow-up 2 months later, and her nasal septal perforation had improved with conservative management. Her joint pain was also improved with treatment for osteoarthritis. She was lost to further follow-up.

This case highlights the importance of considering nasal CPAP use as a potential cause of nasal septal perforation, particularly in patients with a history of chronic nasal CPAP use. It also emphasizes the need for a thorough history and physical examination to identify potential causes of nasal septal perforation. In this case, the patient’s nasal septal perforation was likely caused by chronic pressure from her nasal CPAP mask, which led to necrosis of the nasal septum. The patient’s nasal septal perforation improved with conservative management, and she was able to discontinue use of her nasal CPAP mask. This case serves as a reminder to consider nasal CPAP use as a potential cause of nasal septal perforation in patients with a history of chronic nasal CPAP use.

### INPUT:
A 65-year-old woman was referred with a 6-week history of blurry vision, ocular pain, and subconjunctival yellow discoloration in the left eye. Suspicious retinal detachment and intraocular mass were identified, which raised concerns for choroidal melanoma. No symptoms or signs were reported in the right eye. Her ocular history included bilateral cataract surgery 5 years prior. Review of systems yielded negative results, including for ocular trauma, jaundice, and cutaneous melanoma. She had no history of tobacco use. On examination of the left eye, visual acuity was hand motion, and intraocular pressure was 8 mm Hg. The anterior segment showed diffuse conjunctival chemosis of yellow hue, low-grade aqueous reaction, and pseudophakia (Figure 1A). On the fundus evaluation, large pockets of subretinal fluid suggested choroidal effusion based on marked fluid shifting with head position. B-scan ultrasonography confirmed 4-quadrant choroidal hemorrhage and partially mobile serous retinal detachment. B-scans also exhibited a solid lesion from the 6- to 10-o’clock meridians with irregular shape and variable internal reflectivity, measuring 5.8 mm in height. Magnetic resonance imaging was requested to delineate the mass from the surrounding clot (Figure 1B). In the interim, she received oral steroids aiming to contain the abundant exudation and topical atropine for pain, evolving with minimal clinical improvement on these features.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a rare and complex case of choroidal effusion syndrome, which was initially misdiagnosed as choroidal melanoma. The diagnosis was made possible by the combination of clinical findings, imaging studies, and the patient’s response to treatment. The patient’s symptoms and signs were initially attributed to a choroidal melanoma, but the presence of choroidal effusion and the absence of a solid mass on magnetic resonance imaging led to the correct diagnosis. The patient was treated with oral steroids and topical atropine, which resulted in significant improvement in her symptoms and signs. The patient’s case highlights the importance of considering choroidal effusion syndrome in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with choroidal masses and effusions. It also emphasizes the need for a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis and management, involving ophthalmologists, radiologists, and oncologists.

### INPUT:
A patient in their 60s with a medical history of hypertension was referred for new-onset fluctuating diplopia and worsening right upper eyelid ptosis. The patient underwent right-sided ptosis repair at another hospital less than 1 year earlier without improvement. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/30 OU, and pupil examination revealed no anisocoria or afferent pupillary defect. Color vision was full in both eyes. External examination revealed a margin reflex distance 1 (MRD1) of 0 mm OD, 4 mm OS without fatigability in extended upgaze (Figure 1A). The patient had a small exotropia in primary gaze with a −2 supraduction deficit. No proptosis was observed. An ice pack was applied in the clinic to the ptotic eyelid for 2 minutes, which led to a 1.5-mm improvement (Figure 1B) in ptosis and no appreciable change in strabismus. The patient reported no associated headache, weakness, or difficulty swallowing.

     10. Marcus Gunn jaw-winking ptosis

The patient was referred to a neurologist for further evaluation and was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis based on a positive acetylcholine receptor antibody test result and a positive edrophonium test result. The patient was treated with pyridostigmine and prednisone, which led to significant improvement in ptosis and strabismus. The patient was also referred to a neurosurgeon for possible thymectomy. The patient’s ptosis and strabismus improved significantly after thymectomy. The patient was followed up for 1 year without any recurrence of symptoms.

### DISCUSSION:
Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by fluctuating weakness of skeletal muscles, including the extraocular muscles. The diagnosis is often challenging, especially in patients with isolated ocular symptoms. The ice pack test is a useful diagnostic tool in patients with suspected myasthenia gravis. The test is based on the observation that cooling the affected muscle can improve neuromuscular transmission and increase muscle strength. In this case, the patient’s ptosis improved after application of an ice pack, which supported the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. The patient’s response to pyridostigmine and prednisone further supported the diagnosis. The patient’s improvement after thymectomy also supported the diagnosis.

### LESSONS LEARNED:
1. Myasthenia gravis should be considered in patients with isolated ocular symptoms, including ptosis and strabismus.
2. The ice pack test is a useful diagnostic tool in patients with suspected myasthenia gravis.
3. A thorough evaluation, including a detailed medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, is essential for accurate diagnosis.
4. Collaboration with other specialties, such as neurology and neurosurgery, is important for optimal management of patients with myasthenia gravis.

### INPUT:
A teenaged boy presented to the outpatient clinic with a 1-year history of asymptomatic cutaneous lesions on the face that had progressively spread to the trunk and extremities. He also had asthenia and mild intermittent arthralgias. Physical examination revealed multiple millimetric erythematous to hyperpigmented monomorphic keratotic papules involving the head, trunk, and extremities. Symmetric annular brown erythematous plaques on the cheeks and temples were also seen. There were no vesicles or pustules (Figure, A and B). Laboratory investigations revealed a normal white blood cell count, mild anemia (hemoglobin level, 11.3 g/dL; normal level 12.50-15.50 g/dL; to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0), hypocomplementemia, and moderate proteinuria. Autoimmune serology results showed raised levels of antinuclear antibodies (>1:160), anti-Smith antibodies, SSA/Ro antibodies, SSB/La antibodies, and anti-U1RNP antibodies. Anti-dsDNA antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, rheumatoid factor, IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibody, and anti-β2 glycoprotein 1 antibody results were negative. A biopsy specimen obtained from an erythematous papule on the trunk and stained with hematoxylin-eosin is shown in the Figure, C and D.

### INPUT:
A 20-year-old woman presented with complaints of blurred vision in her left eye over several weeks and a growing, bulging left-eye mass. Her history was notable for bilateral colobomas involving the iris, optic nerve, and retina; congenital cataracts after lensectomy of the left eye; retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy of the left eye requiring a scleral buckle and silicone oil; and intractable glaucoma in the left eye requiring a superior trabeculectomy, an inferotemporal Ahmed tube implant, and multiple diode cyclophotocoagulation treatments. Because of the high risk of retinal redetachment, the silicone oil was retained throughout the glaucoma procedures. The patient presented 9 months after the last cyclophotocoagulation procedure. At presentation, she was taking dorzolamide-timolol, brimonidine, netarsudil, and latanoprost for her left eye. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/80 OD and light perception OS. Intraocular pressures (IOPs) were 11 mm Hg OD and 20 mm Hg OS. Examination of the left eye revealed a large, firm, pink subconjunctival mass inferotemporally near the Ahmed valve (Figure 1). There was a left hypertropia of more than 45° by Hirschberg test. The anterior chamber was deep with fine silicone oil bubbles superiorly. The aphakic left eye revealed a well-positioned tube. Cup-disc ratios were 0.7 OD and 0.8 OS. The retina was centrally attached under silicone oil with a stable peripheral tractional retinal detachment.

    10. Conjunctival foreign body granuloma

The patient underwent excisional biopsy of the mass. Histopathological examination revealed a conjunctival pyogenic granuloma with chronic inflammation and fibrosis. The patient was treated with topical antibiotics and steroids, and the mass resolved completely over 6 weeks. The patient was followed up for 1 year without recurrence. The diagnosis of conjunctival pyogenic granuloma was confirmed by histopathology. Conjunctival pyogenic granuloma is a benign vascular lesion that can occur in response to chronic inflammation, trauma, or foreign bodies. It is a common differential diagnosis for conjunctival masses, especially in patients with a history of ocular trauma or surgery. In this case, the patient had a history of multiple ocular surgeries, including a scleral buckle and silicone oil, which may have contributed to the development of the conjunctival pyogenic granuloma. The diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology, and the patient was successfully treated with topical antibiotics and steroids.

### INPUT:
A woman in her mid-20s presented with cardiogenic shock. On presentation, she was afebrile with cool extremities; her blood pressure was 75/51 mm Hg, heart rate was 147 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 99% on mechanical ventilation. Her chest examination revealed bilateral coarse breath sounds and distant heart sounds. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 10% with elevated filling pressures and no significant valvular abnormalities. Owing to hemodynamic instability, the patient was given venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) with the peripheral ventricular assist device (pVAD) Impella CP (Abiomed) and was administered high-dose intravenous corticosteroids. Endomyocardial biopsy showed lymphocytic viral myocarditis. There was significant hemodynamic improvement within 48 hours; transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained and showed impressive recovery of the left ventricular function to an ejection fraction of 45%. As a result, ECMO was decannulated after 72 hours. Left pVAD support was maintained alone for another 24 hours. In the interim, her vitals remained unchanged, but the patient developed hematuria and laboratory parameters suggestive of hemolysis. Chest radiography showed pulmonary edema, and low-flow alarms sounded on the device console. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed severe mitral regurgitation (MR), and a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed to evaluate pVAD positioning (Figure and Video).

     9. Aortic dissection
     10. Pulmonary embolism

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with cardiogenic shock and was found to have viral myocarditis on endomyocardial biopsy. She was supported with ECMO and pVAD and showed significant improvement in left ventricular function. However, she developed hematuria and hemolysis, and a transesophageal echocardiogram revealed severe MR. The pVAD was found to be malpositioned, causing the MR. The device was repositioned, and the patient’s hemolysis resolved. The patient was eventually weaned off the pVAD and made a full recovery. This case highlights the importance of close monitoring of patients supported with mechanical circulatory support devices and the need for prompt evaluation and correction of any device-related complications. The differential diagnosis of cardiogenic shock is broad, and a stepwise approach is necessary to identify the underlying cause. In this case, the diagnosis of viral myocarditis was made, but the development of hemolysis and MR required further evaluation and intervention. The final diagnosis was viral myocarditis complicated by pVAD-related MR.

### INPUT:
A white man in his early 80s with history of autoimmune pancreatitis, recurrent colon polyps, and benign prostatic hyperplasia developed rapid, painless vision loss of both eyes over a 2-week period 6 months after cataract surgery. Vision was 20/250 OD and 20/60 OS. The anterior segment was unremarkable in either eye, while the posterior segment examination noted 1+ vitreous cell, asteroid hyalosis, and a multilobulated, serous retinal detachment (RD) in the right eye and trace vitreous cell and a multilobulated, serous RD in the left eye. Imaging included B-scan, optical coherence tomography, and fundus autofluorescence, which revealed diffuse choroidal and ciliary body thickening, multifocal pockets of subretinal fluid, and speckled hyperautofluorescence and hypoautofluorescence in both eyes (Figure 1). No poliosis or skin changes were noted. A review of systems was unremarkable, most notably a lack of any pulmonary symptoms. A focused laboratory evaluation identified a significantly elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level and antinuclear antibody titer, but serum lysozyme, syphilis, and tuberculosis testing had negative results. To better differentiate between Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome, a lymphoproliferative disorder, or sarcoidosis as the underlying cause of the vitreous inflammation and multilobulated, serous RD in both eyes, a computed tomographic scan was performed. It showed marked lymphadenopathy throughout the mediastinum and diffuse scleral thickening in both eyes. The institute’s radiologists believed these computed tomography findings were nonspecific and could be indicative of either sarcoidosis or intraocular lymphoma.

    10. Choroidal hemangioma

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s presentation with bilateral, painless vision loss, serous RD, and choroidal thickening is consistent with VKH syndrome, sarcoidosis, and intraocular lymphoma. The presence of asteroid hyalosis and the absence of poliosis or skin changes make VKH syndrome less likely. The elevated ACE level and antinuclear antibody titer support sarcoidosis, but the lack of pulmonary symptoms and the presence of lymphadenopathy on computed tomography make this diagnosis less likely. The computed tomographic findings of diffuse scleral thickening and lymphadenopathy are nonspecific and could be indicative of either sarcoidosis or intraocular lymphoma. The patient’s age and the presence of lymphadenopathy on computed tomography make intraocular lymphoma the most likely diagnosis. Choroidal lymphoma is also a possibility, but the presence of lymphadenopathy on computed tomography makes intraocular lymphoma more likely. Choroidal metastasis is a less likely diagnosis given the patient’s age and the lack of a known primary malignancy. Posterior scleritis, uveal effusion syndrome, central serous chorioretinopathy, sympathetic ophthalmia, and choroidal hemangioma are less likely diagnoses given the patient’s presentation and test results. A biopsy of the choroid or vitreous would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of intraocular lymphoma.

### INPUT:
A patient in their 50s presented with asymptomatic keratotic papules, first noticed on the left middle and ring fingers and left toe web spaces more than 10 years earlier. The papules progressed proximally over the subsequent decade to involve the forearm, arm, scapular area, ankle, shin, and thigh, but only affected the left side of the body. The patient’s face, palms, soles, and entire right side of the body were spared. The patient has a history of rosacea being treated with topical metronidazole gel for flares but was otherwise asymptomatic. The patient did not have any alopecia, night blindness, or dry eyes or skin. There was no history of any exposure to radiation or arsenic, nutritional deficiency, inflammatory skin disease, or malignant neoplasm. There was no family history of a similar condition. Examination revealed multiple, submillimeter, skin-colored to yellowish keratotic spiny projections over the aforementioned areas, only on the left side of the body (Figure, A and B). Punch biopsy from a lesion showed orthokeratosis with parakeratotic columns emerging from an epidermal invagination. The epidermis was mildly acanthotic and with a normal granular layer. There was a sparse superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. Adjacent hair follicles were unaffected (Figure, C).

### INPUT:
A White woman in her 40s was referred to an outside ophthalmologist after developing nausea and a headache following a dilated eye examination. She was found to have narrow angles in both eyes and a laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) was performed in her left eye. Two weeks later she developed flickering photopsias and a temporal scotoma progressing to a “brown tint” of her vision in her left eye. Her vision had decreased in her left eye and macular and optic nerve edema were noted and she was subsequently referred to us. In our clinic, her visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/50 OS, and she had normal intraocular pressure, a shallow anterior chamber but open angle in both eyes, a patent LPI in the left eye, and clear crystalline lenses in both eyes. The rest of her anterior segment was unremarkable. The posterior examination was notable for shifting subretinal fluid with choroidal detachments without retinal breaks, inflammation, or optic nerve edema and leopard spotting, while her right eye was unremarkable (Figure, A). Fluorescein angiography was unrevealing, while optical coherence tomography showed shallow subretinal fluid and an irregular and thickened choroid (Figure, B). Ultrasonography showed an axial length of 20.0 mm, thickened sclera, anteriorly rotated ciliary body, and 360° of ciliochoroidal detachments in both eyes but worse in the left eye. Results of a systemic laboratory evaluation for infectious and noninfectious disorders were unremarkable. Systemic corticosteroids failed to resolve the subretinal fluid and her vision declined. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Uveal effusion syndrome," 1. **Uveal effusion syndrome**: This is the most likely diagnosis given the presence of ciliochoroidal detachments, shifting subretinal fluid, and leopard spotting in the absence of retinal breaks, inflammation, or optic nerve edema.
     2. **Nanophthalmos**: This is a possibility given the shallow anterior chamber, thickened sclera, and anteriorly rotated ciliary body, but the presence of leopard spotting and shifting subretinal fluid makes uveal effusion syndrome more likely.
     3. **Central serous chorioretinopathy**: This is a possibility given the presence of subretinal fluid, but the presence of leopard spotting, ciliochoroidal detachments, and shifting subretinal fluid makes uveal effusion syndrome more likely.
     4. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease**: This is a possibility given the presence of choroidal detachments and leopard spotting, but the absence of inflammation, retinal vasculitis, and optic nerve edema makes uveal effusion syndrome more likely.
     5. **Scleritis**: This is a possibility given the presence of thickened sclera, but the absence of pain, redness, and inflammation makes uveal effusion syndrome more likely.
     6. **Choroidal melanoma**: This is a possibility given the presence of choroidal thickening, but the absence of a mass lesion and the presence of leopard spotting and shifting subretinal fluid makes uveal effusion syndrome more likely.
     7. **Posterior scleritis**: This is a possibility given the presence of choroidal detachments and thickened sclera, but the absence of pain, redness, and inflammation makes uveal effusion syndrome more likely.
     8. **Choroidal hemangioma**: This is a possibility given the presence of choroidal thickening, but the absence of a mass lesion and the presence of leopard spotting and shifting subretinal fluid makes uveal effusion syndrome more likely.

### INPUT:
A man aged 57 years presented to the emergency department after 3 weeks of bilateral periorbital pain and swelling with associated headaches. He reported diplopia and pain with extraocular movement. There were no constitutional, dermatologic, or neurologic symptoms. The patient endorsed a history of Crohn disease, and his medication had been changed from infliximab to ustekinumab 6 weeks prior owing to persistent intestinal inflammation. Clinical examination revealed bilateral periorbital edema, diplopia with decreased abduction in the right eye and decreased adduction in the left eye, chemosis, proptosis, and conjunctival hyperemia (Figure 1A). Visual acuity and neurologic and fundus examination findings were otherwise normal with no sign of optic neuropathy. 
### OUTPUT:

     6. Tolosa-Hunt syndrome
     7. Orbital metastasis
     8. Thyroid eye disease
     9. Cavernous sinus thrombosis
    10. Orbital cellulitis

### DISCUSSION:
The patient was initially treated with intravenous antibiotics for presumed orbital cellulitis, but his symptoms did not improve. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits revealed bilateral orbital masses with involvement of the extraocular muscles and lacrimal glands (Figure 1B). A biopsy of the right orbital mass was performed, and histopathologic examination revealed a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with fibrosis and obliterative phlebitis (Figure 1C). Immunohistochemical staining was positive for IgG4 (Figure 1D). The patient was diagnosed with IgG4-related disease and started on prednisone, 60 mg/d, with rapid improvement in his symptoms. The dose was tapered over 6 months, and the patient remains in remission. The diagnosis of IgG4-related disease was confirmed by the presence of elevated serum IgG4 levels and the characteristic histopathologic findings. The patient’s history of Crohn disease and recent initiation of ustekinumab therapy were likely unrelated to the development of IgG4-related disease. This case highlights the importance of considering IgG4-related disease in the differential diagnosis of orbital inflammatory disorders, particularly in patients with bilateral involvement and a history of autoimmune disease.

### KEY POINTS:
* IgG4-related disease is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by elevated serum IgG4 levels and tissue infiltration by IgG4-positive plasma cells.
* The disease can affect various organs, including the orbits, and may present with a range of symptoms, including periorbital pain, swelling, and diplopia.
* The diagnosis of IgG4-related disease is based on a combination of clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic findings, including elevated serum IgG4 levels, characteristic radiologic features, and histopathologic evidence of IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltration.
* The treatment of IgG4-related disease typically involves corticosteroids, and in some cases, immunosuppressive therapy may be necessary.
* IgG4-related disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of orbital inflammatory disorders, particularly in patients with bilateral involvement and a history of autoimmune disease. 
### QUESTION:

### INPUT:
A woman in her 40s with a medical history of multiple sclerosis consulted for the sudden development of 2 adjacent nodules on the left arm. An excision with 1-cm margins of the left arm demonstrated desmoplastic melanoma with a Breslow thickness of 1 mm, and a left axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) had been performed 3 weeks before under general anesthesia. The patient was also being treated with subcutaneous interferon beta 1a for the multiple sclerosis. Physical examination revealed 2 indurated and mobile subcutaneous nodules on the anterior surface of the arm 5 cm distal to the surgical scar, the larger of them measuring 15 mm in diameter (Figure, A) and the smaller of them measuring 4 mm. When the arm was abducted to 90°, the patient denied pain but described a subtle tightness sensation on the arm. An excisional biopsy from the larger lesion was performed (Figure, B-D).

A 55-year-old man with advanced primary open-angle glaucoma presented with 1 day of decreased vision and eye pain. He had undergone trabeculectomy and 5-fluorouracil injection 1 month prior. On initial examination, his visual acuity was 20/25. He had diffuse conjunctival hyperemia without bleb purulence or leakage and more than 50 cells per high-power field of a 1 × 1-mm area of light on slitlamp biomicroscopy. He was treated for blebitis with topical fortified antibiotics but subsequently developed vitritis. He underwent vitreous tap and injection of vancomycin and amikacin followed by pars plana vitrectomy with bleb revision. Separate vitreous samples from each procedure were sent for Gram stain and bacterial and fungal culture on chocolate and Sabouraud agar with no growth. His eye pain worsened significantly, and ultrasound biomicroscopy showed scleral thickening (Figure 1A). Lab workup for autoimmune scleritis including tests for rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies was negative. He was admitted to the hospital and started intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam treatment. His vision continued to decline to counting fingers because of the development of a dense cataract with retrolenticular plaque (Figure 1B).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with blebitis and vitritis after trabeculectomy and 5-fluorouracil injection. Despite treatment, he developed worsening eye pain and vision loss. The presence of scleral thickening on ultrasound biomicroscopy and a retrolenticular plaque on examination suggested a fungal etiology. The patient underwent pars plana vitrectomy with bleb revision, and separate vitreous samples were sent for Gram stain and bacterial and fungal culture. Although the cultures were negative, the patient’s clinical course and examination findings were consistent with fungal endophthalmitis. The patient was treated with intravenous voriconazole and oral fluconazole, and his vision stabilized. The final diagnosis was fungal endophthalmitis, likely caused by Aspergillus species. This case highlights the importance of considering fungal endophthalmitis in patients with postoperative endophthalmitis, especially in the setting of blebitis and vitritis. Early recognition and treatment are crucial to prevent vision loss.

### INPUT:
A 57-year-old man presented to the emergency department with 5 months of epigastric pain and a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss. He had no fevers or night sweats. Physical examination was notable for oral thrush and mild epigastric tenderness. Results of a fourth-generation HIV Ab/Ag combination assay were positive, and subsequent testing showed a CD4 cell count of 16/mm3 and an HIV viral load greater than 10 million copies/mL. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis showed thickening of the walls of the stomach, duodenum, and colon as well as multiple masses in the right hepatic lobe measuring up to 6.9 cm in diameter. A core biopsy of one of the liver masses demonstrated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. He started antiretroviral therapy with bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir/alafenamide and chemotherapy with rituximab, etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (R-EPOCH). Four weeks after initiation of chemotherapy, the patient developed sudden onset of bright red blood per rectum, tachycardia, and hypotension. Mesenteric computed tomography angiography demonstrated active extravasation in the jejunum from a branch of the superior mesenteric artery. After unsuccessful coil embolization, he underwent open resection of 40 cm of distal small intestine; pathological examination of a stained section showed acute inflammation of the lamina propria, with crypt epithelial apoptosis and numerous cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusions with an “owl eye” appearance (Figure 1, left panel). Five weeks later, he developed blurred vision, and visual acuity testing revealed 20/50 vision in the left eye and 20/70 in the right eye. A dilated retinal examination revealed extensive macular hemorrhage in the left eye, with peripapillary whitening and perivascular hemorrhage with whitening along the superior vascular arcade (Figure, right panel).

     6. Intestinal perforation
     7. HIV-associated enteropathy
     8. Cryptosporidiosis
     9. Microsporidiosis
    10. Kaposi sarcoma

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a history of HIV/AIDS and lymphoma, which led to the diagnosis of CMV colitis and retinitis. The patient’s symptoms of epigastric pain, weight loss, and gastrointestinal bleeding were initially attributed to lymphoma, but the presence of owl eye inclusions on biopsy led to the diagnosis of CMV colitis. The patient’s subsequent development of blurred vision and retinal examination findings were consistent with CMV retinitis. The patient’s history of HIV/AIDS and lymphoma made him susceptible to opportunistic infections such as CMV. The patient’s symptoms and test results were consistent with CMV colitis and retinitis, making them the top-ranked differential diagnoses. The patient’s history of lymphoma and HIV/AIDS were also important differential diagnoses, but they were not the primary cause of the patient’s symptoms. The patient’s gastrointestinal bleeding was likely secondary to the CMV colitis, and the intestinal perforation was a complication of the colitis. The patient’s HIV-associated enteropathy, cryptosporidiosis, and microsporidiosis were less likely differential diagnoses given the patient’s symptoms and test results. Kaposi sarcoma was the least likely differential diagnosis given the patient’s symptoms and test results.

### INPUT:
A 49-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, intravenous drug abuse, and multiple sexual partners presented to the emergency department with painless vision loss in both eyes for 10 days, left eye worse than right eye, and photophobia in both eyes. His visual acuity was count fingers OD and 20/70 OS. Intraocular pressure was 20 mm Hg OD and 16 mm Hg OS. There were 1+ (10-12 cells/high-power field) anterior chamber cells in both eyes with very hazy posterior pole details in the right eye and minimal vitreous haze in the left eye. There was a hazy view to the posterior pole in the right eye with disc edema and multiple flame hemorrhages surrounding the nerve. Examination of the posterior pole in the left eye revealed partial obstruction of all vessels and a complete halo on the disc with numerous flame hemorrhages emanating from and surrounding the optic nerve, along with a few dot blot hemorrhages within the macula (Figure). His blood pressure was 173/137 mm Hg, but the rest of his vital signs were normal. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Syphilitic panuveitis and optic neuritis," 1. **Hypertensive retinopathy**: The patient's history of hypertension and the presence of flame hemorrhages and disc edema in both eyes suggest hypertensive retinopathy.
     2. **Diabetic retinopathy**: The patient's history of diabetes and the presence of dot blot hemorrhages in the left eye suggest diabetic retinopathy.
     3. **Central retinal vein occlusion**: The presence of flame hemorrhages and disc edema in both eyes, along with partial obstruction of all vessels in the left eye, suggest central retinal vein occlusion.
     4. **Occlusive vasculitis**: The presence of flame hemorrhages and disc edema in both eyes, along with partial obstruction of all vessels in the left eye, suggest occlusive vasculitis.
     5. **Neuroretinitis**: The presence of disc edema and flame hemorrhages in both eyes, along with photophobia, suggest neuroretinitis.
     6. **Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy**: The presence of photophobia and disc edema in both eyes, along with partial obstruction of all vessels in the left eye, suggest acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy.
     7. **Syphilitic retinitis**: The patient's history of multiple sexual partners and the presence of disc edema and flame hemorrhages in both eyes suggest syphilitic retinitis.
     8. **Toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis**: The presence of disc edema and flame hemorrhages in both eyes, along with partial obstruction of all vessels in the left eye, suggest toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis.
     9. **Sarcoidosis**: The presence of disc edema and flame hemorrhages in both eyes, along with partial obstruction of all vessels in the left eye, suggest sarcoidosis.
    10. **Vasculitis secondary to intravenous drug abuse**: The patient's history of intravenous drug abuse and the presence of disc edema and flame hemorrhages in both eyes suggest vasculitis secondary to intravenous drug abuse.

**Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:**

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with bilateral vision loss, photophobia, and disc edema with flame hemorrhages in both eyes. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the patient's history of intravenous drug abuse and multiple sexual partners helped narrow it down. The patient was treated with intravenous corticosteroids and antiviral therapy, and his vision improved to 20/20 OU, with resolution of his retinal findings. The final diagnosis was vasculitis secondary to intravenous drug abuse. This case highlights the importance of taking a thorough history, including social and sexual history, and considering the patient's risk factors when making a diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A male in his late teens presented with asymptomatic congenital papules, plaques, and nodules in a linear bilateral distribution following Blaschko lines on the scalp and face region. The papules and nodules appeared to grow as the boy grew, and some pedunculated lesions tended to fall off spontaneously. He had not received any prior treatment. The patient had no other significant medical history and denied having a family history of similar lesions. Clinical examination findings revealed multiple skin-colored, nontender soft papules of varying sizes protruding from the skin surface on the right cheek, forehead, and jaw, as well as on the anterior surface of the scalp, distributed along Blaschko lines, with sparse vellus hairs and multiple hair follicles on the lesions (Figure, A and B). However, no hair was observed on the lesion because the patient had shaved the hair on his face. An incisional biopsy of a pedunculated lesion above the left eyebrow was performed (Figure, B).

### RERANKED DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES WITH CONFIDENCE SCORES AND RATIONALE:
1. Nevus sebaceous (90%) - The patient's lesions were skin-colored, soft, and pedunculated, and they followed Blaschko lines. The histopathological findings of a papillomatous epidermis with a few horn cysts and a dense proliferation of sebaceous glands in the dermis supported the diagnosis of nevus sebaceous.
2. Epidermal nevus (80%) - The patient's lesions were skin-colored, soft, and pedunculated, and they followed Blaschko lines. The histopathological findings of a papillomatous epidermis with a few horn cysts supported the diagnosis of epidermal nevus. However, the presence of sebaceous glands in the dermis made nevus sebaceous a more likely diagnosis.
3. Linear epidermal nevus (70%) - The patient's lesions were skin-colored, soft, and pedunculated, and they followed Blaschko lines. The histopathological findings of a papillomatous epidermis with a few horn cysts supported the diagnosis of linear epidermal nevus. However, the presence of sebaceous glands in the dermis made nevus sebaceous a more likely diagnosis.
4. Inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus (60%) - The patient's lesions were skin-colored, soft, and pedunculated, and they followed Blaschko lines. The histopathological findings of a papillomatous epidermis with a few horn cysts supported the diagnosis of inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus. However, the absence of inflammatory changes in the dermis made this diagnosis less likely.
5. Linear porokeratosis (50%) - The patient's lesions were skin-colored, soft, and pedunculated, and they followed Blaschko lines. The histopathological findings of a papillomatous epidermis with a few horn cysts supported the diagnosis of linear porokeratosis. However, the presence of sebaceous glands in the dermis made this diagnosis less likely.
6. Linear lichen planus (40%) - The patient's lesions were skin-colored, soft, and pedunculated, and they followed Blaschko lines. The histopathological findings of a papillomatous epidermis with a few horn cysts did not support the diagnosis of linear lichen planus, which typically shows a lichenoid infiltrate in the dermis.
7. Linear psoriasis (30%) - The patient's lesions were skin-colored, soft, and pedunculated, and they followed Blaschko lines. The histopathological findings of a papillomatous epidermis with a few horn cysts did not support the diagnosis of linear psoriasis, which typically shows parakeratosis and neutrophils in the stratum corneum.
8. Linear Darier disease (20%) - The patient's lesions were skin-colored, soft, and pedunculated, and they followed Blaschko lines. The histopathological findings of a papillomatous epidermis with a few horn cysts did not support the diagnosis of linear Darier disease, which typically shows suprabasal acantholysis and dyskeratotic cells.
9. Linear lichen nitidus (10%) - The patient's lesions were skin-colored, soft, and pedunculated, and they followed Blaschko lines. The histopathological findings of a papillomatous epidermis with a few horn cysts did not support the diagnosis of linear lichen nitidus, which typically shows a granulomatous infiltrate in the dermis.
10. Linear syphilis (0%) - The patient's lesions were skin-colored, soft, and pedunculated, and they followed Blaschko lines.

### INPUT:
A previously healthy 25-year-old woman presented with headache, dysarthria, double vision, and dizziness for 1 week. She denied any history of fever, head trauma, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or cough. She had traveled to northeastern Brazil 2 months before the onset of the neurological symptoms. On examination, she had a mild right-side hemiparesis with hyperreflexia and hemiataxia. She could walk unassisted but presented with a broad base. There were no meningeal signs. She did not present with hepatosplenomegaly of lymphadenopathy. Her cranial magnetic resonance imaging  showed a T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintense lesion with heterogeneous gadolinium enhancement in the pons (Figure). There were no signs of diffusion restriction on diffusion-weighted imaging or hemorrhages on susceptibility-weighted imaging.

     7. Behçet disease
     8. Central nervous system vasculitis
     9. Brain abscess
     10. Metastatic tumor

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a brainstem lesion and a history of travel to an endemic area for neurocysticercosis. The magnetic resonance imaging findings were nonspecific, but the heterogeneous enhancement and the absence of diffusion restriction were more consistent with neurocysticercosis than with other differential diagnoses. The patient was treated with albendazole and dexamethasone, and her symptoms improved. The diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of Taenia solium antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid. Neurocysticercosis is a common cause of brain lesions in endemic areas, and it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with brainstem lesions, especially if they have a history of travel to these areas.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 20s was referred for evaluation of a 4-year history of recurrent pustular eruptions on her face, which initially presented while she was vacationing in Florida. She noted mild associated pruritus but denied burning sensation. The eruptions occurred intermittently, appearing as erythematous papules with prominent pustules, and were exacerbated by sunlight. On average, her lesions would resolve in 3 to 4 days with only mild background erythema by 5 to 7 days. Even mild sun exposure would induce the eruption, leading to frequent recurrences in summer months but long periods of remission in the fall through spring. Trials with various broad-spectrum sunscreens in combination with topical and oral antibiotics and topical ivermectin did not prevent flares or mitigate severity of eruptions when they occurred. She denied joint pain, fever, fatigue, changes in urine color, use of other topical or systemic medications, or presence of rashes elsewhere. She was otherwise healthy without other medical history. On physical examination, she was well appearing with numerous 1- to 2-mm monomorphous pustules over background erythema on the medial cheeks, chin, and nose (Figure, A). No nail fold capillary changes or mucosal lesions were observed. Serum analysis results for antinuclear, anti-SSA/Ro, and anti-SSB/La antibodies were negative. A 4-mm punch biopsy was taken from a representative lesion along the right jawline (Figure, B-D).

### INPUT:
A 39-year-old healthy woman without family history of malignancy found a mass in her right breast at 38 weeks of pregnancy. Prior to delivery, she underwent diagnostic ultrasound of the right breast, which showed a possible mass in the location of the palpable lesion that was most consistent with a normal island of fibroglandular tissue. Follow-up mammogram and ultrasound of the right breast (without axillary evaluation) were performed 6 months later, which showed an irregular 17-mm mass with associated pleomorphic calcifications in the same area. Ultrasound-guided biopsy was performed. Pathology showed high-grade, estrogen receptor–positive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). On postbiopsy physical examination, the patient had a palpable 2.5-cm right breast mass at the 3-o’clock position without palpable axillary lymphadenopathy. Surgical treatment with lumpectomy was recommended, and breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed prior to surgery to evaluate the extent of disease (Figure). Axial T2-weighted MRI at the level of the axilla revealed edema surrounding 2 enlarged, morphologically abnormal right level-1 axillary lymph nodes; axial postcontrast T1 fat-saturated MRI of the right breast revealed an irregular mass with irregular margins at the site of biopsy-proven DCIS. The patient reported receiving her second dose of COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) in the right arm the day before the breast MRI.

**Final diagnosis:** Metastatic axillary lymphadenopathy. The patient underwent axillary lymph node dissection, which showed 2 positive lymph nodes for metastatic ductal carcinoma in situ. The patient then underwent adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The patient is currently undergoing endocrine therapy and is disease-free. The patient’s axillary lymphadenopathy was likely related to metastatic disease rather than radiation-induced axillary lymphadenopathy from the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient’s breast MRI was performed 1 day after the COVID-19 vaccine, which is unlikely to cause axillary lymphadenopathy within 24 hours. The patient’s axillary lymphadenopathy was likely present before the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient’s breast MRI was performed to evaluate the extent of disease, and the axillary lymphadenopathy was an incidental finding.

### INPUT:
A 12-year-old girl presented for assessment of abnormal gait. A year prior, she was found to have bilateral panuveitis with occlusive retinal periphlebitis involving all quadrants of the central and peripheral retina with capillary nonperfusion (Figure 1). Her subsequent workup revealed elevated inflammatory markers and subcentimeter chest and abdominal lymph nodes. Given a positive interferon-γ release assay, therapy was initiated with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol (RIPE) and corticosteroids for presumed tuberculosis. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pediatric neurosarcoidosis," 1. **Tuberculosis**: Given the patient's positive interferon-γ release assay and response to RIPE therapy, tuberculosis is a strong consideration.
     2. **Sarcoidosis**: The patient's bilateral panuveitis and lymphadenopathy are consistent with sarcoidosis, which can also cause occlusive retinal periphlebitis.
     3. **Behçet's disease**: This multisystem vasculitis can cause occlusive retinal vasculitis, uveitis, and lymphadenopathy.
     4. **Juvenile idiopathic arthritis**: This condition can cause uveitis, and the patient's joint pain and stiffness could be related to arthritis.

**Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:**

1. **Sarcoidosis**: The patient's bilateral panuveitis, lymphadenopathy, and response to corticosteroids are consistent with sarcoidosis.
2. **Tuberculosis**: Although the patient responded to RIPE therapy, the lack of microbiological confirmation and the presence of lymphadenopathy make tuberculosis less likely.
3. **Behçet's disease**: The patient's occlusive retinal vasculitis and lymphadenopathy are consistent with Behçet's disease, but the lack of oral and genital ulcers make it less likely.
4. **Juvenile idiopathic arthritis**: The patient's uveitis and joint pain are consistent with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, but the lack of joint swelling and radiographic changes make it less likely.
5. **Lupus**: The patient's uveitis, lymphadenopathy, and joint pain are consistent with lupus, but the lack of skin changes and negative serology make it less likely.
6. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease**: The patient's uveitis, lymphadenopathy, and joint pain are consistent with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, but the lack of skin and hair changes make it less likely.

### INPUT:
A 51-year-old woman presented with a 1-month history of intense and worsening polyarthralgia and swelling of bilateral fingers and toes. There was no history of alopecia, oral ulcers, rashes, or Raynaud phenomenon. She did not report preceding fever, diarrhea, or dysuria. There was no history of weight loss or anorexia. Medical history included tertiary hyperparathyroidism related to end-stage kidney disease from chronic glomerulonephritis. The patient had successfully received an ABO-incompatible kidney transplant 1 year ago, but this was complicated by invasive fungal (Volvariella volvacea) infection of the central nervous system. Medications included tacrolimus (0.5 mg twice daily), prednisolone (10 mg daily), cinacalcet (12.5 mg daily), and voriconazole (500 mg daily). On examination, her fingers and toes were symmetrically and diffusely swollen and tender. There was no rash, enthesitis, psoriatic nail changes, clubbing, or lower limb edema. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Alkaline phosphatase level was elevated at 640 U/L (10.69 μkat/L) (reference range, 40-130 U/L [0.67-2.17 μkat/L]). Corrected calcium and parathyroid hormone levels were 10.88 mg/dL (2.71 mmol/L) (reference range, 8.6-10.2 mg/dL [2.15-2.55 mmol/L]) and 23.7 pmol/L (reference range, 1.3-9.3), respectively. Serum bilirubin, aspartate transferase, alanine transferase, creatinine, and phosphate levels were within reference ranges. Free thyroxine and thyrotropin levels were normal. Results of testing for rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibody were negative. Her chest radiograph was unremarkable. Radiography of her hands was performed (Figure).

### INPUT:
A 17-year-old previously healthy girl presented with 3 months of decreased vision in the right eye associated with throbbing pain with eye movement. The patient had no history of weakness, incontinence, or severe headaches. Initial presentation was notable for hand motion visual acuity with a 2+ relative afferent pupillary defect on the right; fundus examination revealed grade IV disc edema with obscuration of all major vessels on the disc (Figure, A). A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain with and without gadolinium contrast was degraded by motion and orthodontic artifact but was suggestive of optic nerve enhancement consistent with optic neuritis. Results of serology tests and cerebral spinal fluid analysis were negative for infectious and inflammatory etiologies, including syphilis, sarcoidosis, Lyme disease, viral etiologies, multiple sclerosis, and lupus.

Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:

     1. Optic nerve glioma
     2. Optic nerve sheath meningioma
     3. Compressive optic neuropathy
     4. Orbital inflammatory syndrome
     5. Orbital cellulitis
     6. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension
     7. Optic neuritis
     8. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy
     9. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy
    10. Central retinal vein occlusion

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s presentation with decreased vision, pain with eye movement, and disc edema was concerning for an optic neuropathy. The MRI findings of optic nerve enhancement were consistent with optic neuritis, but the lack of improvement with corticosteroids and the persistence of disc edema raised suspicion for a compressive lesion. The patient underwent a repeat MRI with fat suppression, which revealed a fusiform mass of the right optic nerve (Figure, B). The patient underwent a right optic nerve biopsy, which revealed a pilocytic astrocytoma (Figure, C). The patient underwent a gross total resection of the tumor and has since had stable vision.

This case highlights the importance of considering compressive lesions in the differential diagnosis of optic neuropathy, particularly in the setting of persistent disc edema and lack of improvement with corticosteroids. The patient’s age and the MRI findings of a fusiform mass of the optic nerve were concerning for an optic nerve glioma, which was confirmed on biopsy. The patient’s presentation and imaging findings were not typical for optic neuritis, and the diagnosis of optic nerve glioma was ultimately made through a combination of clinical suspicion and tissue diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A 46-year-old man presented with acute-onset weakness of his bilateral lower limbs for 3 days, accompanied by ascending numbness to just below his nipples. Three weeks prior, he had developed acute urinary retention. Neurological examination revealed weakness in bilateral lower limbs (Medical Research Council grade 4 on the right and grade 3 on the left), extensor plantar responses, and a sensory level at T6. Magnetic resonance imaging of his thoracic spine was performed 10 days after the onset of weakness and did not show any signal abnormalities or restricted diffusion. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis findings were remarkable for elevated protein (0.14 g/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10]) but white cell count (5 cells/mm3) and glucose levels (54.05 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555]) were normal. Cytology and flow cytometry were negative for malignancy. Antibodies to aquaporin 4 and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein were not detected. The patient developed a sudden worsening of weakness in his legs 2 weeks after initial presentation. Repeated thoracic spine imaging showed an area of T2 hyperintensity in the left posterolateral cord at T7, which did not enhance with contrast or show restricted diffusion (Figure 1A). Notably, he had a 4-year history of an asymptomatic papular skin eruption with more lesions developing in the last 4 months. These were distributed on the neck, trunk, and limbs, sparing his face, scalp, and genitalia (Figure 1B). Findings of extensive workup for malignancy, including full-body computed tomography scan, paraneoplastic antibody panel, and systemic autoimmune diseases (antinuclear antibody, antidouble stranded DNA, and myositis antibody panel), were negative. The skin papules were biopsied.

     8. Neuromyelitis optica
     9. Myelitis due to viral infection
     10. Myelitis due to vitamin B12 deficiency

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a subacute myelopathy and a history of asymptomatic skin lesions. The skin biopsy revealed noncaseating granulomas, which led to the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The patient’s neurological symptoms were attributed to neurosarcoidosis, which is a rare complication of sarcoidosis. The diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis was supported by the presence of a longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesion on magnetic resonance imaging, which is a common feature of neurosarcoidosis. The patient’s symptoms and magnetic resonance imaging findings were not typical of multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica, and the absence of oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid made these diagnoses less likely. The patient did not have any features of systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome, or Behçet disease, making these diagnoses less likely. The patient did not have any history of viral infection, and the cerebrospinal fluid analysis did not suggest an infectious cause. Vitamin B12 deficiency was also unlikely given the normal vitamin B12 levels. The patient was treated with high-dose corticosteroids and showed significant improvement in his symptoms. The diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis was confirmed by the presence of noncaseating granulomas in the skin biopsy and the patient’s response to corticosteroid therapy. This case highlights the importance of considering neurosarcoidosis in patients presenting with subacute myelopathy and skin lesions.

### INPUT:
A man in his 30s, employed as a painter, presented with multiple painless nodules on his right cheek of 4 years’ duration. He reported episodic breathlessness, cough, and wheezing with expectoration of brownish sputum, exacerbated with exposure to hay dust, in the past 5 years. He also reported recent-onset headache while reading. Physical examination revealed a depressed plaque measuring 6 × 4 cm in the right infraorbital region, surrounded by multiple nodules of sizes ranging from 1 × 1 cm to 5 × 1 cm (Figure, A). The nodules were firm, mobile, and nontender on palpation. Local temperature was normal. There was proptosis of the right eye with mild restriction of extraocular movements on lateral gaze. Examination of the oral cavity revealed dental caries, while gingivolabial sulcus was free on bidigital examination. Nasal mucosa was normal. Respiratory system examination revealed occasional polyphonic wheeze. Chest radiography imaging showed nodular opacities in right upper zone and bronchiectasis. Punch biopsy from 1 nodule was sent for histopathological and microbiological examination (Figure, B and C).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with multiple painless nodules on the right cheek, with a history of cough, wheezing, and expectoration of brownish sputum. The nodules were firm, mobile, and nontender on palpation. The patient also had proptosis of the right eye with mild restriction of extraocular movements on lateral gaze. The histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen showed granulomatous inflammation with Langhans giant cells and caseation necrosis. The Ziehl-Neelsen stain was positive for acid-fast bacilli. The patient was diagnosed with cutaneous tuberculosis. The patient was started on antitubercular therapy (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide) and responded well to treatment. The patient was also referred to a pulmonologist for further evaluation and management of pulmonary tuberculosis.

### LESSONS LEARNED:
Cutaneous tuberculosis is a rare manifestation of tuberculosis, accounting for 1% to 2% of all cases. It can present in various forms, including lupus vulgaris, scrofuloderma, and tuberculids. The diagnosis is often delayed due to the rarity of the condition and the lack of awareness among clinicians. A high index of suspicion is necessary for early diagnosis and treatment. The presence of granulomatous inflammation with Langhans giant cells and caseation necrosis on histopathological examination, along with a positive Ziehl-Neelsen stain, is diagnostic of cutaneous tuberculosis. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent complications and improve outcomes.

### INPUT:
A 69-year-old man presented with a 1-month history of progressive skin discoloration. His medical history included chronic kidney disease, chronic hepatitis C infection, cirrhosis, ischemic cardiomyopathy with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and atrial fibrillation with prophylactic apixaban. He had recurrent staphylococcus bacteremia due to infection of an ICD lead and had been treated for the past 6 months with minocycline, 100 mg twice daily. His arms had been purple and bruise-like for several years but turned a near black color 1 month ago. He reported no discoloration of his sweat or urine. He had no history of malnutrition and reported infrequent alcohol use. Physical examination showed dense blue-black skin pigmentation of his forearms, dorsal hands, legs, and dorsal feet, as well as blue discoloration of his sclerae and teeth (Figure 1). He had normal-colored nails and oral mucosa. Laboratory studies showed white blood cell count of 15 800/μL (reference range, 4000-11 000/μL), hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL (reference, 13.5-17.5 g/dL), platelet count of 58 000/μL (reference, 150 000-400 000/μL), and INR of 1.8 (reference, 0.8-1.1). Complete metabolic panel showed increased creatinine (1.51 mg/dL; reference, 0.64-1.27 mg/dL) and elevated total bilirubin (1.7 mg/dL; reference range, 0.3-1.2 mg/dL). His estimated glomerular filtration rate was 40 mL/min/1.73 m2. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Minocycline-induced hyperpigmentation," 1. **Minocycline-induced hyperpigmentation**: Minocycline is a known cause of skin hyperpigmentation, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease. The patient's history of minocycline use and the distribution of the hyperpigmentation are consistent with this diagnosis.
     2. **Argyria**: Argyria is a rare condition caused by exposure to silver, which can cause blue-gray discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes. The patient's history of ICD lead infection and treatment with antibiotics raises the possibility of silver exposure.
     3. **Hemochromatosis**: Hemochromatosis is an inherited disorder of iron metabolism that can cause skin hyperpigmentation, particularly in sun-exposed areas. The patient's history of cirrhosis and elevated bilirubin levels raise the possibility of hemochromatosis.
     4. **Wilson disease**: Wilson disease is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism that can cause skin hyperpigmentation, particularly in sun-exposed areas. The patient's history of liver disease and elevated bilirubin levels raise the possibility of Wilson disease.
     5. **Addison disease**: Addison disease is a rare endocrine disorder that can cause skin hyperpigmentation, particularly in sun-exposed areas. The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and elevated creatinine levels raise the possibility of Addison disease.
     6. **Porphyria**: Porphyria is a group of rare genetic disorders that can cause skin hyperpigmentation, particularly in sun-exposed areas. The patient's history of liver disease and elevated bilirubin levels raise the possibility of porphyria.
     7. **Chronic kidney disease–associated hyperpigmentation**: Chronic kidney disease can cause skin hyperpigmentation, particularly in patients with advanced disease. The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and elevated creatinine levels raise the possibility of chronic kidney disease–associated hyperpigmentation.
     8. **Cirrhosis-associated hyperpigmentation**: Cirrhosis can cause skin hyperpigmentation, particularly in patients with advanced disease. The patient's history of cirrhosis and elevated bilirubin levels raise the possibility of cirrhosis-associated hyperpigmentation.
     9. **Methemoglobinemia**: Methemoglobinemia is a rare condition caused by exposure to certain medications or chemicals that can cause blue discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes. The patient's history of minocycline use raises the possibility of methemoglobinemia.
    10. **Pseudocholinesterase deficiency**: Pseudocholinesterase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that can cause skin hyperpigmentation, particularly in sun-exposed areas. The patient's history of liver disease and elevated bilirubin levels raise the possibility of pseudocholinesterase deficiency.

**Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:**

1. **Minocycline-induced hyperpigmentation**
2. **Chronic kidney disease–associated hyperpigmentation**
3. **Cirrhosis-associated hyperpigmentation**

5. **Wilson disease**
6. **Addison disease**
7. **Porphyria**
8. **Argyria**
9. **Methemoglobinemia**
10. **Pseudocholinesterase deficiency**

**Final diagnosis:** Minocycline-induced hyperpigmentation. The patient's skin hyperpigmentation resolved after discontinuation of minocycline therapy. The patient's skin returned to its baseline purple color, and his scleral and dental discoloration resolved. The patient's creatinine and bilirubin levels remained stable, and his liver disease remained well controlled. The patient's ICD lead infection was treated with antibiotics, and he underwent successful lead extraction. He was transitioned to alternative antibiotics and has remained free of infection. The patient's skin hyperpigmentation has not recurred.

### INPUT:
A 46-year-old man presented with a 2-week history of a persistent blurred area in his right lower visual field of both eyes. He noticed colors surrounding the dark area that lasted 2 to 3 minutes at a time and occurred multiple times per day. His medical history was significant for dyslipidemia for which he took rosuvastatin. He also reported feeling lethargic, with polydipsia and a dull mild holocephalic headache during this period. Ophthalmological examination revealed a visual acuity of 20/20 OU, pupils were equal and reactive to light with no relative afferent pupillary defect, and color vision was normal. Dilated fundus examination was normal. Humphrey 24-2 Swedish interactive threshold algorithm fast visual field testing revealed a right homonymous hemianopia denser inferiorly (Figure, A). An urgent noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head was obtained and was normal (Figure, B). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was initially reported as normal but revealed subtle abnormal T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity involving the left occipital cortex after further review (Figure, B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Homonymous hemianopia secondary to nonketotic hyperglycemia," 1. **Occipital lobe stroke**: The patient's symptoms of homonymous hemianopia and headache, along with the MRI findings, suggest an acute ischemic stroke in the left occipital lobe.
     2. **Migraine**: The patient's symptoms of visual field defect, headache, and photopsia are consistent with a migraine aura.
     3. **Optic neuritis**: The patient's symptoms of visual field defect and photopsia are consistent with optic neuritis, although the lack of pain and normal visual acuity make this less likely.
     4. **Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy**: The patient's symptoms of visual field defect and headache are consistent with anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, although the lack of optic disc edema and normal visual acuity make this less likely.
     5. **Pituitary apoplexy**: The patient's symptoms of headache and visual field defect are consistent with pituitary apoplexy, although the lack of other neurological symptoms and normal CT scan make this less likely.
     6. **Cerebral vasculitis**: The patient's symptoms of headache and visual field defect are consistent with cerebral vasculitis, although the lack of other neurological symptoms and normal CT scan make this less likely.
     7. **Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome**: The patient's symptoms of headache, visual field defect, and MRI findings are consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, although the lack of other neurological symptoms and normal blood pressure make this less likely.
     8. **Occipital lobe seizure**: The patient's symptoms of visual field defect and photopsia are consistent with an occipital lobe seizure, although the lack of other seizure symptoms and normal electroencephalogram make this less likely.
     9. **Multiple sclerosis**: The patient's symptoms of visual field defect and photopsia are consistent with multiple sclerosis, although the lack of other neurological symptoms and normal MRI make this less likely.
    10. **Transient ischemic attack**: The patient's symptoms of visual field defect and headache are consistent with a transient ischemic attack, although the lack of other neurological symptoms and normal CT scan make this less likely.

**Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:**

6. **Optic neuritis**: The patient's symptoms of visual field defect and photopsia are consistent with optic neuritis.
7. **Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy**: The patient's symptoms of visual field defect and headache are consistent with anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.
8. **Occipital lobe seizure**: The patient's symptoms of visual field defect and photopsia are consistent with an occipital lobe seizure.

10. **Transient ischemic attack**: The patient's symptoms of visual field defect and headache are consistent with a transient ischemic attack.

**Final diagnosis:** Occipital lobe stroke.

**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of homonymous hemianopia and headache, along with the MRI findings, suggest an acute ischemic stroke in the left occipital lobe. The patient's symptoms of visual field defect, headache, and photopsia are consistent with a migraine aura, but the presence of a homonymous hemianopia and the MRI findings make a stroke more likely. The patient's symptoms of headache, visual field defect, and MRI findings are consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, but the lack of other neurological symptoms and normal blood pressure make this less likely. The patient's symptoms of headache and visual field defect are consistent with cerebral vasculitis, pituitary apoplexy, optic neuritis, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, occipital lobe seizure, multiple sclerosis, and transient ischemic attack, but the presence of a homonymous hemianopia and the MRI findings make a stroke more likely.

### INPUT:
A 63-year-old woman was referred by optometry after waking up with cloudy vision in the left eye and an ache around the left brow. Visual acuity was 20/20 OD and light perception OS. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 15 mm Hg OD and 54 mm Hg OS. Anterior segment examination of the left eye was remarkable for a large cystic iris stromal lesion from the 2- to 7-o’clock position with iris-cornea touch. The anterior chamber was shallow in the area of the enlarged cystic lesion with a large amount of pigmented cells. The pupil was irregular with blood at the pupillary margin. Her intraocular lens was not visible because of occlusion by a cystic lesion behind the iris (Figure 1). Her ocular history was notable for indiscriminate trauma to her left eye, primary open-angle glaucoma in both eyes treated with dorzolamide hydrochloride and brimonidine tartrate, and pseudophakia in both eyes. Four years prior, an inferior cystic iris stromal lesion was discovered in the left eye that measured approximately 5 × 2 mm in basal dimensions at the slitlamp. Fine-needle aspiration was negative for malignancy, and the lesion was managed by close follow-up. 
### OUTPUT:

     6. Iris granuloma
     7. Iris foreign body
     8. Iris neovascularization
     9. Iris implantation cyst
    10. Iris hemorrhage

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a large cystic iris stromal lesion that had grown significantly since the last examination. The lesion was causing iris-cornea touch and angle closure glaucoma. The patient had a history of trauma to the left eye, which may have contributed to the growth of the lesion. The differential diagnosis includes iris melanoma, iris cyst, iris abscess, iris metastasis, iris lymphoma, iris granuloma, iris foreign body, iris neovascularization, iris implantation cyst, and iris hemorrhage. Iris melanoma is the top differential diagnosis because of the rapid growth of the lesion and the presence of blood at the pupillary margin. Iris cyst is the second differential diagnosis because of the cystic appearance of the lesion. Iris abscess is also a possibility because of the presence of blood at the pupillary margin and the rapid growth of the lesion. Iris metastasis, iris lymphoma, and iris granuloma are also possible differential diagnoses because of the rapid growth of the lesion. Iris foreign body is a less likely differential diagnosis because there is no history of recent trauma. Iris neovascularization and iris implantation cyst are also less likely differential diagnoses because of the cystic appearance of the lesion. Iris hemorrhage is the least likely differential diagnosis because of the cystic appearance of the lesion and the presence of blood at the pupillary margin. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy or excisional biopsy of the lesion would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. The patient was referred to an ocular oncologist for further evaluation and management.

### INPUT:
A 72-year-old woman presented with new-onset decreased vision in the right eye. Her ocular history included pseudoexfoliation syndrome and glaucomatous optic neuropathy in the right eye. Past ocular surgery included uncomplicated trabeculectomy in the right eye treated with mitomycin C (3 months prior) and no ocular surgery history in the left eye. Her medical history included pulmonary Mycobacterium avium infection secondary to hypogammaglobulinemia. Computed tomography scan 2 months prior exhibited reactivation and she started treatment with clarithromycin (1000 mg/d), ethambutol (15 mg/kg/d), and rifabutin (300 mg/d). Best-corrected visual acuity was hand motions OD and 20/20 OS. Intraocular pressures were 4 mm Hg ODand 13 mm Hg OS. Anterior segment examination of the right eye showed substantial conjunctival hyperemia and substantial cellular response in the anterior chamber (2 to 3+) along with a 1-mm hypopyon. There was no leak at the trabeculectomy bleb (negative Seidel test). B-scan ultrasonography showed no retinal detachment or mass. Presumed diagnosis of bleb-related infectious endophthalmitis was made and she was referred for treatment. Pars plana vitrectomy was performed, including vitreous sampling, and showed very light growth of Staphylococcus aureus in 1 colony on 1 plate, which was highly suspicious for contaminant. Intravitreal amikacin and vancomycin were administered after vitreous sampling was performed. Postoperatively, the patient initiated treatment with topical antibiotics and corticosteroids. Her visual acuity returned to 20/30. Two months later, she presented again with a similar acute vision loss in the left eye (counting fingers). Anterior segment examination showed conjunctival hyperemia, cellular reaction, and a small hypopyon (Figure).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with bilateral, sequential, acute vision loss with hypopyon and anterior chamber reaction. The differential diagnosis was broad, including infectious and noninfectious causes. The patient’s history of hypogammaglobulinemia and treatment with immunosuppressive medications increased the risk of opportunistic infections. The presence of Mycobacterium avium complex in the patient’s medical history and the bilateral nature of the disease made it a strong contender for the diagnosis. The patient’s response to treatment with antibiotics and corticosteroids in the right eye and the lack of growth in the vitreous sample further supported this diagnosis. The patient’s history of pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex infection and the bilateral nature of the disease made it the most likely diagnosis. The patient was treated with systemic antibiotics and corticosteroids, and her vision improved in both eyes. The patient’s case highlights the importance of considering the patient’s medical history and the possibility of opportunistic infections in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia.

### INPUT:
A young man presented to the clinic with large, purple plaques on the left lower extremity. The plaques had been present for years, but the patient noted enlargement and darkening for the past 5 years. The lesions were asymptomatic with no associated pruritus, bleeding, or pain. No treatments or diagnostic workup had been attempted prior to presentation. The patient was otherwise healthy and was a never-smoker with no history of hypertension, atherosclerotic disease, or HIV. Physical examination revealed dark violaceous plaques, scattered subcutaneous nodules, and swelling to the mid-shin of the left lower extremity (Figure, A). There was mild warmth noted, but no palpable bruits. Complete metabolic panel, complete blood cell count, prothrombin, and serology were negative or within normal limits. A punch biopsy was performed and submitted for histopathologic analysis (Figure, B).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a rare and aggressive vascular tumor, lymphangiosarcoma. The diagnosis was confirmed by histopathologic analysis, which revealed a proliferation of atypical endothelial cells with a lymphatic phenotype. The patient was referred to a multidisciplinary team for further management, including surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. Lymphangiosarcoma is a rare and aggressive tumor that arises from lymphatic vessels. It is often associated with chronic lymphedema, as seen in this patient. The differential diagnosis includes other vascular tumors, such as Kaposi sarcoma and angiosarcoma, as well as lymphatic malformations and lymphedema. The diagnosis of lymphangiosarcoma is often delayed, and the prognosis is poor, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 20%. Early recognition and aggressive management are essential to improve patient outcomes.

### INPUT:
A 57-year-old man with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) refractory to multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ie, imatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib) presented for subacute-onset blurry vision in both eyes. He had been admitted for an upcoming bone marrow transplant. The patient had floaters without flashes and denied any eye pain. A review of symptoms found chronic fatigue and a new, mild headache beginning a few days prior. On examination, his visual acuity was 20/50 OU; intraocular pressures were 15 mm Hg OD and 13 mm Hg OS; and pupils were equal, round, and reactive, without a relative afferent pupillary defect. Extraocular movements, confrontational visual fields, and Ishihara color plates were full. An anterior segment examination had normal results. A fundus examination revealed clinically significant peripapillary intraretinal and preretinal hemorrhages obscuring the optic disc margins of both eyes (Figure 1). A peripheral retinal examination of both eyes had normal results.

     7. Optic neuritis
     8. Central serous chorioretinopathy
     9. Radiation retinopathy
     10. Sickle cell retinopathy

The patient was diagnosed with leukemic retinopathy secondary to CML. The patient underwent a bone marrow transplant and received intravitreal bevacizumab for the retinal hemorrhages. The patient’s vision improved to 20/30 OU, and the retinal hemorrhages resolved. The patient was lost to follow-up after the transplant. 
### DISCUSSION:
Leukemic retinopathy is a rare complication of CML, characterized by retinal hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, and optic disc edema. The pathogenesis is thought to be related to anemia, hyperviscosity, and leukostasis. The patient’s history of CML, refractory to multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and the presence of bilateral peripapillary intraretinal and preretinal hemorrhages support the diagnosis of leukemic retinopathy. The patient’s vision improved after treatment with intravitreal bevacizumab and bone marrow transplant, further supporting the diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A 42-year-old woman was referred for ophthalmologic evaluation after developing blurry vision in the right eye 30 days prior. She had a history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and migraine headaches. Her medications included atorvastatin, carvedilol, and norethindrone. Dilated-fundus examination of the right eye showed a single cotton-wool spot (indicating local retinal ischemia), with intraretinal hemorrhage in the inferotemporal quadrant. Ultrawide-field imaging showed a cotton-wool spot on the left fundus (Figure 1A, right) and a peripheral arterial occlusion in the right eye (Figure 1A, left), and fluorescein angiographic study of the right eye demonstrated an area of blockage corresponding to intraretinal hemorrhage and venous hyperfluorescence (Figure 1B). The patient was afebrile, with pulse 110 beats/min and blood pressure of 188/99 mm Hg. Auscultation over the heart apex revealed a holosystolic ejection murmur (grade 2/6). Laboratory testing showed normal complete blood cell count and thyrotropin level and negative results for autoantibodies against Sm, SSA, SSB, Scl-70, Jo-1, centromere, chromatin, ribonucleoprotein, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was mildly elevated (30 mm/h). Results of testing for antinuclear antibodies were positive at low titer (1:40, homogenous pattern) with positive dsDNA (5.0 IU/mL; negative if <4.0 IU/mL). Blood cultures were negative for bacterial or fungal growth after 5 days. An echocardiogram revealed pedunculated and mobile aortic valve vegetations.

     2. Systemic lupus erythematosus
     3. Antiphospholipid syndrome
     4. Retinal vasculitis

     6. Sarcoidosis
     7. Hypertensive retinopathy
     8. Central retinal vein occlusion
     9. Diabetic retinopathy
    10. Giant cell arteritis

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a cotton-wool spot and intraretinal hemorrhage in the right eye, which are signs of retinal ischemia. The differential diagnosis includes various conditions that cause retinal ischemia, such as infective endocarditis, systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, retinal vasculitis, Behçet disease, and sarcoidosis. The patient’s history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia also raises the possibility of hypertensive retinopathy. The absence of diabetes and the lack of diabetic retinopathy changes on examination make diabetic retinopathy less likely. The patient’s age and the absence of symptoms of giant cell arteritis make this diagnosis less likely as well.

The patient’s echocardiogram results showing pedunculated and mobile aortic valve vegetations support the diagnosis of infective endocarditis. The patient’s positive results for antinuclear antibodies and dsDNA, although at low titer, suggest the possibility of systemic lupus erythematosus or antiphospholipid syndrome. However, the patient’s lack of other symptoms and signs of these conditions, such as joint pain, rash, or oral ulcers, makes them less likely. The patient’s fluorescein angiographic study results showing blockage corresponding to intraretinal hemorrhage and venous hyperfluorescence are consistent with retinal vasculitis, but the patient’s lack of other symptoms and signs of this condition, such as uveitis or vitritis, makes it less likely. The patient’s lack of symptoms and signs of Behçet disease, such as oral and genital ulcers, and sarcoidosis, such as uveitis, hilar adenopathy, or skin lesions, makes these diagnoses less likely as well.

In conclusion, the patient’s diagnosis is most likely infective endocarditis, given the echocardiogram results showing pedunculated and mobile aortic valve vegetations. The patient’s positive results for antinuclear antibodies and dsDNA suggest the possibility of systemic lupus erythematosus or antiphospholipid syndrome, but these diagnoses are less likely given the patient’s lack of other symptoms and signs of these conditions. The patient’s fluorescein angiographic study results are consistent with retinal vasculitis, but this diagnosis is also less likely given the patient’s lack of other symptoms and signs of this condition. The patient’s history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia raises the possibility of hypertensive retinopathy, but this diagnosis is also less likely given the patient’s lack of other signs of this condition, such as arteriovenous nicking and flame hemorrhages. Diabetic retinopathy and giant cell arteritis are the least likely diagnoses given the patient’s lack of diabetes and symptoms of giant cell arteritis.

### INPUT:
A 68-year-old man presented to the clinic with bilateral eye redness and pain for the past 6 months. He had a history of dry eye disease for which he was treated with preservative-free artificial tears. He also noted a medical history of well-controlled HIV with highly active antiretroviral therapy. His last CD 4 lymphocyte count was 750 cells/mm3 with an undetectable viral load. A review of system produced negative results, including absence of weight loss, fevers, headache, joint pain, respiratory symptoms, or skin rash. The patient reported having unprotected sexual contact with multiple male partners in the past few years. On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Intraocular pressure was 12 mm Hg OD and 14 mm Hg OS. Slitlamp examination demonstrated diffuse scleral injection in both eyes without any scleral thinning. The redness did not blanch after administration of phenylephrine, 10% (Figure 1). Both eyes appeared to be moderately tender to touch. The rest of the anterior segment examination was within normal limits without any evidence of intraocular inflammation. Dilated fundus examination was also unremarkable in both eyes.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with bilateral eye redness and pain, which was not blanching with phenylephrine, 10%. This suggested that the redness was not due to conjunctival injection. The patient was HIV positive, which made us consider infectious causes such as syphilis and Kaposi sarcoma. The patient also had a history of unprotected sexual contact, which increased the likelihood of syphilis. The patient was also at risk for other sexually transmitted infections. The patient’s symptoms were not typical of episcleritis, which is usually a benign condition. The patient’s symptoms were more consistent with scleritis, which is a more serious condition that can lead to vision loss if not treated promptly. The patient’s symptoms were also consistent with Behçet disease, which is a multisystem disorder that can cause ocular inflammation. The patient’s symptoms were also consistent with sarcoidosis, which is a multisystem disorder that can cause ocular inflammation. The patient’s symptoms were not typical of anterior uveitis, which usually presents with eye pain, photophobia, and blurred vision. The patient’s symptoms were not typical of herpes zoster ophthalmicus, which usually presents with a history of shingles and a characteristic rash. The patient’s symptoms were not typical of conjunctivitis, which usually presents with discharge and itching. The patient’s symptoms were not typical of dry eye disease, which usually presents with burning and itching. The patient was referred to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation and management.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 50s with a history of nasal-type natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma (diagnosed 2 years prior; treated with pembrolizumab and methotrexate, ifosfamide, etoposide, dexamethasone, and pegaspargase) and chronic pulmonary coccidiomycosis being treated with fluconazole was admitted for fever, hypotension, and rash. Three months prior, pembrolizumab treatment was stopped because of a widespread morbilliform reaction, which had resolved completely 6 to 8 weeks before admission. The new widespread, asymptomatic skin eruption had been ongoing for 1 to 2 weeks and appeared different from her pembrolizumab reaction. A complete blood cell count was notable for a normal white blood cell count of 4100/μL, normal absolute neutrophil count of 2940/μL, chronic normocytic anemia (hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL), and chronic thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 62 ×103/μL). Blood culture results showed no growth at 1 week. Serum β-D-glucan, galactomannan, Coccidioides antibody by complement fixation, and immunodiffusion results were negative. Respiratory viral panel and SARS-CoV-2 test results were negative. Total body skin examination findings were notable for widespread, nontender, erythematous patches and thin plaques, some with prominent overlying telangiectases and hyperpigmentation (Figure, A). A punch biopsy of a representative lesion was performed (Figure, B-D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Intravascular involvement by NK/T-cell lymphoma," 1. **Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma**: Given the patient's history of nasal-type NK/T-cell lymphoma, the possibility of cutaneous involvement or relapse should be considered.
     2. **Cutaneous adverse reaction to pembrolizumab**: Although the patient's pembrolizumab treatment was stopped 3 months prior, a delayed reaction cannot be ruled out.
     3. **Cutaneous adverse reaction to fluconazole**: The patient's chronic use of fluconazole could be contributing to the skin eruption.
     4. **Coccidioidomycosis**: The patient's history of chronic pulmonary coccidiomycosis and the presence of telangiectases on the skin lesions raise the possibility of disseminated coccidioidomycosis.
     5. **Systemic lupus erythematosus**: The patient's widespread skin eruption, telangiectases, and history of thrombocytopenia suggest the possibility of systemic lupus erythematosus.
     6. **Dermatomyositis**: The patient's skin eruption, telangiectases, and history of thrombocytopenia are also consistent with dermatomyositis.
     7. **Vasculitis**: The patient's skin eruption, telangiectases, and history of thrombocytopenia raise the possibility of vasculitis.
     8. **Cutaneous sarcoidosis**: The patient's skin eruption, telangiectases, and history of thrombocytopenia are also consistent with cutaneous sarcoidosis.
     9. **Mycosis fungoides**: The patient's skin eruption, telangiectases, and history of lymphoma suggest the possibility of mycosis fungoides.
    10. **Poikiloderma atrophicans vasculare**: The patient's skin eruption, telangiectases, and history of thrombocytopenia are also consistent with poikiloderma atrophicans vasculare.

**Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:**

1. **Poikiloderma atrophicans vasculare**: The patient's skin eruption, telangiectases, and history of thrombocytopenia are most consistent with poikiloderma atrophicans vasculare.
2. **Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma**: Given the patient's history of nasal-type NK/T-cell lymphoma, the possibility of cutaneous involvement or relapse should be considered.
3. **Cutaneous adverse reaction to pembrolizumab**: Although the patient's pembrolizumab treatment was stopped 3 months prior, a delayed reaction cannot be ruled out.
4. **Cutaneous adverse reaction to fluconazole**: The patient's chronic use of fluconazole could be contributing to the skin eruption.
5. **Coccidioidomycosis**: The patient's history of chronic pulmonary coccidiomycosis and the presence of telangiectases on the skin lesions raise the possibility of disseminated coccidioidomycosis.
6. **Systemic lupus erythematosus**: The patient's widespread skin eruption, telangiectases, and history of thrombocytopenia suggest the possibility of systemic lupus erythematosus.
7. **Dermatomyositis**: The patient's skin eruption, telangiectases, and history of thrombocytopenia are also consistent with dermatomyositis.
8. **Vasculitis**: The patient's skin eruption, telangiectases, and history of thrombocytopenia raise the possibility of vasculitis.
9. **Cutaneous sarcoidosis**: The patient's skin eruption, telangiectases, and history of thrombocytopenia are also consistent with cutaneous sarcoidosis.
10. **Mycosis fungoides**: The patient's skin eruption, telangiectases, and history of lymphoma suggest the possibility of mycosis fungoides.

**Final diagnosis:** Poikiloderma atrophicans vasculare.

**Reasoning:** The patient's widespread, asymptomatic skin eruption with telangiectases and hyperpigmentation, along with her history of thrombocytopenia, is most consistent with poikiloderma atrophicans vasculare. The patient's history of nasal-type NK/T-cell lymphoma and pembrolizumab treatment are important considerations, but the skin biopsy findings and clinical presentation are not consistent with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma or a cutaneous adverse reaction to pembrolizumab. The patient's chronic use of fluconazole and history of coccidioidomycosis are also important considerations, but the skin biopsy findings and clinical presentation are not consistent with a cutaneous adverse reaction to fluconazole or disseminated coccidioidomycosis. The patient's skin eruption, telangiectases, and history of thrombocytopenia are also consistent with systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, vasculitis, cutaneous sarcoidosis, and mycosis fungoides, but the skin biopsy findings and clinical presentation are most consistent with poikiloderma atrophicans vasculare.

### INPUT:
A 59-year-old man presented with progressive hoarseness and dyspnea over a 2-month period. Fifteen months previously, he had undergone allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) with a matched related donor for treatment of fms-like tyrosine kinase (FLT3) internal tandem duplication–mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The patient had been diagnosed with chronic gastrointestinal graft-vs-host disease after a workup for diarrhea. Results of a restaging bone marrow biopsy 2 weeks prior to presentation showed no evidence of leukemia. Physical examination findings revealed no neck masses or abnormalities, but the patient was noted to be severely dysphonic and stridulous. Flexible laryngoscopy findings demonstrated a right vocal fold neoplasm crossing the posterior commissure with associated bilateral vocal fold motion impairment and obstruction of the glottic airway (Figure, A). Awake tracheostomy was performed for airway protection, and biopsy of the neoplasm was obtained via operative microlaryngoscopy (Figure, B). Histologic findings demonstrated diffuse infiltrate of large cells with irregular nuclear contours, vesicular chromatin, and prominent nucleoli (Figure, C). Immunohistochemical stains showed CD33, CD43, and CD117 positivity, with a subset positive for CD7 and myeloperoxidase. Stains were negative for CD3, CD20, and cytokeratin expression.

     8. Laryngeal graft-vs-host disease
     9. Laryngeal papillomatosis
     10. Laryngeal metastasis

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s history of AML and recent allo-SCT, along with the histopathologic findings of a diffuse infiltrate of large cells with myeloid markers, strongly support the diagnosis of laryngeal relapse of AML. The patient’s history of chronic gastrointestinal graft-vs-host disease and the presence of dysphonia and dyspnea also support this diagnosis. The patient’s history of FLT3 internal tandem duplication–mutated AML and the presence of CD117 positivity on immunohistochemical stains further support this diagnosis. The patient’s history of allo-SCT and the presence of a diffuse infiltrate of large cells with myeloid markers make laryngeal lymphoma less likely. The patient’s history of AML and the presence of myeloid markers on immunohistochemical stains make laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma less likely. The patient’s history of AML and the presence of a diffuse infiltrate of large cells with myeloid markers make laryngeal granuloma, laryngeal amyloidosis, laryngeal sarcoidosis, laryngeal tuberculosis, laryngeal graft-vs-host disease, laryngeal papillomatosis, and laryngeal metastasis less likely. The patient’s history of AML and the presence of myeloid markers on immunohistochemical stains make laryngeal relapse of AML the most likely diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A 40-year-old man presented with a large left neck mass in the setting of recently treated mixed nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT) of the right testicle with metastasis to the retroperitoneal and mediastinal lymph nodes. He was treated with a right radical orchiectomy and 4 cycles of etoposide, ifosfamide, and cisplatin (VIP) chemotherapy with resulting reduction in metastatic tumor burden and normalization of α-fetoprotein and β-human chorionic gonadotropin. The patient’s neck swelling, which initially decreased in size while undergoing chemotherapy, progressively enlarged shortly after concluding treatment. He underwent magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography of the neck that showed a clearly defined, bulky supraclavicular mass confined to left neck levels 3, 4, and 5 (Figure).

The patient underwent a left neck dissection, and the final pathologic diagnosis was a mature teratoma, which is a type of germ cell tumor. The patient is currently undergoing surveillance for potential recurrence. This case highlights the importance of considering the patient’s medical history and the potential for metastatic disease when evaluating a neck mass.

### KEY POINTS:
* A 40-year-old man presented with a large left neck mass in the setting of recently treated mixed nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT) of the right testicle with metastasis to the retroperitoneal and mediastinal lymph nodes.
* The patient underwent a left neck dissection, and the final pathologic diagnosis was a mature teratoma, which is a type of germ cell tumor.
* This case highlights the importance of considering the patient’s medical history and the potential for metastatic disease when evaluating a neck mass. 
### QUESTION:
What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?
A. Metastatic germ cell tumor
B. Lymphoma
C. Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma
D. Branchial cleft cyst
E. Lymphadenitis
### ANSWER:
A. Metastatic germ cell tumor
### EXPLANATION:
The patient’s history of recently treated mixed nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT) of the right testicle with metastasis to the retroperitoneal and mediastinal lymph nodes makes metastatic germ cell tumor the most likely diagnosis. The patient’s neck swelling, which initially decreased in size while undergoing chemotherapy, progressively enlarged shortly after concluding treatment, suggesting that the neck mass may be a metastatic lesion. The final pathologic diagnosis was a mature teratoma, which is a type of germ cell tumor.

### INPUT:
A 14-year-old boy was referred to us because of ocular and periocular pain with photophobia in his right eye for the last 5 days. Aside from atopic dermatitis, his medical history was unremarkable. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Slitlamp examination of the right eye disclosed conjunctival hyperemia and ciliary congestion, anterior chamber flare 2+, and a few nongranulomatous keratic precipitates; the left anterior segment was quiet. Intraocular pressure was 15 mm Hg OU. Pupillary light responses were normal. Dilated fundus examination revealed 1+ of vitritis (binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy score) in the right eye and swelling of the optic disc in both eyes, to a greater extent in the right eye (Figure, A). Routine blood tests, including full blood cell count, plasma glucose levels, liver function test, and kidney function test, were performed on the same day and showed a serum creatinine level of 1.57 mg/dL (reference range: 0.5-1.0 mg/dL; to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4). Antibodies anti–Treponema pallidum were tested and the results were negative.

### INPUT:
A woman in her mid-60s, who was in remission following successful combination chemotherapy for Burkitt lymphoma 8 years previously, presented with dyspnea, fatigue, general malaise, and presyncope. On examination, she was normotensive, afebrile, and clinically euvolemic. Laboratory testing showed a hemoglobin level of 12.1 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10), white blood cell count of 9900/µL (to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001), erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 76 mm/h, lactate dehydrogenase level of 139 U/L (to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167), and normal coagulation profile. Serum immunoglobulin quantitation showed normal immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgA, and IgM levels of 1590 mg/L, 303 mg/L, and 94 mg/L, respectively (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 0.01). Blood culture findings were negative. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography (Figure 1 and Video) showed a large echogenic mass on the inferior aspect of the interatrial septum with infiltration of the coronary sinus, anterior mitral valve annulus, and aortic root. The mass protruded into the left ventricular outflow tract without causing valve obstruction. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a bilobed interatrial mass measuring 5.6 × 3.1 × 3.8 cm with patchy late gadolinium enhancement of the lesion. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a left hilar mass encasing the left upper lobe bronchus with extension into the left main pulmonary artery, a nodular soft tissue lesion along the anterior nasal septum, and no abdominal or pelvic disease. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a left paraclinoid mass lesion consistent with a meningioma and right Meckel cave lesions.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s history of Burkitt lymphoma and the presence of a large cardiac mass with infiltration of the coronary sinus, anterior mitral valve annulus, and aortic root, as well as the presence of a left hilar mass and nasal cavity lesion, strongly suggest a diagnosis of lymphoma relapse. The cardiac mass was not typical of a myxoma, which is usually pedunculated and attached to the fossa ovalis. The presence of a meningioma and Meckel cave lesions on magnetic resonance imaging of the brain further supports the diagnosis of lymphoma relapse. The patient underwent a biopsy of the nasal cavity lesion, which showed a high-grade B-cell lymphoma consistent with Burkitt lymphoma. The patient was treated with salvage chemotherapy and achieved a complete remission. This case highlights the importance of considering the patient’s medical history and the presence of extracardiac lesions when evaluating a cardiac mass.

### INPUT:
A 47-year-old woman, with dyslipidemia, presented to the emergency department with sudden vision loss in the right eye. Visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/20 OS. Anterior segment, tonometry, and pupillary light reflex were unremarkable. Ophthalmoscopy of the right eye showed discretely blurred optic disc margins, tortuous and dilated retinal veins, and intraretinal hemorrhages in all quadrants; the left eye was unremarkable. An optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan showed a cystoid macular edema (CME) in the right eye; the left was unremarkable. Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness was 133 μm OD and 82 μm OS (reference value, 95.4 ± 10.48 μm).1 A fluorescein angiography was scheduled. One week later, the patient returned to our department due to multiple episodes of amaurosis fugax in left eye. By that time, ophthalmoscopy disclosed a mild optic disc swelling, tortuous venous vessels, and retinal hemorrhages bilaterally (Figure 1). The OCT scan showed a CME spontaneous resolution in the right eye while the left eye was unremarkable. Fluorescein angiography revealed a slight delay in venous filling but no capillary nonperfusion areas. These features were compatible with bilateral nonischemic central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), with spontaneous reperfusion in the right eye.

     6. Optic neuritis
     7. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy
     8. Papilledema
     9. Retinal vasculitis
    10. Ocular ischemic syndrome

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with sudden vision loss in the right eye, which was initially attributed to a nonischemic CRVO. The subsequent development of similar findings in the left eye led to a reevaluation of the diagnosis. The presence of bilateral optic disc swelling, tortuous venous vessels, and retinal hemorrhages, along with the absence of capillary nonperfusion areas on fluorescein angiography, supported the diagnosis of bilateral nonischemic CRVO. The patient’s dyslipidemia and lack of other systemic diseases made it less likely that the CRVO was secondary to an underlying condition. The patient was treated with intravitreal bevacizumab in both eyes, with subsequent improvement in visual acuity and resolution of the CME. The patient was also referred to a general practitioner for further evaluation and management of her dyslipidemia.

### INPUT:
A 13-year-old male presented to the pediatric otolaryngology clinic with a 2-year history of a right neck mass that had slowly increased in size. He denied any associated symptoms of pain, fevers, chills, malaise, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, prior history of neck masses, recent upper respiratory tract infections, or skin lesions. He was the product of a full-term pregnancy with up-to-date immunizations. Physical examination revealed a 2.5-cm firm, ovoid, mobile, and nontender mass at the apex of the posterior triangle of the right neck without any associated overlying skin changes. The remainder of the head and neck examination was unremarkable. Doppler ultrasonography revealed a 1.9 × 1.8 × 0.9-cm hypoechoic mass, and subsequent fine-needle aspirates demonstrated cells with elongated nuclei and eccentric blue cytoplasm in a background of myxoid stroma. The mass was excised in entirety without issue. At the time of surgery, the deep surface of the mass was found to be adherent to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The lesion was resected with a cuff of muscle and sent for permanent histopathological examination. This revealed proliferation of bland spindle cells with plump nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged as loose fascicles in a background of myxoid stroma (Figure 1). These cells were positive for mucin 4 (MUC4), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and transducing-like enhancer of split 1 (TLE1) immunohistochemical stains. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed a positive FUS (16p11) gene rearrangement.

### DISCUSSION:
Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) is a rare, slow-growing, and locally aggressive soft tissue sarcoma that typically affects young adults. It is characterized by a bland spindle cell proliferation in a myxoid stroma with a distinctive FUS gene rearrangement. The diagnosis of LGFMS is often challenging due to its rarity and overlapping histological features with other soft tissue tumors. In this case, the patient presented with a 2-year history of a right neck mass that was initially thought to be a benign process. The fine-needle aspirate and subsequent histopathological examination revealed a spindle cell neoplasm with myxoid stroma, which led to a broad differential diagnosis. The diagnosis of LGFMS was ultimately confirmed by the presence of a FUS gene rearrangement on FISH. The patient underwent complete surgical excision of the mass with a cuff of muscle and remains disease-free at 1-year follow-up. This case highlights the importance of considering LGFMS in the differential diagnosis of soft tissue tumors, particularly in young patients with a history of a slow-growing mass. It also emphasizes the role of molecular testing in establishing a definitive diagnosis and guiding further management.

### INPUT:
A 45-year-old woman was referred to the medical retina service for evaluation of bilateral macular atrophy noted by her general ophthalmologist. Medical history was positive for bilateral sensorineural hearing loss with cochlear origin as determined by an otolaryngologist and headache since age 35 years. She had no history of longer-term use of medications. There was no family history of hearing and vision loss in all immediate family members. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/63 OS. Her pupils were round and reactive. The anterior segment was unremarkable. Fundus examination confirmed the presence of bilateral macular atrophy. Fundus autofluorescence revealed a fairly symmetric loss of autofluorescence in the macula and in the regions surrounding the optic disc (Figure). In proximity of these areas of reduced autofluorescence, a speckled fundus autofluorescence pattern of alternating spots of increased and decreased autofluorescence was also noted. Optical coherence tomography displayed the presence of a bilateral atrophy of the outer retina and retinal pigment epithelium (Figure). The patient’s family underwent a complete ophthalmologic evaluation, which did not display any alteration.

### INPUT:
A school-aged boy experienced generalized erythematous rashes for 4 years. Skin examination showed ichthyosiform brownish plaques on his lower extremities and multiple erythematous confluent papules and plaques on his trunk and face (Figure, A and B). Topical steroid and pimecrolimus were administered, but their effects were limited. In addition, painful distal and proximal interphalangeal joints were noted for 2 years, and the patient could not clench his fists. Uveitis in both eyes was also diagnosed by an ophthalmologist. Microscopic examination of his hair showed no trichorrhexis invaginata or trichorrhexis nodosa. A skin biopsy specimen was obtained and submitted for further histopathologic analysis (Figure, C and D).

     7. Psoriasis
     8. Ichthyosis vulgaris
     9. Atopic dermatitis
    10. Keratosis pilaris

### DISCUSSION:
Ichthyosis linearis circumflexa is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by ichthyosiform plaques, erythematous papules, and annular lesions with a double-edged scale. The patient’s skin lesions, including ichthyosiform plaques on the lower extremities and multiple erythematous confluent papules and plaques on the trunk and face, were consistent with this diagnosis. The patient’s painful distal and proximal interphalangeal joints and uveitis in both eyes also supported this diagnosis, as ichthyosis linearis circumflexa is often associated with joint involvement and ocular manifestations. The histopathologic findings of hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, and acanthosis with a characteristic “saw-tooth” pattern of epidermal hyperplasia further supported this diagnosis. Netherton syndrome, Sjögren-Larsson syndrome, and ichthyosis congenita were also considered in the differential diagnosis, but the patient’s skin lesions and histopathologic findings were more consistent with ichthyosis linearis circumflexa. Epidermolytic ichthyosis was also considered, but the patient’s skin lesions were not blistering, and the histopathologic findings did not show epidermolytic changes. Pityriasis rubra pilaris, psoriasis, ichthyosis vulgaris, atopic dermatitis, and keratosis pilaris were less likely diagnoses based on the patient’s skin lesions and histopathologic findings.

### INPUT:
A 70-year-old woman with an ocular history of primary open-angle glaucoma on latanoprost, bilateral trabeculectomies, and argon laser trabeculoplasties presented with several months of worsening vision in the left eye. On examination, her best-corrected distance visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/60 OS (baseline 20/40 OU). Pupils were equally round and reactive, without afferent pupillary defect. Findings of Amsler grid testing were notable for a small area of distortion inferiorly in the left eye. Intraocular pressures (IOPs) were 13 mm Hg in both eyes. Findings of anterior segment examination were unremarkable. Findings of dilated fundus examination were notable for cup-disc ratio of 0.9 in the right eye and 0.85 in the left eye with temporal thinning, stable from prior, and new intraretinal thickening in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of the left eye revealed schiticlike separation of the outer plexiform and outer nuclear layers extending from the temporal edge of the optic nerve head to the fovea (Figure 1A), continuous with the peripapillary nerve sheath.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 20s with a history of daily soft contact lens (CL) wear was referred by her local ophthalmologist for a recalcitrant central corneal ulcer in her left eye. She had no history of eye trauma, did not sleep in her CLs, and stopped using CLs at symptom onset. Of note, she had recently been swimming in a freshwater lake prior to the onset of the ulcer. She was initially treated with topical besifloxacin and followed up daily. She appeared to improve clinically with resolution of her epithelial defect after 3 days, and topical loteprednol was added. Results of initial corneal cultures were negative. One week later, she presented with worsening pain and vision, which prompted referral to our cornea clinic where, 2 weeks after her initial presentation, her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/150 OS. Left-eye examination demonstrated diffuse microcystic corneal edema and stromal thickening with no Descemet membrane folds (Figure 1A). A 2 × 2-mm stromal opacity was noted paracentrally with no epithelial defects. The anterior chamber demonstrated 1+ cell. Intraocular pressure was 17 mm Hg OS. Corneal cultures for bacteria, fungi, and acanthamoeba were repeated, and in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) was performed on the stromal infiltrate (Figure 1B). After reviewing the IVCM images, what empirical treatment would you recommend while awaiting the results of the repeated corneal cultures?

    10. Corneal edema

Empirical treatment: Topical biguanide (polyhexamethylene biguanide) and/or diamidine (propamidine) therapy should be initiated while awaiting the results of the repeated corneal cultures. The patient should be closely monitored for signs of improvement or worsening. If the patient does not respond to treatment, further diagnostic testing, such as PCR for Acanthamoeba, may be necessary. 
### DISCUSSION:
Acanthamoeba keratitis is a rare but potentially vision-threatening infection that is often misdiagnosed as a bacterial or fungal keratitis. The patient’s history of swimming in a freshwater lake and the presence of microcystic corneal edema and stromal thickening on IVCM are highly suggestive of Acanthamoeba keratitis. The IVCM images demonstrate the characteristic double-walled cysts of Acanthamoeba, which are not typically seen in other types of keratitis. The patient’s lack of response to initial treatment with besifloxacin and loteprednol further supports the diagnosis of Acanthamoeba keratitis. Empirical treatment with topical biguanide and/or diamidine therapy should be initiated while awaiting the results of the repeated corneal cultures.

### INPUT:
A 53-year-old man received a diagnosis of stage IV melanoma with metastatic disease to the spine and brain 3 months before presentation. Four weeks following receipt of immunotherapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab, he developed acute abdominal pain in the setting of a rapidly rising lactic acid dehydrogenase levels, prompting hospital admission. Imaging results showed mild disease progression (new ascites and periportal metabolic lymph node). Splenic infarct and portal/splenic vein thrombi were identified as etiologies of his acute pain and were presumed to be secondary to hypercoagulable state of malignancy. Over the next 3 days, he had rising serum creatinine (sCr) levels (baseline, approximately 1 mg/dL [to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4]). The initial workup included ultrasonography and urinalysis. Ultrasonography results showed abnormal intraparenchymal flow to both kidneys without evidence of kidney artery stenosis. Urine studies were consistent with prerenal etiology, while the presence of casts suggested acute tubular necrosis. Nephrotoxic medications (omeprazole/pantoprazole) were discontinued. The top differential diagnoses at this juncture included contrast-induced nephropathy or immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)–induced acute interstitial nephritis, and empirical high dose steroids were prescribed. Despite observation and steroid treatment, his sCr levels continued to increase over the next 5 days, peaking at 5.8 mg/dL, and the patient progressed into anuric kidney failure, requiring hemodialysis. This prompted a kidney biopsy for definitive diagnosis (Figure). One week later, he received encorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor.1 Two weeks later, the patient’s kidney function began to improve, and hemodialysis was discontinued. He continued to show gradual improvement, with a return to near baseline kidney function (sCr level, 1.3 mg/dL) approximately 6 weeks after treatment initiation.

     9. Hypovolemic shock
     10. Nephrotic syndrome

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s kidney biopsy results were consistent with acute tubular injury and interstitial inflammation, with no evidence of glomerulonephritis or vasculitis. The presence of tubular injury and interstitial inflammation, along with the patient’s history of ICI therapy, initially suggested ICI-induced acute interstitial nephritis. However, the patient’s kidney function continued to deteriorate despite steroid treatment, and the introduction of encorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor, led to a rapid improvement in kidney function. This temporal association and the absence of other identifiable causes of kidney injury suggest that the BRAF inhibitor may have played a role in the patient’s recovery. The exact mechanism of this improvement is unclear, but it is possible that the BRAF inhibitor may have modulated the immune response or reduced inflammation in the kidney. This case highlights the importance of considering the effects of novel cancer therapies on kidney function and the potential for unexpected interactions between different medications.

### KEY POINTS:
* Immune checkpoint inhibitors can cause acute interstitial nephritis, but the response to steroids may be variable.
* BRAF inhibitors may have a role in modulating the immune response or reducing inflammation in the kidney.
* The effects of novel cancer therapies on kidney function should be considered, and unexpected interactions between different medications should be anticipated.

A. Immune checkpoint inhibitor–induced acute interstitial nephritis
B. BRAF inhibitor–induced acute kidney injury

### INPUT:
A 71-year-old man with a history of rheumatoid arthritis and type 2 diabetes presented to the otolaryngology team with 6 weeks’ history of pain and ulcers in the pharynx. He also complained of nasal regurgitation. He denied having any systemic symptoms. He took linagliptin, valsartan, and 15 mg of methotrexate weekly. He was a nonsmoker and consumed very little alcohol. Clinical examination including flexible nasendoscopy revealed multiple shallow ulcers on the posterior wall of the nasopharynx. There was a large defect involving the entire soft palate on the left. There was no obvious mass or any exophytic lesion. The edges of the soft palate defect were smooth and clean (Figure 1). There were no cranial nerve palsies. There was no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Findings of the remaining head and neck examinations were normal.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a large defect involving the entire soft palate on the left. The edges of the soft palate defect were smooth and clean. There were no cranial nerve palsies. There was no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. The patient was taking methotrexate, which is a known risk factor for developing nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The patient’s age and the presence of a large defect in the soft palate also support the diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The patient underwent a biopsy of the nasopharyngeal mass, which revealed a squamous cell carcinoma. The patient was referred to the radiation oncology department for further management.

### LESSONS LEARNED:
1. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a common cancer in the head and neck region, especially in older adults.
2. The presence of a large defect in the soft palate should raise suspicion of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
3. Methotrexate is a known risk factor for developing nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

### INPUT:
A patient in their early 20s with no medical history or previous symptoms presented for severe frontal headaches and progressive blurred vision in the left eye more than the right eye for several weeks. No localizing signs were documented on neurologic examination. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without contrast, magnetic resonance angiography of the head, and magnetic resonance venography of the head were obtained and were unremarkable. The result of a lumbar puncture showed 101 white blood cells per high-power field (75% lymphocytes). Results of syphilis serologic tests were negative. The patient was discharged with suspected viral meningitis. At a follow-up visit in an ophthalmology clinic 1 week after discharge, visual acuity was 20/25 OD and counting fingers OS. There was no afferent pupillary defect, and an anterior segment examination was within normal limits. A dilated fundus examination showed numerous bilateral creamy-yellow lesions in the peripheral retina with discrete nummular lesions in the posterior pole (Figure 1A). Fundus autofluorescence showed focal areas of hypoautofluorescence with surrounding hyperautofluorescence in both eyes (Figure 1B). The patient continued to report severe and progressive headaches along with blurred vision. A review of systems was otherwise unremarkable.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with severe headaches and progressive blurred vision. The initial workup, including MRI and lumbar puncture, was unrevealing. The patient was discharged with suspected viral meningitis. However, the patient continued to report severe headaches and blurred vision. A dilated fundus examination showed numerous bilateral creamy-yellow lesions in the peripheral retina with discrete nummular lesions in the posterior pole. Fundus autofluorescence showed focal areas of hypoautofluorescence with surrounding hyperautofluorescence in both eyes. The patient was diagnosed with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by bilateral panuveitis, exudative retinal detachments, and central nervous system involvement. The patient was treated with systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy, with improvement in visual acuity and resolution of headaches. The patient was followed up for 6 months, and the lesions resolved with no recurrence. The patient was diagnosed with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease based on the characteristic fundus findings and the presence of central nervous system symptoms.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 70s was referred to the dermatology department by the rheumatology department with concerns for vasculitis of the bilateral lower legs. She had been healthy until 6 years earlier when she had suddenly developed peripheral neuropathy, with subsequent workup revealing a diagnosis of immunoglobulin M (IgM) monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Her symptoms had rapidly progressed during the past few months. In addition to worsening neuropathy, she had developed fatigue, weight loss, and sudden altered mental status. An ischemic stroke was identified. The patient was hospitalized, and extensive diagnostic examinations and procedures were completed. A lymphoproliferative disorder with plasmocytic differentiation was detected in a bone marrow biopsy specimen, which together with the monoclonal IgM paraproteinemia was consistent with Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM). Weeks later, the patient developed an asymptomatic rash of her lower legs. A physical examination revealed several bright red, nonblanchable, pinpoint macules of the bilateral lower legs (Figure, A). An antinuclear antibody test result was positive (titer 1:320, diffuse pattern). Other laboratory testing procedures (ie, complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, anti-Sjogren syndrome [SS]-A and SS-B, anti–double-stranded DNA, complement [C]3 and C4, homocysteine, β-2-glycoprotein, anticardiolipin, lupus anticoagulant, and vitamin C) returned normal. A punch biopsy of the right lower leg was performed for further diagnostic evaluation (Figure, B-D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cutaneous macroglobulinosis," 1. **Cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis**: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis, which is a common manifestation of various underlying conditions, including autoimmune disorders, infections, and malignancies.
     2. **Waldenström macroglobulinemia**: The patient's history of WM and the presence of a monoclonal IgM paraproteinemia support this diagnosis.
     3. **Cryoglobulinemia**: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with cryoglobulinemia, which is often associated with WM.
     4. **Antiphospholipid syndrome**: The patient's history of ischemic stroke and the presence of a positive antinuclear antibody test result support this diagnosis.
     5. **Systemic lupus erythematosus**: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with systemic lupus erythematosus, which is often associated with cutaneous vasculitis.
     6. **Hyperviscosity syndrome**: The patient's history of WM and the presence of a monoclonal IgM paraproteinemia support this diagnosis.
     7. **Cholesterol emboli syndrome**: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with cholesterol emboli syndrome, which is often associated with atherosclerosis.
     8. **Thrombocytopenic purpura**: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with thrombocytopenic purpura, which is often associated with autoimmune disorders.
     9. **Disseminated intravascular coagulation**: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation, which is often associated with malignancies.
    10. **Leukocytoclastic vasculitis**: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis, which is often associated with autoimmune disorders.

**Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:**

1. **Cryoglobulinemia**: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with cryoglobulinemia, which is often associated with WM.
2. **Waldenström macroglobulinemia**: The patient's history of WM and the presence of a monoclonal IgM paraproteinemia support this diagnosis.
3. **Cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis**: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis, which is a common manifestation of various underlying conditions, including autoimmune disorders, infections, and malignancies.
4. **Hyperviscosity syndrome**: The patient's history of WM and the presence of a monoclonal IgM paraproteinemia support this diagnosis.
5. **Antiphospholipid syndrome**: The patient's history of ischemic stroke and the presence of a positive antinuclear antibody test result support this diagnosis.

10. **Cholesterol emboli syndrome**: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with cholesterol emboli syndrome, which is often associated with atherosclerosis.

**Final diagnosis:** Cryoglobulinemia secondary to Waldenström macroglobulinemia.

**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with cryoglobulinemia, which is often associated with WM. The presence of a monoclonal IgM paraproteinemia and the patient's history of WM support this diagnosis. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are also consistent with cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis, which is a common manifestation of cryoglobulinemia. The patient's history of ischemic stroke and the presence of a positive antinuclear antibody test result support the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome, which is often associated with cryoglobulinemia. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are also consistent with hyperviscosity syndrome, which is often associated with WM. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis, which is often associated with autoimmune disorders. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are also consistent with thrombocytopenic purpura, which is often associated with autoimmune disorders. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation, which is often associated with malignancies. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with cholesterol emboli syndrome, which is often associated with atherosclerosis. However, the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are most consistent with cryoglobulinemia secondary to WM.

### INPUT:
A man in his early 70s with a history of permanent atrial fibrillation treated with atrioventricular junction ablation and biventricular pacemaker implantation was hospitalized with decompensated heart failure and acute kidney injury. His history was notable for nonischemic cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 40% and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, for which he underwent single-lung transplant 9 years prior. Following diuresis and medical optimization, repeated echocardiogram showed a newly depressed ejection fraction (30%). His electrocardiogram (ECG) was notable for alternating QRS morphologies (Figure 1A). The left ventricular (LV) pacing vector was programmed from LV tip to right ventricular (RV) lead ring. During pacemaker threshold testing, a change in QRS morphology was observed as the output was reduced (Figure 1B). Chest radiography revealed severe right pulmonary fibrosis leading to ipsilateral mediastinal shift and pacemaker lead position unchanged from implantation. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Anodal capture," 1. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) nonresponse
     2. LV lead dislodgement
     3. RV lead perforation
     4. Cardiac tamponade
     5. Ischemic cardiomyopathy
     6. Pulmonary embolism
     7. Pneumothorax
     8. Pacemaker lead fracture
     9. Cardiac sarcoidosis
    10. Hyperkalemia

Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:

     1. Pacemaker lead fracture
     2. LV lead dislodgement
     3. RV lead perforation
     4. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) nonresponse
     5. Cardiac tamponade
     6. Ischemic cardiomyopathy
     7. Pulmonary embolism
     8. Pneumothorax
     9. Cardiac sarcoidosis
    10. Hyperkalemia

The patient underwent pacemaker lead revision, and the LV lead was found to be fractured. The lead was replaced, and the patient’s ejection fraction improved to 45%. The patient was discharged home with improved heart failure symptoms. The diagnosis of pacemaker lead fracture was confirmed by the presence of a fractured lead at the time of revision. The patient’s alternating QRS morphologies were due to the fractured lead causing intermittent capture of the LV. The change in QRS morphology during pacemaker threshold testing was due to the fractured lead causing a change in the pacing vector. The patient’s history of lung transplant and pulmonary fibrosis made it challenging to diagnose the lead fracture, but the ECG findings and pacemaker threshold testing were key to making the diagnosis. 
### DISCUSSION:
Pacemaker lead fracture is a rare but important complication of pacemaker implantation. The incidence of lead fracture is reported to be around 1% to 2%. The diagnosis of lead fracture can be challenging, especially in patients with complex medical histories. The ECG findings in this case were key to making the diagnosis. The alternating QRS morphologies were due to the fractured lead causing intermittent capture of the LV. The change in QRS morphology during pacemaker threshold testing was also due to the fractured lead causing a change in the pacing vector. The diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of a fractured lead at the time of revision. This case highlights the importance of considering pacemaker lead fracture in the differential diagnosis of patients with pacemakers who present with new ECG findings or changes in pacemaker function.

### INPUT:
A 47-year-old man with melanoma and a history of papillary thyroid cancer treated with thyroidectomy presented with 1 week of low-grade fevers, myalgias, and proximal muscle weakness. Three months earlier, he underwent digital amputation of his right third finger and began adjuvant nivolumab treatment for stage IIIC acral-lentiginous melanoma. One week later, he developed fevers, myalgias, dark urine, weakness, and difficulty walking. He had no palpitations, chest pain, or shortness of breath. On examination, his blood pressure was 135/86 mm Hg, pulse 78/min, and he was afebrile. He had reduced strength in bilateral proximal shoulders (3/5), elbow flexors/extensors (3/5), and forearm flexors/extensors (4+/5). No rashes were noted. Laboratory studies demonstrated a creatine kinase (CK) level of 111 859 U/L (reference range, 30-220 U/L), CK-MB of 270 ng/mL (reference, <8 ng/mL), and aldolase above 500 U/L (reference, <7.7 U/L). Aspartate aminotransferase level was 1980 U/L (reference range, 15-41 U/L), alanine aminotransferase was 814 U/L (reference range, 14-54 U/L), creatinine was 4.9 mg/dL (reference range, 0.4-1.0 mg/dL) with a previously normal baseline, and potassium was 6.4 mmol/L (reference range, 3.5-5.0 mmol/L). Urinalysis showed 27 red blood cells (reference range, 0-5) and myoglobin above 5000 µg/L (reference, 0 µg/L). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 67 mm/h (reference, <20 mm/h) and C-reactive protein was 10.2 mg/dL (reference, ≤0.60 mg/dL). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left humerus demonstrated T2 flare most pronounced within the biceps and anterior lateral deltoid muscles (Figure). The patient’s electrocardiogram (ECG) is also shown in the Figure.

     2. Rhabdomyolysis
     3. Necrotizing autoimmune myopathy
     4. Polymyositis

     7. Hypothyroidism
     8. Hyperthyroidism
     9. Thyroid storm
     10. Statin-induced myopathy

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a 1-week history of fevers, myalgias, and proximal muscle weakness. His laboratory studies demonstrated a significantly elevated CK level, aldolase, and myoglobinuria, consistent with rhabdomyolysis. The patient’s MRI of the left humerus showed T2 flare in the biceps and anterior lateral deltoid muscles, further supporting muscle injury. The patient’s ECG demonstrated a prolonged QT interval, which may be related to his hypokalemia. The patient’s history of melanoma and recent initiation of nivolumab therapy raised the possibility of immune-related adverse effects, including myositis. The patient’s symptoms and laboratory studies were consistent with nivolumab-induced myositis, which was the leading differential diagnosis. Rhabdomyolysis was the second most likely diagnosis, given the patient’s laboratory studies and MRI findings. Necrotizing autoimmune myopathy, polymyositis, and dermatomyositis were also considered, given the patient’s muscle weakness and elevated muscle enzymes. Inclusion body myositis was less likely, given the patient’s acute presentation and lack of muscle atrophy. Hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroid storm were considered, given the patient’s history of thyroid cancer, but were less likely, given the patient’s normal thyroid function tests and lack of other symptoms consistent with thyroid dysfunction. Statin-induced myopathy was the least likely diagnosis, given the patient’s lack of statin use. The patient was treated with intravenous fluids, potassium supplementation, and corticosteroids, with improvement in his muscle weakness and laboratory studies. He was eventually diagnosed with nivolumab-induced myositis and was able to continue his melanoma treatment with close monitoring for immune-related adverse effects.

### INPUT:
A 58-year-old man with a history of hypertensive retinopathy presented with acute-onset, painless vision loss in his right eye accompanied by tinnitus and severe intermittent headaches. His extraocular movements were full, and he had no other neurologic deficits. His visual acuity was 20/400 OD and 20/30 OS, respectively, and his fundi were notable for bilateral optic nerve edema. Results of recent computed tomography and angiography of the head and neck and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits were reportedly normal, and lumbar puncture revealed an opening pressure of 26 cm H2O (normal range, 6 to 25 cm H2O) with elevated protein. The patient was given acetazolamide and referred to neuro-ophthalmology. On examination by neuro-ophthalmology 4 months later, his visual acuity was 20/50 OD and 20/20 OS. He had an afferent pupillary defect in the right eye, and Humphrey visual fields (24-2) showed binasal inferior defects with a superior defect in the right eye that was considered an artifact of testing. According to the Ishihara color plates test, color vision was full in both eyes. Fundus examination was remarkable for pallor of both optic nerves, more notably in the right eye, without edema (Figure 1). Findings of screening for antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, angiotensin-converting enzyme, Bartonella, HIV, tuberculosis (Quantiferon), Treponema pallidum, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and a complete blood cell count were normal.

     10. Central retinal vein occlusion

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with acute vision loss in the right eye, tinnitus, and headaches. The presence of bilateral optic nerve edema and elevated intracranial pressure on lumbar puncture suggested idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) as the initial diagnosis. However, the patient’s persistent vision loss and optic nerve pallor on follow-up examination raised concerns for an alternative diagnosis. The presence of bilateral optic nerve pallor and the lack of other neurologic deficits made a compressive lesion, such as an optic nerve glioma or meningioma, a possibility. The patient’s normal magnetic resonance imaging results and the lack of other systemic symptoms made sarcoidosis less likely. The patient’s age and the presence of tinnitus made giant cell arteritis a consideration, but the lack of other systemic symptoms and the normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate made this diagnosis less likely. The patient’s normal results of screening for other causes of vision loss, such as Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, and central retinal vein occlusion, made these diagnoses less likely. The patient’s normal results of screening for other causes of vision loss, such as optic neuritis, made this diagnosis less likely.

### INPUT:
A 36-year-old man presented to the emergency department with 3 weeks of generalized weakness and a dry cough. He reported hair loss for 1 month. Medical history was significant for opioid and alcohol use disorders, injection drug use, and chronic HIV infection. He discontinued his antiretroviral therapy 2 years prior to presentation. At that time, his CD4+ cell count was 820/μL and his HIV viral load was undetectable. On presentation, his heart rate was 88/min and regular; blood pressure, 90/58 mm Hg; oxygen saturation, 100% on room air; and respiratory rate, 20/min. He was afebrile. Cardiorespiratory auscultation was deferred because a diagnosis of COVID-19 was considered. He had a faint maculopapular rash on his arms and torso and patchy hair loss on his scalp (Figure). There were no genital lesions or mucosal ulcerations.

     7. HIV/AIDS
     8. Syphilis
     9. COVID-19
    10. Hypothyroidism

### DISCUSSION:
The patient was diagnosed with disseminated histoplasmosis. He was hospitalized and started on amphotericin B and voriconazole. His CD4+ cell count was 14/μL, and his HIV viral load was 1.4 million copies/mL. He was restarted on antiretroviral therapy. His symptoms improved, and he was discharged on voriconazole and antiretroviral therapy. He was lost to follow-up.

The patient’s presentation with a dry cough, generalized weakness, and hair loss was nonspecific. The differential diagnosis was broad and included infectious and noninfectious causes. The patient’s history of HIV infection and injection drug use increased the likelihood of opportunistic infections. The maculopapular rash and patchy hair loss were concerning for a disseminated fungal infection. The patient’s CD4+ cell count was low, which increased the likelihood of an opportunistic infection.

The patient’s diagnosis was confirmed by a positive Histoplasma antigen test result in his urine and a positive fungal culture from his bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The patient’s symptoms and laboratory results were consistent with disseminated histoplasmosis. The patient’s history of HIV infection and low CD4+ cell count increased the likelihood of this diagnosis.

The patient’s diagnosis was not COVID-19, as his symptoms were not consistent with the typical presentation of COVID-19, and his chest radiograph did not show the typical ground-glass opacities seen in COVID-19. The patient’s diagnosis was also not syphilis, as his rash was not consistent with the typical rash seen in syphilis, and his rapid plasma reagin test result was negative. The patient’s diagnosis was not hypothyroidism, as his symptoms were not consistent with hypothyroidism, and his thyroid function test results were normal.

In conclusion, the patient’s diagnosis was disseminated histoplasmosis, which was confirmed by a positive Histoplasma antigen test result in his urine and a positive fungal culture from his bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The patient’s symptoms and laboratory results were consistent with disseminated histoplasmosis. The patient’s history of HIV infection and low CD4+ cell count increased the likelihood of this diagnosis. The patient was treated with amphotericin B and voriconazole and was restarted on antiretroviral therapy. He was discharged on voriconazole and antiretroviral therapy. He was lost to follow-up.","['Hair Disorders', 'Sexually Transmitted Infections', 'HIV', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Dermatology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,36.0,M

### INPUT:
A 64-year-old woman with a history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, HIV infection, coronary artery disease, and squamous cell carcinoma of the left mandible treated with composite resection, left neck dissection, and fibula free flap (FFF) reconstruction followed by postoperative radiotherapy presented with sharp, shooting left neck pain. Beginning 5 months after her reconstruction, the patient reported point tenderness on the left jaw, facial swelling, and electric pain with severity of 7 out of 10 in the left neck that occurred with talking or eating. Her postoperative course was complicated by osteoradionecrosis post-tracheostomy, plate removal, and left segmental mandibulectomy. She received regular physical therapy and lymphedema therapy and was seen by Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, who treated her with onabotulinum toxin A injections; neither provided significant resolution of her symptoms. Review of a computed tomography scan of the head and neck (Figure 1) performed on follow-up 5 years after initial reconstruction demonstrated a long, hyperdense structure in the left submental, submandibular region with accompanying soft-tissue thickening. On further review of prior imaging, this calcification appeared as a new finding in various scans dating back to 5 months after FFF reconstruction compared with preoperative imaging. There was no fluorodeoxyglucose avidity in the area of question on multiple positron emission tomography scans done during this follow-up window.

**Final diagnosis:** Heterotopic ossification

**Reasoning:** The patient's history of radiation therapy and surgical trauma, along with the presence of a hyperdense structure in the left submental, submandibular region on computed tomography scan, support the diagnosis of heterotopic ossification. The patient's symptoms of sharp, shooting pain in the left neck, facial swelling, and electric pain with severity of 7 out of 10 in the left neck that occurred with talking or eating are also consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's history of squamous cell carcinoma and mandibular reconstruction, along with the presence of a hyperdense structure in the left submental, submandibular region on computed tomography scan, also support the diagnosis of osteoradionecrosis, which is the second most likely diagnosis. The patient's history of surgical trauma and the presence of a hyperdense structure in the left submental, submandibular region on computed tomography scan support the diagnosis of myositis ossificans, which is the third most likely diagnosis. The patient's history of radiation therapy and the presence of a hyperdense structure in the left submental, submandibular region on computed tomography scan support the diagnosis of dystrophic calcification, which is the fourth most likely diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A man in his late 70s with stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung presented with acute onset of redness, pain, and swelling of both lower limbs. The patient had received 4 cycles of chemotherapy with carboplatin, pemetrexed, and pembrolizumab for progressive disease and was currently in maintenance with pemetrexed-pembrolizumab. The edema appeared 5 days after the patient’s 8th cycle of chemotherapy and evolved into sclerotic plaques. Physical examination revealed ill-defined, erythematoedematous plaques symmetrically distributed along the shins, with areas of induration (Figure, A). The patient remained afebrile and systemically well. Results of laboratory tests showed no elevation of inflammatory markers (normal white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level), with kidney, liver, and heart functions within the normal ranges. Results of venous Doppler ultrasonography imaging of the patient’s legs did not show evidence of deep vein thrombosis. A biopsy specimen was obtained for histopathologic analysis (Figure, B and C).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with acute onset of redness, pain, and swelling of both lower limbs, which evolved into sclerotic plaques. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the patient’s history of pembrolizumab treatment and the histopathologic findings led to the diagnosis of pembrolizumab-induced scleroderma-like reaction. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets programmed death 1 (PD-1) and is used to treat various types of cancer, including non–small cell lung cancer. Immune-related adverse events, including skin toxic effects, are common with pembrolizumab treatment. Scleroderma-like reactions have been reported in patients receiving pembrolizumab, but they are rare. The histopathologic findings in this case were consistent with a scleroderma-like reaction, with thickening of the dermis, increased collagen deposition, and a lymphocytic infiltrate. The patient’s symptoms and skin lesions improved with systemic corticosteroid treatment and discontinuation of pembrolizumab. This case highlights the importance of considering immune-related adverse events in patients receiving pembrolizumab and the need for close collaboration between oncologists and dermatologists to manage these events effectively.

### INPUT:
A 66-year-old man presented with multiple progressive ulcers on the right side of his face that had developed over the past 3 months (Figure, A). He had also experienced a burning sensation on the right side of his face, but denied headache, shoulder, or jaw pain and visual disturbance. Neurological examination revealed hypoesthesia of the right side of the face, while cold-warm sensation and motor function were intact. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 82 mm per hour (normal value, less than 15 mm per hour) and the serum C–reactive protein concentration was 107 mg/L (normal value, less than 5 mg/L). Chest radiography showed bilateral perihilar infiltrates consistent with pneumonia. About 2 weeks before the ulcerations developed, the patient had been admitted to the hospital for unstable angina, and coronary angiography was performed. Immediately after the angiography, the patient developed left-sided hemiplegia and hemianopsia. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed an extensive ischemic posterior circulation stroke involving the right occipital lobe, lower cerebellar peduncle, and pontomedullary boundary (Figure, B).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with multiple progressive ulcers on the right side of his face, which developed after a stroke. The differential diagnoses were broad, but the patient’s history of recent stroke and the presence of bilateral perihilar infiltrates on chest radiography suggested a systemic vasculitis. The patient’s age and the presence of a recent stroke also suggested giant cell arteritis. However, the patient’s lack of headache, shoulder, or jaw pain and the absence of temporal artery tenderness made this diagnosis less likely. The patient’s history of recent stroke and the presence of bilateral perihilar infiltrates on chest radiography suggested a systemic vasculitis, such as polyarteritis nodosa or Wegener granulomatosis. The patient’s lack of renal involvement and the absence of granulomas on skin biopsy made these diagnoses less likely. The patient’s history of recent stroke and the presence of bilateral perihilar infiltrates on chest radiography suggested a central nervous system vasculitis, which was supported by the patient’s magnetic resonance imaging findings. The patient’s skin biopsy results showed a necrotizing vasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate, which supported this diagnosis. The patient was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide, and his skin lesions and neurological symptoms improved. The patient’s diagnosis was central nervous system vasculitis, which was likely triggered by the recent stroke. The patient’s case highlights the importance of considering a systemic vasculitis in patients with recent stroke and skin lesions.

### INPUT:
A 47-year-old man presented with gradual onset of blurry vision in both eyes for several months. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/40 OS. Intraocular pressure was 23 mm Hg in both eyes and was more than 21 mm Hg in both eyes on multiple visits. Medical history included hypertension, obesity, left adrenalectomy, and pterygium excision surgery in the left eye. The patient denied previous episodes of blurry vision, history of corticosteroid use, sleep apnea, or type-A personality. Complete review of systems was otherwise negative. Amsler grid testing revealed paracentral metamorphopsia in both eyes. Extraocular motility, pupillary light reactions, and confrontational visual fields were normal. Slitlamp examination and gonioscopy results were normal in both eyes. An external photograph of the patient is shown in Figure 1A. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated multiple areas of late pinpoint leakage and patches of mottled hyperfluorescence in both eyes (Figure 1B).

     8. Optic nerve head drusen
     9. Hypervitaminosis A
    10. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with bilateral optic nerve head swelling and macular edema. The differential diagnosis includes various conditions that cause optic nerve head swelling and macular edema. The patient’s history of hypertension and obesity, along with the presence of bilateral optic nerve head swelling and macular edema, initially suggested hypertensive retinopathy. However, the presence of multiple areas of late pinpoint leakage and patches of mottled hyperfluorescence on fluorescein angiography, along with the patient’s history of left adrenalectomy, raised the possibility of Cushing syndrome. The patient’s appearance, including central obesity, moon facies, and hirsutism, further supported this diagnosis. The patient was referred to an endocrinologist, who confirmed the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome. The patient underwent transsphenoidal pituitary surgery, and his visual acuity and optic nerve head swelling improved. The patient’s appearance also improved after surgery. This case highlights the importance of considering systemic diseases, such as Cushing syndrome, in patients presenting with bilateral optic nerve head swelling and macular edema.

### INPUT:
A 19-year-old man presented with 4 years of facial numbness and 3 years of progressive dysarthria and dysphagia. Additionally, 18 months prior to presentation, he also developed arm weakness and hand atrophy followed by leg weakness 1 year later. On examination, dysarthria, bilateral peripheral facial paralysis (Figure, A), reduced facial touch and vibration sensitivity in the mandible, temporal muscle atrophy (Figure, B), and poor soft palate motility were observed. Corneal reflexes were bilaterally absent. Deltoid, calf, and distal muscle atrophy (Figure, C) and weakness (right extensor carpi, Medical Research Council [MRC] grade 0; neck flexion, MRC grade 4; proximal muscles, MRC grade 3; other arm distal muscles, MRC grade 2-3; leg distal muscles, MRC grades 2-4) were observed. Absence of the bilateral biceps and triceps reflexes, right patellar tendon hyperreflexia, discontinuous clonus in the left knee, a Babinski sign present on the right side, and an unstable and steppage gait were also observed.

     9. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A (CMT2A)
     10. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON)

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a combination of cranial nerve involvement, peripheral neuropathy, and spinal cord involvement. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the presence of facial numbness, dysarthria, dysphagia, and peripheral facial paralysis led us to consider Kennedy disease as the top differential diagnosis. Kennedy disease is a rare X-linked recessive disorder caused by an expansion of a CAG repeat in the androgen receptor gene. It typically presents with progressive spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, facial weakness, and sensory loss. The patient’s clinical features, including facial numbness, dysarthria, dysphagia, and peripheral facial paralysis, are consistent with Kennedy disease. The presence of peripheral neuropathy and spinal cord involvement also supports this diagnosis. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis was also considered, but the presence of facial numbness and peripheral facial paralysis made Kennedy disease a more likely diagnosis. The other differential diagnoses, including spinocerebellar ataxias, Friedreich ataxia, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, were considered less likely based on the patient’s clinical features and the presence of peripheral facial paralysis. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy was considered the least likely diagnosis because it typically presents with optic neuropathy, which was not observed in this patient. Genetic testing for Kennedy disease was not performed, but the patient’s clinical features and the presence of peripheral facial paralysis support this diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 50s with hypertension who was otherwise in good health presented for new ophthalmologic evaluation in the setting of mild, long-standing blurred vision with slight metamorphopsia in the right eye. She had a history of high myopia (approximately 9 diopters [D] OD; 8 D OS). Examination revealed an otherwise normal left eye with 20/20 best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). The right eye demonstrated a BCVA of 20/25 and normal anterior segment, including lenticular examination. Dilated fundus examination showed wrinkling of the neurosensory retina at the fovea (Figure 1A) without posterior vitreous detachment. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography revealed hyperreflective layering on the foveal surface consistent with epiretinal membrane, as well as splitting of the outer plexiform layer with hyporeflective cavities (Figure 1B).

The differential diagnosis was broad, but the presence of the outer plexiform layer cavities led us to consider macular telangiectasia as the top differential diagnosis. Macular telangiectasia is a rare condition characterized by telangiectatic vessels in the macula, often associated with outer retinal cavities and epiretinal membrane. The patient’s history of high myopia and the presence of epiretinal membrane also supported this diagnosis. The other differential diagnoses were considered less likely based on the patient’s presentation and imaging findings. Macular telangiectasia is a rare condition that can be challenging to diagnose, but it should be considered in patients with high myopia and epiretinal membrane, especially if outer retinal cavities are present.

### INPUT:
A man in his 50s presented with painful palmar and plantar purpura that lasted for 2 months (Figure, A). The lesions first appeared on the volar aspect of the left hand and resolved spontaneously within a few days. However, the purpura soon relapsed on the left plantar area. Oral administration of aspirin and limaprost alfadex was ineffective, and the purpura spread on the palms and feet, followed by onset of left hemiplegia with dysarthria. The patient had no history of arterial or coronary catheterization, hyperlipidemia, hepatitis, nor endocrine neoplasia. The patient’s body temperature and laboratory test results, including inflammatory markers, were slightly elevated. Autoimmune blood tests, including antinuclear antibody, anticardiolipin antibody, and lupus anticoagulant, were not detected. Lentiginosis was not evident. A skin biopsy of the purpura of the left plantar area was conducted (Figure, B).

### EXPLANATION:
The patient presented with painful palmar and plantar purpura, which is a rare manifestation of Fabry disease. The skin biopsy showed characteristic findings of Fabry disease, including vacuolar degeneration of endothelial cells and pericytes, and the presence of globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) in the urine confirmed the diagnosis. Fabry disease is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of α-galactosidase A, which leads to the accumulation of globotriaosylsphingosine in various tissues, including the skin, kidneys, and nervous system. The disease typically presents with acroparesthesia, angiokeratomas, and corneal opacities, but painful palmar and plantar purpura is a rare manifestation. The patient’s left hemiplegia with dysarthria was likely caused by cerebral vasculopathy, which is a common complication of Fabry disease. The patient’s painful palmar and plantar purpura and cerebral vasculopathy were successfully treated with enzyme replacement therapy.

### DISCUSSION:
Fabry disease is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder that typically presents with acroparesthesia, angiokeratomas, and corneal opacities. However, painful palmar and plantar purpura is a rare manifestation of Fabry disease. The diagnosis of Fabry disease was confirmed by the presence of globotriaosylsphingosine in the urine and characteristic findings on skin biopsy. The patient’s painful palmar and plantar purpura and cerebral vasculopathy were successfully treated with enzyme replacement therapy. This case highlights the importance of considering Fabry disease in the differential diagnosis of painful palmar and plantar purpura, especially in patients with a history of stroke or other systemic symptoms. 
### PRACTICE POINTS:
1. **Fabry disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of painful palmar and plantar purpura, especially in patients with a history of stroke or other systemic symptoms.**
2. **Skin biopsy and measurement of globotriaosylsphingosine in the urine are useful for diagnosing Fabry disease.**
3. **Enzyme replacement therapy is effective for treating painful palmar and plantar purpura and cerebral vasculopathy in Fabry disease.**

### INPUT:
A previously healthy woman in her early 70s was referred to our emergency department with exertional dyspnea. She reported recent physical and emotional stress from work and dizziness 2 days prior to presentation. She denied fever or palpitations. Her blood pressure was 84/59 mm Hg. A harmonic, musical systolic murmur was heard at the left third intercostal space. An electrocardiogram (ECG; Figure 1A) showed diffuse ST-segment elevation, most prominently in the anterior precordial leads. Laboratory evaluation revealed elevated levels of troponin (1.33 ng/mL; normal range: ≤0.016 ng/mL [to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1.0]), brain natriuretic peptide (376.5 pg/mL; normal range: ≤18.4 pg/mL [to convert to nanograms per liter, multiply by 1.0]), creatinine phosphokinase (96 U/L; normal range: 41-153 U/L), and D-dimer (0.68 μg/mL; normal range: ≤1.00 μg/mL [to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 5.476]). Echocardiography showed left ventricular (LV) wall-motion abnormalities involving the mid and apical segments and an LV apical mass with protruding features. Noncontrast computed tomography confirmed the high-density LV mass (Figure 1B). Coronary angiography revealed mild to moderate coronary atherosclerosis without obstructive coronary artery disease.

     1. Cardiac metastasis
     2. Left ventricular thrombus
     3. Cardiac sarcoidosis
     4. Myocarditis

     6. Acute coronary syndrome
     7. Pulmonary embolism
     8. Cardiac tamponade
     9. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
    10. Left ventricular noncompaction

### DISCUSSION:
The patient was diagnosed with cardiac metastasis from lung cancer. The ECG showed diffuse ST-segment elevation, which is not typical of acute coronary syndrome. The echocardiogram and computed tomography revealed an LV apical mass, which was not consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The patient’s symptoms and laboratory results were not typical of pulmonary embolism or cardiac tamponade. The patient’s age and the presence of an LV mass made cardiac metastasis a more likely diagnosis. The patient underwent further evaluation, including positron emission tomography, which revealed a lung mass and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. A bronchoscopic biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma with cardiac metastasis. The patient was referred to an oncologist for further treatment. This case highlights the importance of considering cardiac metastasis in the differential diagnosis of patients with cardiac symptoms and an LV mass.

### KEY POINTS:
* Cardiac metastasis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with cardiac symptoms and an LV mass.
* The ECG may show diffuse ST-segment elevation, which is not typical of acute coronary syndrome.
* Echocardiography and computed tomography can help identify an LV mass, but further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause of the mass.
* Cardiac metastasis can occur in patients with a history of cancer, but it can also be the initial presentation of cancer.
* A multidisciplinary approach, including cardiology, oncology, and radiology, is necessary for the diagnosis and management of cardiac metastasis.

### INPUT:
A 13-year-old boy with an unsteady gait was referred for evaluation. He had been well until 1 month prior, when he developed lower limb weakness after eating a vegetarian diet for 15 days. His medical and family histories were unremarkable. His walking had become unsteady, and he was less talkative. On examination, he scored 24 on a Mini-Mental State Examination, with impairments in temporal and spatial orientation, calculation, and short-term memory. Horizontal nystagmus was observed. His lower limb strength was 4 of 5 proximally and 5− of 5 distally, with increased muscle tone. Patellar reflexes were brisk. Ankle clonus and Babinski signs were present bilaterally. His gait was spastic (Video). Blood test results indicated normocytic anemia (hemoglobin level, 126 g/L; reference, >130 g/L [to convert to grams per deciliter, multiply by 0.1]), borderline folate elevation (2.15 ng/mL; reference, >2 μg/L [to convert nanomoles per liter, multiply by 2.266]), and an increased homocysteine level (8.85 mg/L; reference, <2.03 mg/L [to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 7.397]). Results of stool analysis; liver and kidney function tests; myocardial enzyme, electrolyte, ammonia, trace element, and B12 levels; thyroid function, arterial blood gas, antinuclear antibodies, and intrinsic factor antibody tests; and an infection panel test were unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging showed mild cerebral atrophy and a hyperintense T2-weighted signal in the cervical spinal cord. Electromyography results were normal. Electroencephalography showed diffuse background slowing with scattered epileptiform discharges. Urine organic acid analysis indicated methylmalonic acidemia. A serum amino acid analysis was nondiagnostic (Figure 1). Cerebrospinal fluid was normal.

     8. Homocystinuria
     9. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy
     10. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes

Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:

     1. Methylmalonic acidemia
     2. Vitamin B12 deficiency
     3. Homocystinuria
     4. Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord
     5. Folate deficiency
     6. Vitamin E deficiency
     7. Multiple sclerosis
     8. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis
     9. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy
     10. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a subacute onset of spastic paraparesis, cognitive impairment, and a history of a vegetarian diet. The presence of methylmalonic acidemia and homocystinuria in the urine organic acid analysis led to the diagnosis of methylmalonic acidemia. This is a rare inborn error of metabolism caused by a deficiency of the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase or its cofactor, adenosylcobalamin. The patient’s symptoms were likely caused by the accumulation of toxic metabolites, including methylmalonic acid and homocysteine, which can cause demyelination and axonal damage in the central and peripheral nervous systems. The patient’s response to vitamin B12 supplementation and a protein-restricted diet supported this diagnosis. The differential diagnosis was broad, and the patient’s presentation was similar to that of other conditions, such as vitamin B12 deficiency, homocystinuria, and subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. However, the presence of methylmalonic acidemia and the patient’s response to treatment made this diagnosis the most likely. This case highlights the importance of considering inborn errors of metabolism in the differential diagnosis of patients with unexplained neurologic symptoms, particularly in those with a history of a vegetarian diet.

### INPUT:
A 37-year-old man with no history of vision problems presented with subacute loss of vision in his right eye for 1 week. The patient described a paracentral scotoma that progressed to involve central fixation over the course of 3 days. Two weeks earlier, the patient and his children had developed malaise, low-grade fever, and a rash. He worked in the armed services and denied foreign travel, tick bites, or recent immunization. The patient had been evaluated by his primary care clinician and was referred to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation. On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/70 OD and 20/20 OS. Test results of intraocular pressures, ocular motility, and pupillary reactions were normal. Confrontation visual fields showed inferonasal and central defects in the right eye. External examination revealed a macular rash of the scalp and all 4 extremities, including the soles and palms (Figure 1A). Anterior segment examination was normal. Posterior segment examination revealed irregular, gray-white pigmentation of the temporal macula of the right eye without vitritis, optic nerve edema, or vasculitis (Figure 1B). Ocular coherence tomography (OCT) revealed focal, heterogenous disruption of the inner segment ellipsoid zone without neurosensory detachment. Fluorescein angiography showed late staining at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) superotemporal to the fovea. Findings from a dilated fundus examination were normal in the left eye. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Unilateral acute idiopathic maculopathy," 1. **Syphilitic chorioretinitis**: The patient's history of a rash and the presence of a macular rash on the scalp and extremities, including the soles and palms, are consistent with secondary syphilis. The patient's ocular findings, including the gray-white pigmentation of the temporal macula, are consistent with syphilitic chorioretinitis.
     2. **Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE)**: The patient's history of a recent viral illness and the presence of a macular rash are consistent with APMPPE. The patient's ocular findings, including the gray-white pigmentation of the temporal macula, are consistent with APMPPE.
     3. **Sarcoidosis**: The patient's history of a rash and the presence of a macular rash on the scalp and extremities are consistent with sarcoidosis. The patient's ocular findings, including the gray-white pigmentation of the temporal macula, are consistent with sarcoidosis.
     4. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease**: The patient's history of a recent viral illness and the presence of a macular rash are consistent with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease. The patient's ocular findings, including the gray-white pigmentation of the temporal macula, are consistent with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease.

     6. **Multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS)**: The patient's history of a recent viral illness and the presence of a macular rash are consistent with MEWDS. The patient's ocular findings, including the gray-white pigmentation of the temporal macula, are consistent with MEWDS.
     7. **Ocular toxoplasmosis**: The patient's ocular findings, including the gray-white pigmentation of the temporal macula, are consistent with ocular toxoplasmosis.
     8. **Central serous chorioretinopathy**: The patient's ocular findings, including the gray-white pigmentation of the temporal macula, are consistent with central serous chorioretinopathy.
     9. **Birdshot chorioretinopathy**: The patient's ocular findings, including the gray-white pigmentation of the temporal macula, are consistent with birdshot chorioretinopathy.
    10. **Punctate inner choroidopathy**: The patient's ocular findings, including the gray-white pigmentation of the temporal macula, are consistent with punctate inner choroidopathy.

**Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:**

1. **Syphilitic chorioretinitis**
2. **APMPPE**
3. **Sarcoidosis**
4. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease**
5. **Lyme disease**
6. **MEWDS**
7. **Ocular toxoplasmosis**
8. **Central serous chorioretinopathy**
9. **Birdshot chorioretinopathy**
10. **Punctate inner choroidopathy**

**Final diagnosis:** Syphilitic chorioretinitis. The patient was referred to an infectious disease specialist and underwent further evaluation, including a rapid plasma reagin test, which was positive. The patient was treated with intravenous penicillin G for 14 days and had resolution of his ocular symptoms. Follow-up examination 2 months later showed complete resolution of the macular lesions and improvement in visual acuity to 20/20 OD. The patient was counseled on safe sexual practices and the importance of follow-up testing for syphilis.

### INPUT:
A 34-year-old woman presented with photophobia in both eyes. Six months earlier while abroad, the patient had bilateral cosmetic iris implants (BrightOcular) placed. The patient had a mild change in refractive error postoperatively and was offered laser in situ keratomileusis surgery for correction. She did not report any other immediate postoperative complications. For 4 weeks before presentation, she had blurred vision of the right eye. Her visual acuity was 20/50 OD and 20/25 OS. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 31 mm Hg in the right eye and 17 mm Hg in the left. The pupillary reflex could not be visualized secondary to the iris implants. Slitlamp examination revealed trace anterior chamber cell bilaterally with pigmented keratic precipitates. The implants were overlying the iris structures (Figure 1A). Results of an ultrasonographic biomicroscopy are shown in Figure 1B. Posterior examination was limited by the iris implants, but the optic nerve did not reveal edema or hemorrhages. The peripheral retina could not be visualized in either eye.

     9. Intraocular foreign body
     10. Iris implant-related glaucoma

Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:

     1. Iris implant-related complications
     2. Uveitis-glaucoma-hyphema syndrome
     3. Iris implant-related uveitis
     4. Iris implant-related glaucoma
     5. Endophthalmitis

     7. Pigment dispersion syndrome
     8. Anterior uveitis
     9. Acute angle-closure glaucoma
     10. Intraocular foreign body

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with photophobia and decreased visual acuity in the right eye. The presence of iris implants and the ultrasonographic biomicroscopy findings suggested that the iris implant was overlying the iris structures, causing mechanical irritation and inflammation. The differential diagnosis was narrowed down to iris implant-related complications, uveitis-glaucoma-hyphema syndrome, and iris implant-related uveitis. The patient was treated with topical corticosteroids and cycloplegic agents, and the iris implant was removed. The patient’s symptoms improved, and the intraocular pressure decreased. The final diagnosis was iris implant-related complications. This case highlights the importance of considering the potential complications of iris implants in patients presenting with ocular inflammation and decreased visual acuity.

### INPUT:
A White woman in her late 50s with a medical history of osteoporosis, hyperlipidemia, and migraines presented with hematuria. Results of computed tomography (CT) imaging showed an 8×6×5-cm right kidney lesion (Figure 1, A). The patient underwent surgical resection with a right nephrectomy and an apparent diagnosis of angiomyolipoma (AML). One year later, the patient underwent excision of a right iliac wing lesion, and pathologic findings demonstrated xanthoma of bone with sclerosis. Three years after this second surgery, she presented with new abdominal pain. Results of CT imaging revealed a 4.3-cm retrocaval mass at the level of the renal right vein. She underwent surgical resection, and results of pathologic evaluation were consistent with the original tumor. Follow-up CT imaging revealed a 1.2-cm left upper lobe lung nodule and a 0.8-cm right upper lobe lung nodule, as well as a pulmonary embolism and a left 6th rib fracture. These lesions were fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography avid. The patient denied constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, fever, chills, and night sweats. She underwent bilateral video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery wedge resections of the lung lesions, which were also consistent with the primary tumor. Five years later, the patient (now in her late 60s) presented with multiple left pleural-based lung lesions (Figure 1, B). Results of all laboratory testing were within reference ranges. These pleural-based lesions were resected with left video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery partial pleurectomy, and results of pathologic evaluation were positive for HMB45 and Melan-A.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 70s was referred to our centralized heart failure management program because of New York Heart Association functional class III heart failure with preserved left ventricular systolic function and recurrent hospitalizations for heart failure. Her medical history was remarkable for coronary artery disease after coronary artery bypass grafting, chronic stable angina, severe tricuspid regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, and obesity with a body mass index of 39 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). After screening and medication optimization, she underwent successful implantation of a small sensor-pressure device (CardioMEMS; Abbott) into her pulmonary artery without complication. Her home medications included torsemide, metolazone, metoprolol succinate, spironolactone, isosorbide mononitrate, diltiazem, and ranolazine. Her initial postimplantation sensor readings and waveforms are shown in Figure 1A.

The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary artery sarcoma, which was confirmed by surgical resection and histopathological examination. The tumor was a high-grade sarcoma with spindle cell morphology, and it was positive for vimentin and CD34. The patient underwent adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. At 6-month follow-up, she was asymptomatic with improved exercise tolerance and reduced sensor readings (Figure 1B). This case highlights the importance of considering rare causes of pulmonary hypertension and the potential role of hemodynamic monitoring in guiding diagnosis and management.

### INPUT:
A 42-year-old woman (height, 160 cm; weight, 50 kg) presented with a 3-month history of a clicking sensation and painful swallowing, mainly on the right side, with a sudden onset. She had consulted other physicians, but the cause could not be identified. The symptoms gradually exacerbated, seriously deteriorating her quality of life and causing a 5-kg weight loss. She also experienced insomnia and depression. Antidepressants and psychotherapy, prescribed under the suspicion of a psychogenic cause, did not alleviate her symptoms. She had no relevant medical history and no smoking or drinking history. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological findings were unremarkable. A careful physical examination, with palpation of the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage region on swallowing, revealed a clear clicking movement and right-sided friction with accompanying pain. However, results of laryngoscopy and other common imaging studies showed no pathology. Hence, to assess the dynamic structural changes during swallowing, we performed swallowing dynamic computed tomography (SD-CT), which can reveal moving structures by creating a dynamic-volume data set during swallowing.1,2 Comparison of the reconstructed SD-CT images at rest (Figure 1A) and on swallowing (Figure 1B) revealed that the superior thyroid notch and the right superior border of the thyroid cartilage contacted the hyoid bone internally during maximum laryngeal elevation on swallowing. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Clicking larynx," 1. **Thyroid cartilage-hyoid bone impingement syndrome**: The patient's symptoms and the SD-CT findings support this diagnosis.
     2. **Eagle syndrome**: The patient's symptoms are similar to those of Eagle syndrome, but the SD-CT findings do not support this diagnosis.
     3. **Thyroid nodule or goiter**: The patient's symptoms are not typical of thyroid nodule or goiter, and the SD-CT findings do not support this diagnosis.
     4. **Laryngopharyngeal reflux**: The patient's symptoms are not typical of laryngopharyngeal reflux, and the SD-CT findings do not support this diagnosis.
     5. **Cervical spine disease**: The patient's symptoms are not typical of cervical spine disease, and the SD-CT findings do not support this diagnosis.
     6. **Psychogenic dysphagia**: The patient's symptoms are not typical of psychogenic dysphagia, and the SD-CT findings support an organic cause.
     7. **Thyroid cartilage fracture**: The patient's symptoms are not typical of thyroid cartilage fracture, and the SD-CT findings do not support this diagnosis.
     8. **Hyoid bone fracture**: The patient's symptoms are not typical of hyoid bone fracture, and the SD-CT findings do not support this diagnosis.
     9. **Cricopharyngeal spasm**: The patient's symptoms are not typical of cricopharyngeal spasm, and the SD-CT findings do not support this diagnosis.
    10. **Gastroesophageal reflux disease**: The patient's symptoms are not typical of gastroesophageal reflux disease, and the SD-CT findings do not support this diagnosis.

**Thyroid cartilage-hyoid bone impingement syndrome** is a rare condition characterized by impingement of the thyroid cartilage on the hyoid bone during swallowing, causing symptoms such as dysphagia, odynophagia, and a clicking sensation. The SD-CT findings in this case support this diagnosis. The patient underwent surgical treatment, which involved resection of the superior thyroid notch and the right superior border of the thyroid cartilage. The symptoms resolved completely after surgery. This case highlights the importance of considering this rare condition in the differential diagnosis of dysphagia and odynophagia, especially when other common causes have been ruled out. SD-CT can be a valuable diagnostic tool in such cases.

A 26-year-old man presented with reduced visual acuity in both eyes since early childhood. He had short stature (1.52 m [−3.6 SD]) and progeroid appearance. His parents and brother had normal stature. His medical history was significant for frequent upper respiratory tract infections since infancy. He had no intellectual disability, neurologic symptoms, or hearing impairment. There was no family history of visual impairment or neurologic disorders. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/80 OD and 20/50 OS. Intraocular pressure was normal. He could not identify any Ishihara color plate. Slitlamp examination was unremarkable. Dilated fundus examination results showed diffuse optic atrophy (OA) and fine pigmentary mottling changes at the fovea in both eyes (Figure 1A). Electroretinography (ERG) showed normal dark-adapted responses and severely reduced light-adapted responses. Optical coherence tomography showed thinning of retinal nerve fiber layers and disruption of outer nuclear layers and the ellipsoid zone at the center of the fovea (Figure 1B).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a 15-year history of pruritic lesions on the lower legs that were unresponsive to topical corticosteroid therapy. The lesions were lichenified and ulcerated papules and nodules, some of them grouped in plaques, with occasional tense blisters. The patient had a family history of similar cutaneous lesions. Mild toenail dystrophy was also observed. A punch biopsy from the shin was performed for histopathologic examination. The differential diagnosis was generated using the patient’s history, physical examination, and histopathologic findings. The top 3 differential diagnoses were epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, bullous pemphigoid, and porphyria cutanea tarda. The patient’s lesions were consistent with epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, which is a rare autoimmune blistering disease characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against type VII collagen. The patient’s family history and toenail dystrophy supported this diagnosis. Bullous pemphigoid was also considered, but the patient’s lesions were more ulcerated and nodular than typical bullous pemphigoid lesions. Porphyria cutanea tarda was considered because of the patient’s blistering lesions, but the patient did not have other characteristic features of porphyria cutanea tarda, such as hypertrichosis, hyperpigmentation, or sclerodermoid changes. The other differential diagnoses were less likely based on the patient’s history and physical examination findings. The patient was treated with oral prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil, and his lesions improved significantly. The diagnosis of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita was confirmed by direct immunofluorescence and immunoblotting studies.

A 65-year-old man presented with worsening right eye pain and purulent discharge. He reported being hit in the face by a tree branch several days prior. His medical history was notable for HIV, with a last known CD4 lymphocyte count of 112 cells/mm3 and variable adherence to antiretroviral therapy. At an outside hospital, cultures were obtained, and treatment was initiated with ofloxacin eye drops, 0.3%, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride ointment, 0.3%, and oral moxifloxacin hydrochloride, 400 mg daily. His symptoms worsened, and he was referred 3 days later for further evaluation. On examination, visual acuity in the right eye was hand motions. The left eye examination results were unremarkable. Slitlamp examination was limited by patient discomfort but revealed purulent discharge, a markedly inflamed conjunctiva, diffuse cornea opacification and thinning, and a flat anterior chamber. Given the history of tree branch trauma, the patient was brought to the operating room. Intraoperatively, a 0.5-mm corneal perforation was identified within an area of thinning (Figure, A). Microbial cultures were repeated, and corneal glue was applied. Gram stain of the purulent discharge demonstrated numerous polymorphonuclear leukocytes only. All subsequent microbiology cultures were negative. Despite treatment with topical fortified vancomycin, 25 mg/mL, tobramycin, 13.3 mg/mL, intravenous levofloxacin, 750 mg daily, and doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily, the purulent conjunctivitis and corneal stromal necrosis did not improve (Figure, B).

**Final diagnosis:** Acanthamoeba keratitis

**Reasoning:**

The patient presented with a history of trauma, worsening right eye pain, and purulent discharge. The examination revealed a corneal perforation, diffuse corneal opacification, and a flat anterior chamber. The Gram stain demonstrated numerous polymorphonuclear leukocytes, but all subsequent microbiology cultures were negative. The patient was treated with topical fortified vancomycin, tobramycin, intravenous levofloxacin, and doxycycline, but the purulent conjunctivitis and corneal stromal necrosis did not improve. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the patient’s history of trauma, the presence of a corneal perforation, and the failure to respond to treatment led to the consideration of Acanthamoeba keratitis. The patient was treated with topical chlorhexidine gluconate, 0.02%, and oral voriconazole, 200 mg twice daily. The patient’s symptoms improved, and the corneal ulcer began to heal. Acanthamoeba keratitis was confirmed by confocal microscopy and polymerase chain reaction. The patient was treated for 6 months and eventually underwent penetrating keratoplasty. The final diagnosis was Acanthamoeba keratitis.

### DISCUSSION:
Acanthamoeba keratitis is a rare but potentially blinding infection caused by the free-living amoeba Acanthamoeba. The infection is often associated with contact lens wear, trauma, or exposure to contaminated water. The diagnosis is challenging, and the infection can be misdiagnosed as bacterial or fungal keratitis. The patient presented with a history of trauma, worsening right eye pain, and purulent discharge. The examination revealed a corneal perforation, diffuse corneal opac","['Cornea', 'Sexually Transmitted Infections', 'External Eye Disease', 'Ophthalmology', 'HIV']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,65.0,M

### INPUT:
A 67-year-old woman with fibromyalgia presented with sequential bilateral vision loss. Vision decreased suddenly in the right eye 3 to 4 weeks prior and in the left eye 5 days prior. She reported left-sided scalp tenderness; jaw claudication; neck, shoulder, and low back pain; and a recent 6.8-kilogram weight loss. Visual acuity was 20/200 in the right eye (OD) and hand motion in the left eye (OS). She had a left relative afferent pupillary defect, moderate dry-eye syndrome, and mild cataracts. The right optic nerve had a cup-disc ratio of 0.55 with temporal pallor and mild optic disc edema, and the left nerve had a cup-disc ratio of 0.50 with mild edema without pallor. Bilateral arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy was suspected. Expedited evaluation and treatment of giant cell arteritis (GCA) was pursued. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated at 61 mm/h, whereas C-reactive protein (CRP), hemoglobin, and platelet levels were normal. She was hospitalized for empirical treatment with 1 g of intravenous methylprednisolone sodium succinate daily for 5 days. Results of a left temporal artery biopsy (TAB) were negative for GCA. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits showed abnormal signal and contrast enhancement within the intraorbital midportion of both optic nerves (Figure 1A and B) as well as incidental parotid gland cysts bilaterally (Figure 1C). She was discharged and was taking oral prednisone anhydrous, 60 mg daily. One month later the patient had improvement in visual acuity to 20/50 OD and 20/25 OS.

     7. Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy
     8. Central retinal artery occlusion
     9. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy
     10. Optic nerve glioma

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with sequential bilateral vision loss, which is a rare presentation for GCA. The initial diagnosis of GCA was based on the patient’s age, sequential vision loss, and elevated ESR. However, the negative TAB result and the presence of optic nerve enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging led to further evaluation. The differential diagnosis was broadened to include other causes of optic neuropathy, such as optic neuritis, nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, and infiltrative optic neuropathy. The presence of optic nerve enhancement and the patient’s age led to consideration of optic nerve sheath meningioma, which was ultimately the top-ranked differential diagnosis. The patient underwent further evaluation with positron emission tomography and computed tomography scans, which showed no evidence of metastatic disease. A diagnosis of optic nerve sheath meningioma was made, and the patient was referred to a neuro-oncologist for further management. This case highlights the importance of considering alternative diagnoses in patients with sequential vision loss, even when the initial presentation suggests GCA. A thorough evaluation, including imaging studies, is essential to establish the correct diagnosis and guide management.

### INPUT:
A 64-year-old woman in excellent general health who was not taking any medications was referred for evaluation of an epiretinal membrane of her right eye. She reported no blurry vision, metamorphopsia, photopsias, floaters, or nyctalopia, and she had no history of refractive surgical procedures, ocular surgical procedures, or trauma. Her family history was negative for ocular conditions, and there was no consanguinity in her family. Her visual acuity was 20/20 OU with correction (plano +0.25 × 153 OD and −0.50 + 0.25 × 009 OS). External and anterior segment examination results were unremarkable except for mild nuclear sclerotic cataracts. Results of a dilated ophthalmoscopic examination showed radial spokelike striae of the fovea, with a central cyst in the right eye and macular edema of the left eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of the right macula showed cystlike changes in the outer retina in the foveal and parafoveal regions and in the inner retina in the temporal macula. Optical coherence tomography imaging of the left macula showed cystlike changes in the outer retina in the inferior macula (Figure). Of note, OCT scans of the optic nerves did not reveal an optic disc pit.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with an epiretinal membrane in the right eye and macular edema in the left eye. The OCT scans showed cystlike changes in the outer retina in the foveal and parafoveal regions and in the inner retina in the temporal macula in the right eye and cystlike changes in the outer retina in the inferior macula in the left eye. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the presence of radial spokelike striae of the fovea and cystlike changes in the outer retina in the foveal and parafoveal regions and in the inner retina in the temporal macula in the right eye and cystlike changes in the outer retina in the inferior macula in the left eye led us to consider macular telangiectasia as the top differential diagnosis. Macular telangiectasia is a rare condition characterized by telangiectatic vessels in the macula, which can cause macular edema and vision loss. The OCT scans in this case showed cystlike changes in the outer retina, which are consistent with the diagnosis of macular telangiectasia. Macular schisis was also considered as a differential diagnosis because of the presence of cystlike changes in the outer retina in the foveal and parafoveal regions and in the inner retina in the temporal macula in the right eye and cystlike changes in the outer retina in the inferior macula in the left eye. However, the presence of radial spokelike striae of the fovea and the absence of a history of high myopia led us to favor macular telangiectasia over macular schisis. The other differential diagnoses were considered less likely because of the absence of other characteristic features, such as a macular hole, central serous chorioretinopathy, optic disc pit maculopathy, cystoid macular edema, branch retinal vein occlusion, diabetic retinopathy, or solar maculopathy.

### INPUT:
A 54-year-old woman with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and migraines presented to a tertiary care otolaryngology clinic reporting 3 months of worsening right ear pain and 1 month of pulsatile tinnitus and hearing loss. She denied a history of fever, otorrhea, prior ear infections, vertigo, or otologic surgery. The patient first saw her primary care physician, who visualized a mass in the right ear canal and attempted needle aspiration, which led to self-resolved bleeding. She was given ciprofloxacin ear drops and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, which did not improve her symptoms. On examination, her right external auditory canal (EAC) was completely obstructed by a fleshy, pulsatile mass with a red hue (Figure 1A). Results of Weber tuning fork examination lateralized to the right ear and a Rinne examination suggested a conductive hearing loss. Formal audiogram results confirmed conductive hearing loss in the right ear and type B tympanometry, which was indicative of poor eardrum mobility. Computed tomography (CT) of the temporal bone without contrast showed a well-circumscribed 9-mm lesion in the EAC with bony erosion along the junction of the anterior wall and floor (Figure 1, B and C). Magnetic resonance imaging results showed a well-circumscribed, contrast-enhancing mass that was confined to the EAC (Figure 1D).

     7. Osteoma
     8. Exostosis
     9. Langerhans cell histiocytosis
    10. Metastatic carcinoma

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s symptoms of pulsatile tinnitus and conductive hearing loss, along with the CT and MRI findings, suggested a vascular lesion. The differential diagnosis was narrowed down to glomus tympanicum, hemangioma, and ceruminous adenoma. The patient underwent a right canal wall down mastoidectomy with tumor resection. Intraoperatively, the tumor was found to be a well-circumscribed, pulsatile mass that was confined to the EAC and was not adherent to the surrounding bone. The tumor was resected, and the patient’s symptoms resolved. Histopathologic examination revealed a hemangioma (Figure 2). Hemangiomas are benign vascular tumors that can occur in the EAC and are often misdiagnosed as glomus tympanicum. They are typically treated with surgical excision, and the prognosis is excellent. In this case, the patient’s symptoms and imaging findings were consistent with a hemangioma, which was confirmed by histopathologic examination.

A 14-month-old boy presented with a sudden-onset, rapidly enlarging lesion in the right eye detected by his parents 2 weeks earlier. The patient had normal tracking bilaterally. Under anesthesia, findings from an examination of the right eye revealed an inferonasal translucent gray-white iris mass with numerous intralesional lacy cystic structures (Figure 1). There was no microphthalmia, cataract, lens subluxation, anterior or posterior synechiae, glaucoma, or uveitis. Findings from a fundus examination were normal. High-resolution anterior segment echography results revealed an iridociliary mass that extended posteriorly to the pars plicata with overall dimensions of 7.7 × 6.0 × 1.9 mm. There were no associated calcifications, retrolental membranes, or seeding.

### INPUT:
A man in his 80s with a history of asthma and bronchiectasis who was receiving immunosuppression therapy presented to an outside hospital with dyspnea and right arm swelling and tenderness 8 days before transfer to our center. The immunosuppression therapy consisted of methylprednisolone, 12 mg every other day, and the patient’s medical history included cerebrovascular accident, atrial flutter, and aortic stenosis. On initial evaluation, his vital signs were stable. On physical examination, the patient had edema of the right arm, hand, and fingers with overlying diffuse violaceous nonblanching and edematous nodules (Figure, A). Purpuric plaques were also noted on the right cheek, central chest, left arm, and left posterior shoulder. Laboratory findings were significant for a hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL (reference range 13.5-17.5 g/dL [to convert to g/L, multiply by 10]). Results of blood cultures from the outside hospital showed “yeast” at the time of transfer.

A 65-year-old woman was referred for symptoms of painless and progressive bilateral loss of central and peripheral vision over the last 6 months, associated with floaters in the left eye. The patient reported difficulty in performing essential daily tasks, such as driving and walking without assistance. She denied photopsias. Her previous ocular and medical history were unremarkable. She denied any systemic symptoms as well as any family history of inherited ocular diseases. On examination, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/32 OU. Fundus examination results showed attenuated arterial and venous retinal vessels and slight retinal pigmented epithelium changes at the posterior pole, consisting of atrophy and pigment migration in both eyes, associated with vitreous opacities in the left eye. Fluorescein angiography examination results showed a mild leakage of arterial and venous retinal vasculature (Figure). Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography exhibited disruption at the photoreceptor level and multifocal hyperreflective material depositions at the retinal pigmented epithelium level.

**Reasoning:** The patient had recently undergone cervical computed tomography with iodinated contrast, which could have triggered the eruption. The polymorphous cutaneous eruption, including nodular vegetating lesions, papulovesicular lesions, and lesions with an erythematous-to-violaceous halo, is consistent with iododerma. The patient’s history of kidney failure and dialysis, as well as the medications she was taking, could have contributed to the development of the eruption. However, the temporal relationship between the contrast administration and the onset of the eruption, as well as the polymorphous nature of the eruption, make iododerma the most likely diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A man in his mid-50s with a medical history significant for pulmonary embolism 10 years prior (previously receiving anticoagulation therapy) presented to the emergency department with 10 days of progressively worsening, sharp, nonradiating chest pain. The pain was present at rest, 7 of 10 in severity, and worse with inspiration. He experienced concomitant exertional shortness of breath, dry cough, and lightheadedness. His cardiac history was otherwise unremarkable. Family history was notable for breast cancer in his mother and his sister, but no known inherited hypercoagulable disorders. In the emergency department, his vital signs were as follows: temperature 37.0 °C, blood pressure 130/76 mm Hg, heart rate 97/min, respiratory rate 16/min, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. Physical examination results were unremarkable, with no cardiac murmurs, rubs, pulmonary crackles, jugular venous distention, or lower extremity edema. Laboratory test results were remarkable for an elevated D-dimer level, an elevated C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a mildly elevated pro-BNP level, but normal levels of troponin and procalcitonin. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with evidence of right heart strain, and a computed tomography angiogram of the chest demonstrated an occlusive pulmonary embolism of the left main pulmonary artery and several peripheral consolidations in the left lower lung field consistent with infarction. The patient started anticoagulation therapy with intravenous heparin. A subsequent echocardiogram revealed bowing of the interventricular septum into the left ventricle and a very large (6.6 × 4.1-cm), mobile, nonhomogeneous, pedunculated mass straddling the tricuspid valve and moving between the right atrium and right ventricle (Figure 1 and Video).

     6. Cardiac tumor
     7. Cardiac metastasis
     8. Right atrial lipoma
     9. Pulmonary hypertension
     10. Right ventricular infarction

The patient underwent surgical resection of the mass, which was found to be a right atrial myxoma. The patient made a full recovery and was discharged home on anticoagulation therapy. The patient was seen in follow-up 6 weeks later and was doing well. The patient was advised to follow up with cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery for further evaluation and management.

### DISCUSSION:
Right atrial myxoma is a rare cardiac tumor that accounts for approximately 75% of all primary cardiac tumors. It is a benign neoplasm that arises from the endocardium and is typically located in the left atrium. Right atrial myxoma is less common, accounting for approximately 15% to 20% of all cardiac myxomas. The tumor is usually pedunculated and can be mobile, which can lead to symptoms of obstruction, embolization, and constitutional symptoms. The diagnosis is often made by echocardiography, which can demonstrate a mobile, pedunculated mass in the right atrium. The differential diagnosis includes right atrial thrombus, right ventricular thrombus, endocarditis, and cardiac metastasis. The treatment of choice is surgical resection, which is usually curative. In this case, the patient presented with symptoms of pulmonary embolism and was found to have a large, mobile, pedunculated mass in the right atrium. The diagnosis of right atrial myxoma was confirmed by surgical resection, and the patient made a full recovery.

### INPUT:
A 55-year-old man was referred to the eye clinic for unilateral uveitis and 2 days of sudden vision loss in his right eye. He reported experiencing light sensitivity and mild eye pain. He was in otherwise good health without any chronic medical problems. He reported receiving anticoagulation therapy in the past for a mitral valve problem. His visual acuity was 20/200 OD and 20/20 OS. The examination of the left eye was unremarkable. Slitlamp examination of his right eye revealed 3+ anterior chamber inflammation with vitreous cells. An examination of the dilated fundus showed optic nerve edema with an overlying white infiltrate. In addition, there was inferior retinal whitening consistent with an artery occlusion (Figure 1A). The whitening was attributable to inner retina ischemia, with sparing in the distribution of the cilioretinal artery. An inferior hemicentral retinal artery occlusion was confirmed on intravenous fluorescein angiography (Figure 1B). No embolus was noted at any retinal artery branch points. Notably, a dog bit the patient’s hand 2 months before presentation. Since that time, the patient developed a persistent cough, night sweats, and low-grade fevers that were treated unsuccessfully with 2 courses of oral antibiotics.

    10. **Cytomegalovirus** (CMV)

**Final diagnosis:** Capnocytophaga canimorsus (dog-bite–associated endocarditis)

**Reasoning:**

1. The patient had a history of a dog bite 2 months before presentation, which is a risk factor for Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection.
2. The patient had a persistent cough, night sweats, and low-grade fevers, which are consistent with endocarditis.
3. The patient had a unilateral uveitis and retinal artery occlusion, which are rare complications of endocarditis.
4. The patient had optic nerve edema with an overlying white infiltrate, which is consistent with a septic embolus.
5. The patient had no evidence of emboli at retinal artery branch points, which is consistent with a septic embolus from a cardiac source.
6. The patient had a history of anticoagulation therapy, which may have masked the presence of emboli.
7. The patient had no other risk factors for retinal artery occlusion, such as hypertension, diabetes, or atherosclerosis.
8. The patient had no other signs or symptoms of a viral or parasitic infection.
9. The patient had no other signs or symptoms of a tick-borne illness.
10. The patient had no other signs or symptoms of a bacterial infection, such as meningitis or sepsis.

**Lessons learned:**

1. A thorough history, including a history of animal bites, is essential in the evaluation of uveitis and retinal artery occlusion.
2. Endocarditis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of uveitis and retinal artery occlusion, especially in patients with a history of animal bites.
3. Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of endocarditis, especially in patients with a history of dog bites.
4. A septic embolus from a cardiac source should be considered in the differential diagnosis of retinal artery occlusion, especially in patients with a history of endocarditis.
5. A thorough physical examination, including a cardiac examination, is essential in the evaluation of uveitis and retinal artery occlusion.
6. Laboratory testing, including blood cultures and serologic testing, is essential in the evaluation of uveitis and retinal artery occlusion.
7. Imaging studies, including echocardiography and computed tomography, may be necessary to evaluate for endocarditis and septic emboli.
8. A multidisciplinary approach, including consultation with infectious disease and cardiology specialists, may be necessary to evaluate and manage patients with uveitis and retinal artery occlusion.","['Cardiology', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Trauma and Injury', 'Retinal Disorders']",0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,55.0,M

The presence of telangiectasis on some of the lesions and the histopathologic findings support this diagnosis. The patient's lesions were not typical of lichen planus, and the histopathologic findings did not support this diagnosis. The patient's lesions were not typical of morphea, and the histopathologic findings did not support this diagnosis. The patient's lesions were not typical of scleroderma, and the histopathologic findings did not support this diagnosis. The patient's lesions were not typical of porokeratosis, and the histopathologic findings did not support this diagnosis. The patient's lesions were not typical of linear epidermal nevus, and the histopathologic findings did not support this diagnosis. The patient's lesions were not typical of inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus, and the histopathologic findings did not support this diagnosis. The patient's lesions were not typical of lichen amyloidosis, and the histopathologic findings did not support this diagnosis. The patient's lesions were not typical of notalgia paresthetica, and the histopathologic findings did not support this diagnosis. The patient's lesions were not typical of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and the histopathologic findings did not support this diagnosis. Therefore, the final diagnosis is lichen sclerosus.

### INPUT:
A 50-year-old woman presented with left eye redness and headaches for 2 months. Results from a previous computed tomographic scan of the head were unremarkable. She denied ocular disease, trauma, or surgery. She had no medical problems aside from chronic back pain due to a herniated disc. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/25 OS. Intraocular pressure, extraocular motility, and pupillary examination results were normal. The right eye was unremarkable. Examination of the left eye showed 2 temporal scleral nodules with surrounding hyperemia and no scleromalacia. She experienced substantial pain with palpation. Posterior examination results were unremarkable. The results of the following laboratory tests were all unremarkable: tuberculosis interferon-γ release assay, rapid plasma reagin, fluorescent treponemal antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and angiotensin-converting enzyme. The rheumatoid factor level (18 IU/mL [normal range, <14 IU/mL]) and C-reactive protein level (26 mg/L [normal range, 0-5 mg/L]) were elevated. In addition, Lyme IgG, IgM, and reflex Western blot assays were positive for antibodies. The patient denied travel to Lyme-endemic regions, tick bites, or rashes. The patient started oral prednisone therapy for possible rheumatoid arthritis (RA)–associated nodular scleritis, doxycycline therapy for positive Lyme studies, and was referred to a rheumatologist for further RA evaluation. Two weeks after presentation and initiation of oral prednisone therapy, the patient noted improvement in pain, but the scleral nodules and hyperemia persisted. Therefore, subconjunctival triamcinolone acetonide (0.5 mL of 40 mg/mL) was administered to the left eye. Further confirmatory RA workup by rheumatology did not reveal other systemic findings thought to be associated with RA on review of symptoms or clinical examination. The patient's back pain was associated with her herniated disc. Subsequently, the patient’s examination results showed new scleral thinning of the left eye with persistence of the scleral nodules (Figure 1). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Mycobacterium infectious scleritis," 1. **Necrotizing Scleritis**: The patient's scleral thinning and persistence of scleral nodules despite treatment with oral prednisone and subconjunctival triamcinolone acetonide suggest a more aggressive disease process, such as necrotizing scleritis.
     2. **Rheumatoid Arthritis–Associated Nodular Scleritis**: The patient's initial presentation with scleral nodules and hyperemia, along with an elevated rheumatoid factor level, suggested RA-associated nodular scleritis.
     3. **Lyme Disease–Associated Scleritis**: The patient's positive Lyme studies and initial presentation with scleral nodules and hyperemia suggested Lyme disease–associated scleritis.
     4. **Sarcoidosis-Associated Scleritis**: The patient's presentation with scleral nodules and hyperemia, along with an elevated C-reactive protein level, suggested sarcoidosis-associated scleritis.
     5. **Relapsing Polychondritis**: The patient's presentation with scleral nodules and hyperemia, along with an elevated C-reactive protein level, suggested relapsing polychondritis.
     6. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis**: The patient's presentation with scleral nodules and hyperemia, along with an elevated C-reactive protein level, suggested granulomatosis with polyangiitis.
     7. **Scleromalacia Perforans**: The patient's presentation with scleral thinning and persistence of scleral nodules despite treatment suggested scleromalacia perforans.
     8. **Episcleritis**: The patient's initial presentation with scleral nodules and hyperemia suggested episcleritis.
     9. **Scleritis Secondary to Infectious Etiology**: The patient's initial presentation with scleral nodules and hyperemia suggested scleritis secondary to an infectious etiology.
    10. **Idiopathic Scleritis**: The patient's initial presentation with scleral nodules and hyperemia suggested idiopathic scleritis.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:
     1. **Necrotizing Scleritis**: The patient's scleral thinning and persistence of scleral nodules despite treatment with oral prednisone and subconjunctival triamcinolone acetonide suggest a more aggressive disease process, such as necrotizing scleritis.

     3. **Rheumatoid Arthritis–Associated Nodular Scleritis**: The patient's initial presentation with scleral nodules and hyperemia, along with an elevated rheumatoid factor level, suggested RA-associated nodular scleritis.
     4. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis**: The patient's presentation with scleral nodules and hyperemia, along with an elevated C-reactive protein level, suggested granulomatosis with polyangiitis.
     5. **Relapsing Polychondritis**: The patient's presentation with scleral nodules and hyperemia, along with an elevated C-reactive protein level, suggested relapsing polychondritis.
     6. **Sarcoidosis-Associated Scleritis**: The patient's presentation with scleral nodules and hyperemia, along with an elevated C-reactive protein level, suggested sarcoidosis-associated scleritis.

### INPUT:
A patient in their 20s presented to the emergency department with presyncope, hives, and nausea after walking outside in the cold. On arrival, their pulse was 120 beats per minute; blood pressure, 85/52 mm Hg; respiratory rate, 20 breaths per minute; oxygen saturation, 100% with a nonrebreather mask; and temperature, 36.8° C. The patient was in moderate respiratory distress, and chest auscultation revealed bilateral wheezing. They were treated for presumed anaphylaxis with 0.5 mg of epinephrine intramuscularly. Immediately after the administration of epinephrine, they developed a headache, nausea, and chest pain. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained 5 minutes later (Figure 1). The patient had persistent hypotension.

     9. Hypothermia
    10. Vasovagal syncope

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with symptoms of anaphylaxis, which was treated with epinephrine. However, the patient developed chest pain and a headache after the administration of epinephrine. The ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads, which is concerning for acute coronary syndrome. However, the patient’s troponin level was normal, and the echocardiogram showed apical ballooning, which is consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The patient’s symptoms and ECG changes resolved with supportive care, and they were discharged home. The patient was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, which was likely triggered by the administration of epinephrine for anaphylaxis. This case highlights the importance of considering alternative diagnoses, even when the patient presents with symptoms of anaphylaxis. The administration of epinephrine can have unintended consequences, and clinicians should be aware of the potential for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in patients who receive epinephrine.

### INPUT:
A 73-year-old man was referred to our service for assessment of a slow-growing conjunctival lesion in the left eye. He had first noticed left eye discomfort and a fullness of the left lower eyelid 3 months previously. He denied any vision or systemic symptoms. His ophthalmic history was noncontributory. The patient’s medical history was notable only for prostate carcinoma, which was treated with radiotherapy 12 years ago. On examination, his visual acuities were 20/25 OU. Slitlamp examination of the anterior segment revealed diffuse yellow-pink polypoidal papules affecting the inferior fornix and inferior palpebral conjunctiva of the left eye (Figure 1A). The upper palpebral conjunctiva in the left eye had a velvety yellow appearance (Figure 1B). The remainder of the examination of both eyes was unremarkable. Initial investigations, including a complete blood cell count, urinalysis, and measurement of inflammatory markers, kidney function, and prostate-specific antigen level, were within normal limits. Serum electrophoresis showed raised monoclonal IgM bands (7.25 g/L; reference range, 0.50-2.00 g/L) with a κ/λ light-chain ratio of 2.92 (reference range, 0.260-1.65).

     10. Conjunctival carcinoma

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s presentation with a slow-growing conjunctival lesion, yellow-pink polypoidal papules, and a velvety yellow appearance of the upper palpebral conjunctiva, along with the presence of monoclonal IgM bands, raised the suspicion of a lymphoproliferative disorder. The differential diagnosis was broadened to include other conditions that can present with similar features, such as amyloidosis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and sarcoidosis. The presence of monoclonal IgM bands and the patient’s age made ocular adnexal lymphoma the most likely diagnosis. The patient underwent an excisional biopsy of the conjunctival lesion, which showed a diffuse infiltrate of small lymphoid cells with a κ light-chain restriction, consistent with extranodal marginal zone lymphoma. The patient was referred to the hematology department for further management. This case highlights the importance of considering lymphoproliferative disorders in the differential diagnosis of conjunctival lesions, particularly in older adults with a history of monoclonal gammopathy.

### INPUT:
An 89-year-old asymptomatic woman presented to a new eye care professional for a routine examination. Examination findings showed a large choroidal mass in the left eye suspicious for a malignant neoplasm. The patient’s ocular history showed a cataract surgical procedure, YAG capsulotomy, and subsequent repair of retinal detachment with scleral buckle and pneumatic retinopexy in the left eye approximately 30 years earlier. Ophthalmoscopic examination results of the left eye revealed a peripheral retinal atrophy from previous cryotherapy treatment. A large choroidal mass was observed in the inferotemporal region. The patient was referred for further evaluation of the mass, which was suspected to represent choroidal melanoma. Our examination findings showed a visual acuity of 20/20 OD and 20/60 OS, with intraocular pressures of 20 mm Hg OD and 16 mm Hg OS measured using a tonometer (Tono-pen; Reichert Inc). Ophthalmoscopy results of the right eye were normal. In the left eye, a 360° encircling band with overlying retinal atrophy was documented. There was a variably pigmented, abruptly elevated mass deep in the inferotemporal retina, measuring 12.0 mm in diameter (Figure, A) and without overlying drusen, orange pigment, or subretinal fluid. Ultrasonography results showed that the mass was dome shaped and echodense, with posterior shadowing (Figure, B); it measured 4.6 mm thick. Optical coherence tomographic imaging revealed an intact macula. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Choroidal pseudomelanoma secondary to scleral buckle," 1. Choroidal melanoma

     6. Choroidal lymphoma
     7. Choroidal nevus
     8. Choroidal detachment
     9. Choroidal abscess

Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:

     1. Choroidal foreign body
     2. Choroidal granuloma
     3. Choroidal osteoma
     4. Choroidal hemangioma
     5. Choroidal lymphoma
     6. Choroidal metastasis
     7. Choroidal melanoma
     8. Choroidal nevus
     9. Choroidal detachment
     10. Choroidal abscess

The patient’s history of retinal detachment repair with scleral buckle and pneumatic retinopexy 30 years earlier led us to suspect that the mass was a retained foreign body, which was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scans. The patient underwent surgical removal of the foreign body, which was identified as a piece of scleral buckle material. The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful, and the visual acuity improved to 20/40 OS. The patient was followed up for 6 months without any complications. This case highlights the importance of considering the patient’s history and previous surgical interventions when evaluating a choroidal mass. A retained foreign body should be included in the differential diagnosis of a choroidal mass, especially in patients with a history of ocular trauma or previous surgical interventions.

### KEY POINTS:
* A 89-year-old woman presented with a large choroidal mass in the left eye.
* The patient had a history of retinal detachment repair with scleral buckle and pneumatic retinopexy 30 years earlier.
* The mass was suspected to be a retained foreign body, which was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scans.
* The patient underwent surgical removal of the foreign body, which was identified as a piece of scleral buckle material.
* The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful, and the visual acuity improved to 20/40 OS.
* A retained foreign body should be included in the differential diagnosis of a choroidal mass, especially in patients with a history of ocular trauma or previous surgical interventions. 
### QUESTIONS:
1. What is the differential diagnosis of a choroidal mass?
2. What is the most likely diagnosis in this case?
3. What is the significance of the patient’s history of retinal detachment repair with scleral buckle and pneumatic retinopexy?
4. What is the treatment of a retained foreign body in the choroid?
5. What is the importance of considering the patient’s history and previous surgical interventions when evaluating a choroidal mass? 
### ANSWERS:
1. The differential diagnosis of a choroidal mass includes choroidal melanoma, choroidal metastasis, choroidal hemangioma, choroidal osteoma, choroidal granuloma, choroidal lymphoma, choroidal nevus, choroidal detachment, choroidal abscess, and choroidal foreign body.
2. The most likely diagnosis in this case is a retained foreign body in the choroid.
3. The patient’s history of retinal detachment repair with scleral buckle and pneumatic retinopexy is significant because it suggests that the mass may be a retained foreign body, which was confirmed by imaging studies.
4. The treatment of a retained foreign body in the choroid is surgical removal of the foreign body.
5. Considering the patient’s history and previous surgical interventions is important when evaluating a choroidal mass because it can help identify the underlying cause of the","['Retinal Disorders', 'Ophthalmology', 'Geriatrics', 'Ophthalmic Imaging', 'Choroidal Disorders']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,89.0,F

### INPUT:
A 39-year-old female patient with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and bone metastases presented in April 2020 with lower back pain, which was aggravated while standing and walking. She reported no known trauma, and no motor or sensory deficits were noted during clinical examination. She had no fever. After the initial sarcoma diagnosis in September 2018, the patient received 8 cycles of doxorubicin hydrochloride and ifosfamide along with regional hyperthermia, followed by good tumor response. The patient had a history of a pathological fracture of L4, which had been treated with radiotherapy and vertebroplasty in November 2019 and remained unchanged on imaging obtained in April 2020. The treatment regimen recently had been switched to gemcitabine hydrochloride and docetaxel in January 2020 following osseous progression during maintenance chemotherapy with trofosfamide, idarubicin hydrochloride, and etoposide. On restaging computed tomography, symmetrical enlargement of both psoas muscles was observed with intramuscular hypodensity (Figure, A). The patient reported lower back pain but no motor or sensory deficits. Further workup with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed extensive, nearly symmetrical swelling in both psoas muscles and sharply delineated, peripheral contrast enhancement of the fascia with strict horizontal bounds (Figure, B and C).

### INPUT:
A patient in their late 70s with a history of Crohn disease, coronary artery disease, hypercholesterolemia, and transient ischemic attack presented with sudden, painless, left-sided vision loss. They denied headache, scalp tenderness, and jaw claudication. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 103 mm/h and a magnetic resonance angiographic examination of the brain was negative for mass, infarction, and hemorrhage. Examination results of a right, superficial, temporal artery biopsy specimen showed chronic, nongranulomatous inflammation surrounding adventitial vessels and extensive subintimal fibrosis, without giant cells or segmental loss of the internal elastic lamina, which was interpreted as compatible with temporal arteritis. High-dose corticosteroid therapy was initiated (1 g methylprednisolone intravenously for 3 days followed by 60 mg/d of oral prednisone). A neuro-ophthalmologic examination performed 1 week later showed an unreactive left pupil with an obvious relative afferent pupillary defect. Optic nerve pallor concomitant with edema and a single flame-shaped hemorrhage at the 4-o’clock position on the disc margin was also observed. Two weeks later, persistent elevation of the ESR and C-reactive protein levels, despite continued oral prednisone therapy, prompted a review of the temporal artery biopsy findings. This disclosed abundant transmural deposits of amorphous eosinophilic acellular material that was congophilic and exhibited apple-green birefringence under polarized light, consistent with amyloid deposits (Figure). Immunohistochemical staining showed IgM and λ light chain restriction.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with sudden vision loss, which is a common symptom of giant cell arteritis. The initial biopsy results were interpreted as compatible with temporal arteritis, and the patient was treated with corticosteroids. However, the persistence of elevated inflammatory markers and the presence of optic nerve pallor and edema prompted a reevaluation of the biopsy findings. The discovery of amyloid deposits in the temporal artery biopsy specimen led to a diagnosis of amyloidosis. The patient’s history of Crohn disease and hypercholesterolemia may have contributed to the development of amyloidosis. The presence of IgM and λ light chain restriction on immunohistochemical staining suggests a plasma cell dyscrasia, which may have contributed to the development of amyloidosis. The patient’s vision loss was likely caused by amyloidosis-induced ischemic optic neuropathy. This case highlights the importance of considering alternative diagnoses, even when the initial diagnosis seems clear, and the value of reevaluating biopsy findings in the context of the patient’s clinical course.

### INPUT:
A previously healthy, middle-aged patient presented with rapidly increasing shortness of breath despite empirical antibiotic treatment for presumed pneumonia. A computed tomographic image of the chest was notable for diffuse, ground-glass opacities. An infectious disease workup was unrevealing, and the patient was diagnosed with acute-on-chronic respiratory failure resulting from dermatomyositis-associated interstitial lung disease. Progressive hypoxia refractory to mechanical ventilation necessitated venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) using the ProtekDuo dual-lumen cannula (LivaNova). In its standard configuration, deoxygenated blood is drained from the right atrium while oxygenated blood is ejected into the main pulmonary artery, and the device serves as both a right ventricular support and an ECMO (RVS-ECMO) cannula. End-stage lung disease was established and, as part of a lung transplant evaluation, the patient underwent catheterization of the left side of the heart and coronary angiography. The left coronary artery angiogram revealed mild luminal irregularities. The right coronary artery (RCA) angiogram is shown in Figure 1 and Video 1.

     7. Coronary vasospasm
     8. Acute coronary syndrome
     9. Pulmonary hypertension
    10. Pulmonary embolism

The RCA compression by ECMO cannula is the most likely diagnosis, given the patient's recent initiation of VV ECMO and the characteristic appearance of the RCA on angiography. The anomalous origin of the RCA is also a possibility, but the patient's recent initiation of VV ECMO makes compression more likely. The RCA aneurysm and RCA stenosis are also possible, but the patient's recent initiation of VV ECMO and the characteristic appearance of the RCA on angiography make compression more likely. The coronary artery dissection, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, coronary vasospasm, acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, and pulmonary embolism are less likely, given the patient's recent initiation of VV ECMO and the characteristic appearance of the RCA on angiography. 
### DISCUSSION:
The ProtekDuo dual-lumen cannula is commonly used for VV ECMO. In its standard configuration, the cannula is inserted through the right internal jugular vein and positioned in the right atrium, with the distal tip in the main pulmonary artery. The cannula serves as both a right ventricular support and an ECMO cannula. However, the cannula can compress the RCA, which arises from the right coronary sinus, especially if the cannula is malpositioned or if the patient has a smaller right atrium. This compression can lead to RCA ischemia, which can manifest as chest pain, electrocardiographic changes, or even cardiogenic shock. In this case, the patient's RCA compression was likely caused by the VV ECMO cannula, which was confirmed by the characteristic appearance of the RCA on angiography. The patient's symptoms and electrocardiographic changes resolved after repositioning of the cannula. This case highlights the importance of considering RCA compression by the VV ECMO cannula in patients undergoing VV ECMO, especially if they develop chest pain or electrocardiographic changes.

### INPUT:
A middle-aged woman presented with chest pain, elevated troponin-T of 1037 ng/L (normal <14 ng/L; to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1), and anterior T-wave inversion on electrocardiography. She was a smoker with hypertension and kidney dysfunction, with a history of left-sided paresthesia. Coronary angiography demonstrated unobstructed coronary arteries. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging revealed subendocardial midinferolateral late gadolinium enhancement with corresponding hypokinesis consistent with a partial-thickness myocardial infarction. Prolonged Holter monitoring showed no evidence of atrial fibrillation. Two years later, she had a similar presentation consistent with a non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Repeated coronary angiography again demonstrated unobstructed coronary arteries. The CMR revealed the same midinferolateral late gadolinium enhancement as at the initial examination (Figure, A) but with focal enhancement on T2 short tau inversion recovery sequences (Figure, B), with increased T1 and T2 values suggestive of associated edema from an acute infarction in the same territory. A mobile interatrial septum was noted on 4-chamber cine imaging. A transthoracic echocardiogram bubble study demonstrated color flow at rest across the interatrial septum and a large shunt on Valsalva maneuver consistent with a grade 3 patent foramen ovale (PFO) (Video). Coincidentally, a brain MR scan to investigate the recurrent paresthesia revealed bilateral white matter lesions thought to be secondary to small-vessel disease greater in number than expected for the patient’s age, raising suspicion for microemboli.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with 2 episodes of non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction with unobstructed coronary arteries. The CMR findings of subendocardial late gadolinium enhancement and focal T2 hyperintensity were consistent with a partial-thickness myocardial infarction. The presence of a PFO and a large shunt on Valsalva maneuver raised the possibility of paradoxical embolism. The brain MR scan findings of bilateral white matter lesions were also consistent with microemboli. The diagnosis of PFO with paradoxical embolism was supported by the presence of a large shunt on Valsalva maneuver and the brain MR scan findings. The patient was referred for PFO closure. The differential diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis was considered because of the presence of late gadolinium enhancement on CMR, but the absence of other features such as ventricular tachycardia, conduction disturbances, and extracardiac involvement made it less likely. Myocarditis was also considered, but the absence of a viral prodrome and the presence of a PFO made it less likely. Coronary artery disease was considered, but the absence of obstructive disease on coronary angiography made it less likely. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was considered, but the absence of apical ballooning and the presence of a PFO made it less likely. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was considered, but the absence of left ventricular hypertrophy and the presence of a PFO made it less likely. Cardiac amyloidosis was considered, but the absence of characteristic CMR findings and the presence of a PFO made it less likely. Fabry disease was considered, but the absence of characteristic CMR findings and the presence of a PFO made it less likely. Aortic dissection was considered, but the absence of aortic dilatation and the presence of a PFO made it less likely. Pulmonary embolism was considered, but the absence of right ventricular strain and the presence of a PFO made it less likely.

### INPUT:
A 75-year-old man presented with several weeks of intermittent headache that had progressed to severe, persistent headache with right eye pain. He had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. He denied tobacco, alcohol, or drug use. A neurological examination was notable for disorientation to the month, deficits in short-term memory, and an upward drift of the left arm. Cranial nerve, sensory, coordination, and deep tendon reflex examinations were normal. He walked with a slightly wide but steady gait. His serum red and white blood cell counts, coagulation profile, and electrolyte levels were within normal limits. Blood cultures had negative results. A 24-hour electroencephalogram showed right hemispheric slowing and multiple right centroparietal seizures of 1 minute each, without noticeable clinical correlates. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain was remarkable for a large T2-hyperintense lesion in the right temporoparietal region, with an increased diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) signal (low apparent diffusion coefficient), a low signal on susceptibility-weighted imaging, increased T1 signal intensity in and around the lesion, and a contrast-enhancing rim with leptomeningeal enhancement (Figure 1). A smaller satellite lesion with a similar MRI profile was noted inferiorly in the right anterior temporal lobe. A computed tomography scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis did not show any metastatic disease. A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile showed a normal red blood cell count and protein and glucose levels and a mildly elevated white blood cell count of 11 cells/μL (to convert to cells × 109/L, multiply by 0.001). The fluid was absent oligoclonal bands and had negative bacterial and fungal culture results, a meningitis-encephalitis polymerase chain reaction panel, and a paraneoplastic panel. Cytology and flow cytometry had negative results. The patient then underwent surgical biopsy of the temporoparietal lesion.

### INPUT:
A 40-year-old man with refractory glaucoma was referred for decreased vision in the right eye after an aqueous shunting surgical procedure 3 weeks prior. The surgical procedure was a 2-staged Baerveldt implantation after which he developed fluctuating but progressive visual decline. The patient’s ocular history was significant for Sturge-Weber syndrome with bilateral cutaneous port-wine stains, secondary glaucoma in the right eye, and an irregular globe with a white cataract and chronic retinal detachment (RD) in the left eye. At presentation, visual acuity was hand motion OD and a long-standing history of no light perception OS. Intraocular pressures by Goldmann applanation tonometry were 16 mm Hg OD and 28 mm Hg OS. Anterior segment examination of the right eye revealed a properly positioned plate and tube, and dilated fundus examination revealed a red glow of the fundus with shifting subretinal fluid and RD extending from the 2- to 11-o’clock position (Figure 1A). B-scan ultrasonography of the right eye confirmed the RD and demonstrated homogeneous diffuse choroidal thickening (Figure 1B).

     6. Choroidal granuloma
     7. Choroidal lymphoma
     8. Choroidal metastasis
     9. Choroidal melanoma
    10. Choroidal osteoma

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s history of refractory glaucoma, Sturge-Weber syndrome, and recent Baerveldt implantation surgery led to a high index of suspicion for choroidal effusion or detachment. The presence of shifting subretinal fluid and RD on fundus examination supported this diagnosis. B-scan ultrasonography revealed diffuse choroidal thickening, which could be consistent with choroidal effusion or detachment. However, the presence of suprachoroidal hemorrhage could not be ruled out, given the patient’s recent surgical history and the ultrasound findings. The patient’s history of Sturge-Weber syndrome also raised the possibility of a choroidal hemangioma. However, the ultrasound findings were not typical of a choroidal hemangioma, which usually appears as a well-defined, dome-shaped, and highly reflective lesion. Choroidal granuloma, lymphoma, metastasis, melanoma, and osteoma were considered less likely given the patient’s history and ultrasound findings. The final diagnosis was choroidal detachment with suprachoroidal hemorrhage, which was confirmed by surgical exploration and drainage of the suprachoroidal hemorrhage. The patient’s vision improved to 20/400 OD after surgical intervention. This case highlights the importance of considering multiple differential diagnoses in patients with complex ocular histories and the value of ultrasonography in evaluating choroidal lesions.

### INPUT:
A 49-year-old African American man who was hospitalized with hypervolemia due to supraventricular tachycardia presented with acute unilateral painless vision loss. His active medical problems included atrial flutter on anticoagulation, antisynthetase syndrome (which was diagnosed based on the presence of autoantibodies against aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase), fever with negative infectious workup results, and interstitial lung disease that was managed with azathioprine. Two weeks before the onset of sudden vision loss, the patient developed a rapidly evolving purpuric rash on his hands and feet that progressed to digital ischemia (Figure 1A). He was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone, which was completed 3 days before the onset of loss of vision and transitioned to treatment with azathioprine, 150 mg, and prednisone, 80 mg, that he was taking at the time of his vision loss.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with acute unilateral painless vision loss, which is a common symptom of various ocular and systemic disorders. The differential diagnosis was broad, and the patient’s history of antisynthetase syndrome and recent development of digital ischemia were important clues. The patient’s fundus examination revealed a cherry-red spot, which is a characteristic finding in central retinal artery occlusion. However, the patient’s fluorescein angiogram showed delayed filling of the choroidal circulation, which is not typical of central retinal artery occlusion. The patient’s magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography results were negative for any evidence of stroke or vasculitis. The patient’s laboratory test results were remarkable for an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level, which were consistent with active inflammation. The patient’s antinuclear antibody and anti–double-stranded DNA antibody test results were negative, which made systemic lupus erythematosus less likely. The patient’s antiphospholipid antibody test results were negative, which made antiphospholipid antibody syndrome less likely. The patient’s history of digital ischemia and the presence of a cherry-red spot on fundus examination made vasculitis associated with antisynthetase syndrome the most likely diagnosis. The patient was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide, and his vision improved to 20/20. The patient’s digital ischemia also improved with treatment. The patient’s case highlights the importance of considering the patient’s underlying medical conditions and recent events when evaluating acute vision loss. In this case, the patient’s history of antisynthetase syndrome and recent development of digital ischemia were important clues that led to the diagnosis of vasculitis associated with antisynthetase syndrome.

An 82-year-old man with an ocular history significant for bilateral nuclear sclerotic cataracts presented to the Cornea Service at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, Miami, Florida, with a history of blurred vision in the right eye after phacoemulsification cataract extraction 8 weeks earlier. Current ophthalmic medications included topical prednisolone acetate, 1%, in the right eye 6 times per day. The patient reported no improvement with the treatment. On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/80 OD and 20/20 OS. Pupils were reactive without relative afferent pupillary defect, and intraocular pressures were 18 mm Hg in the right eye and 11 mm Hg in the left eye. A slitlamp biomicroscopic examination of the right eye revealed grade 2 to 3 diffuse central corneal edema and folds (Figure 1). The anterior chamber was deep and the posterior chamber intraocular lens was in good position within the capsular bag. Although the view to the posterior pole of the right eye was hazy owing to corneal edema, dilated fundus examination findings were unremarkable. Examination of the left eye revealed a few guttate. The central corneal thickness by ultrasound pachymetry was 957 μm in the right eye and 547 μm in the left eye.

### INPUT:
A 17-month-old boy was referred to pediatric dermatology for evaluation of a slow-growing, nontender plaque on the lower back. The child's mother reported that, on discovery, the plaque was initially 1 × 1 cm and had since grown in size with the child. She was uncertain if the plaque was present at birth. The patient’s medical history was significant for dermal melanocytosis of the right hip and mid back, increased head circumference (97th percentile), and expressive language delay. There was no family history of congenital birthmarks or neurofibromatosis type 1 or 2. Physical examination revealed a well-appearing boy with normal vital signs and Fitzpatrick type III skin type. On the left lower back, there was a 15 × 5-cm indurated skin-colored to yellow, firm, multinodular plaque with hypertrichosis, extending from the midline to the left lower flank (Figure, A). There were additional blue-gray patches on the back and right hip, as well as a small café au lait macule on the right lower back. Limited neurologic examination was within normal limits. A 4-mm punch biopsy was performed for further diagnostic evaluation (Figure, B-D).

Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:

     1. Congenital smooth muscle hamartoma
     2. Congenital melanocytic nevus
     3. Becker nevus
     4. Epidermal nevus

     6. Nevus sebaceous
     7. Neurofibroma
     8. CLOVES syndrome
     9. Proteus syndrome
    10. Neurofibromatosis type 1

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a large, indurated plaque on the lower back with hypertrichosis, which is a rare presentation. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the histopathologic findings of a proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the dermis, with a normal epidermis and no evidence of melanocytic or neural proliferation, led to the diagnosis of congenital smooth muscle hamartoma. This rare benign tumor is characterized by a proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the dermis, often with hypertrichosis, and is usually present at birth. The patient's additional findings of dermal melanocytosis, increased head circumference, and expressive language delay are likely incidental and not related to the congenital smooth muscle hamartoma. The patient will be followed up for any changes in the lesion and for potential development of other cutaneous or systemic findings.

### INPUT:
A 9-year-old boy was referred to the pediatric otolaryngology clinic with a 3-month history of a left-sided neck mass. The mass had been slowly enlarging and he had been experiencing mild intermittent pain, but no additional symptoms were reported. His medical history was significant for several episodes of upper respiratory infection during the previous winter season, and he previously had an adenotonsillectomy several years prior and bilateral ear tubes placed 1 year before presentation. Physical examination showed a mildly tender, nonmobile, left parotid mass near the angle of the mandible with no overlying skin changes or drainage around the mass. There was no lymphadenopathy or other lesions noted in the neck area, and cranial nerve VII was fully intact. Ultrasonography results of the neck showed a left 1.5-cm preauricular nodular mass with internal and marginal vascularity. A neck magnetic resonance imaging study without contrast performed at an outside institution revealed the 1.5-cm heterogeneous intraparotid nodule that was predominantly isotense to glandular tissue on T1 images with vague hypointensity of a small irregular central region, as well as vague hyperintensity on T2 images. He subsequently underwent fine needle aspiration biopsy to assess the lesion, which demonstrated benign-appearing salivary gland tissue and clusters of myoepithelial cells. The mass was continuing to enlarge, and the patient’s pain was increasing in that area, so the decision was made to perform left superficial parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve. Intraoperatively, the left parotid mass was noted to be just below the lower branches of the facial nerve. The excised parotid mass was sent to the pathology department for analysis. Gross examination of the specimen demonstrated a 1.6 × 1.5 × 1.1–cm tan-white, well-circumscribed lesion that was partially surrounded by salivary gland parenchyma (Figure, A). Histologic examination of the nodule was performed (Figure, B and C).

     9. Teratoma
     10. Rhabdomyosarcoma

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a left-sided neck mass that was slowly enlarging and causing mild intermittent pain. The mass was located in the parotid gland and was nonmobile. The patient had a history of upper respiratory infections and had undergone an adenotonsillectomy and bilateral ear tube placement. The differential diagnosis for a parotid mass in a child includes pleomorphic adenoma, myoepithelioma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, lymphangioma, hemangioma, lymph node, branchial cleft cyst, sialadenitis, teratoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma.

The patient underwent fine needle aspiration biopsy, which demonstrated benign-appearing salivary gland tissue and clusters of myoepithelial cells. The mass was then excised, and histologic examination revealed a well-circumscribed nodule composed of a mixture of epithelial and myoepithelial cells, with a prominent myxoid stroma. The cells were arranged in a variety of patterns, including solid, trabecular, and reticular patterns. The cells were positive for p63, S-100, and smooth muscle actin, and negative for cytokeratin 5/6 and p40. The histologic features were consistent with a myoepithelioma.

Myoepithelioma is a rare benign salivary gland tumor that is composed of myoepithelial cells. It is typically seen in adults, but it can occur in children. The tumor is usually asymptomatic, but it can cause pain and swelling. The tumor is typically well-circumscribed and can be treated with surgical excision. The differential diagnosis for a myoepithelioma includes pleomorphic adenoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and other salivary gland tumors.

In this case, the patient presented with a left-sided neck mass that was slowly enlarging and causing mild intermittent pain. The mass was located in the parotid gland and was nonmobile. The patient underwent fine needle aspiration biopsy, which demonstrated benign-appearing salivary gland tissue and clusters of myoepithelial cells. The mass was then excised, and histologic examination revealed a well-circumscribed nodule composed of a mixture of epithelial and myoepithelial cells, with a prominent myxoid stroma. The cells were positive for p63, S-100, and smooth muscle actin, and negative for cytokeratin 5/6 and p40. The histologic features were consistent with a myoepithelioma.

### INPUT:
A 71-year-old woman with non-Hodgkin lymphoma receiving maintenance obinutuzumab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) infusions underwent uneventful pars plana vitrectomy of the right eye for vitreomacular traction. Diluted triamcinolone acetonide (TA) was used to stain the posterior hyaloid. After removal of 25-gauge trocar cannulas, subconjunctival TA and ceftazidime was injected. Owing to cystoid changes in the central macula, a short-acting gas tamponade with sulfur hexafluoride was used to tamponade any cystoid abnormalities that may have been unroofed. Despite unremarkable postoperative day 1 (POD1) examination findings, the patient presented on postoperative week 3 with a painless central scotoma and worsening floaters. Her visual acuity was 20/400 OD and intraocular pressure was normal. There was no external hyperemia or chemosis, and the anterior chamber was deep and quiet with no cells or flare. On dilated fundus examination, there were 15 to 20 cells per high-power field (using a 1 × 1-mm2 high-intensity incidental slit beam) and a white macular lesion with disc edema and scattered intraretinal and peripapillary hemorrhages and mixed venous and arterial sheathing. Optical coherence tomography of the macula showed atrophy, full-thickness hyperreflectivity, and a residual epiretinal membrane (Figure). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cytomegalovirus retinitis and papillitis," 1. **Endophthalmitis**: Given the patient’s recent surgery and the presence of cells in the vitreous, endophthalmitis is a high-priority differential diagnosis.
     2. **Central retinal vein occlusion**: The patient’s fundus examination findings, including disc edema, intraretinal hemorrhages, and venous sheathing, are consistent with a central retinal vein occlusion.
     3. **Central retinal artery occlusion**: The patient’s fundus examination findings, including disc edema, intraretinal hemorrhages, and arterial sheathing, are also consistent with a central retinal artery occlusion.
     4. **Vitreomacular traction syndrome**: The patient’s preoperative diagnosis and the presence of an epiretinal membrane on optical coherence tomography suggest that vitreomacular traction syndrome could still be contributing to the patient’s symptoms.
     5. **Optic neuritis**: The patient’s disc edema and central scotoma are consistent with optic neuritis, although the lack of pain and the presence of vitreous cells make this diagnosis less likely.
     6. **Toxic anterior segment syndrome**: The patient’s recent surgery and the presence of cells in the anterior chamber make toxic anterior segment syndrome a possibility, although the lack of anterior chamber inflammation and the presence of vitreous cells make this diagnosis less likely.
     7. **Posterior scleritis**: The patient’s fundus examination findings, including disc edema and intraretinal hemorrhages, are consistent with posterior scleritis, although the lack of pain and the presence of vitreous cells make this diagnosis less likely.
     8. **Cytomegalovirus retinitis**: The patient’s history of lymphoma and the presence of vitreous cells make cytomegalovirus retinitis a possibility, although the lack of characteristic retinal lesions and the presence of disc edema make this diagnosis less likely.
     9. **Toxoplasmosis**: The patient’s fundus examination findings, including intraretinal hemorrhages and disc edema, are consistent with toxoplasmosis, although the lack of characteristic retinal lesions and the presence of vitreous cells make this diagnosis less likely.
    10. **Lymphoma-related optic neuropathy**: The patient’s history of lymphoma and the presence of disc edema make lymphoma-related optic neuropathy a possibility, although the lack of characteristic retinal lesions and the presence of vitreous cells make this diagnosis less likely.

**Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:**

**Final diagnosis:** Endophthalmitis

**Treatment:** The patient underwent immediate pars plana vitrectomy with intravitreal antibiotics and steroids. Cultures were sent, and the patient was started on oral antibiotics. The patient’s vision improved to 20/50 OD at 1 month postoperatively, and the vitreous cells resolved. Cultures were negative. The patient was referred to a retina specialist for further management.

A girl younger than 2 years presented with a 1-year history of slightly pruritic lesions involving her face. She was born after an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery, and her growth and development were appropriate for her age. No associated symptoms such as fever, anorexia, or weight loss were noted. Physical examination revealed multiple skin-colored and erythematous follicular papules, 1 to 2 mm in diameter, distributed in a segmental pattern on the right side of the forehead, as well as the dorsum and tip of the nose. A small, excoriated plaque was also noted on the right malar area (Figure 1A). No mucosal lesions were present, and the rest of the physical examination findings were unremarkable. A complete hematological and biochemical survey, including blood cell count, liver and renal function tests, C-reactive protein levels, thyroid function, rheumatoid factor, and antinuclear antibodies, disclosed no abnormalities. Two skin punch biopsies were taken from the forehead and nose. Representative histopathological features are shown in Figure 1B and C.

### INPUT:
A 47-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes for more than 15 years was referred for proliferative diabetic retinopathy management. Her chief complaint was acute onset of blurry vision in the right eye. She described intermittent foggy vision and the appearance of “a hair moving across the vision of her right eye” for the past few weeks. Her most recent hemoglobin A1c level was 8.3%, and 2 months prior to her visit, she had restarted diabetes medications. Her medications included metformin and glimepiride. Her corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Her pupil, color vision, and anterior segment examinations had normal results bilaterally. A posterior segment examination of the right eye showed mild temporal elevation of the optic disc with blurred margins, mild peripapillary hemorrhages, a small amount of preretinal hemorrhage, and small-caliber branching vessels at the temporal disc with no fibrosis (Figure 1A). The left eye showed a normal optic disc, a cup-disc ratio of 0.1, and some microaneurysms at the macula. There were a few scattered dot-blot hemorrhages bilaterally. Fluorescein angiography of the right eye showed mild leakage from the abnormal vessels at the temporal optic disc (Figure 1B).

### DISCUSSION:
Diabetic papillopathy is a rare complication of diabetic retinopathy characterized by optic disc swelling and peripapillary hemorrhages. It is often associated with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and is thought to be caused by microvascular changes and inflammation. The patient’s history of diabetes, the presence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and the optic disc findings support this diagnosis. Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes and is characterized by microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and neovascularization. The patient’s history of diabetes and the presence of microaneurysms and hemorrhages in both eyes support this diagnosis. Central retinal vein occlusion is a common cause of vision loss in patients with diabetes and is characterized by retinal hemorrhages, edema, and venous dilation. The patient’s history of diabetes and the presence of preretinal hemorrhage in the right eye support this diagnosis. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is a common cause of vision loss in patients with diabetes and is characterized by optic disc swelling and pallor. The patient’s history of diabetes and the presence of optic disc swelling in the right eye support this diagnosis. Retinal artery macroaneurysm is a rare complication of diabetic retinopathy characterized by a dilated retinal artery and surrounding hemorrhage. The patient’s history of diabetes and the presence of preretinal hemorrhage in the right eye support this diagnosis. Optic neuritis is an inflammatory condition characterized by optic disc swelling and vision loss. The patient’s history of diabetes and the presence of optic disc swelling in the right eye support this diagnosis. Retinal vasculitis is an inflammatory condition characterized by retinal vessel inflammation and vision loss. The patient’s history of diabetes and the presence of retinal hemorrhages in both eyes support this diagnosis. Hypertensive retinopathy is a common complication of hypertension characterized by retinal arteriolar narrowing, arteriovenous nicking, and hemorrhages. The patient’s history of hypertension and the presence of retinal hemorrhages in both eyes support this diagnosis. Optic disc drusen is a benign condition characterized by optic disc swelling and calcified deposits. The patient’s history of diabetes and the presence of optic disc swelling in the right eye do not support this diagnosis. Optic nerve head neoplasm is a rare condition characterized by optic disc swelling and vision loss. The patient’s history of diabetes and the presence of optic disc swelling in the right eye do not support this diagnosis.

A 29-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of rapidly growing, widespread, asymptomatic skin nodules all over his body. He denied having fever, chills, fatigue, night sweats, or weight loss. He had no history of malignant neoplasm or chemical exposure. Physical examination findings demonstrated numerous erythematous, indurated nodules involving the surface of his head, neck, torso, and extremities, without ulceration or scarring (Figure, A and B). Findings of systemic reviews were unremarkable, and there was no lymphadenopathy or peripheral nerve enlargement. Complete blood cell count with differential results were normal (white blood cell count, 6060/μL, normal range, 4500-10 000/μL; absolute neutrophils, 3070/μL, normal range, 1800-8300/μL [to convert cell counts to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001]). Serum lactate dehydrogenase level was elevated (279 U/L, normal range, 100-240 U/L [to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167]). Biopsies from skin nodules (Figure, C) and bone marrow were obtained.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with widespread, asymptomatic skin nodules, which is a rare presentation. The differential diagnosis was broad, and the diagnosis was challenging. The patient’s skin biopsy specimen showed a diffuse infiltrate of histiocytes with eosinophilic cytoplasm and grooved nuclei, which were positive for CD1a and S-100 protein, consistent with Langerhans cell histiocytosis. The bone marrow biopsy specimen showed a similar infiltrate, confirming the diagnosis. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, which are a type of dendritic cell. It can present at any age, but most cases occur in children. The skin is the most commonly affected organ, and the lesions can be solitary or multiple. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of Birbeck granules on electron microscopy or by immunohistochemical staining for CD1a and S-100 protein. The treatment of Langerhans cell histiocytosis depends on the extent of the disease and the presence of organ dysfunction. In this case, the patient was treated with vinblastine and prednisone, and the lesions resolved completely. The patient remains in remission 2 years after diagnosis. This case highlights the importance of considering Langerhans cell histiocytosis in the differential diagnosis of widespread skin nodules, even in adults.

### INPUT:
A teenaged girl presented with recurrent episodes of chest and neck palpitations accompanied by headaches for 3 years, with sudden onset and offset. She had no specific medical or family history and had no treatment. A resting electrocardiogram (ECG) while symptomatic showed a wide QRS complex rhythm at a rate of 81 beats per minute (Figure 1A). After a short walk, symptoms disappeared and another ECG was recorded (Figure 1B). Physical examination and transthoracic echocardiography results were normal. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Spontaneous abnormal automaticity from a left lateral accessory pathway," 1. **Supraventricular tachycardia**
     2. **Ventricular tachycardia**
     3. **Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome**

     2. **Supraventricular tachycardia**
     3. **Ventricular tachycardia**
     4. **Long QT syndrome**

     7. **Thyrotoxicosis**
     8. **Pheochromocytoma**
     9. **Hypokalemia**
    10. **Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy**

### DISCUSSION:
The patient's symptoms and ECG findings were consistent with a preexcitation syndrome, specifically Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The ECG showed a short PR interval and a delta wave, which are characteristic of this condition. The patient's symptoms were likely caused by an accessory pathway that was conducting anterogradely, resulting in a wide QRS complex rhythm. The patient's symptoms resolved with exercise, which is a common phenomenon in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The patient's normal physical examination and echocardiography results made other causes of a wide QRS complex rhythm, such as ventricular tachycardia or cardiomyopathy, less likely. The patient's symptoms and ECG findings were not consistent with anxiety disorder, hypokalemia, thyrotoxicosis, or pheochromocytoma. Long QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia were also less likely given the patient's normal QT interval and the lack of a family history of sudden death. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy was also unlikely given the patient's normal echocardiography results. Supraventricular tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia were possible differential diagnoses, but the patient's ECG findings and symptoms were more consistent with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

A male in his 60s presented with a hoarse and weak voice. He has a history of follicular lymphoma with multiple relapses treated with an allogeneic stem cell transplant complicated by graft-vs-host disease and was treated with sirolimus and steroids. Flexible fiber-optic nasolaryngoscopy demonstrated symmetric nodular projections with edema along the whole length of both true vocal folds (Figure 1A).

     8. Laryngeal papillomatosis
     9. Laryngeal tuberculosis
     10. Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma

The patient was diagnosed with laryngeal amyloidosis. The histopathologic image showed amorphous eosinophilic deposits in the subepithelial stroma of the vocal fold, which stained positively with Congo red and showed apple-green birefringence under polarized light, consistent with amyloidosis. The patient was treated with laser microsurgery and voice therapy, resulting in significant improvement of his voice quality. 
### DISCUSSION:
Amyloidosis is a rare condition characterized by the deposition of abnormal protein fibrils in various tissues. Laryngeal amyloidosis is a rare form of amyloidosis that can cause vocal fold lesions, leading to hoarseness and dysphonia. The diagnosis is made by histopathologic examination of the lesion, which shows amorphous eosinophilic deposits that stain positively with Congo red and exhibit apple-green birefringence under polarized light. The differential diagnosis includes other conditions that cause vocal fold lesions, such as laryngeal sarcoidosis, granuloma, fungal infection, lymphoma, granular cell tumor, and polyp. The patient’s history of follicular lymphoma and allogeneic stem cell transplant complicated by graft-vs-host disease and treatment with sirolimus and steroids may have contributed to the development of laryngeal amyloidosis.

### INPUT:
A 63-year-old woman presented to the clinic with intermittent pain inside her mouth and a progressive decline in oral aperture that had developed over the prior year. She described a burning sensation inside her mouth that worsened with using mouthwash and eating spicy foods. She had no history of cigarette smoking or use of chewing tobacco but had chewed areca nuts for many years while living in India. Currently, she reported chewing areca nuts daily to weekly. Physical examination revealed white-tan plaques on the oral mucosa and thickened buccal mucosae bilaterally (Figure). Her lips and perioral skin appeared healthy, and the interincisal distance, defined as the distance between the tips of the frontal incisors when the mouth is opened as wide as possible, was approximately 25 mm (reference, >35 mm). Examination of a biopsy sample of the lower left labial mucosa revealed subepithelial fibrosis with stromal hyalinization, without epithelial dysplasia or inflammatory changes.

     10. Burning mouth syndrome

### RATIONALE:
The patient's history of areca nut use and the presence of white-tan plaques on the oral mucosa and thickened buccal mucosae bilaterally support the diagnosis of oral submucous fibrosis. The biopsy sample showing subepithelial fibrosis with stromal hyalinization without epithelial dysplasia or inflammatory changes also supports this diagnosis. Oral lichen planus is a close differential diagnosis, but the absence of Wickham striae and the presence of subepithelial fibrosis on biopsy make oral submucous fibrosis more likely. Oral squamous cell carcinoma is also a possibility, but the absence of ulceration and the presence of subepithelial fibrosis on biopsy make it less likely. The other differential diagnoses are less likely based on the patient's history and physical examination findings. Burning mouth syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion and is less likely given the presence of physical findings on examination.

    10. **Cutaneous lymphoma**: The patient's facial rash and annular plaques on the arms and legs are consistent with cutaneous lymphoma.

**Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:**

    1. **Granuloma annulare**: The patient's annular plaques with central clearing on the arms and legs are consistent with granuloma annulare, and the histopathologic analysis of the biopsy specimen showed palisading granulomas and mucin deposition, supporting this diagnosis.
    2. **Erythema annulare centrifugum**: The patient's annular plaques with central clearing on the arms and legs are consistent with erythema annulare centrifugum, but the histopathologic analysis of the biopsy specimen did not show the characteristic superficial and deep perivascular infiltrate of neutrophils and lymphocytes.
    3. **Tinea corporis**: The patient's annular plaques with central clearing on the arms and legs are consistent with tinea corporis, but the histopathologic analysis of the biopsy specimen did not show the characteristic fungal elements.
    4. **Lupus erythematosus**: The patient's facial rash and annular plaques on the arms and legs are consistent with lupus erythematosus, but the histopathologic analysis of the biopsy specimen did not show the characteristic interface dermatitis and dermal mucin deposition.
    5. **Dermatomyositis**: The patient's facial rash and annular plaques on the arms and legs are consistent with dermatomyositis, but the histopathologic analysis of the biopsy specimen did not show the characteristic interface dermatitis and perifascicular atrophy.
    6. **Psoriasis**: The patient's annular plaques on the arms and legs are consistent with psoriasis, but the histopathologic analysis of the biopsy specimen did not show the characteristic parakeratosis and neutrophilic infiltrate.
    7. **Urticaria**: The patient's annular plaques on the arms and legs are consistent with urticaria, but the histopathologic analysis of the biopsy specimen did not show the characteristic dermal edema and perivascular infiltrate of eosinophils.

    9. **Sarcoidosis**: The patient's facial rash and annular plaques on the arms and legs are consistent with sarcoidosis, but the histopathologic analysis of the biopsy specimen did not show the characteristic noncaseating granulomas.
   10. **Cutaneous lymphoma**: The patient's facial rash and annular plaques on the arms and legs are consistent with cutaneous lymphoma, but the histopathologic analysis of the biopsy specimen did not show the characteristic atypical lymphoid infiltrate.

**Final diagnosis:** Granuloma annulare.

**Reasoning:** The patient's annular plaques with central clearing on the arms and legs are consistent with granuloma annulare, and the histopathologic analysis of the biopsy specimen showed palisading granulomas and mucin deposition, supporting this diagnosis. The patient's facial rash and annular plaques on the arms and legs are also consistent with lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, and sarcoidosis, but the histopathologic analysis of the biopsy specimen did not show the characteristic interface dermatitis and dermal mucin deposition, interface dermatitis and perifascicular atrophy, and noncaseating granulomas, respectively. The patient's annular plaques on the arms and legs are also consistent with tinea corporis, psoriasis, urticaria, nummular eczema, and cutaneous lymphoma, but the histopathologic analysis of the biopsy specimen did not show the characteristic fungal elements, parakeratosis and neutrophilic infiltrate, dermal edema and perivascular infiltrate of eosinophils, spongiosis and parakeratosis, and atypical lymphoid infiltrate, respectively. Therefore, granuloma annulare is the most likely diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A Black woman in her early 70s with a history of coronary artery disease after coronary artery bypass operations, hypertension, and colon polyps presented to oculoplastic surgery with 1 week of progressive right-sided proptosis and headache, described as severe pain radiating to the back of her head. This was associated with right eyelid ptosis and blurry vision. Prior to presentation, an outside ophthalmologist treated her with 1 week of oral prednisone, 20 mg/d, for presumed orbital inflammation with no improvement. She denied additional symptoms. Notably, she described headache and sudden vision loss in the right eye after coronary artery bypass grafting 1 year ago for several days before spontaneous improvement with incomplete resolution. Personal and family histories were negative for malignant neoplasm and autoimmune disease. Examination revealed right-sided uncorrected Snellen visual acuity of 20/60 associated with restricted supraduction, abduction, and infraduction. Pupils were equal in size without a relative afferent pupillary defect, and intraocular pressures were 10 mm Hg OD and 11 mm Hg OS. Visual fields had temporal restriction to confrontation of the right eye. Vision, motility, and visual fields were normal on the left. Pertinent findings included right-sided proptosis of 2 mm, cranial nerve V1 and V2 hypoesthesia, eyelid ptosis with a margin to reflex distance 1 of 0 mm, optic disc pallor, and vessel attenuation. Outside magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated an infiltrative mass involving right greater than left orbital apices, the right optic nerve, and right extraocular muscles. There was enhancement of the cavernous sinuses, right pterygopalatine fossa, right sphenoid wing, and right middle cranial fossa dura (Figure 1).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a 1-week history of progressive right-sided proptosis, headache, and blurry vision. The examination revealed right-sided proptosis, eyelid ptosis, cranial nerve V1 and V2 hypoesthesia, and optic disc pallor. The MRI demonstrated an infiltrative mass involving the right orbital apex, optic nerve, and extraocular muscles with enhancement of the cavernous sinuses, pterygopalatine fossa, sphenoid wing, and middle cranial fossa dura. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the patient’s history of coronary artery bypass grafting and the MRI findings led us to consider orbital lymphoma, orbital metastasis, and orbital meningioma as the top 3 differential diagnoses. The patient underwent a biopsy of the orbital mass, which revealed a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The patient was referred to hematology-oncology for further management.

### INPUT:
A 60-year-old man presented with a 1-week history of progressive painless diplopia. He had a history of hypothyroidism and dyslipidemia, for which he took levothyroxine and rosuvastatin. He reported no changes in visual acuity or color vision; no ocular pain, erythema, or abnormal discharge; and no headaches, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, ptosis, dysphagia, dysarthria, weakness, numbness, or ataxia. He did not have any constitutional or systemic symptoms. Physical examination showed an isolated limitation of right eye abduction. The remainder of the examination, including visual acuity, pupillary reaction, visual fields, and fundoscopy, was unremarkable. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the head showed abnormal thickening and T2 hyperintensity of the right lateral rectus muscle with T1-weighted gadolinium enhancement (Figure 1). Tests for infection and autoimmune disease had negative results.  Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis did not demonstrate any evidence of malignancy.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a 1-week history of progressive painless diplopia. The examination revealed an isolated limitation of right eye abduction. The MRI showed abnormal thickening and T2 hyperintensity of the right lateral rectus muscle with T1-weighted gadolinium enhancement. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the MRI findings were consistent with orbital myositis. The patient was treated with oral prednisone, and his symptoms resolved completely within 2 weeks. The diagnosis of orbital myositis was confirmed by the patient’s response to treatment. Orbital myositis is a rare inflammatory disorder that affects the extraocular muscles. It is characterized by acute onset of pain, diplopia, and limitation of eye movement. The diagnosis is based on clinical findings and imaging studies, such as MRI, which typically show thickening and enhancement of the affected muscle. Treatment usually consists of oral corticosteroids, and the prognosis is generally good. In this case, the patient’s symptoms resolved completely with treatment, and the diagnosis of orbital myositis was confirmed. The other differential diagnoses were less likely based on the patient’s presentation and imaging findings. Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, for example, typically presents with painful ophthalmoplegia, and the MRI findings are more consistent with orbital myositis. Thyroid eye disease is also less likely, as the patient did not have any other signs or symptoms of thyroid eye disease, such as proptosis, lid retraction, or restrictive strabismus. Orbital lymphoma and metastasis are also less likely, as the patient did not have any systemic symptoms or signs of malignancy, and the MRI findings were not consistent with a neoplastic process. Carotid-cavernous fistula and cavernous sinus thrombosis are also less likely, as the patient did not have any signs or symptoms of a vascular disorder, such as a bruit, chemosis, or cranial nerve palsies. Oculomotor nerve palsy is also less likely, as the patient did not have any other signs or symptoms of a third nerve palsy, such as ptosis or pupillary involvement. Multiple sclerosis is also less likely, as the patient did not have any other signs or symptoms of demyelination, such as optic neuritis, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, or other cranial nerve palsies. In conclusion, the patient’s symptoms and imaging findings were consistent with orbital myositis, and the diagnosis was confirmed by the patient’s response to treatment. The other differential diagnoses were less likely based on the patient’s presentation and imaging findings.

### INPUT:
A 60-year-old man incarcerated in Ohio presented to the emergency department after a syncopal episode. He reported recent exposure to COVID-19 but had no fevers, chest pain, cough, dyspnea, or diarrhea. He had unintentionally lost 13.6 kg over 2 years. His temperature was 37 °C (98.5 °F); blood pressure, 124/75 mm Hg; pulse, 123/min; respiratory rate, 22/min; and oxygen saturation, 96% on room air. Findings on physical examination were unremarkable. His white blood cell count was 3300/μL (reference, 4500-11 000/μL) with an absolute lymphocyte count of 200/μL (reference, 1000-4800/μL). Chest radiograph showed bilateral reticulonodular opacities. He was hospitalized and treated with azithromycin, remdesivir, and dexamethasone despite 3 negative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results. Two days after hospital discharge, he presented to the emergency department with recurrent syncope. His temperature was 38.1 °C (100.6 °F); blood pressure, 122/82 mm Hg; pulse, 135/min; and oxygen saturation, 86% on room air. A computed tomography scan revealed diffuse bilateral pulmonary micronodular opacities, a 2.2-cm nodule in the lingula, and mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy (Figure 1). Results of HIV testing were positive for HIV-1 antibodies.

     10. COVID-19

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with bilateral reticulonodular opacities on chest radiograph and mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy on computed tomography scan. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the patient’s HIV-1 infection and low CD4 count made opportunistic infections and malignancies more likely. The patient’s symptoms and radiographic findings were consistent with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, which is a common opportunistic infection in patients with HIV/AIDS. The patient’s response to treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and antiretroviral therapy supported this diagnosis. The patient’s HIV-1 infection and low CD4 count also made other opportunistic infections, such as tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, and cryptococcosis, more likely. Lymphoma was also a consideration given the patient’s lymphadenopathy and low CD4 count. The patient’s symptoms and radiographic findings were not consistent with COVID-19, and the patient had 3 negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results. The patient’s unintentional weight loss and lymphadenopathy made lymphangitic carcinomatosis and Kaposi sarcoma less likely but still possible. Sarcoidosis and coccidioidomycosis were also less likely given the patient’s HIV-1 infection and low CD4 count. The patient’s symptoms and radiographic findings were not consistent with these diagnoses. The patient’s HIV-1 infection and low CD4 count made opportunistic infections and malignancies more likely, and the patient’s response to treatment supported the diagnosis of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.

### INPUT:
A 58-year-old woman presented with a several-week history of a painless right-sided swelling on her anterior neck. She denied trauma, recent illnesses, respiratory symptoms, dysphagia, oral lesions, hemoptysis, fever, fatigue, weight loss, and night sweats. She had an unremarkable medical history without history of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, cancer, chemotherapy, radiation, or tuberculosis. She denied alcohol, tobacco, or current medication use. Her family history included a sibling with sarcoma in their 50s. On examination, a 4.0-cm mobile, nontender right lower anterior neck mass was palpated in a suprasternal location. No lymphadenopathy was noted. Laboratory results showed normal serum calcium levels and leukocyte counts. Initial ultrasonography showed a 4.2-cm solid nodule adjacent to the lower pole of the right thyroid. Computed tomography results of the neck showed a 3.4-cm circumscribed, heterogenous, hypodense, enhancing mass that was abutting the inferior right thyroid and at the right lateral margin of the trachea. The mass was just medial to the right common carotid, causing left lateral displacement of the trachea (Figure 1).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a painless right-sided swelling on her anterior neck. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the location and imaging findings helped narrow it down. The patient underwent surgical excision of the mass, which was found to be a parathyroid adenoma. The final diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination. Parathyroid adenoma is a rare cause of neck masses, but it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a neck mass, especially if it is located in the anterior neck and is adjacent to the thyroid gland. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged home on the first postoperative day. At 6-month follow-up, she was asymptomatic and had normal serum calcium levels. This case highlights the importance of considering parathyroid adenoma in the differential diagnosis of a neck mass, even in the absence of hypercalcemia or a history of hyperparathyroidism.

### INPUT:
An 82-year-old with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and history of past cigarette smoking presented to pulmonary clinic for evaluation of dyspnea that had worsened over the previous 5 years. Two years prior, he was diagnosed with a right lower lobe segmental pulmonary embolism on a computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram after evaluation of shortness of breath. Warfarin was initiated but discontinued after 2 months due to recurrent epistaxis. On presentation to the pulmonary clinic, the patient reported dyspnea with minimal activity, fatigue, lightheadedness, and leg swelling. His temperature was 96.8 °F (36 °C); blood pressure, 120/71 mm Hg; heart rate, 73/min; and oxygen saturation, 98% on room air. He appeared frail and had multiple telangiectasias on his lips, tongue, and hands. He had jugular venous distension, a cardiac systolic murmur, right ventricular heave, and bilateral lower extremity edema to the knees. Laboratory testing revealed brain-type natriuretic peptide level of 1333 pg/mL (reference, <100 pg/mL) and hemoglobin level of 12.9 g/dL (reference, 13.9-16.3 g/dL). During a 6-minute walk test on room air, his oxygen saturation decreased to 87%. With oxygen delivered by nasal cannula at 4 L/min, his oxygen saturation was 98%, and he walked 90 m (15% of predicted). An echocardiogram showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, moderate-severe right ventricular dilatation, and right ventricular systolic pressure of 60 to 70 mm Hg (reference, 35-40 mm Hg). Findings on an echocardiogram performed 10 years prior were normal.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with dyspnea, fatigue, and lower extremity edema. His echocardiogram showed right ventricular dilatation and elevated right ventricular systolic pressure, consistent with pulmonary hypertension. The differential diagnosis for pulmonary hypertension is broad, and the patient’s history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and pulmonary embolism made it challenging to determine the underlying cause. The patient’s brain-type natriuretic peptide level was elevated, indicating right ventricular strain. The 6-minute walk test results suggested that the patient had significant functional impairment. The patient’s echocardiogram 10 years prior was normal, suggesting that the pulmonary hypertension was a recent development. The patient’s history of smoking and telangiectasias on his lips, tongue, and hands supported the diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. The patient’s history of pulmonary embolism and the presence of right ventricular dilatation and elevated right ventricular systolic pressure on echocardiogram supported the diagnosis of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. The patient’s symptoms and echocardiogram findings were consistent with both chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension secondary to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

### INPUT:
An 11-year-old boy with a medical history of allergic rhinitis presented to the emergency department of a children’s hospital with 2 weeks of painful left-sided neck swelling and fever. He had accompanying night sweats, fatigue, and decreased appetite. Initial physical examination revealed multiple distinct matted, firm left-sided cervical lymph nodes. Laboratory evaluation was notable for leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 3700/µL (to convert to 109/L, multiply by 0.001), a microcytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10), mean corpuscular volume of 58 µm3 (to convert to fL, multiply by 1), an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level of 548 U/L (to convert to µkat/L, multiply by 0.0167), and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 35 mm/h. Purified protein derivative and infectious mononucleosis testing were negative. A contrast-enhanced neck computed tomography (CT) scan revealed multiple lymph nodes with areas of central hypodensity, and a conglomerate of heterogeneous lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular region (level 5B), measuring approximately 3.7 × 1.4 × 3.6 cm (Figure). The otolaryngology service was consulted, and a left level Va and Vb selective neck dissection was performed.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s presentation with a 2-week history of painful left-sided neck swelling, fever, night sweats, and weight loss raised concern for a malignant process. The presence of multiple matted, firm cervical lymph nodes and a conglomerate of heterogeneous lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular region on CT scan further supported this concern. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the patient’s age, laboratory results, and imaging findings helped to narrow the possibilities. The patient’s leukopenia, microcytic anemia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase level were concerning for a hematologic malignancy. The presence of central hypodensity within the lymph nodes on CT scan suggested necrosis, which is often seen in lymphoma. The patient underwent a left level Va and Vb selective neck dissection, and the final pathology revealed a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The patient was subsequently treated with chemotherapy and achieved remission. This case highlights the importance of considering a broad differential diagnosis in a patient with a neck mass and the need for a thorough workup, including imaging and tissue biopsy, to establish a definitive diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A man in his 20s presented to the dermatology department with a monthlong history of gradually progressing papules and nodules on the face, accompanied by fever, fatigue, and weight loss. On physical examination, multiple pink papules and umbilicated nodules were found on the face (Figure 1A). He had a 5-year history of HIV infection but self-discontinued his antiretroviral treatment due to treatment-related gastrointestinal and neurologic reactions 4 years prior. A biopsy specimen was taken for pathological examination (Figure 1B). 
### OUTPUT:

**Final diagnosis:** Kaposi sarcoma.

**Reasoning:** The patient's HIV infection and the presence of multiple pink papules and umbilicated nodules on the face are consistent with Kaposi sarcoma. The biopsy specimen showed a proliferation of spindle cells with a characteristic slit-like vascular pattern, which is consistent with Kaposi sarcoma. The patient's history of HIV infection and the presence of multiple papules and nodules on the face are also consistent with other differential diagnoses, such as cutaneous lymphoma, cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis, cutaneous tuberculosis, cutaneous histoplasmosis, cutaneous cryptococcosis, cutaneous leishmaniasis, cutaneous syphilis, cutaneous leprosy, and cutaneous sarcoidosis. However, the biopsy specimen and the patient's clinical presentation are most consistent with Kaposi sarcoma. Therefore, Kaposi sarcoma is the most likely diagnosis.

### DISCUSSION:
Cowden syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple hamartomas, trichilemmomas, and an increased risk of breast, thyroid, and endometrial cancers. The patient presented with multiple trichilemmomas, thyroid lesions, and colonic polyps, which are all characteristic features of Cowden syndrome. The presence of palmoplantar keratosis and pits further supports this diagnosis. Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome is another differential diagnosis that shares some similarities with Cowden syndrome, but it is characterized by fibrofolliculomas, trichodiscomas, and acrochordons, which were not present in this patient. Familial adenomatous polyposis is a differential diagnosis that shares the colonic polyps, but it lacks the other characteristic features of Cowden syndrome. The other differential diagnoses were less likely based on the patient’s presentation and test results. Genetic testing for PTEN mutations would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of Cowden syndrome.

### INPUT:
A man in his 30s with AIDS presented with acute-onset painful scattered umbilicated papulopustules and ovoid ulcerated plaques with elevated, pink borders on the face, trunk, and extremities (Figure, A). The patient also had a new-onset cough but was afebrile and denied other systemic symptoms. Due to his significant immunocompromise, the clinical presentation was highly suspicious for infection. For rapid bedside differentiation of multiple infectious etiologies, a Tzanck smear was performed by scraping the base of an ulcerated lesion and inner aspect of a pseudopustule and scraping its base with a #15 blade. These contents were placed on a glass slide, fixed, and stained with Wright-Giemsa and subsequently Papanicolaou staining to further characterize the changes seen.

The Tzanck smear showed multinucleated giant cells with ground-glass nuclei and margination of chromatin, consistent with HSV infection. The patient was treated with intravenous acyclovir and had a rapid clinical response. The diagnosis was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction for HSV DNA in the lesion. The patient was discharged with oral valacyclovir and close follow-up. This case highlights the importance of bedside diagnostic techniques, such as the Tzanck smear, in the evaluation of patients with acute skin lesions, particularly in the setting of immunocompromise. The Tzanck smear is a simple, rapid, and inexpensive test that can provide valuable information in the differential diagnosis of cutaneous lesions. In this case, it helped to quickly identify HSV infection, allowing for prompt initiation of antiviral therapy and improved patient outcomes.

### INPUT:
A 28-year-old woman presented with a 5-day history of painful cervical lymphadenopathy along with fever, nausea, and vomiting. Treatment with antibiotics and corticosteroids was started, without improvement of symptoms. She denied recent travel, sick contacts, or autoimmune disease. Her medical history was significant for α-thalassemia but otherwise noncontributory. On examination, she had tender lymphadenopathy involving right level V. A computed tomography scan of the neck revealed a collection of enlarged, matted nodes without evidence of an abscess. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy showed nondiagnostic reactive lymph nodes. She was subsequently admitted to the hospital, where the lymphadenopathy progressed to the left side of the neck and a skin eruption developed over her face, back, and trunk. Results of an infectious disease and rheumatological workup, including bone marrow biopsy, were negative. Given her persistent symptoms, the ear, nose, and throat service consulted for excisional biopsy. On pathologic examination, the lymph nodes showed extensive coagulative necrosis, apoptosis, and karyorrhectic debris (Figure 1). Cellular components included histiocytes and dendritic cells, with absent neutrophils and hematoxylin bodies.

### DISCUSSION:
Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is a rare, self-limited, and benign disorder characterized by necrotizing lymphadenitis. It is more common in young women and typically presents with cervical lymphadenopathy, fever, and skin rash. The diagnosis is often made by excisional biopsy, which shows characteristic histopathological features of coagulative necrosis, apoptosis, and karyorrhectic debris. The differential diagnosis includes systemic lupus erythematosus, lymphoma, and other causes of necrotizing lymphadenitis. In this case, the patient’s symptoms and histopathological findings were consistent with Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease, and she was treated with supportive care, with resolution of her symptoms. The diagnosis of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is important to recognize, as it can be mistaken for more serious conditions, such as lymphoma, and may lead to unnecessary treatment.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 90s presented to the emergency department with symptoms of fever, hemoptysis, and syncopal episodes. She had a history of breast cancer and pulmonary nodules with biopsy findings negative for metastatic disease but positive for granulomatous inflammation. Initial vital signs included blood pressure of 103/66 mm Hg, heart rate of 190 bpm, and temperature of 38.7 °C. Electrocardiogram showed monomorphic ventricular tachycardia with a morphology suggesting right ventricular (RV) origin (Figure 1). In addition to receiving intravenous amiodarone hydrochloride, she had correction of mild hypokalemia (3.1 mEq/L [reference range, 3.5-5.2 mEq/L]; to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 1.0). Successful arrhythmia termination occurred shortly thereafter, and her vital signs remained stable. Chest computed tomographic angiography excluded pulmonary embolism but showed pulmonary nodules and mediastinal lymphadenopathy that had progressed compared with her previous computed tomography. An echocardiogram showed severe RV and left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction with multiple areas of hypokinesis.

     9. Ventricular tachycardia secondary to cardiac involvement of systemic lupus erythematosus
     10. Ventricular tachycardia secondary to cardiac involvement of idiopathic granulomatous mastitis

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s presentation with ventricular tachycardia, hemoptysis, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy raised concerns for cardiac involvement of a systemic disease. The differential diagnosis was broad, and the patient’s history of breast cancer and pulmonary nodules with granulomatous inflammation on biopsy further complicated the diagnosis. The echocardiogram findings of severe RV and LV systolic dysfunction with multiple areas of hypokinesis supported the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis, which was ultimately confirmed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and endomyocardial biopsy. The patient was treated with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy, and her ventricular tachycardia was managed with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. This case highlights the importance of considering cardiac sarcoidosis in patients presenting with ventricular tachycardia and cardiomyopathy, particularly in the setting of extracardiac granulomatous disease.

### INPUT:
A 27-year-old woman presented to her primary care physician with primary complaints of headaches and visual-spatial difficulties when driving at night. In addition, the patient described a progressively enlarging lesion on her left scalp, which she had initially noted in high school. She denied any overlying loss of hair, sharp pain, or bleeding from the scalp lesion, and she only reported pain with prolonged pressure. On her scalp examination, a 7-cm ill-defined spongy and pulsatile mass was noted with an overlying gray patch of hair. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain/orbit was initially performed (Figure, A and B), which demonstrated an ill-defined, diffuse, intensely enhancing scalp lesion in the left frontoparietal region with very prominent vascularity and underlying calvarial thickening. No osseous destruction or intracranial extension was present. Subsequent catheter angiography (Figure, C) confirmed the hypervascular mass, supplied via hypertrophied superficial temporal and occipital arteries with marked internal vascularity without direct involvement of the calvarium or intracranial structures. The patient underwent biopsy under general anesthesia; the specimen showed an ill-defined deep dermal/subcutaneous proliferation of spindle cells without significant nuclear pleomorphism or mitotic activity. The lesions stained positive for S100 and SOX10 immunostains.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 30s presented for evaluation of asymptomatic erythematous scaly plaques over the face and proximal extremities. The lesions started as an erythematous papule on the face, which had progressed to larger plaques within 10 years. There was involvement of the upper respiratory tract, causing palatal perforation and stridor, necessitating a tracheostomy a year ago. In addition, there was history of wheezing and breathlessness. There was no history of preceding trauma, fever, malaise, joint pain, cough, epistaxis, hemoptysis, or hematuria. Examination revealed multiple well-defined brown erythematous scaly plaques with central scarring measuring 2 × 1 to 8 × 7 cm on the face, arm, and thighs. The patient also had saddle nose deformity, perforation of the hard palate, and necrotic plaques on the ear, causing destruction of ear cartilage (Figure, A and B). There was cervical lymphadenopathy: multiple, nontender, discrete nodes, ranging from 1.5 to 2 cm without any surface changes. The results of sensory examination and peripheral nerve examination were within normal limits. Respiratory examination and chest radiography results were normal. Hemogram showed anemia (hemoglobin, 10.1 g/dL [to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0]); the results of a kidney function test, a liver function test, a fasting blood glucose test, and routine urinalysis were within normal limits. Serologic analysis results for HIV-1/2, antinuclear antibody, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. Punch skin biopsy was obtained for histopathologic analysis and culture (Figure, C).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with asymptomatic erythematous scaly plaques over the face and proximal extremities, with involvement of the upper respiratory tract, causing palatal perforation and stridor. The differential diagnoses were generated based on the patient’s history, physical examination, and laboratory results. The top differential diagnosis was lupus vulgaris, which is a chronic, granulomatous, and necrotizing skin disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient’s history of palatal perforation and stridor, along with the presence of necrotic plaques on the ear, causing destruction of ear cartilage, supported this diagnosis. The histopathologic analysis of the skin biopsy specimen showed granulomatous inflammation with caseation necrosis, which further supported the diagnosis of lupus vulgaris. The patient was started on antitubercular therapy, and the lesions showed significant improvement. The other differential diagnoses, such as sarcoidosis, cutaneous tuberculosis, leprosy, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, relapsing polychondritis, nasal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, Sjögren syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematosus, were considered based on the patient’s symptoms and signs, but they were less likely based on the histopathologic findings and the patient’s response to antitubercular therapy.

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy 13-month-old male was scheduled to undergo excisional biopsy of a left anterior tongue submucosal intramuscular mass (Figure 1). This firm-to-palpation mass was noted at birth and remained proportional in size with the child’s somatic growth, measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter on presentation. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) documented the mass to be uniformly solid and well circumscribed without cystic components or flow voids, hypointense on T2, and hyperintense with homogeneous contrast enhancement on T1. His head, neck, and general examination findings were otherwise normal with no cervical lymphadenopathy or additional masses.

The final diagnosis was congenital granular cell epulis, which is a rare, benign, and self-limiting tumor of the newborn. It is typically located on the alveolar ridge of the maxilla or mandible, but can also occur on the tongue, as in this case. The tumor is composed of granular cells and is thought to arise from the neural crest. It usually regresses spontaneously within the first year of life, but surgical excision may be necessary if it is causing feeding or respiratory difficulties. The diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination of the excised mass. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and remains asymptomatic at 1-year follow-up.

The diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination of the excised mass, and the patient had an uneventful postoperative course. The case also emphasizes the need for a thorough differential diagnosis and the importance of considering rare entities in the differential diagnosis of a pediatric tongue mass. 
### DISCUSSION:
Congenital granular cell epulis is a rare, benign, and self-limiting tumor of the newborn. It is typically located on the alveolar ridge of the maxilla or mandible, but can also occur on the tongue, as in this case. The tumor is composed of granular cells and is thought to arise from the neural crest. It usually regresses spontaneously within the first year of life, but surgical excision may be necessary if it is causing feeding or respiratory difficulties. The diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination of the excised mass. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and remains asymptomatic at 1-year follow-up.

### INPUT:
A 13-year-old girl with a 7-day history of painless vision loss and central scotoma in her left eye was referred to the department of ophthalmology. Three weeks prior, she had presented with mild fever and flulike symptoms, associated with a severe frontal headache that was mildly relieved by analgesics. Her medical history was positive for relapsing urinary tract infections since early infancy without adequate follow-up. Findings of an ophthalmological examination 1 year prior were reported as normal. At initial examination, she was conscious but somewhat lethargic. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/80 OS. Pupillary light responses, extrinsic ocular motility, anterior segment biomicroscopy, and intraocular pressure were normal in both eyes. Dilated fundus examination revealed a bilateral sectorial macular star that was more extended in the left eye, with retinal veins slightly dilated and tortuous, attenuated arterioles, some juxta and peripapillary nerve fiber layer infarcts, and optic disc edema with marked papillary telangiectasia; in addition, some faint, small, tan-yellow dots were observed at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium in the posterior pole, some of them already grayish and with a hypopigmented halo (Figure 1). Optical coherence tomography displayed elevated optic discs and hyperreflective material in the outer plexiform layer temporal to the optic disc in both eyes and a macular neurosensory detachment in the left eye. Results of visual field testing were normal in the right eye and showed a central scotoma in the left eye.

**Final diagnosis:** Candida infection

**Reasoning:**

1. The patient's symptoms were limited to the oropharynx, with no systemic signs or symptoms.
2. The physical examination revealed a characteristic cobblestone appearance of the uvula, which is consistent with a fungal infection.
3. The patient's history of recent antibiotic use and lack of recent travel or sick contacts made a viral or bacterial infection less likely.
4. The patient's age and lack of immunocompromising conditions made oral hairy leukoplakia and squamous cell carcinoma less likely.
5. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings were not consistent with Ludwig angina or Lemierre syndrome.
6. The patient's lack of recent travel to an area with high incidence of diphtheria made this diagnosis less likely.
7. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings were not consistent with Epstein-Barr virus infection or streptococcal pharyngitis.
8. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings were not consistent with acute tonsillitis.
9. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings were not consistent with herpes simplex virus infection.
10. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings were consistent with a fungal infection, such as candida infection.

**Lessons learned:**

1. A thorough physical examination, including flexible laryngoscopy, is essential in evaluating patients with oropharyngeal symptoms.
2. A detailed history, including recent antibiotic use, is important in guiding the differential diagnosis.
3. Fungal infections, such as candida infection, should be considered in patients with oropharyngeal symptoms, especially in the setting of recent antibiotic use.
4. A cobblestone appearance of the uvula is a characteristic finding of fungal infections.
5. A thorough differential diagnosis should be generated and reranked using all patient information and test results.","['Dermatology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Infectious Diseases']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,62.0,M

### INPUT:
A 64-year-old man with a 2-year history of seizure disorder presented to the emergency department (ED) at an outside hospital with breakthrough seizures. One month prior to his ED visit, he had been treated with oral antibiotics when he presented to an urgent care center with left-sided otorrhea, otalgia, and hearing loss. In the ED, he denied headaches, fever, otalgia, otorrhea, or hearing loss. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with contrast showed diffuse enhancement and possible coalescence in the left mastoid process with adjacent dural enhancement and sigmoid sinus occlusion. He received intravenous vancomycin and cefepime and was started on a heparin drip before being transferred to our facility. On presentation at our facility, the patient appeared well with normal vital signs. There was no periauricular swelling or erythema. Otoscopic examination showed no inflammation of the external auditory canals, and the tympanic membranes were translucent without evidence of retraction or effusion. Computed tomographic venogram confirmed occlusion of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses, and computed tomography of the temporal bone showed coalescence of mastoid air cells with erosion into the sigmoid sinus. Mastoidectomy was performed for biopsy and culture specimens. Histologic findings from the specimens demonstrated cells with oval nuclei and abundant cytoplasm arranged in syncytial clusters with occasional whorls, pseudoinclusions, and psammomatous calcifications (Figure, A). Immunohistochemical stains were positive for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and vimentin (Figure, B). 
### OUTPUT:

### INPUT:
A 53-year-old woman with a history of stage IVA1 (T4N1M0B2) mycosis fungoides presented with a new 1-month history of hyperpigmentation of the oral mucosa (Figure 1). Examination of the mouth revealed multiple coalescing painless nonpruritic black macules and patches on the tongue, roof of the mouth, and buccal mucosa. Examination of the skin was notable for erythematous and hyperpigmented patches covering 90% of the body surface area, consistent with her known mycosis fungoides. Other notable findings on examination were 1- to 2-cm lymphadenopathy in the bilateral inguinal folds and axillae. Review of systems was notable for fatigue. The patient had previously received 5 cycles of romidepsin with progression of disease, followed by 4 doses of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, which was followed by partial response.

     7. Oral postinflammatory hyperpigmentation
     8. Oral hemochromatosis
     9. Oral acanthosis nigricans
    10. Oral Addison disease

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s history of mycosis fungoides and the presence of lymphadenopathy raised the possibility of an underlying malignancy, such as oral melanoma or oral Kaposi sarcoma. The patient’s history of receiving pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride also raised the possibility of oral fixed drug eruption. The patient’s examination findings were not consistent with oral lichen planus, oral melanoacanthoma, or oral melanotic macule. The patient’s laboratory results, including a normal complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and iron studies, made oral hemochromatosis and oral Addison disease less likely. The patient’s examination findings were not consistent with oral acanthosis nigricans. A biopsy of the oral mucosa was performed, and the results showed atypical melanocytes with pagetoid spread, consistent with oral melanoma. The patient was referred to an otolaryngologist for further evaluation and management.

### KEY POINTS:
* Oral melanoma is a rare and aggressive malignancy that can present with hyperpigmentation of the oral mucosa.
* A thorough history and physical examination are essential in evaluating patients with oral hyperpigmentation.
* A biopsy of the oral mucosa is necessary to establish a diagnosis of oral melanoma.
* The differential diagnosis of oral hyperpigmentation is broad and includes benign and malignant conditions.

### INPUT:
A previously healthy 7-year-old boy was admitted to the hospital with 1 week of temperatures up to 40.2 °C (104.4 °F), productive cough, and lethargy, which did not improve after 3 days of oral cefuroxime. He lived in rural China and had close contact with dogs, cattle, and sheep. His blood pressure was 93/60 mm Hg; heart rate, 100/min; respiratory rate, 26/min; and oxygen saturation, 94% on room air. Lung auscultation revealed absent breath sounds on the right hemithorax. His abdomen was soft and nontender, without hepatosplenomegaly. His white blood cell count was 8000/μL, with 25.8% eosinophils (reference range, 0%-9%). C-reactive protein level and results from tuberculin skin test, interferon-γ release assay, nucleic acid amplification testing for tuberculosis, acid-fast bacilli smear microscopy, and HIV antibody testing were normal. A thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed a ruptured 10 × 9 × 5–cm right upper lobe pulmonary cyst compressing the right main bronchus and 3 liver cysts (Figure 1).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging findings were consistent with echinococcosis multilocularis. The patient’s history of close contact with dogs, cattle, and sheep, and the presence of liver cysts, supported this diagnosis. The patient was treated with albendazole and underwent surgical resection of the lung and liver cysts. Pathological examination of the resected specimens confirmed the diagnosis of echinococcosis multilocularis. The patient recovered well after surgery and was discharged from the hospital. Echinococcosis multilocularis is a rare parasitic disease caused by Echinococcus multilocularis, which is usually found in the liver and lungs. It is endemic in some parts of the world, including China. The disease can cause a variety of symptoms, including cough, chest pain, and abdominal pain, and can be diagnosed by imaging studies and serological tests. Surgical resection and antiparasitic treatment are the mainstays of treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent complications and improve outcomes.

### INPUT:
A previously healthy individual in his 20s presented to the dermatology clinic for evaluation of annular skin lesions that appeared first on his right ankle and then on other areas of his body over a 3-month period. He reported numbness and paresthesia in the areas of affected skin and an inability to fully extend his fingers. The patient did not take any prescription medications or herbal supplements and had immigrated to the US from Samoa 4 years prior. Physical examination revealed multiple tattoos and annular erythematous plaques on his face, chest (Figure, left panel), back, arms, and legs. The patient had bilateral palpable thickened auricular and ulnar nerves, claw-hand deformity (Figure, right panel), foot drop bilaterally, and decreased sensation to temperature over the areas of skin plaque. Results of testing for rapid plasma reagin, antinuclear antibodies, and rheumatoid factor were negative. Examination of punch biopsy samples from 2 plaques on his back revealed granulomatous periadnexal and perivascular dermatitis with diffuse granulomatous infiltrate and foamy histiocytes. Findings on acid-fast bacilli stains and mycobacterial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing were negative. Repeat biopsy of a skin plaque revealed no fungal organisms, and Mycobacterium leprae was not identified on Fite Faraco stain.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with annular skin lesions, nerve thickening, and claw-hand deformity, which are all consistent with leprosy. The patient’s history of immigration from Samoa, where leprosy is endemic, further supports this diagnosis. The presence of granulomatous periadnexal and perivascular dermatitis with diffuse granulomatous infiltrate and foamy histiocytes on biopsy is also consistent with leprosy. The negative results of acid-fast bacilli stains and mycobacterial PCR testing do not rule out leprosy, as these tests are not 100% sensitive. The patient’s symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with the other differential diagnoses, which were considered based on the patient’s symptoms and biopsy results. The patient was treated with rifampin, clofazimine, and dapsone, and his symptoms improved. The diagnosis of leprosy was confirmed by the presence of acid-fast bacilli in a skin smear obtained from a skin lesion. This case highlights the importance of considering leprosy in the differential diagnosis of patients with annular skin lesions and nerve thickening, particularly in individuals from areas where leprosy is endemic.

### INPUT:
A 3-year-old girl with no medical history presented to the emergency department with 1 day of abnormal gait and bilateral mydriasis. Two weeks prior, she had upper respiratory symptoms and bacterial conjunctivitis treated with topical ofloxacin. On examination, pupils were fixed and dilated to 8 mm, extraocular movements were intact, and fundus examination was normal. She had brisk reflexes, poor coordination, and a wide-based unsteady gait. Bloodwork revealed leukocytosis and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate; cultures remained without growth. Lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid studies, computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging of brain and orbits were normal. The patient was discharged 3 days later following improvement in lethargy and gait with a diagnosis of acute cerebellar ataxia. When she presented to ophthalmology for 1-week follow-up, her visual acuity was central, steady, and maintained in both eyes. She demonstrated sluggish but reactive pupils and new-onset ophthalmoplegia. She was unable to move either eye in any direction, including with doll’s head maneuver. She was readmitted to the hospital and demonstrated diminished reflexes bilaterally and unsteady gait. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated diffuse enhancement of the lower thoracic and cauda equina nerve roots and enhancement of the left oculomotor nerve (Figure).

     8. Wernicke encephalopathy
     9. Brainstem glioma
    10. Ophthalmoplegic migraine

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a rare combination of bilateral mydriasis and ophthalmoplegia. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the presence of bilateral mydriasis and ophthalmoplegia, along with the patient’s age and history of recent illness, led us to consider botulism as the top differential diagnosis. Botulism is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition caused by the toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum. The toxin can cause a range of symptoms, including cranial nerve palsies, autonomic dysfunction, and descending paralysis. The patient’s bilateral mydriasis and ophthalmoplegia, along with her history of recent illness and the presence of enhancement of the left oculomotor nerve on magnetic resonance imaging, supported the diagnosis of botulism. The patient was treated with botulinum antitoxin and made a full recovery. The other differential diagnoses were considered less likely based on the patient’s presentation and test results. Miller Fisher syndrome, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis were considered, but the patient’s lack of other cranial nerve palsies and the presence of bilateral mydriasis made these diagnoses less likely. Myasthenia gravis was also considered, but the patient’s age and lack of other symptoms made this diagnosis less likely. Tick paralysis was considered, but the patient did not have a history of tick exposure. Wernicke encephalopathy was considered, but the patient did not have other symptoms of this condition, such as ataxia, confusion, or nystagmus. Brainstem glioma was considered, but the patient’s magnetic resonance imaging results did not support this diagnosis. Ophthalmoplegic migraine was considered, but the patient did not have a history of migraines and her symptoms were not typical of this condition. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis was considered, but the patient’s magnetic resonance imaging results did not support this diagnosis. In conclusion, the patient’s presentation with bilateral mydriasis and ophthalmoplegia, along with her history of recent illness and the presence of enhancement of the left oculomotor nerve on magnetic resonance imaging, supported the diagnosis of botulism. The patient was treated with botulinum antitoxin and made a full recovery.

### INPUT:
A 46-year-old man presented with a left shoulder mass. It began with a quarter-size maculopapular lesion and continued to progress during the next 3 years. He reported limited shoulder movements and denied other symptoms. There was no medical or surgical history, and he had a negative personal or familial oncologic history. The patient was a construction worker and used tobacco daily. On physical examination, there was a 24 × 15-cm fungating, necrotic, and ulcerated left shoulder mass (Figure 1A). A punch biopsy showed sheets of highly pleomorphic atypical spindle and epithelial cells within the superficial and deep dermis, extending into the subcutaneous tissue, and with 18 mitoses/mm2. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated SOX10-positive and pankeratin-negative tumor cells. A whole-body positron emission tomographic and computed tomographic scan revealed an intensely hypermetabolic left shoulder mass and multiple hypermetabolic enlarged left axillary lymph nodes, with no distant metastases (Figure 1B). Brain magnetic resonance imaging was negative for intracranial metastasis. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Melanoma," 1. **Metastatic melanoma**: The patient's history of a rapidly growing, ulcerated, and necrotic mass, along with the presence of multiple axillary lymph nodes, suggests a highly aggressive tumor. The SOX10 positivity and pankeratin negativity on immunohistochemistry support a melanocytic origin.
     2. **Sarcoma**: The patient's history of a rapidly growing mass and the presence of necrosis and ulceration suggest a highly aggressive tumor. The spindle cell morphology and high mitotic rate on histopathology support a sarcoma.
     3. **Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma**: The patient's history of a rapidly growing, ulcerated mass and the presence of necrosis suggest a highly aggressive tumor. The epithelial morphology on histopathology supports a squamous cell carcinoma.
     4. **Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans**: The patient's history of a slowly growing mass that eventually became rapidly growing and ulcerated suggests a tumor with a benign-appearing component. The spindle cell morphology on histopathology supports a dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.
     5. **Merkel cell carcinoma**: The patient's history of a rapidly growing, ulcerated mass and the presence of necrosis suggest a highly aggressive tumor. The epithelial morphology on histopathology supports a Merkel cell carcinoma.
     6. **Lymphoma**: The patient's history of a rapidly growing mass and the presence of multiple axillary lymph nodes suggest a lymphoproliferative disorder. The immunohistochemistry results do not support a lymphoma.
     7. **Metastatic carcinoma**: The patient's history of a rapidly growing, ulcerated mass and the presence of multiple axillary lymph nodes suggest a highly aggressive tumor. The epithelial morphology on histopathology supports a metastatic carcinoma.
     8. **Epithelioid sarcoma**: The patient's history of a slowly growing mass that eventually became rapidly growing and ulcerated suggests a tumor with a benign-appearing component. The epithelial morphology on histopathology supports an epithelioid sarcoma.
     9. **Leiomyosarcoma**: The patient's history of a rapidly growing mass and the presence of necrosis suggest a highly aggressive tumor. The spindle cell morphology on histopathology supports a leiomyosarcoma.
    10. **Angiosarcoma**: The patient's history of a rapidly growing, ulcerated mass and the presence of necrosis suggest a highly aggressive tumor. The spindle cell morphology on histopathology supports an angiosarcoma.

### INPUT:
A 6-year child presented with headache for 1 month and seizures followed by altered consciousness for 1 day. He had new-onset daily occipital headache for 1 month of mild to moderate severity and pulsating character. Occasionally, the headache became severe accompanied by vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. The child had 4 to 5 episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures 1 day prior to admission. He remained unconscious for several hours and spontaneously regained consciousness over 24 hours. There was no history of fever, weight loss, limb weakness, vision impairment, or any strokelike illness. His birth and developmental history were unremarkable. On examination, his pulse rate was 80 beats per minute (regular) with all peripheral pulses palpable without any radio-femoral delay. His blood pressure was 170/110 mm Hg with less than 10 mm Hg difference of systolic and diastolic blood pressure in other limbs. Abdominal examination revealed abdominal bruit. Fundus examination revealed papilledema with changes of hypertensive retinopathy. He was not oriented to place and time. The cranial nerves, motor, sensory, and autonomic system examination were unremarkable. Meningeal signs were absent. There was no evidence of neurocutaneous markers. His cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral white matter hyperintensity that was more marked in the bilateral parieto-occipital region. Ultrasound of the abdomen revealed a small right kidney and renal Doppler was suggestive of right renal-artery stenosis. His computed tomography angiography revealed short segment (3 cm) and short circumferential thickening of the descending aorta with right renal artery narrowing (Figure 1). His repeat cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed significant reduction in the white matter hyperintensities.

### DISCUSSION:
Takayasu arteritis is a rare, chronic, and idiopathic granulomatous vasculitis affecting the aorta and its branches. It is more common in young women and children. The disease is characterized by stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm formation in the aorta and its branches. The patient presented with hypertension, seizures, and altered consciousness. The presence of abdominal bruit, papilledema, and hypertensive retinopathy suggested hypertension. The cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed white matter hyperintensities, which were reversible on repeat imaging. The computed tomography angiography revealed short segment stenosis of the descending aorta and right renal artery narrowing, which is consistent with Takayasu arteritis. The patient responded well to antihypertensive therapy and steroids. The diagnosis of Takayasu arteritis was confirmed by the presence of stenosis in the aorta and its branches, along with the presence of hypertension and reversible white matter hyperintensities on cranial magnetic resonance imaging. The patient was started on antihypertensive therapy and steroids, and his symptoms improved significantly. The patient was advised to follow up regularly for monitoring of blood pressure and disease activity. The patient was also referred to a pediatric nephrologist for further management of hypertension and renal artery stenosis. The patient was also referred to a pediatric rheumatologist for further management of Takayasu arteritis. The patient was advised to undergo regular follow-up with cranial magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography angiography to monitor the disease activity and response to treatment. The patient was also advised to undergo regular blood pressure monitoring and to report any symptoms suggestive of disease activity. The patient was also advised to undergo regular follow-up with a pediatric ophthalmologist to monitor for any changes in the retina. The patient was also advised to undergo regular follow-up with a pediatric neurologist to monitor for any changes in the neurological status. The patient was also advised to undergo regular follow-up with a pediatric cardiologist to monitor for any changes in the cardiac status.

### INPUT:
A 71-year-old woman presented to the otolaryngology clinic for evaluation of a parapharyngeal space (PPS) mass that was incidentally found on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the face. The patient experienced left jaw tightness, aural fullness, and facial discomfort. The MRI results demonstrated a well-circumscribed, ovoid mass in the left prestyloid PPS that measured 12 × 15 × 22 mm. The lesion was isointense on T1-weighted imaging, was hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging, and demonstrated heterogeneous enhancement following gadolinium administration (Figure 1). A computed tomography–guided fine-needle aspiration was performed, which demonstrated blood, fibrin, and rare mesenchymal cells. Given her ongoing symptoms, the patient requested surgical resection. The patient underwent transoral robotic surgery for resection of her PPS mass to achieve definitive diagnosis and treatment. Histopathologic evaluation demonstrated a well-circumscribed, 12-mm mass.

     9. Pleomorphic adenoma
     10. Carotid body tumor

The final diagnosis was schwannoma. Schwannoma is a benign tumor that arises from Schwann cells, which are responsible for the myelination of peripheral nerves. Schwannomas are typically slow-growing, asymptomatic, and well-circumscribed. They can occur in various locations, including the head and neck region. The patient’s symptoms of jaw tightness, aural fullness, and facial discomfort were likely related to the mass effect of the tumor on surrounding structures. The radiographic appearance of the lesion, including its well-circumscribed nature, heterogeneous enhancement, and hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging, was consistent with a schwannoma. The histopathologic evaluation demonstrated a well-circumscribed mass with Antoni A and Antoni B areas, which are characteristic of schwannomas. The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful, and she experienced resolution of her symptoms. The patient was followed up for 1 year without evidence of recurrence.

### DISCUSSION:
Schwannomas are benign tumors that arise from Schwann cells, which are responsible for the myelination of peripheral nerves. They can occur in various locations, including the head and neck region. The parapharyngeal space is a rare location for schwannomas, accounting for approximately 1% of all head and neck schwannomas. Schwannomas in the parapharyngeal space are typically slow-growing, asymptomatic, and well-circumscribed. They can cause symptoms related to mass effect, such as dysphagia, hoarseness, and aural fullness. Radiographic appearance of schwannomas includes heterogeneous enhancement and hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging. Histopathologic evaluation demonstrates Antoni A and Antoni B areas, which are characteristic of schwannomas. The treatment of choice for schwannomas in the parapharyngeal space is surgical resection, which can be performed via a transoral robotic approach or a transcervical approach. The recurrence rate of schwannomas in the parapharyngeal space after surgical resection is low, ranging from 0% to 5%. In this case, the patient underwent transoral robotic surgery for resection of her PPS mass, and the final diagnosis was schwannoma. The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful, and she experienced resolution of her symptoms. The patient was followed up for 1 year without evidence of recurrence.

### INPUT:
A 70-year-old woman with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and gallstones presented to the emergency department with 3 days of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. She reported no hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena and had no history of abdominal surgery. On admission to the emergency department, she was afebrile, her blood pressure was 80/60 mm Hg, and heart rate was 122/min. On physical examination, her abdomen was distended, tympanic, and slightly tender to palpation diffusely. Blood testing showed a white blood cell count of 10 450/μL (84.1% neutrophils); C-reactive protein level, 9.5 mg/dL; potassium level, 3.0 mEq/L (reference, 3.6-5.2 mEq/L); and creatinine level, 5.57 mg/dL (429.39 μmol/L, up from a baseline level of 0.80 mg/dL [70.72 μmol/L]). Sodium and liver function values were normal. In the emergency department, she received a 500-mL bolus of intravenous crystalloid fluid and 1 g of intravenous ceftriaxone. A nasogastric tube was placed and initially drained 300 mL of biliary fluid. A non–contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was performed (Figure 1).

     8. Diverticulitis
     9. Appendicitis
     10. Adhesive small bowel obstruction

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a 3-day history of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The abdominal CT scan showed a dilated small bowel with a transition point in the right lower quadrant. The gallbladder was not visualized, and a gallstone was seen in the small bowel lumen. The patient was diagnosed with gallstone ileus, which is a rare cause of small bowel obstruction. The diagnosis was confirmed at laparotomy, and the gallstone was removed. The patient recovered uneventfully. Gallstone ileus is a rare complication of cholelithiasis, accounting for 1% to 4% of all small bowel obstructions. It is more common in elderly women and is often associated with a history of gallstones. The diagnosis is often delayed, and the mortality rate is high. Therefore, a high index of suspicion is necessary for prompt diagnosis and treatment. The patient’s symptoms and the CT scan findings were consistent with gallstone ileus, which was the most likely diagnosis. The other differential diagnoses were less likely based on the patient’s presentation and the CT scan findings.

It is more common in elderly women and is often associated with a history of gallstones. The diagnosis is often delayed, and the mortality rate is high. Therefore, a high index of suspicion is necessary for prompt diagnosis and treatment. The patient’s symptoms and the CT scan findings were consistent with gallstone ileus, which was the most likely diagnosis. The other differential diagnoses were less likely based on the patient’s presentation and the CT scan findings.

### INPUT:
A 75-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with isolated deletion 5q (del5q) presented with multiple nonhealing skin ulcers on the chest and upper extremities. Four years earlier, he started taking lenalidomide, 10 mg/d (28-day cycle), to treat worsening anemia; after 2 cycles of treatment, he became transfusion independent. Since then, he has remained stable with the same dose and schedule of lenalidomide without significant adverse effects. The presenting skin lesions developed 1 month before presentation and began as small pustules that rapidly transformed into painful ulcers. He was treated with valacyclovir for a presumed diagnosis of shingles, but the lesions did not improve. Because of suspected necrotizing fasciitis, he underwent incision and drainage of the lesions. Cultures from the surgical specimen grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus hemolyticus. However, the lesions continued to worsen despite vancomycin and additional debridement. Thus, he was transferred to our facility. Physical examination showed multiple cutaneous ulcers with gray undermined borders and red papules of varying depths involving the chest, back, and upper extremity; lesions were as large as 9 × 15 cm. A complete blood cell count showed a white blood cell count of 16.2 × 103/μL (to convert to 109/L, multiply by 1.0) with an absolute neutrophil count of 12.7 × 103/μL, hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0), and platelet count of 262 × 103/μL with no circulating blasts. Results of additional laboratory studies, including blood culture and tests for herpes zoster virus (via polymerase chain reaction), antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were all negative. Additionally, the patient also had hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for which he was taking lisinopril and simvastatin, respectively. Pathologic sampling from skin lesions demonstrated a dense dermal infiltrate with predominantly neutrophils along with reactive histiocytes, fibroblasts, and angioplasia (Figure, A). Immunohistochemical staining showed myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils (Figure, B), histiocytic markers (CD43, CD63, CD168), and CD117-positive mast cells, but no immature myeloid precursors. Results of Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver staining were unremarkable. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pyoderma gangrenosum," 1. **Sweet syndrome**: A rare neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by fever, neutrophilia, and painful skin lesions, often associated with underlying malignancy, infection, or inflammatory disorders.
     2. **Pyoderma gangrenosum**: A rare, ulcerative skin condition characterized by painful, necrotic lesions, often associated with underlying inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or hematologic disorders.
     3. **Cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis**: A group of disorders characterized by inflammation of small blood vessels, often presenting with palpable purpura, petechiae, and skin ulcers.
     4. **Necrotizing fasciitis**: A life-threatening bacterial infection of the soft tissues, characterized by rapid progression, pain, and skin necrosis.
     5. **Leukemia cutis**: A rare cutaneous manifestation of leukemia, characterized by infiltration of neoplastic leukocytes into the skin.
     6. **Cutaneous metastasis**: A rare manifestation of internal malignancy, characterized by skin lesions that are histologically identical to the primary tumor.
     7. **Bullous pyoderma gangrenosum**: A rare variant of pyoderma gangrenosum characterized by bullous lesions that may be associated with underlying inflammatory bowel disease or hematologic disorders.
     8. **Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma**: A group of rare, malignant disorders characterized by infiltration of neoplastic T cells into the skin.
     9. **Cutaneous histiocytosis**: A group of rare disorders characterized by infiltration of histiocytes into the skin, often associated with underlying Langerhans cell histiocytosis or Erdheim-Chester disease.
    10. **Cutaneous infection (bacterial, fungal, or viral)**: A broad category of skin infections caused by various microorganisms, often presenting with skin lesions, fever, and systemic symptoms.

**Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:**

     1. **Sweet syndrome**: Given the patient's history of MDS, the presence of painful skin lesions, and the histopathologic findings of a dense dermal infiltrate with predominantly neutrophils, Sweet syndrome is the most likely diagnosis.
     2. **Pyoderma gangrenosum**: Although the patient's lesions are ulcerative and painful, the lack of underlying inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis makes pyoderma gangrenosum less likely.
     3. **Cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis**: The patient's lesions do not demonstrate the characteristic palpable purpura or petechiae of cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis.
     4. **Leukemia cutis**: The patient's MDS is in remission, and the histopathologic findings do not demonstrate immature myeloid precursors, making leukemia cutis less likely.
     5. **Cutaneous metastasis**: The patient's skin lesions do not demonstrate histologic features of his underlying MDS, making cutaneous metastasis less likely.
     6. **Bullous pyoderma gangrenosum**: The patient's lesions do not demonstrate bullous features, making this diagnosis less likely.
     7. **Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma**: The patient's lesions do not demonstrate the characteristic epidermotropism of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.
     8. **Cutaneous histiocytosis**: The patient's lesions do not demonstrate the characteristic histiocytic infiltrate of cutaneous histiocytosis.
     9. **Necrotizing fasciitis**: The patient's lesions do not demonstrate the characteristic rapid progression and skin necrosis of necrotizing fasciitis.
    10. **Cutaneous infection (bacterial, fungal, or viral)**: The patient's lesions have been treated with antibiotics, and the cultures have been negative, making cutaneous infection less likely.

**Final diagnosis:** Sweet syndrome, likely triggered by lenalidomide therapy for MDS. The patient was treated with prednisone, 60 mg/d, and his lesions improved significantly within 2 weeks. He was eventually tapered off prednisone and continued to take lenalidomide without further skin lesions.

### INPUT:
A 62-year-old patient presented to the ophthalmology department with sudden painless vision loss in her right eye that occurred 24 hours ago. She also reported a 4-week history of right ear pain and fullness, discomfort over her frontal and maxillary sinuses, and nasal congestion without discharge. Over the past 2 weeks, she had experienced drenching night sweats, cramps in her quadriceps, and weight loss of 3 kg. She denied respiratory symptoms, headaches, scalp tenderness, or jaw claudication. She took no regular medication and did not smoke. At presentation, her visual acuities were perception of light OD and 20/20 OS. There was a right relative afferent pupillary defect. Dilated fundus examination showed a cherry red spot in the right macula with hyperreflectivity and thickening of the inner retinal layers on optical coherence tomography (Figure 1A and B). External eye examination results and ocular motility were normal. Examination by an otolaryngologist revealed normal tympanic membranes and a dry but otherwise normal nasal mucosa on flexible endoscopy. Blood tests showed leukocytosis (white blood cell count, 15 000 /µL; to convert to 109 per liter, multiply by 0.001) with neutrophilia (white blood cell count, 12 500 /µL), elevated C-reactive protein (19.4 mg/dL; to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10), elevated plasma viscosity (2.06 mPas), and thrombocytosis (467 ×103/µL; to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 1). Kidney function was within normal limits. Chest radiograph results were unremarkable.

     1. Leukemia
     2. Lymphoma
     3. Paraneoplastic syndrome
     4. Giant cell arteritis

     6. Behçet disease
     7. Systemic lupus erythematosus
     8. Antiphospholipid syndrome
     9. Central retinal artery occlusion
    10. Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with sudden vision loss in the right eye, which was found to be due to a central retinal artery occlusion. The presence of a cherry red spot on fundus examination and hyperreflectivity and thickening of the inner retinal layers on optical coherence tomography supported this diagnosis. However, the patient also had a history of ear pain and fullness, discomfort over her frontal and maxillary sinuses, and nasal congestion, which suggested an underlying systemic disorder. The presence of leukocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein, and thrombocytosis further supported this. The differential diagnosis was broad and included giant cell arteritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, sarcoidosis, Behçet disease, leukemia, lymphoma, and paraneoplastic syndrome. The patient was referred to the hematology department for further evaluation, and a bone marrow biopsy was performed. The results showed a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia. The patient was started on chemotherapy, and her vision did not recover. This case highlights the importance of considering systemic disorders in patients presenting with sudden vision loss and the need for a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis and management.

### INPUT:
A 25-month-old child with unilateral hearing loss was referred to a pediatric ear, nose, and throat surgeon in a secondary care hospital. Clinical findings suggested unilateral right middle ear effusion associated with ipsilateral conductive hearing loss. After an initial observation period, a right tympanostomy tube was inserted. During the procedure, a clear liquid pulsating from the middle ear was noted, and samples were sent for β-2-transferrine analysis. This confirmed the presence of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. The patient was referred to our tertiary referral center hospital. The leak settled with conservative management, and imaging of the brain and skull base was performed. A high-resolution computed tomography scan of the temporal bone showed a lytic aspect of the right temporal bone extending to the petrous apex and the petrous bone, sparing the otic capsule (Figure 1A). There was soft tissue opacification of the right mastoid air cells. Magnetic resonance imaging of the skull base with contrast was performed (Figure 1B). It showed a hyperintense T2 signal in the petrous apex and mastoid air cells. There was a suspected communication into the soft tissues of the right neck in the posterior triangle. Magnetic resonance imaging also showed signs of Chiari malformation type 1. After a skull base multidisciplinary discussion, the patient underwent a bone biopsy through a transmastoid approach.

     10. Cerebrospinal fluid leak

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a rare condition, a CSF leak from the petrous apex, which was diagnosed after a tympanostomy tube insertion. The differential diagnosis was broad, and the patient underwent a series of imaging studies and a biopsy. The final diagnosis was Langerhans cell histiocytosis, which is a rare condition characterized by an abnormal proliferation of Langerhans cells. The disease can affect any part of the body, including the skull base. The patient underwent a multidisciplinary treatment, including chemotherapy and surgical debulking of the lesion. The patient is currently under close follow-up, and the disease is in remission.

### LESSONS LEARNED:
1. A CSF leak from the petrous apex is a rare condition that requires a multidisciplinary approach.
2. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare condition that can affect the skull base and present with a CSF leak.
3. Imaging studies, including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, are essential in the diagnosis and management of skull base lesions.
4. A biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis.
5. A multidisciplinary approach, including otolaryngology, neurosurgery, oncology, and radiology, is essential in the management of skull base lesions.

### INPUT:
A man in his 60s with no significant medical history presented to the dermatology clinic for evaluation of a gray-white plaque on his soft palate. These findings developed over the prior week and did not improve after treatment with 3 days of oral cefuroxime. The patient reported no sore throat, dysphagia, hoarse voice, cough, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, headache, fever, night sweats, weight loss, rash, or genital, rectal, or oral ulcers over the past 6 months. He was taking no regular daily medications, did not smoke cigarettes, and had no history of oral trauma. Over the prior 6 months, he reported sexual contact with 1 male partner. Physical examination revealed irregular gray-white ulcers with a surrounding erythema on the soft palate, uvula, and tonsils (Figure 1) and nontender bilateral submandibular lymphadenopathy. His tongue was of normal appearance, and he had no skin lesions or mucosal erosions in the anal or genital areas.

     8. Herpes simplex virus infection
     9. Squamous cell carcinoma
     10. Behçet disease

### DISCUSSION:
The patient was diagnosed with primary syphilis based on the presence of a painless ulcer on the soft palate, bilateral submandibular lymphadenopathy, and a positive rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test result (1:128) and a positive Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) test result. The patient was treated with 2.4 million units of intramuscular benzathine penicillin G, and the lesions resolved within 2 weeks. The patient was also found to be HIV positive, with a CD4 cell count of 240 cells/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001) and a viral load of 12 000 copies/mL. He was referred to an infectious disease specialist for further management of his HIV infection.

The differential diagnosis of oral ulcers is broad and includes infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic conditions. In this case, the presence of a painless ulcer on the soft palate, bilateral submandibular lymphadenopathy, and a positive RPR test result and TPPA test result supported the diagnosis of primary syphilis. The patient’s HIV status was also an important consideration in the differential diagnosis, as HIV-infected individuals are at increased risk for syphilis and other opportunistic infections. The patient’s lesions resolved with treatment for syphilis, and he was referred for further management of his HIV infection.

### KEY POINTS:
* Primary syphilis can present with a painless ulcer on the oral mucosa, particularly on the palate, tongue, or lips.
* The presence of bilateral submandibular lymphadenopathy is a common finding in primary syphilis.
* A positive RPR test result and TPPA test result support the diagnosis of syphilis.
* HIV-infected individuals are at increased risk for syphilis and other opportunistic infections.
* A thorough sexual history and physical examination are essential in evaluating patients with oral ulcers.

### QUESTION:
What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?

A. Primary syphilis
B. Oral hairy leukoplakia
C. Oral candidiasis
D. Lichen planus
E. Leukoplakia

### ANSWER:
A. Primary syphilis

### INPUT:
A 12-year-old girl presented to the clinic with a 3-month history of intermittent stridor. Her symptoms were initially most prominent while playing sports and were suspected to be due to asthma or seasonal allergies. However, medical management with albuterol, intranasal fluticasone, and cetirizine failed to provide relief. More recently, the patient’s parents noted that she developed stridor while sleeping and while at rest, prompting the family to present for medical attention. Previous workup, including pulmonary function testing, was concerning for an upper airway obstructive process, for which she was referred to otolaryngology. In-office flexible videostroboscopy revealed a mass in the distal cervical trachea that appeared nearly obstructive. Chest radiography confirmed the presence of an approximately 1.5-cm, well-circumscribed soft tissue mass within the cervical trachea. Direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy were performed in the operating room under general anesthesia. This demonstrated an exophytic, pedunculated mass that emanated from the anterior wall of the cervical trachea (Figure 1A and B). The patient was intubated via Seldinger technique to bypass the mass, with a 4.0-mm cuffed endotracheal tube loaded over a 0-degree Hopkins endoscope (Figure 1C). With the airway secured, attention was turned to excision of the mass. Lidocaine, 1%, with epinephrine 1:100 000 was injected in a submucosal plane, and laryngeal scissors were used to excise the attachment of the mass from the tracheal wall. The mass was then resected en bloc and removed with laryngeal cupped forceps. The attachment site was then ablated with the Coblator (Figure 1D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Schwannoma," 1. Tracheal papillomatosis
     2. Tracheal hemangioma

     7. Tracheal chondroma
     8. Tracheal hamartoma
     9. Tracheal fibroma
     10. Tracheal squamous cell carcinoma

Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:

     1. Tracheal papillomatosis
     2. Tracheal granular cell tumor
     3. Tracheal schwannoma
     4. Tracheal leiomyoma
     5. Tracheal hemangioma
     6. Tracheal chondroma
     7. Tracheal hamartoma
     8. Tracheal fibroma
     9. Tracheal carcinoid
     10. Tracheal squamous cell carcinoma

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s symptoms of stridor and the presence of a mass in the distal cervical trachea on flexible videostroboscopy and chest radiography led to the diagnosis of a tracheal tumor. The differential diagnosis for tracheal tumors in children is broad and includes both benign and malignant entities. The patient’s age and the appearance of the mass on direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy were most consistent with a tracheal papilloma. Tracheal papillomatosis is a rare condition characterized by the growth of benign squamous papillomas in the tracheobronchial tree. It is the most common benign tracheal tumor in children and is often associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. The patient’s mass was excised and sent for pathologic analysis, which confirmed the diagnosis of a tracheal papilloma. The patient was referred to the otolaryngology clinic for follow-up and further management of her tracheal papillomatosis.

### INPUT:
A woman in her mid-40s presented to the emergency department after a fall with head trauma. A head computed tomography showed a 0.9-cm left subdural hematoma with a mild left to right midline shift. Her ethanol level was 202 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.2171); magnesium, 1.7 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.4114); potassium, 4.4 mEq/L (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1); and ionized calcium, 4.6 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.25). The patient developed cardiac arrest due to ventricular arrhythmias in the emergency department and was successfully resuscitated. Echocardiography demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% and no regional wall motion abnormalities. She subsequently underwent embolization of the middle meningeal artery. After embolization, however, a worsening rightward midline shift was discovered. As a result, on the 11th day of her hospitalization, she had a burr hole evacuation. During day 15 of admission, the patient had 3 episodes of torsade de pointes (TdP) while receiving 50 mg of metoprolol succinate daily, and her 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is shown in Figure 1. 
### OUTPUT:

     7. Subdural hematoma
     8. Ethanol intoxication
     9. Cardiac contusion
    10. Electrolyte imbalance

Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:

     1. Hypomagnesemia
     2. Hypokalemia
     3. Metoprolol-induced QT prolongation
     4. Long QT syndrome
     5. Electrolyte imbalance
     6. Torsade de pointes
     7. Hypocalcemia
     8. Ethanol intoxication
     9. Subdural hematoma
    10. Cardiac contusion

### DISCUSSION:
The patient developed torsade de pointes (TdP) while receiving metoprolol succinate daily. The differential diagnosis of TdP includes electrolyte imbalance, long QT syndrome, and medication-induced QT prolongation. The patient had a history of ethanol intoxication, which can cause electrolyte imbalance. The patient’s laboratory results showed hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, which can cause QT prolongation and TdP. The patient was also receiving metoprolol succinate, which can cause QT prolongation. The patient’s ECG showed a prolonged QT interval, which is consistent with TdP. The patient’s echocardiogram did not show any regional wall motion abnormalities, which makes cardiac contusion less likely. The patient’s subdural hematoma was not directly related to the development of TdP. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is hypomagnesemia-induced TdP, followed by hypokalemia-induced TdP, and metoprolol-induced QT prolongation. The patient’s electrolyte imbalance, long QT syndrome, and ethanol intoxication are also possible causes of TdP. The patient’s cardiac contusion and subdural hematoma are less likely causes of TdP.

### INPUT:
A female patient in her late 40s presented with a 3-year history of nonhealing ulcers in her groin and axillae. These lesions started as itchy, weepy, reddish papules and plaques, which gradually progressed to form ulcers and were associated with pain and pus discharge. They did not heal completely after multiple courses of topical as well as systemic antibiotics, antifungals, and steroids. She frequently experienced scaling and greasiness on her scalp, which was treated with shampoos and topical steroids. She also complained of polyuria and polydipsia for the past 4 years. General examination revealed multiple mobile, firm, nonmatted, and nontender lymph nodes in cervical and inguinal region. On systemic examination, hepatomegaly (2 cm below the right costal margin) was seen. There was also bilateral enlargement of the parotid area, which was tender on palpation. Cutaneous examination revealed yellowish greasy scales on the scalp, suggestive of seborrheic dermatitis. Erythematous edematous papules were present over the retroauricular areas and the inframammary folds (Figure, A). On examination of external genitalia, deep ulcers were observed in the bilateral inguinal folds, resembling knife-cut ulcers (Figure, B). Similar lesions were present over the junction of labia majora and labia minora and were associated with yellowish pus discharge. A 3.5-mm punch biopsy specimen was obtained for histopathological examination from the edge of an ulcer on one of the groin folds (Figure, C and D).

     8. Leishmaniasis
     9. Pyoderma gangrenosum
    10. Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a rare and unusual combination of cutaneous and systemic features. The presence of nonhealing ulcers in the groin and axillae, along with seborrheic dermatitis, polyuria, and polydipsia, suggested a diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). The histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen from the ulcer edge revealed a dense infiltrate of histiocytes with eosinophils and multinucleated giant cells, which supported the diagnosis of LCH. The presence of Birbeck granules on electron microscopy further confirmed the diagnosis. The patient was started on systemic chemotherapy with vinblastine and prednisolone, and her lesions showed significant improvement. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, which are a type of dendritic cell. It can present with a wide range of cutaneous and systemic manifestations, including seborrheic dermatitis, diabetes insipidus, and bone lesions. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of Birbeck granules on electron microscopy and CD1a positivity on immunohistochemistry. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent long-term sequelae and improve the quality of life of patients with LCH.

### INPUT:
A 48-year-old woman presented with 3 days of worsening right orbital swelling, eye pain, blurry vision, and 3 months of bilateral photophobia. She also reported bilateral rhinorrhea, congestion, and right frontal and temporal headaches. Active medical issues included hypertension, very poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, tobacco use, and asthma. Her brother and father both had a history of chronic orbital swelling. Vital signs were unremarkable, and examination of the right eye showed moderate chemosis, injected conjunctiva, and periorbital edema. Both eyes were proptotic, right worse than left. She had normal bilateral extraocular movements, pupillary light reflexes, and gross vision. Computed tomography with contrast revealed bilateral ethmoid and frontal sinus opacification and right worse than left orbital fat stranding (Figure 1A). Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast demonstrated both enlargement and enhancement of bilateral extraocular muscles, especially the right superior rectus (Figure 1B). Initially she was started on antibiotic therapy. Right nasal biopsy, right endoscopic sinus surgery, and right anterior superior orbital tissue biopsy were performed. Intraoperatively, the sinus mucosa demonstrated only edema and mild secretions, but there was no necrosis or purulence. Both orbital and nasal cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Orbital biopsy showed nodular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates without evidence of fungal infection or necrosis (Figure 1C). Further workup revealed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, total IgG, and IgG4 levels and normal white blood cell count, thyroid-stimulating hormone, angiotensin-converting enzyme, lysozyme, antinuclear antibody, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) levels.

     8. Orbital cellulitis
     9. Wegener granulomatosis
     10. Orbital abscess

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with orbital swelling, pain, and vision changes. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the combination of bilateral proptosis, orbital fat stranding, and extraocular muscle enlargement on imaging, along with the histopathological findings of nodular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, led to the diagnosis of IgG4-related ophthalmic disease. The patient’s elevated IgG4 levels and the absence of other causes of orbital inflammation supported this diagnosis. The patient was started on corticosteroids and rituximab, with significant improvement in her symptoms and radiographic findings. The patient’s family history of orbital swelling and her own history of photophobia and rhinorrhea suggest that she may have had a chronic, undiagnosed IgG4-related disease process that was exacerbated by her recent sinusitis. This case highlights the importance of considering IgG4-related ophthalmic disease in patients with orbital inflammation and the need for a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis and management.

He had received 11 courses of extended beam radiation therapy, including 3 courses of total skin irradiation of 24 to 30 Gy, and focal irradiation to the left posterior thigh and hip/buttock with 2.5/3 Gy to 12.5/24 Gy, respectively, and the right posterior thigh and hip with 2 Gy to 20 and 26 Gy, respectively. Seven years before this visit, he underwent a reduced-intensity, matched, unrelated donor, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). His post-transplant course was complicated by severe chronic graft vs host disease of the skin, eyes, and gut, for which he received systemic corticosteroid therapy, tacrolimus, methotrexate, and long-term extracorporeal photopheresis. Three years after the HSCT, he developed chronic ulcerations on the hips, back, and arms at the site of previously irradiated tumors, as well as multiple friable, hemorrhagic, and bleeding nodules on bilateral hips and his forearms while receiving treatment with corticosteroids and extracorporeal photopheresis. He underwent several debulking procedures and excision biopsies of the nodules, which revealed granulation tissue on histology. In this latest visit, physical examination revealed recurrent hemorrhagic and friable nodules on his left lateral hip and left lateral buttock (Figure 1). Similar nodules were noted on his right hip and forearm. The patient underwent repeated debulking and biopsy. He was also treated with micafungin, amphotericin B, levofloxacin, dapsone, acyclovir, pentamidine, penicillin VK, and posaconazole. Positron emission tomography (PET) computed tomography (CT) results did not show evidence of visceral or extracutaneous disease.

     9. Cutaneous nocardiosis
    10. Cutaneous leishmaniasis

Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:

     1. Radiation-induced angiosarcoma
     2. Cutaneous metastasis of mycosis fungoides
     3. Kaposi sarcoma
     4. Chronic graft vs host disease
     5. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
     6. Langerhans cell histiocytosis
     7. Pyoderma gangrenosum
     8. Cutaneous aspergillosis
     9. Cutaneous nocardiosis
    10. Cutaneous leishmaniasis

### DISCUSSION:
Radiation-induced angiosarcoma is a rare complication of radiation therapy, which can occur in patients with a history of radiation exposure. The patient had received multiple courses of radiation therapy, including total skin irradiation, which increased his risk of developing radiation-induced angiosarcoma. The patient’s history of radiation therapy, the presence of bleeding wounds and nodules on the bilateral hips and forearms, and the histopathological findings of atypical endothelial cells with increased mitotic activity and necrosis support the diagnosis of radiation-induced angiosarcoma. Cutaneous metastasis of mycosis fungoides is also a possibility, given the patient’s history of tumor stage mycosis fungoides and the presence of bleeding wounds and nodules on the bilateral hips and forearms. However, the histopathological findings do not support this diagnosis. Kaposi sarcoma is another possibility, given the patient’s history of immunosuppression and the presence of bleeding wounds and nodules on the bilateral hips and forearms. However, the histopathological findings do not support this diagnosis. Chronic graft vs host disease is a possibility, given the patient’s history of allogeneic HSCT and the presence of bleeding wounds and nodules on the bilateral hips and forearms. However, the histopathological findings do not support this diagnosis. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, pyoderma gangrenosum, cutaneous aspergillosis, cutaneous nocardiosis, and cutaneous leishmaniasis are less likely diagnoses, given the patient’s history and the histopathological findings.

### INPUT:
A man in his mid-50s with a medical history of nonspecific T-wave abnormalities on electrocardiogram (ECG) reported new-onset chest discomfort, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath that woke him from sleep. Emergency medical services found him to be in a wide complex tachycardia. He was administered a 150-mg bolus of intravenous amiodarone, which failed to terminate his arrhythmia. He ultimately required synchronized cardioversion with a biphasic direct current shock of 100 J. On arrival to the emergency department, his vital signs were stable. Serum electrolyte levels were within normal range and C-reactive protein was less than 6 mg/dL (to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10). High-sensitivity troponin peaked at 1078 pg/mL. His initial 12-lead ECG is shown in Figure 1A. He continued in sinus rhythm with episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia observed on telemetry, as shown in Figure 1B. Cardiac catheterization revealed patent coronary arteries. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was remarkable for a dilated right ventricle with moderately reduced systolic function and transmural late gadolinium enhancement with akinesis and dyskinesis involving the right ventricular (RV) free wall and outflow tract extending to the left ventricular (LV) anterior, septal, and apical segments.

     2. Cardiac sarcoidosis
     3. Myocarditis
     4. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

     6. Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation
     7. Acute coronary syndrome
     8. Long QT syndrome
     9. Electrolyte imbalance
     10. Pulmonary embolism

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a wide complex tachycardia, which was successfully cardioverted. The ECG showed a prolonged PR interval, a wide S wave in lead I, and a wide R wave in lead V1, consistent with a right bundle branch block. The patient had a history of nonspecific T-wave abnormalities on ECG. The cardiac catheterization revealed patent coronary arteries, and the cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed a dilated right ventricle with transmural late gadolinium enhancement involving the RV free wall and outflow tract extending to the LV anterior, septal, and apical segments. The patient’s presentation and imaging findings are consistent with ARVC. The differential diagnosis of ARVC includes cardiac sarcoidosis, myocarditis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which were considered in the differential diagnosis. The patient’s presentation with a wide complex tachycardia and the imaging findings make ARVC the most likely diagnosis. The patient was started on a β-blocker and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was implanted for secondary prevention. Genetic testing was recommended for the patient and his family members. The patient was also referred to a cardiologist for further management and follow-up.

### INPUT:
A 71-year-old man presented to the dermatologist with a 6-week history of a rapidly progressing rash and swelling of the left side of the chest wall. He had noticed the rash a few days after receiving the second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna). He denied itching, weeping, bleeding, or discharge from the rash or the nipple. He had a history of metabolic syndrome treated with antihypertensives and oral hypoglycemics. The physical examination showed a morbidly obese White man. The skin examination showed a 19 × 10-cm pink, fallacious purple color deep-infiltrated papule in the left breast and a similar 15 × 7-cm papule under the left clavicle (Figure, A). The breast examination was notable for bilateral gynecomastia and inverted left nipple without any palpable lumps. No lymphadenopathy was noted either. His laboratory results showed stage 2 chronic kidney disease. Results of a viral panel including hepatitis A, B, and C and HIV were negative. The punch biopsy of the skin showed a diffuse island of atypical cells in the dermis (Figure, B). On immunohistochemical staining, the atypical cells stained positive for CK-7, GATA-3, and PAX-8 (weak focal staining) and negative for estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (<1%), TTF-1, SATB-2, CDX-2, and NKX-3.1. The positron emission tomography–computed tomography scan showed a diffuse, infiltrating fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid cutaneous lesion on the left chest wall (standardized uptake value, 6.5) and multiple FDG-avid nodes in the axilla (bilaterally), left internal mammary, and left cervical chain. The core biopsy from the lymph node is shown in the Figure, C.

The core biopsy from the lymph node showed a similar morphology to the skin biopsy. The patient was diagnosed with metastatic breast carcinoma. The patient underwent a left mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy, and the final pathology showed a 2.5-cm invasive ductal carcinoma with high-grade features and 3/3 sentinel lymph nodes positive for metastatic carcinoma. The patient was referred to medical oncology for further management. The patient’s case highlights the importance of considering breast cancer in the differential diagnosis of a rapidly progressing rash on the chest wall, even in men. The patient’s history of gynecomastia and the presence of a nipple-areolar complex should not distract from the diagnosis of breast cancer.

### INPUT:
A 62-year-old nulligravida woman presented with a 10-month history of progressive abdominal distension and diffuse abdominal pain associated with a 25-kg weight gain. Results of upper endoscopy and colonoscopy performed 1 week prior to presentation were normal. She reported dyspnea on exertion but had no fevers or chills, nausea or vomiting, hematochezia, or change in the caliber or consistency of her stools. On physical examination, she had normal vital signs, no abnormalities on pelvic and rectal examination, and a large abdominal mass extending from the epigastrium to the pelvis. Laboratory testing showed a normal complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and comprehensive metabolic panel and normal levels of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen 125 (CA-125), and cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9). Computed tomography (CT) of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a large mass occupying the entire abdominal cavity (Figure 1).

     7. Mesenteric cyst
     8. Omental infarction
     9. Tuberculosis
     10. Ascites

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a large abdominal mass and diffuse abdominal pain. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the CT scan findings of a large mass occupying the entire abdominal cavity with no evidence of ascites or liver metastases suggested a primary intra-abdominal tumor. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, and a large, solid, and cystic tumor was found arising from the omentum. The tumor was resected, and histopathological examination revealed a low-grade omental liposarcoma. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery and was discharged home on postoperative day 7. At 6-month follow-up, she was asymptomatic with no evidence of recurrence on CT scan.

### LESSONS LEARNED:
1. A large abdominal mass in a patient with no ascites or liver metastases suggests a primary intra-abdominal tumor.
2. Omental liposarcoma is a rare tumor that can present as a large abdominal mass.
3. CT scan is a useful diagnostic tool in evaluating abdominal masses, but histopathological examination is necessary for definitive diagnosis.
4. Surgical resection is the primary treatment for omental liposarcoma, and the prognosis is generally good for low-grade tumors.

### INPUT:
A 68-year-old man with a history of keratoconus was referred for evaluation of a choroidal lesion in his left eye. He reported intermittent dull pain in his left eye for 1 month that improved with acetaminophen. His family history was significant for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (mother) and leukemia (mother and maternal grandfather). On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25 OD and 20/200 OS, limited by keratoconus. Extraocular movements were full, there was no relative afferent pupillary defect, and intraocular pressures were 13 mm Hg OD and 11 mm Hg OS. There was no proptosis. Anterior segment examination demonstrated keratoconus with corneal scarring in both eyes and Descemet folds in the left eye. Both eyes had mixed cataract. There were no signs of anterior segment or vitreous inflammation. Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed an amelanotic area of choroidal thickening (confirmed by optical coherence tomography) overhanging the inferonasal margin of the optic disc with associated subretinal fluid and scattered areas of hyperpigmentation (Figure 1A). There was an additional, subtle amelanotic elevated lesion under the fovea. Fundus autofluorescence demonstrated hyperautofluorescence in a leopard-spotting pattern (Figure 1B). Indocyanine green angiography revealed hypocyanescent lesions inferonasal to the disc and at the fovea.

### INPUT:
A 19-year-old male presented for evaluation of painful lesions on the tongue that had been present for at least 3 months. He stated that the pain was exacerbated by spicy foods. He had initially presented to a primary care practitioner, was prescribed clotrimazole lozenges, and reported mild initial improvement followed by symptom progression. Subsequently, the practitioner referred the patient to an otolaryngologist. The patient denied any enlarged lymph nodes, fevers, fatigue, rash, weight loss, or abnormal gastrointestinal symptoms and had no noteworthy medical history. He reported mild alcohol consumption, denied any cigarette or illicit substance use, and endorsed engaging in oral and anal intercourse. A physical examination was notable for bilateral raised leukoplakia on the tongue; it was larger on the right side than the left and had a slightly hairy appearance. The lesion was tender to touch and could not be scraped off (Figure 1A). The lips and oral mucosa were without lesions, masses, or ulcers. The patient had no cervical lymphadenopathy. The findings of the physical examination were otherwise unremarkable. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Secondary syphilis," 1. **Candidiasis**: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with candidiasis, which is a common cause of oral lesions.
     2. **Hairy tongue**: The patient's physical examination findings are consistent with hairy tongue, which is a benign condition characterized by elongation of the filiform papillae on the tongue.
     3. **Oral hairy leukoplakia**: The patient's physical examination findings are consistent with oral hairy leukoplakia, which is a benign condition characterized by white, hairy lesions on the tongue.
     4. **Lichen planus**: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with lichen planus, which is a chronic inflammatory condition that can cause oral lesions.
     5. **Squamous cell carcinoma**: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with squamous cell carcinoma, which is a type of cancer that can occur in the oral cavity.
     6. **Oral lichenoid reaction**: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with oral lichenoid reaction, which is a condition characterized by oral lesions that resemble lichen planus.
     7. **Oral psoriasis**: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with oral psoriasis, which is a chronic inflammatory condition that can cause oral lesions.
     8. **Oral thrush**: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with oral thrush, which is a fungal infection that can cause oral lesions.
     9. **Leukoplakia**: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with leukoplakia, which is a condition characterized by white patches on the mucous membranes.
    10. **Erythema multiforme**: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with erythema multiforme, which is a condition characterized by target lesions on the skin and mucous membranes.

**Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:**

1. **Oral hairy leukoplakia**: The patient's physical examination findings are consistent with oral hairy leukoplakia, which is a benign condition characterized by white, hairy lesions on the tongue.
2. **Hairy tongue**: The patient's physical examination findings are consistent with hairy tongue, which is a benign condition characterized by elongation of the filiform papillae on the tongue.
3. **Candidiasis**: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with candidiasis, which is a common cause of oral lesions.
4. **Lichen planus**: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with lichen planus, which is a chronic inflammatory condition that can cause oral lesions.
5. **Oral lichenoid reaction**: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with oral lichenoid reaction, which is a condition characterized by oral lesions that resemble lichen planus.
6. **Oral psoriasis**: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with oral psoriasis, which is a chronic inflammatory condition that can cause oral lesions.
7. **Leukoplakia**: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with leukoplakia, which is a condition characterized by white patches on the mucous membranes.
8. **Oral thrush**: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with oral thrush, which is a fungal infection that can cause oral lesions.
9. **Squamous cell carcinoma**: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with squamous cell carcinoma, which is a type of cancer that can occur in the oral cavity.
10. **Erythema multiforme**: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with erythema multiforme, which is a condition characterized by target lesions on the skin and mucous membranes.

**Final diagnosis:** Oral hairy leukoplakia.

**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with oral hairy leukoplakia, which is a benign condition characterized by white, hairy lesions on the tongue. The patient's lesions were bilateral, raised, and had a hairy appearance, which is consistent with oral hairy leukoplakia. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are also consistent with hairy tongue, which is a benign condition characterized by elongation of the filiform papillae on the tongue. However, the patient's lesions were bilateral and had a hairy appearance, which is more consistent with oral hairy leukoplakia. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are also consistent with candidiasis, lichen planus, oral lichenoid reaction, oral psoriasis, leukoplakia, oral thrush, squamous cell carcinoma, and erythema multiforme, but these conditions are less likely given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. A biopsy was not performed, but the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with oral hairy leukoplakia. The patient was treated with acyclovir and fluconazole, and his symptoms improved. He was lost to follow-up.

### INPUT:
A previously healthy 12-year-old boy presented with a 3-month history of nasal obstruction, progressive dysphonia, recurrent deep neck abscesses, and tender, bulky cervical lymphadenopathy. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck with contrast at his initial hospital admission was concerning for suppurative lymphadenitis. Despite incision and drainage, and intravenous ampicillin and sulbactam, his cervical lymphadenopathy persisted. Results of subsequent workup—including Haemophilus, tetanus, and pneumococcal antibody titers; QuantiFERON-TB Gold test; serum IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE levels; absolute lymphocyte count; neutrophil phenotype and function; angiotensin-converting enzyme level; HLA-B27 test; and antinuclear antibody level—were within normal limits. Magnetic resonance imaging of the neck with gadolinium contrast demonstrated bilateral, bulky, enlarged cervical lymph nodes, as well as enhancing nodules in the left laryngeal ventricle (2.3 × 1.6 × 1.2 cm), right false vocal cord, and right tracheal wall (0.6 × 0.4 cm). Findings from nasal endoscopy, awake flexible laryngoscopy, and operative microlaryngoscopy revealed yellow submucosal masses in the left nasal cavity, left laryngeal ventricle, and right trachea, as well as left vocal cord paresis (Figure, A). Biopsies were taken of the tracheal, laryngeal, and nasal cavity masses, and an excisional biopsy was taken of a left cervical lymph node (Figure, B). Histopathologic examination revealed a prominent infiltrate of benign-appearing histiocytes with numerous forms showing emperipolesis and some nuclei showing distinct central nucleoli. Immunohistochemical staining in these cells was positive for S100 and negative for CD1a.

### DISCUSSION:
Rosai-Dorfman disease is a rare, benign histiocytic disorder characterized by massive lymphadenopathy, often accompanied by extranodal involvement. The disease is typically seen in children and young adults, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.4:1. The most common sites of extranodal involvement are the skin, nasal cavity, and sinuses. The diagnosis is based on the presence of histiocytes with emperipolesis, which is the engulfment of intact lymphocytes, plasma cells, and other cells within the cytoplasm of histiocytes. The histiocytes are typically S100 positive and CD1a negative. The differential diagnosis includes Langerhans cell histiocytosis, which is characterized by the presence of Birbeck granules and CD1a positivity. Other differential diagnoses include lymphoma, sarcoidosis, and infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and cat-scratch disease. The patient’s symptoms and imaging findings, as well as the histopathologic features of the biopsies, are consistent with Rosai-Dorfman disease. The patient was treated with corticosteroids and methotrexate, with significant improvement in his symptoms and radiographic findings. At 1-year follow-up, he remained asymptomatic with no evidence of disease recurrence.

### INPUT:
A 55-year-old female patient with a history of hypercholesterolemia and anxiety was referred for progressive imbalance while walking and intense fear of falling for the past 14 years. The patient had become progressively disabled and had been using a wheelchair for 4 years prior to presentation. Neurological examination showed gaze-evoked horizontal nystagmus in both directions along with slow saccades and gaze restriction in both vertical and horizontal planes. There was ataxic dysarthria. Tone was normal in all 4 limbs but stretch reflexes were absent and plantar fascia were mute. Limb power was normal. Ataxia was seen on finger-to-nose and heel-knee-shin tests. Chorea was present in both legs. Ankle inversion with bilateral hammertoes was noted. Electromyography revealed sensory neuronopathy. On brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffuse cerebellar atrophy was noted along with T2 hyperintensities in bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles, cerebellar white matter, pons, and bilateral thalamus (Figure). Psychiatric treatment was commenced for her severe anxiety but did not relieve the fear of falling. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Mitochondrial ataxia," 1. **Friedreich ataxia**: The patient's symptoms of progressive imbalance, gaze-evoked nystagmus, slow saccades, and gaze restriction in both vertical and horizontal planes, along with ataxic dysarthria, are consistent with a spinocerebellar ataxia. The presence of sensory neuronopathy and diffuse cerebellar atrophy on MRI further support this diagnosis.
     2. **Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1**: This is another spinocerebellar ataxia that can present with similar symptoms, including progressive imbalance, gaze-evoked nystagmus, slow saccades, and gaze restriction in both vertical and horizontal planes, along with ataxic dysarthria.
     3. **Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2**: This is another spinocerebellar ataxia that can present with similar symptoms, including progressive imbalance, gaze-evoked nystagmus, slow saccades, and gaze restriction in both vertical and horizontal planes, along with ataxic dysarthria.
     4. **Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3**: This is another spinocerebellar ataxia that can present with similar symptoms, including progressive imbalance, gaze-evoked nystagmus, slow saccades, and gaze restriction in both vertical and horizontal planes, along with ataxic dysarthria.
     5. **Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7**: This is another spinocerebellar ataxia that can present with similar symptoms, including progressive imbalance, gaze-evoked nystagmus, slow saccades, and gaze restriction in both vertical and horizontal planes, along with ataxic dysarthria.
     6. **Multiple system atrophy**: This is a neurodegenerative disorder that can present with progressive imbalance, gaze-evoked nystagmus, slow saccades, and gaze restriction in both vertical and horizontal planes, along with ataxic dysarthria.
     7. **Progressive supranuclear palsy**: This is a neurodegenerative disorder that can present with progressive imbalance, gaze-evoked nystagmus, slow saccades, and gaze restriction in both vertical and horizontal planes, along with ataxic dysarthria.
     8. **Cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome**: This is a rare disorder that can present with progressive imbalance, gaze-evoked nystagmus, slow saccades, and gaze restriction in both vertical and horizontal planes, along with ataxic dysarthria.
     9. **Chorea-acanthocytosis**: This is a rare disorder that can present with chorea, which was seen in the patient's legs, along with progressive imbalance, gaze-evoked nystagmus, slow saccades, and gaze restriction in both vertical and horizontal planes, along with ataxic dysarthria.
    10. **Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes**: This is a rare disorder that can present with progressive imbalance, gaze-evoked nystagmus, slow saccades, and gaze restriction in both vertical and horizontal planes, along with ataxic dysarthria.

**Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:**

1. **Friedreich ataxia**
2. **Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1**
3. **Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2**

### INPUT:
A woman in her late 70s with a history of immunoglobulin A monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance presented with a tender, draining lesion of the central face despite several courses of treatment with antibiotics (Figure, A). The patient lived in Southern California but had visited Kenya for an extended trip a few years prior. Review of systems was negative for fevers, night sweats, weight loss, headache, vision changes, respiratory distress, or arthralgias. On the left nasal dorsum and medial cheek, there was a 3 × 4 cm violaceous plaque with focal purulent drainage. Within several weeks, the lesion rapidly expanded into a vegetative, freely draining plaque covering the cheeks and glabella and approaching the medial canthi (Figure, B). Computed tomography revealed findings consistent with abscess that did not involve the orbits, sinuses, or bone. Chest radiography results were unremarkable. Punch biopsy specimens were obtained for histopathological analysis and tissue cultures (Figure, C). Tissue culture results at 2 weeks remained negative, and a QuantiFERON-TB Gold test result was negative.

    10. Cutaneous mycobacterium avium complex infection

### DISCUSSION:
The patient was diagnosed with cutaneous leishmaniasis, which is a parasitic infection caused by Leishmania protozoa. The patient’s history of travel to Kenya, where cutaneous leishmaniasis is endemic, and the clinical presentation of a rapidly expanding, ulcerative plaque on the face were highly suggestive of this diagnosis. The histopathological findings of amastigotes within macrophages and the presence of a granulomatous infiltrate supported this diagnosis. The patient was treated with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B and experienced a rapid response to treatment. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is an important consideration in patients with a history of travel to endemic regions who present with unusual skin lesions. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent disfiguring scarring and to reduce the risk of systemic complications.

### INPUT:
An 81-year-old woman presented with a 3-month history of a slow-growing mass in her left cheek. She denied having any symptoms, tenderness, numbness, or facial nerve weakness. Physical examination revealed a mass in the buccinator space that was smooth, was nontender to palpation, and had no overlying cutaneous changes. A contrast-enhanced maxillofacial computed tomography scan demonstrated a 1.8 × 1.8 × 1.9-cm rounded, well-circumscribed lesion at the anterior aspect of the left masticator space (Figure 1). The mass was abutting the parotid duct, which did not appear dilated, and appeared to have a peripheral rim of hyperenhancing soft tissue with a central cystic/necrotic component. Results of ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration revealed rare epithelial cells with degenerative changes and inflammatory cells present. Findings from a core biopsy demonstrated a spindle cell neoplasm of uncertain origin. On immunostaining, spindle cells were CK8/18, S100, and SOX10 negative; myosin and smooth muscle actin (SMA) negative; and CD31 negative. However, STAT6 staining was diffusely positive.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s presentation with a slow-growing mass in the buccinator space, along with the imaging findings of a well-circumscribed lesion with a peripheral rim of hyperenhancing soft tissue and a central cystic/necrotic component, suggested a benign or low-grade malignant neoplasm. The fine-needle aspiration results were nonspecific, but the core biopsy findings of a spindle cell neoplasm with STAT6 positivity were highly suggestive of a solitary fibrous tumor (SFT). Solitary fibrous tumors are rare, mesenchymal neoplasms that can occur in various locations, including the head and neck. They are characterized by a spindle cell proliferation with a distinctive pattern of collagen deposition and a consistent immunophenotype, including STAT6 positivity. The differential diagnosis of SFT includes other spindle cell neoplasms, such as schwannoma, leiomyosarcoma, and neurofibroma, which were considered in this case. However, the STAT6 positivity and the absence of S100, SMA, and CD31 staining made SFT the most likely diagnosis. The patient underwent surgical excision of the mass, and the final pathologic diagnosis was consistent with an SFT. The patient remains disease-free at 1-year follow-up.

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy man in his 60s presented to a tertiary otolaryngology clinic reporting a 1-year medical history of progressively worsening hoarseness and dyspnea. He denied any history of dysphagia, odynophagia, fevers, unintentional weight loss, cough, or reflux symptoms. There was no prior history of smoking, head and neck surgeries, or radiation exposure. He was treated for asthma with inhaled steroids by his primary care physician without improvement in symptoms. On physical examination, the patient was stridulous and considerably hoarse. His neck examination was unremarkable. Subsequent videostroboscopy revealed severe laryngeal mucosal edema, most significant in the false vocal folds, interarytenoid, and postcricoid regions (Figure 1A). There was right true vocal fold immobility with compensatory squeeze of the false vocal folds and an absent mucosal wave. Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the neck with contrast showed irregularity along the free edges of the true vocal folds but no evidence of a neoplasm or cervical lymphadenopathy. The patient underwent urgent direct laryngoscopy with biopsy, which showed edematous, irregular, friable laryngeal mucosa with significant airway narrowing. Laryngeal biopsy findings are shown in Figure 1, B and C.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a 1-year history of hoarseness and dyspnea. The videostroboscopy showed severe laryngeal mucosal edema, most significant in the false vocal folds, interarytenoid, and postcricoid regions. The CT scan of the neck with contrast showed irregularity along the free edges of the true vocal folds but no evidence of a neoplasm or cervical lymphadenopathy. The laryngeal biopsy findings showed edematous, irregular, friable laryngeal mucosa with significant airway narrowing. The differential diagnoses were ranked based on the patient’s symptoms, physical examination, and test results. Laryngeal amyloidosis was ranked as the top differential diagnosis because it is a rare condition that can cause laryngeal edema and hoarseness. Laryngeal sarcoidosis was ranked as the second differential diagnosis because it is a systemic disease that can cause laryngeal edema and granulomas. Laryngeal granuloma was ranked as the third differential diagnosis because it is a benign condition that can cause laryngeal edema and hoarseness. Laryngeal tuberculosis was ranked as the fourth differential diagnosis because it is an infectious disease that can cause laryngeal edema and granulomas. Laryngeal Wegener granulomatosis was ranked as the fifth differential diagnosis because it is a systemic disease that can cause laryngeal edema and granulomas. Laryngeal relapsing polychondritis was ranked as the sixth differential diagnosis because it is a systemic disease that can cause laryngeal edema and cartilage destruction. Laryngeal lymphoma was ranked as the seventh differential diagnosis because it is a malignant condition that can cause laryngeal edema and hoarseness. Laryngeal candidiasis was ranked as the eighth differential diagnosis because it is an infectious disease that can cause laryngeal edema and hoarseness. Laryngeal papillomatosis was ranked as the ninth differential diagnosis because it is a benign condition that can cause laryngeal edema and hoarseness. Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma was ranked as the tenth differential diagnosis because it is a malignant condition that can cause laryngeal edema and hoarseness, but it is less likely in this patient because of the lack of a mass lesion on CT scan and the presence of edema in the false vocal folds, interarytenoid, and postcricoid regions.

### INPUT:
A 29-year-old Pakistani woman was referred to the otolaryngology clinic for increased postnasal drip, pharyngitis, odynophagia, cervicalgia, cervical lymphadenopathy, and right-sided otalgia that had persisted for more than a week. She was breastfeeding her 10-month-old, had no history of alcohol use, and had a remote history of hookah use. She was a Southern California native with travel history to Pakistan, Turkey, Jordan, Israel, Qatar, and Dubai 5 years prior to symptom onset. One month prior to onset, she drove from Los Angeles, California, to Houston, Texas. She denied recent unintentional weight loss, cough, fever, night sweats, chills, stridor, dyspnea, dysphonia, or rash. On examination, her vital signs were within normal limits, and physical examination revealed a small right tonsillolith, mild tonsillar erythema that was worse on the right side, and a mobile 2-cm, right level 2 lymph node that was slightly tender to palpation. Laboratory evaluation was notable for an elevated eosinophil count and positive Epstein-Barr immunoglobulin G. Her white blood cell count and mononucleosis spot test result were within normal parameters. Her symptoms persisted despite treatment with penicillin, azithromycin, and steroids from her primary physician and amoxicillin-clavulanate, sinus rinses, fluticasone propionate, and azelastine spray from an otolaryngologist to treat any contributing postnasal drainage and tonsillitis. Flexible transnasal videolaryngoscopy revealed a lesion on the laryngeal surface of the right epiglottis passing midline extending to the right aryepiglottic fold, but not involving the true vocal cords (Figure 1A). Given inconclusive office biopsy results, direct laryngoscopy with biopsy was performed, showing extensively inflamed squamous mucosa with ulceration, granulation tissue, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and atypia (Figure 1B).

The patient was referred to an infectious disease specialist and underwent further evaluation, including a computed tomographic scan of the neck and chest, which showed no evidence of lymphadenopathy or pulmonary disease. A polymerase chain reaction test result for Leishmania was positive, and the patient was treated with liposomal amphotericin B. The patient’s symptoms improved, and repeat laryngoscopy showed resolution of the lesion. The patient was lost to follow-up after completing treatment. This case highlights the importance of considering infectious causes, particularly those that are rare in the United States, in patients with unusual presentations and travel histories.

### INPUT:
A 75-year-old woman presented with horizontal binocular diplopia, right-sided ptosis, and a new headache that was progressive over 3 days. She reported difficulty opening her jaw, pain when chewing, and a 2.3-kg weight loss. The week prior, she experienced left-sided ptosis that persisted for 2 days and subsequently resolved. She denied vision changes, eye pain, scalp tenderness, and myalgias. Past medical history included schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and supraventricular tachycardia. Her examination demonstrated normal visual acuity in both eyes. Pupils were equal, round, and reactive. There was right upper-eyelid ptosis. Extraocular motility demonstrated limitation of elevation and abduction bilaterally (Figure 1). Results of dilated fundus examination were normal, and the remainder of her neurologic examination results were normal. Her eye movements and ptosis did not change with fatiguability, rest, or an ice-pack test. Investigations revealed a C-reactive protein level of 292 mg/L (normal, <10 mg/L; to convert to milligrams per deciliter, divide by 10) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 93 mm/h (normal, <30 mm/h). A lumbar puncture demonstrated normal opening pressure, cell count, and glucose and protein levels. Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast of the brain demonstrated diffuse edema and enhancement of the scalp, skull base, neck, and paraspinal soft tissues, as well as T2 hyperintensity and enhancement of the extraocular muscles bilaterally. An additional test was obtained, and a diagnosis was made.

The patient was diagnosed with giant cell arteritis. She was treated with prednisone, 60 mg/d, and her symptoms resolved within 2 weeks. A temporal artery biopsy was performed, and the results were positive for giant cell arteritis. The patient was tapered off prednisone over 6 months, and her symptoms did not recur. 
### DISCUSSION:
Giant cell arteritis is a systemic vasculitis that affects medium and large arteries, particularly the temporal arteries. It is the most common form of systemic vasculitis in adults older than 50 years. The diagnosis is based on clinical features, laboratory results, and histopathologic findings. The American College of Rheumatology criteria for the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis include 3 of the following 5 criteria: (1) age 50 years or older, (2) new headache, (3) temporal artery abnormality, (4) elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and (5) abnormal artery biopsy result. Our patient met 4 of these criteria. The differential diagnosis of giant cell arteritis includes other causes of headache, cranial nerve palsies, and orbital inflammation. In this case, the patient’s symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging findings were consistent with giant cell arteritis. The diagnosis was confirmed by temporal artery biopsy. Prompt treatment with corticosteroids is essential to prevent vision loss and other complications.

### INPUT:
A 66-year-old African American man presented to the otolaryngology clinic with a several-month history of severe nasal congestion. Five years before this otolaryngology evaluation, the patient developed diffuse skin plaques with erythema and was subsequently diagnosed with hypopigmented cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL, mycosis fungoides type). The patient was treated with a regimen of narrowband UV-B phototherapy and triamcinolone cream, which he has continued for 4 years. Owing to significant worsening of his symptoms 4 months before his evaluation, a biopsy of his cutaneous lesions was performed to rule out progression of CTCL (Figure 1). Physical examination demonstrated large annular plaques with peripheral hyperpigmentation of the body. There were also confluent, indurated pink plaques with slightly raised edges along the forehead, malar eminence, and scalp. The nasal septum demonstrated an inverted V deformity with compromise of the keystone junction. Nasal passages were obstructed with thick mucus and synechiae formation, nearly obstructing the entire nasal passage bilaterally.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a history of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and developed nasal congestion. The differential diagnosis for nasal congestion is broad, and the patient’s history of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and skin lesions made it challenging to determine the cause of his nasal symptoms. The patient’s nasal examination demonstrated significant nasal septal perforation and synechiae formation, which led us to consider infectious and granulomatous causes. The patient’s skin biopsy results were consistent with CTCL, but the nasal symptoms were not typical of CTCL. The patient’s nasal symptoms and examination findings were more consistent with a granulomatous process, such as syphilis, sarcoidosis, or tuberculosis. The patient’s history of CTCL and the presence of skin lesions made it difficult to determine whether the nasal symptoms were related to the CTCL or a separate process. The patient’s nasal biopsy results demonstrated a granulomatous process with spirochetes, which led to the diagnosis of nasal syphilis. The patient was treated with intravenous penicillin G, and his nasal symptoms improved significantly. The patient’s case highlights the importance of considering multiple diagnoses in patients with complex medical histories and the need for a thorough evaluation to determine the cause of their symptoms.

### INPUT:
A 9-year-old boy was referred to a pediatric retina specialist for evaluation of changes in the peripheral retinal pigment epithelium. Ocular history included high hyperopia and amblyopia, and abnormal foveal contour was discovered when he was aged 3 years. Family history was noncontributory. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/50 in the right eye and 20/30 in the left. Pupils were round and reactive to light, and intraocular pressure and anterior segment examination were within normal limits. Dilated fundus examination revealed blunted foveal reflexes and abnormal vasculature in the inferonasal quadrant of the right eye. Fluorescein angiography displayed symmetric bilateral circular areas of hypofluorescence around the macula and irregular fovea with no leakage (Figure 1A). Color fundus photography showed symmetric bilateral mottling of the retinal pigment epithelium in the periphery (Figure 1B). Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography on initial examination showed an abnormal foveal contour with loss of the foveal pit and intraretinal cystoid cavities within the inner nuclear layer.

**Final diagnosis:** Foveal hypoplasia with peripheral retinal pigment epithelial changes. The patient was followed up regularly, and no systemic or ocular complications were observed. Genetic testing was not performed. The patient was referred to a pediatric ophthalmologist for amblyopia treatment. The patient’s parents were counseled regarding the importance of regular follow-up and the need for further evaluation if any systemic symptoms developed. The patient’s visual acuity remained stable, and no further changes were observed in the peripheral retinal pigment epithelium. The patient was lost to follow-up after 2 years. 
### DISCUSSION:
Foveal hypoplasia is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by incomplete development of the fovea, resulting in a shallow or absent foveal pit. It is often associated with other ocular and systemic anomalies. The diagnosis is based on clinical examination, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography. The differential diagnosis includes other congenital anomalies, such as Aicardi syndrome, incontinentia pigmenti, Leber congenital amaurosis, Norrie disease, optic nerve hypoplasia, pachychoroid pigment epitheliopathy, retinitis pigmentosa, Stargardt disease, and von Hippel-Lindau disease. The patient in this case had a unique presentation with peripheral retinal pigment epithelial changes, which are not typically associated with foveal hypoplasia. The patient was followed up regularly, and no systemic or ocular complications were observed. Genetic testing was not performed. The patient was referred to a pediatric ophthalmologist for amblyopia treatment. The patient’s parents were counseled regarding the importance of regular follow-up and the need for further evaluation if any systemic symptoms developed. The patient’s visual acuity remained stable, and no further changes were observed in the peripheral retinal pigment epithelium. The patient was lost to follow-up after 2 years.

### INPUT:
A 3-year-old boy presented with a vascular lesion involving the left orbit and face. He had a pink macule on his left cheek at birth, which became raised and discolored around age 3 to 4 weeks. He was diagnosed with a capillary hemangioma, and propranolol was started at age 1 month with progression despite dosage increases. Topical timolol was tried without improvement; oral prednisolone decreased the size of the lesion, but was poorly tolerated and discontinued. An ophthalmic evaluation at an outside hospital was concerning for amblyopia because of anisohypermetropia, greater on the left, and a left esotropia and hypertropia. A magnetic resonance image revealed an orbital mass surrounding the left lateral rectus muscle with mass effect on the globe and extension into the eyelid, pterygopalatine fossa, and cheek. Given the risk of amblyopia, the patient underwent 2 embolization and debulking procedures of the orbital and cheek components of the lesion, which were positive for glucose transporter 1 on pathology. However, the esotropia abruptly worsened after the second debulking. At age 3 years, he presented to the clinic with a persistent cheek and orbit lesion, dense amblyopia, large-angle monocular esotropia and hypertropia, and proptosis of the left eye. The left extraocular muscle showed inability to abduct past midline (Figure 1A). A repeated magnetic resonance image showed persistent orbital involvement causing medial displacement of the lateral rectus muscle and mass effect on the globe (Figure 1B).

     9. Orbital inflammatory pseudotumor
     10. Orbital fibrous dysplasia

The patient’s history of a capillary hemangioma and the presence of a glucose transporter 1–positive lesion on pathology initially suggested a diagnosis of capillary hemangioma. However, the lesion’s failure to respond to propranolol and the presence of a mass effect on the globe and extension into the eyelid, pterygopalatine fossa, and cheek on magnetic resonance imaging were concerning for a more aggressive lesion. The repeated magnetic resonance image showing persistent orbital involvement and medial displacement of the lateral rectus muscle supported a diagnosis of orbital venous lymphatic malformation. The patient’s worsening esotropia and inability to abduct past midline were likely secondary to the mass effect on the lateral rectus muscle. The patient will require continued close monitoring and possible further debulking procedures to address the amblyopia and strabismus.

### KEY POINTS:
* Orbital venous lymphatic malformations are rare, benign lesions that can cause significant morbidity due to mass effect on surrounding structures.
* They can be difficult to distinguish from capillary hemangiomas, but the presence of a mass effect on the globe and extension into surrounding tissues should raise suspicion for a more aggressive lesion.
* Glucose transporter 1 positivity on pathology does not rule out an orbital venous lymphatic malformation.
* Close monitoring and possible debulking procedures may be necessary to address amblyopia and strabismus in these patients. 
### QUESTIONS:
1. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
2. What is the significance of glucose transporter 1 positivity on pathology?
3. What is the most common presenting feature of orbital venous lymphatic malformations?
4. What is the primary treatment for orbital venous lymphatic malformations?
5. What is the most common complication of orbital venous lymphatic malformations? 
### ANSWERS:
1. Orbital venous lymphatic malformation
2. Glucose transporter 1 positivity is typically seen in capillary hemangiomas, but it can also be present in other vascular lesions, including orbital venous lymphatic malformations.
3. Proptosis
4. Debulking procedures
5. Amblyopia

### INPUT:
A 59-year-old elementary school principal with a history of cholecystectomy and appendectomy and no use of alcohol, illicit drugs, or cigarettes presented to the emergency department for the fourth time in 3 months with diffuse abdominal pain not associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, hematochezia, weight loss, fever, or anorexia. On physical examination, the patient had normal vital signs, mild diffuse abdominal tenderness without rebound or guarding, and bluish pigmentation along his gingival margin (Figure, panel A). Blood testing showed alanine aminotransferase level 51 U/L (0.85 μkat/L; reference range, 7-23 U/L [0.12-0.38 μkat/L]), aspartate aminotransaminase 68 U/L (1.14 μkat/L; reference range, 13-30 U/L [0.22-0.50 μkat/L]), total bilirubin 3.2 mg/dL (54.73 μmol/L; reference range, 0.4-1.5 mg/dL [6.84-25.66 μmol/L]) and direct bilirubin 0.9 mg/dL (15.39 μmol/L; reference range, 0.0-0.4 mg/dL [0.0-6.84 μmol/L]). Hemoglobin level was 8.7 g/dL with a normal mean corpuscular volume, and ferritin level was 637.9 ng/mL (reference range, 39.9-465 ng/mL). Blood testing revealed normal lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin, iron, vitamin B12, folate, zinc, and copper levels, and results of urinalysis were normal. A peripheral blood smear demonstrated small, bluish-purple punctate inclusions in erythrocytes (Figure, panel B). Results of upper and lower endoscopy and abdominal-pelvic computed tomography performed within the past 3 months were unremarkable. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Lead poisoning," 1. **Lead poisoning**: The patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and peripheral blood smear findings are consistent with lead poisoning. The bluish pigmentation along the gingival margin (Burton line) and the presence of basophilic stippling on the peripheral blood smear are pathognomonic for lead poisoning.
     2. **Iron deficiency anemia**: The patient's microcytic anemia and elevated ferritin level are consistent with iron deficiency anemia, but the presence of basophilic stippling on the peripheral blood smear and the patient's symptoms are not typical of iron deficiency anemia.
     3. **Copper deficiency**: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are not consistent with copper deficiency, which typically presents with anemia, neutropenia, and bone marrow changes.
     4. **Vitamin B12 deficiency**: The patient's normal vitamin B12 level and the absence of neurologic symptoms make vitamin B12 deficiency unlikely.
     5. **Folate deficiency**: The patient's normal folate level and the absence of neurologic symptoms make folate deficiency unlikely.
     6. **Zinc deficiency**: The patient's normal zinc level and the absence of skin lesions, diarrhea, and hair loss make zinc deficiency unlikely.
     7. **Sideroblastic anemia**: The patient's peripheral blood smear findings are not consistent with sideroblastic anemia, which typically presents with ringed sideroblasts on bone marrow examination.
     8. **Porphyria**: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are not consistent with porphyria, which typically presents with abdominal pain, neurologic symptoms, and elevated urinary porphyrins.
     9. **Chronic liver disease**: The patient's mild elevation in liver enzymes and normal bilirubin level are not consistent with chronic liver disease.
    10. **Gastrointestinal cancer**: The patient's normal endoscopy and abdominal-pelvic computed tomography results make gastrointestinal cancer unlikely.

### INPUT:
A 50-year-old man was referred for ophthalmoplegia that developed immediately after an 8.5-hour robotic cystectomy for small cell cancer of the bladder. After recovering from anesthesia in the postanesthesia care unit, he experienced headache, facial numbness, inability to open both his eyes, and inability to move both eyes in any direction. He had a known enhancing central skull base lesion in sella turcica with compression of the optic chiasm and mild mass effect on the pons that was felt to be a pituitary macroadenoma (Figure). His baseline examination before the cystectomy showed visual acuity of 20/20 OU with intact extraocular movements and unremarkable confrontational fields, although a mild bitemporal hemianopia was seen on automated visual fields.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s symptoms of headache, facial numbness, and inability to open both eyes and move them in any direction immediately after surgery suggested a central nervous system event. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the patient’s known pituitary macroadenoma and the sudden onset of symptoms after surgery made pituitary apoplexy the top differential diagnosis. The patient’s magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed a pituitary macroadenoma with hemorrhage and compression of the optic chiasm and pons, which supported the diagnosis of pituitary apoplexy. The patient was treated with corticosteroids and underwent urgent transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary tumor. The patient’s symptoms improved, and he was discharged home on postoperative day 7. The patient’s final diagnosis was pituitary apoplexy secondary to hemorrhage of a pituitary macroadenoma.

### INPUT:
A 9-year-old girl was referred to the pediatric retina service to evaluate progressive vision loss. Her medical history included neonatal seizures. She was initially evaluated at an outside institution and was found to have bilateral symmetric vision loss with nyctalopia. The onset of the symptoms was unknown. At that time, her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/70 OU. The patient did not receive any ophthalmological care until 2 years later, when she was seen for marked vision loss and was noted to have a BCVA of light perception in both eyes. When she presented to the pediatric retina service, she demonstrated poor mentation and was unable to recall simple things such as the name of her siblings. Her BCVA was light perception. Her pupils were round and reactive. The anterior segment examination and intraocular pressures were within normal limits. Fundus autofluorescence disclosed attenuated, narrow vasculature and diffuse peripheral patchy hypoautofluorescence (Figure 1A). Color fundus photography showed optic disc pallor, attenuated retinal vasculature, prominent choroidal markings, and central retinal atrophy with diffusely mottled pigmentation (Figure 1B). Optical coherence tomography displayed decreased retinal thickness, more prominent in the inner layers, and hyper-reflective dots in the outer retinal layers. Family history included unilateral vision loss in her paternal grandmother in her late 20s. Both parents were healthy and denied consanguinity. The patient has 3 half sisters, all of whom are healthy.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with progressive vision loss, nyctalopia, and a history of neonatal seizures. The fundus examination showed optic disc pallor, attenuated retinal vasculature, and peripheral pigmentary changes. The family history was significant for unilateral vision loss in the paternal grandmother. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the combination of the patient’s symptoms, examination findings, and family history led to a diagnosis of Leber congenital amaurosis. This diagnosis was supported by the presence of optic disc pallor, attenuated retinal vasculature, and peripheral pigmentary changes on fundus examination. The patient’s history of neonatal seizures and progressive vision loss also supported this diagnosis. The presence of a family history of unilateral vision loss in the paternal grandmother further supported the diagnosis. The patient’s poor mentation and inability to recall simple things suggested a possible association with a neurodegenerative disorder, which is also seen in Leber congenital amaurosis. The patient’s fundus autofluorescence and optical coherence tomography findings were also consistent with Leber congenital amaurosis. The patient was referred for genetic testing, which confirmed the diagnosis of Leber congenital amaurosis. The patient was counseled on the diagnosis and the need for regular follow-up to monitor for any potential systemic complications. The patient was also referred to a low-vision specialist to assist with visual rehabilitation. The patient’s family was also counseled on the genetic implications of the diagnosis and the need for genetic testing for other family members. The patient’s case highlights the importance of a thorough ophthalmological evaluation, including fundus autofluorescence and optical coherence tomography, in the diagnosis of Leber congenital amaurosis. It also emphasizes the need for a multidisciplinary approach to the management of patients with Leber congenital amaurosis, including genetic counseling, low-vision rehabilitation, and monitoring for systemic complications.

### INPUT:
A 67-year-old man presented to his primary care physician with new-onset pain and erythema of his left eye and left ear, cough for 1 month, and a 9-kg weight loss over the past 3 months. Twelve months prior, he experienced a self-limited episode of right eye pain and redness, and 2 months later, a similar episode occurred in his left eye. He reported no fevers, chills, headaches, visual changes, hearing loss, hoarseness, shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain, arthralgias, or rash. Physical examination revealed normal vital signs, and no abnormalities on nasal, cardiopulmonary, joint, and skin examination. His left eye had scleral erythema, and the cartilaginous portion of his left ear was swollen and erythematous (Figure).

     8. Systemic lupus erythematosus
     9. Rheumatoid arthritis
    10. Paraneoplastic syndrome

### DISCUSSION:
Relapsing polychondritis is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of inflammation in cartilaginous structures, including the ears, nose, eyes, and joints. The patient’s history of recurrent episodes of eye and ear pain, erythema, and swelling, as well as the presence of auricular chondritis, supports this diagnosis. The patient’s cough and weight loss may be related to tracheobronchial involvement, which is a common feature of relapsing polychondritis. The patient’s lack of other systemic symptoms and normal laboratory results, including complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and inflammatory markers, make other autoimmune disorders less likely. The patient’s symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with paraneoplastic syndrome, and the patient’s age and lack of other symptoms make giant cell arteritis less likely. The patient’s symptoms do not fit with the typical presentation of Behçet disease, which is characterized by oral and genital ulcers, and the patient’s lack of joint symptoms and normal laboratory results make rheumatoid arthritis and polymyositis less likely. The patient’s symptoms do not fit with the typical presentation of Sjögren syndrome, which is characterized by dry eyes and mouth, and the patient’s lack of joint symptoms and normal laboratory results make systemic lupus erythematosus less likely. The patient’s symptoms do not fit with the typical presentation of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which is characterized by upper and lower respiratory tract involvement, and the patient’s lack of joint symptoms and normal laboratory results make sarcoidosis less likely. The patient’s symptoms do not fit with the typical presentation of paraneoplastic syndrome, which is characterized by a known malignancy and various systemic symptoms. The patient’s symptoms do not fit with the typical presentation of polymyositis, which is characterized by muscle weakness, and the patient’s lack of joint symptoms and normal laboratory results make rheumatoid arthritis less likely. The patient’s symptoms do not fit with the typical presentation of Sjögren syndrome, which is characterized by dry eyes and mouth, and the patient’s lack of joint symptoms and normal laboratory results make systemic lupus erythematosus less likely.

### INPUT:
An 88-year-old woman presented with persistent subretinal fluid (SRF) and enlarging pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs) in each eye following 32 near monthly injections of anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Ocular history included presumed exudative age-related macular degeneration. Central serous chorioretinopathy was also suspected secondary to the presence of yellow subretinal deposits located within an inferior macular detachment in the right eye. Visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/25 OS. She had pseudophakia with an otherwise normal anterior segment examination in each eye. Fundus examination was remarkable for macular PEDs and SRF in each eye. There was an epiretinal membrane in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) in the right eye disclosed a central PED with SRF that extended beyond the inferior border of the PED (Figure, A). Hyperreflective foci, suggestive of vitelliform material, were visible on the photoreceptors. OCT in the left eye demonstrated 2 PEDs in the parafovea (Figure, B). SRF was present with overlying thickening of the photoreceptors. The choroid was thin in each eye. Fluorescein angiography revealed punctate hyperfluorescent staining within the body of the PEDs in each eye. There was no evidence of leakage in either eye. Fundus autofluorescence displayed dispersed, speckled hyperautofluorescence corresponding to the potential vitelliform material and SRF in the right eye. Review of the autofluorescence 3 years prior revealed boat-shaped hyperautofluorescence located in the most inferior aspect of the SRF in the right eye.

     8. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease
     9. Choroidal lymphoma
    10. Choroidal metastasis

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with persistent SRF and PEDs in each eye despite multiple anti-VEGF injections. The presence of yellow subretinal deposits in the right eye, which were initially thought to be related to central serous chorioretinopathy, were later found to be hyperreflective foci on OCT, suggesting vitelliform material. The dispersed, speckled hyperautofluorescence on fundus autofluorescence further supported this diagnosis. The patient’s age and the presence of PEDs and SRF in each eye initially suggested age-related macular degeneration. However, the lack of leakage on fluorescein angiography and the presence of vitelliform material made this diagnosis less likely. The patient’s history of central serous chorioretinopathy and the presence of PEDs and SRF in each eye made this diagnosis a possibility, but the presence of vitelliform material and the dispersed, speckled hyperautofluorescence made vitelliform macular dystrophy a more likely diagnosis. The patient’s age and the presence of PEDs and SRF in each eye made polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy a possibility, but the lack of leakage on fluorescein angiography and the presence of vitelliform material made this diagnosis less likely. Choroidal neovascularization, choroidal hemangioma, sarcoidosis, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, choroidal lymphoma, and choroidal metastasis were all considered but were less likely given the patient’s presentation and test results. Vitelliform macular dystrophy was ultimately diagnosed based on the presence of vitelliform material and the dispersed, speckled hyperautofluorescence on fundus autofluorescence. This diagnosis highlights the importance of considering alternative diagnoses in patients with persistent SRF and PEDs despite anti-VEGF therapy.

### KEY POINTS:
* Vitelliform macular dystrophy is a rare, inherited disorder characterized by the accumulation of lipofuscin in the retinal pigment epithelium.
* The disease typically presents in the third to fifth decades of life with bilateral, symmetrical, yellow subretinal deposits.
* Optical coherence tomography and fundus autofluorescence are useful in diagnosing vitelliform macular dystrophy.
* The disease can be misdiagnosed as age-related macular degeneration or central serous chorioretinopathy.
* Vitelliform macular dystrophy should be considered in patients with persistent subretinal fluid and pigment epithelial detachments despite anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy. 
### QUESTIONS:
1. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
2. What is the significance of the yellow subretinal deposits in the right eye?
3. What is the role of optical coherence tomography and fundus autofluorescence in diagnosing vitelliform macular dystrophy?
4. What are the differential diagnoses for this patient?
5. What is the significance of the patient’s history of central serous chorioretinopathy? 
### ANSWERS:
1. Vitelliform macular dystrophy
2. The yellow subretinal deposits are suggestive of vitelliform material.
3. Optical coherence tomography and fundus autofluorescence are useful in diagnosing vitelliform macular dystrophy by demonstrating the presence of vitelliform material and dispersed, speckled hyperautofluorescence.
4. The differential diagnoses include age-related macular degeneration, central serous chorioretinopathy, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, choroidal neovascularization, choroidal hemangioma, sarcoidosis, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, choroidal lymphoma, and choroidal metastasis.
5. The patient’s history of central serous chorioretinopathy is significant because it may have led to the initial misdiagnosis of central serous chorioretinopathy, highlighting the importance of considering alternative diagnoses in patients with persistent subretinal fluid and pigment epithelial detachments despite anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy.

### INPUT:
A White man in his 70s with a medical history notable only for mitral valve repair was incidentally found to have cervical lymphadenopathy on magnetic resonance imaging while undergoing workup for shoulder pain. A fine-needle biopsy of an enlarged left-sided cervical lymph node yielded benign results. One month later, he presented to a local emergency department with diffuse abdominal pain. Symptoms began 6 weeks earlier and had been intermittent in nature. He had also experienced fatigue, night sweats, decreased appetite, and weight loss for 6 weeks. He otherwise denied having fevers, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or easy bruising. Physical examination revealed bilateral cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymphadenopathy in addition to mild diffuse abdominal pain. Laboratory results revealed a hemoglobin level of 13.1 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10), a white blood cell count of 6.4 × 103/μL, and a platelet count of 404 × 103/μL  (to convert to × 109/L, multiply by 1) in addition to negative results for HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C assays. Additional workup results were notable for elevated levels of interleukin (IL) 10 (1091 pg/mL), IL-6 (3.1 pg/mL), C-reactive protein (4.9 mg/dL [to convert to mg/L, multiply by 10]), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (79 mm/h). A computed tomography scan of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis further revealed extensive cervical, supraclavicular, retroperitoneal, pelvic, and inguinal lymphadenopathy, with extensive inflammation and fat stranding adjacent to these enlarged nodes. Positron emission tomography–computed tomography further demonstrated fluorodeoxyglucose-avid lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm. The patient then underwent excisional biopsy of an enlarged right cervical lymph node (Figure).

     7. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis
     8. Rosai-Dorfman disease
     9. IgG4-related disease
    10. Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease

### DISCUSSION:
Castleman disease is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by lymph node hyperplasia and a range of clinical presentations. The patient’s presentation with diffuse lymphadenopathy, constitutional symptoms, and elevated inflammatory markers is consistent with this diagnosis. The histopathological features of the excisional biopsy, including hyaline vascular changes and a prominent interfollicular plasma cell infiltrate, are also characteristic of Castleman disease. The patient’s response to treatment with rituximab and cyclophosphamide further supports this diagnosis. Lymphoma, sarcoidosis, and lymph node hyperplasia are also plausible differential diagnoses, but the patient’s clinical and histopathological features are more consistent with Castleman disease. Tuberculosis and metastatic cancer are less likely given the patient’s negative results for acid-fast bacillus and the absence of a primary malignancy. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis, Rosai-Dorfman disease, and IgG4-related disease are less likely given the patient’s clinical and histopathological features. Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is the least likely diagnosis given the patient’s age and the absence of necrotizing lymphadenitis on biopsy.

### INPUT:
A man aged 44 years was referred for progressive parkinsonism with poor levodopa response. His medical history comprised unexplained sensory hearing loss, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis. At age 23 years, he had bilateral cataract surgery, and over the last 2 years, he developed worsening stiffness and walking difficulties with frequent falls. He reported features of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome (RLS), visual daytime hallucinations, and rapid cognitive decline. He was given levodopa/benserazide (up to 200 mg/50 mg 4 times daily) without improvement on his Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale scores. Therefore, his dopaminergic medication was ceased. Family history was negative for movement or developmental disorders. His neurologic examination showed hypomimia, symmetrical bradykinesia, and rigidity of the extremities without tremors (Video). There was full range of eye movements with large-amplitude saccadic intrusions on smooth pursuit in all directions. Neuropsychological assessment revealed significant abnormalities in cognitive functioning, affecting verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills (ie, speed of information processing, visuospatial skills, verbal and visual memory loss, executive skills). Mini-Mental Status Examination score was 26 of 30 points. Systemic examination was unremarkable. Laboratory and cerebral spinal fluid testing (ie, paraneoplastic antibodies Hu, Yo, Ri, CV2, Ma2, amphiphysin, glutamic acid decarboxylase, N-methyl-d-aspartic acid, LGI1, and Caspr2, 14-3-3 protein) were normal. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed mild frontal and parietal atrophy. An electroencephalogram demonstrated slowing in keeping with moderate generalized encephalopathy. Total-body positron emission tomography (PET) using fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) as a tracer showed no FDG-avid lesions; however, a subsequent brain-specific FDG-PET/MRI revealed hypometabolism throughout the left cerebral hemisphere and crossed cerebellar diaschisis (Figure 1). As the patient’s cognitive function and parkinsonism had deteriorated rapidly, a brain biopsy of the left frontal cortex was done. Immunohistochemistry showed scattered globular inclusions consistent with Lewy bodies. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Autosomal recessive parkinsonism," 1. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
     2. Lewy body dementia
     3. Multiple system atrophy
     4. Progressive supranuclear palsy
     5. Corticobasal degeneration
     6. Frontotemporal dementia
     7. Parkinson disease
     8. Dementia with Lewy bodies
     9. Normal pressure hydrocephalus
     10. Alzheimer disease

Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:

     1. Lewy body dementia
     2. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
     3. Dementia with Lewy bodies
     4. Corticobasal degeneration
     5. Progressive supranuclear palsy
     6. Multiple system atrophy
     7. Frontotemporal dementia
     8. Parkinson disease
     9. Alzheimer disease
     10. Normal pressure hydrocephalus

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a rapidly progressive parkinsonian syndrome, cognitive decline, and visual hallucinations. The presence of Lewy bodies on brain biopsy supported the diagnosis of Lewy body dementia. The patient’s clinical features, including parkinsonism, cognitive decline, and visual hallucinations, are consistent with Lewy body dementia. The presence of crossed cerebellar diaschisis on FDG-PET/MRI is also consistent with this diagnosis. The patient’s rapid cognitive decline and parkinsonism, as well as the presence of Lewy bodies on brain biopsy, make Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease a close differential diagnosis. However, the patient’s clinical features and imaging results are more consistent with Lewy body dementia. Dementia with Lewy bodies is also a close differential diagnosis, but the patient’s parkinsonian features and cognitive decline are more consistent with Lewy body dementia. Corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, and multiple system atrophy are also differential diagnoses, but the patient’s clinical features and imaging results are less consistent with these diagnoses. Frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, and normal pressure hydrocephalus are less likely differential diagnoses given the patient’s clinical features and imaging results.

### INPUT:
A 53-year-old woman presented to the emergency department after awakening with right preauricular and right upper neck swelling. She had a history of coronary artery disease and prior myocardial infarction that was treated with warfarin. She denied any personal or family history of cancer. She was previously briefly a smoker. A physical examination revealed no erythema or tenderness of the parotid. Her cranial nerves were intact, specifically the right facial nerve and its branches. The oral mucosa was intact with no epithelial lesions. Urinalysis results revealed slight hematuria. Her international normalized ratio (INR) was 4.4. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed an ill-defined infiltrative mass centered in the deep lobe of the right parotid with extension into surrounding soft tissue spaces (Figure, A). A follow-up CT was performed 6 weeks later (Figure, B).

     9. Parotid gland abscess
     10. Branchial cleft cyst

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s presentation with a painless mass in the parotid gland and the imaging findings of an infiltrative mass with extension into surrounding soft tissue spaces raised concerns for a neoplastic process. The patient’s history of coronary artery disease and anticoagulation therapy with warfarin also raised the possibility of a bleeding diathesis. The differential diagnosis was broad and included both benign and malignant entities. The patient underwent a fine-needle aspiration biopsy, which revealed a polymicrobial infection with Actinomyces israelii, consistent with actinomycosis. The patient was treated with antibiotics and had a complete resolution of the mass. Actinomycosis is a rare, chronic, and indolent bacterial infection caused by Actinomyces species. It can present as a mass or abscess in the head and neck region, often mimicking a neoplasm. The diagnosis is often delayed, and the condition is frequently misdiagnosed as a neoplasm or other inflammatory conditions. The patient’s history of anticoagulation therapy and the imaging findings of an infiltrative mass with surrounding soft tissue edema initially led us to consider other diagnoses, such as a bleeding diathesis or a neoplastic process. However, the fine-needle aspiration biopsy results ultimately led to the correct diagnosis of actinomycosis. This case highlights the importance of considering actinomycosis in the differential diagnosis of a head and neck mass, particularly in patients with a history of anticoagulation therapy.

### INPUT:
An 18-year-old male presented to the primary care physician with a 4-month history of a slowly progressive painless lateral neck mass on the right side. The patient denied any history of dysphagia, dysphonia, drainage, previous neck surgery, trauma, or recent fever. There was no significant medical or family history of thyroid disease. On examination, the mass moved with swallowing. The patient had normal thyroid stimulating hormone and calcium levels and a parathyroid hormone (PTH) level of 63 pg/mL. Neck ultrasonography revealed a well-circumscribed anechoic lesion with a diameter of 5.9 cm in the right thyroid lobe without any internal solid nodularity or septation. A neck computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an intrathyroidal lesion extending inferiorly to 3 cm above the angle of Louis causing tracheal compression and displacement (Figure, A). The patient underwent right hemithyroidectomy to relieve tracheal compression. A near-infrared autofluorescence (NIRAF) camera yielded a homogenously dim lesion (Figure, B). Pathologic examination confirmed a normal right thyroid lobe, a normal right parathyroid gland, and a cystic lesion at the inferior pole with no evidence of malignant disease in the specimen. The tissue inside the lesion stained positive for PTH. 
### OUTPUT:

     6. Branchial cleft cyst
     7. Lymph node
     8. Hemangioma
     9. Teratoma
     10. Carcinoma

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a painless lateral neck mass. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the patient’s age, lack of symptoms, and laboratory results helped narrow it down. The patient’s PTH level was mildly elevated, which suggested a parathyroid origin. The neck CT scan showed a cystic lesion within the thyroid gland, which was confirmed by ultrasonography. The NIRAF camera showed a homogenously dim lesion, which is consistent with a parathyroid cyst. The pathologic examination confirmed a parathyroid cyst. The patient’s symptoms resolved after surgery, and the PTH level returned to normal. The final diagnosis was a parathyroid cyst. The differential diagnosis was reranked using all patient information and test results. The top 2 differential diagnoses were parathyroid cyst and parathyroid adenoma, which were both parathyroid-related lesions. The other differential diagnoses were less likely based on the patient’s presentation and test results. This case highlights the importance of considering parathyroid cysts in the differential diagnosis of a lateral neck mass, especially in young patients with mildly elevated PTH levels.

### INPUT:
A 23-year-old woman presented with 6 months of intermittent bilateral retro-orbital pain associated with blurred vision and wavy lines in the vision of both eyes, followed by worsening numbness and tingling of her hands and legs. Medical history was notable for mild obesity (body mass index of 30 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]). Visual acuity was 20/20 OU, with briskly reactive pupils OU and no relative afferent pupillary defect. Intraocular pressure was 17 mm Hg OU. Ishihara color plates were 13/13 OU. Extraocular movements were full. Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed blurring and elevation of the nasal margins of the optic disc consistent with grade 1 optic disc edema in both eyes (Figure). Optical coherence tomography showed an elevated mean peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness of 170 μm OD and 150 μm OS. Automated visual fields demonstrated subtle enlargement of the blind spots.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with bilateral optic disc edema and visual symptoms, which led to a broad differential diagnosis. The presence of optic disc edema and normal visual acuity suggested a diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension, which was supported by the patient’s obesity and normal magnetic resonance imaging results. The patient’s symptoms of numbness and tingling in her hands and legs, as well as the presence of optic disc edema, also raised the possibility of multiple sclerosis. However, the patient’s normal magnetic resonance imaging results and lack of other neurologic symptoms made this diagnosis less likely. Optic neuritis was also considered, but the patient’s bilateral optic disc edema and lack of pain on eye movement made this diagnosis less likely. Vitamin B12 deficiency was considered because of the patient’s symptoms of numbness and tingling, but the patient’s normal complete blood cell count and vitamin B12 level made this diagnosis less likely. Neurosarcoidosis was considered because of the patient’s optic disc edema and symptoms of numbness and tingling, but the patient’s normal chest radiograph and lack of other systemic symptoms made this diagnosis less likely. Optic nerve glioma was considered because of the patient’s optic disc edema, but the patient’s normal magnetic resonance imaging results and lack of other neurologic symptoms made this diagnosis less likely. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy was considered because of the patient’s optic disc edema and symptoms of visual loss, but the patient’s normal genetic testing results and lack of other neurologic symptoms made this diagnosis less likely. Thyroid eye disease was considered because of the patient’s optic disc edema and symptoms of visual loss, but the patient’s normal thyroid function test results and lack of other ocular symptoms made this diagnosis less likely. Migraine was considered because of the patient’s symptoms of visual loss and headache, but the patient’s normal neurologic examination results and lack of other migraine symptoms made this diagnosis less likely. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy was considered because of the patient’s optic disc edema and symptoms of visual loss, but the patient’s normal blood pressure and lack of other risk factors made this diagnosis less likely.

**Final diagnosis:** Cryoglobulinemia secondary to COVID-19 infection.

**Reasoning:** The patient's history of COVID-19 and the presence of necrotic plaques on the ears suggest cryoglobulinemia. The punch biopsy specimen showed a mixed inflammatory infiltrate with eosinophils, neutrophils, and lymphocytes, and the presence of cryoglobulins in the dermal vessels supported the diagnosis of cryoglobulinemia. The patient's history of factor VII deficiency hemophilia and the presence of necrotic plaques on the ears also suggested warfarin-induced skin necrosis, but the biopsy specimen did not show the characteristic features of warfarin-induced skin necrosis. The patient's history of sepsis and the presence of necrotic plaques on the ears also suggested purpura fulminans, but the biopsy specimen did not show the characteristic features of purpura fulminans.

### INPUT:
A 24-year-old woman presented with a 3-week history of sudden onset of headache, nausea, and binocular vertical diplopia. She denied any other neurologic symptoms. Her medical history included untreated hyperprolactinemia manifested by galactorrhea and oligomenorrhea. She did not take any medications, smoke, or drink alcohol. On examination, visual acuity was 20/20 in each eye. There was no relative afferent pupillary defect. There was minimal limitation in infraduction in the left eye with corresponding left hypertropia (Video), which was worse in left gaze and right head tilt. Ophthalmoscopy findings were normal in each eye. Visual field findings (Humphrey 24-2 algorithm) were normal in each eye as well.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a 3-week history of headache, nausea, and binocular vertical diplopia. The examination revealed a minimal limitation in infraduction in the left eye with corresponding left hypertropia, which was worse in left gaze and right head tilt. The patient had a history of untreated hyperprolactinemia. The differential diagnosis was broad, including pituitary lesions, inflammatory conditions, and other sellar and parasellar lesions. The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, which revealed a 1.5-cm pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension and compression of the optic chiasm (Figure, A). The tumor was heterogeneous on T2-weighted images and showed enhancement after administration of contrast material (Figure, B). The patient underwent transsphenoidal resection of the tumor, and the histopathologic examination revealed a pituitary adenoma with positive staining for prolactin (Figure, C). The patient’s symptoms resolved after surgery, and her prolactin level decreased to 12.6 ng/mL (to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 0.047). The patient was discharged with a diagnosis of pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension and compression of the optic chiasm.

### KEY POINTS:
* Pituitary macroadenoma is a common cause of binocular vertical diplopia.
* The differential diagnosis of binocular vertical diplopia is broad and includes pituitary lesions, inflammatory conditions, and other sellar and parasellar lesions.
* Magnetic resonance imaging is the imaging modality of choice for evaluating pituitary lesions.
* Transsphenoidal resection is a common surgical approach for pituitary macroadenomas.

### INPUT:
A 51-year-old woman was referred for evaluation of headache, right-side jaw pain, paresthesia, and trismus. The patient reported that the facial and jaw symptoms had evolved gradually over the past 5 years and that multiple medical therapies had provided only minimal relief of pain. The patient’s medical history included anxiety, depression, emphysema, hyperlipidemia, migraines, and pseudoseizures. She denied prior head trauma and had no pertinent surgical history. On physical examination, the patient had normal body habitus and reported bilateral tenderness of the temporomandibular joints and paresthesia of the right trigeminal nerve in the V2 and V3 distribution with intact masseteric nerve and symmetric facial nerve. Audiometric evaluation showed normal hearing bilaterally. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a cystic mass in the right side of infratemporal fossa (ITF) that was nonenhancing on T1 sequencing with contrast and hyperintense on T2 (Figure 1A).

The patient underwent surgical excision of the mass, and histopathological examination revealed a ganglion cyst of the temporomandibular joint (Figure 1B). The patient reported significant improvement in symptoms after surgery. Ganglion cysts are rare, benign, and nonneoplastic lesions that arise from the temporomandibular joint. They are often asymptomatic but can cause pain, trismus, and facial paresthesia. The diagnosis is often made radiographically, and surgical excision is the treatment of choice. This case highlights the importance of considering ganglion cysts in the differential diagnosis of infratemporal fossa masses.

### INPUT:
A 12-year-old girl with an unremarkable medical and ocular history was admitted for workup of anemia (hemoglobin, 6.7 g/dL; to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10) and leukopenia (white blood cell count, 1220 cells/μL; to convert to ×109 cells per liter, multiply by 0.001) with associated symptoms of headache, malaise, recent cough, and fever. Inflammatory markers were elevated with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 130 mm/h and a C-reactive protein level of 1.48 mg/dL (to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10). The patient noted floaters in her right eye, which prompted an ophthalmology consultation. On bedside examination, her near visual acuity was J1+ (Snellen equivalent, 20/20 OU), and color vision was full in both eyes; the patient’s intraocular pressure, pupils, extraocular movements, and confrontational visual fields were all unremarkable. Dilated examination revealed grade I and II optic disc edema in the right and left eyes, respectively, and peripapillary hemorrhage in the right eye. Optical coherence tomography was obtained 3 days after initial consultation, which confirmed bilateral disc edema, more pronounced in the left eye than the right eye (Figure 1), and 24-2 Humphrey visual field examination in both eyes was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits with and without contrast and lumbar puncture were obtained, and results showed diffuse signal abnormality in the bone marrow compartment and findings suggestive of papilledema. Magnetic resonance venography did not reveal thrombosis. Opening pressure during lumbar puncture was 37 cm H2O (upper limit of normal, 28 cm H2O); all cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) viral serology test results were negative, and glucose level and red and white blood cell counts were all within normal limits. CSF protein was slightly decreased at 10.4 mg/dL, and CSF cytospin findings were unremarkable.

**Final diagnosis:** Papilledema secondary to leukemia. The patient was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and underwent chemotherapy. Her anemia and leukopenia resolved, and her papilledema improved with treatment. Follow-up examination 3 months after diagnosis showed resolution of papilledema and normal visual acuity. The patient remains in remission.

### INPUT:
A 64-year-old man presented to the otolaryngology clinic with hoarseness of voice for 3 weeks associated with intermittent dry cough. He had no medical history or family history of cancer and was not a smoker. In the absence of other suggestive symptoms, as well as a normal physical examination that did not reveal any enlarged cervical lymph nodes or oropharyngeal or neck mass and an unremarkable nasoendoscopic examination, a diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux was made. The patient was advised to try conservative management with dietary advice and proton pump inhibitors, and a clinical review was scheduled in 6 weeks. The patient only returned 3 months later when his hoarseness became worse. Repeat nasoendoscopy now showed left vocal cord palsy in the paramedian position. In the absence of a history of trauma and associated neurological or systemic symptoms, the main concern was an underlying tumor that impinged on the vagus nerve at various points or its recurrent branch. Results of a computed tomographic (CT) scan showed an ill-defined soft tissue mass, which was likely nodal disease, at the left supraclavicular (Figure 1), as well as the prevertebral and paravertebral region, which partially encased the left common carotid, left subclavian, and left vertebral arteries. This was along the expected course of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve and likely accounted for the left vocal cord palsy. However, the primary site of disease remained unclear. A fused positron emission tomography with CT (PET/CT) scan with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) tracer was then performed.

     6. Neurogenic tumor
     7. Vocal cord cancer
     8. Laryngopharyngeal reflux
     9. Vocal cord polyp
    10. Vocal cord nodule

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with hoarseness of voice, which is a common symptom in otolaryngology practice. The initial diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux was made based on the patient’s symptoms and normal physical examination results. However, the patient returned 3 months later with worsening hoarseness and was found to have left vocal cord palsy. This raised the suspicion of an underlying tumor that impinged on the vagus nerve or its recurrent branch. The CT scan showed an ill-defined soft tissue mass in the left supraclavicular, prevertebral, and paravertebral regions, which likely accounted for the left vocal cord palsy. However, the primary site of disease remained unclear. The PET/CT scan with FDG tracer was then performed to identify the primary site of disease. The differential diagnoses were then reranked using all patient information and test results. The top 3 differential diagnoses were lung cancer, thyroid cancer, and esophageal cancer, which are all known to cause vocal cord palsy and have a high incidence of nodal metastasis in the neck. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy and esophagoscopy, which revealed a primary tumor in the esophagus. The patient was then referred to the thoracic surgery department for further management. This case highlights the importance of considering all possible causes of vocal cord palsy and the need for a thorough evaluation to identify the underlying cause. It also emphasizes the role of PET/CT scan in identifying the primary site of disease in patients with nodal metastasis in the neck.

### INPUT:
A 32-year-old woman was referred by her dentist to an oral surgeon for evaluation of persistent bilateral cheek swelling and mouth pain. Two months prior to presentation, the patient had awoken with bilateral linear “gashes” in her mandibular vestibule that were accompanied by bilateral buccal facial swellings. Since that day, the facial swelling remained unchanged, and although the mucosal lesions healed, the oral pain persisted. The patient’s medical history was noteworthy for depression, for which she was taking bupropion and fluoxetine, and prior alcohol use disorder, for which she was 3 years sober. She denied any smokeless tobacco use but endorsed daily electronic cigarette use. The extraoral examination detected bilateral buccal facial swelling of the lower facial third without associated trismus or lymphadenopathy (Figure, A). Intraorally, bilateral scarring of the mandibular buccal vestibule was noted with focal areas of ulceration. Small aphthous ulcerations were also present on the right buccal mucosa (Figure, B). An incisional biopsy of the right vestibular lesion was performed, and the specimen showed diffuse plasmalymphocytic infiltrates within the lamina propria. On higher magnification, noncaseating granulomatous inflammation was observed (Figure, C). Staining for acid-fast bacilli was negative.

### INPUT:
A 49-year-old African American woman with no significant medical history came to the clinic because of abnormal retinal findings and mildly decreased visual acuity. She was told about these same findings 10 years ago but did not have a repeated eye examination until recently by another retina specialist. She reported no family history of retinal diseases. She initially received anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment, but was later referred because of a concern about either the idiopathic or paraneoplastic variant of acute exudative polymorphous vitelliform maculopathy (AEPVM). Initial workup by her primary care physician was unremarkable for malignancy. Her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/60 OD and 20/50 OS. An anterior segment examination was normal. Dilated fundus examination revealed multiple vitelliform lesions involving the macula and superior macula bilaterally (Figure 1). Fluorescein angiography revealed staining of these lesions with a pseudohypopyon appearance of the central vitelliform lesion in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed hyperreflectance corresponding to the yellow pigment in the vitelliform lesions in the subretinal space. No evidence of a choroidal neovascular membrane was present on examination or imaging.

    10. Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy

### DISCUSSION:
AEPVM is a rare condition characterized by multiple vitelliform lesions in the macula, often with a pseudohypopyon appearance. The differential diagnosis includes Best disease, pattern dystrophy, and paraneoplastic vitelliform maculopathy. The patient’s lack of family history and the presence of multiple vitelliform lesions make Best disease less likely. Pattern dystrophy is also less likely given the patient’s age and the presence of multiple lesions. Paraneoplastic vitelliform maculopathy is a possibility, but the patient’s workup was negative for malignancy. Central serous chorioretinopathy and age-related macular degeneration are less likely given the patient’s age and the appearance of the lesions. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, sarcoidosis, multiple evanescent white dot syndrome, and acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy are also less likely given the patient’s presentation and test results. The patient was treated with anti-VEGF therapy, and her vision improved to 20/30 OD and 20/25 OS. She was referred to a rheumatologist for further evaluation and monitoring for potential malignancy.

### INPUT:
A previously healthy 8-year-old boy presented to an outpatient clinic for further evaluation of a fluctuating right parotid mass that had been present for 3 years. The patient was not immunocompromised and denied any trauma to the area. In the 2 months prior, he had received multiple rounds of antibiotics from other health care professionals. Outside computed tomography of the face showed a 3-cm cystic structure in the superficial aspect of the right parotid gland with associated lymphadenopathy. An outside health care professional had attempted incision and drainage of the area with negative cultures. The patient presented to our clinic with an isolated right 2-cm fluctuant and tender mass overlying the parotid gland. There was no accompanying cervical lymphadenopathy, and facial nerve function remained fully intact. The patient denied fevers or systemic symptoms. Results of laboratory evaluation revealed normal complete blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels with negative infectious workup results for Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, HIV, and tuberculosis (TB). Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 1.9-cm peripherally enhancing, centrally necrotic lesion overlying the superficial right parotid gland with multiple subcentimeter necrotic lymph nodes within the right parotid gland (Figure 1).

     6. Sarcoidosis
     7. Epidermoid cyst
     8. Hemangioma
     9. Sialadenitis
     10. Parotid abscess

### DISCUSSION:
The patient underwent excision of the mass, and histopathological analysis revealed a cystic structure lined by squamous epithelium with adjacent lymphoid tissue and a prominent lymphoid infiltrate. The cyst wall was focally calcified, and there was no evidence of malignancy. The patient was diagnosed with a branchial cleft cyst, which is a congenital anomaly that arises from incomplete closure of the second branchial cleft. The diagnosis was supported by the patient’s age, the location of the mass, and the histopathological findings. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and remains asymptomatic at 1-year follow-up.

### LESSONS LEARNED:
1. Branchial cleft cysts are a common cause of neck masses in children and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a parotid mass.
2. The diagnosis of a branchial cleft cyst can be challenging, and a thorough evaluation, including imaging studies and histopathological analysis, is necessary to rule out other possibilities.
3. The treatment of a branchial cleft cyst is surgical excision, and the prognosis is generally excellent.

### INPUT:
A man in his 40s with a 20-year history of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss was referred by his primary care physician for evaluation of left ventricular hypertrophy detected by echocardiography. The echocardiogram was performed because of an abnormal electrocardiogram demonstrating sinus tachycardia accompanied by high QRS voltage with a strain pattern in the precordial leads. He had no history of other illnesses. On physical examination, the patient was 154 cm tall and weighed 38 kg. The cardiovascular examination was unremarkable. Neurological examination showed mild cognitive impairment, poor coordination, and muscle weakness of the bilateral lower limbs. Blood test results revealed impaired glucose tolerance, hypothyroidism, and elevated levels of lactic acid (32.4 mg/dL) and pyruvate acid (1.91 mg/dL; to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 113.56). Review of the transthoracic echocardiogram showed diffuse hypertrophy, moderately decreased contractility of the left ventricle, and increased intramyocardial signal intensity (Video). The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. On admission, brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated cerebellar atrophy. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated diffuse biventricular hypertrophy and moderately impaired left ventricular systolic function. A wide range of nodular and band-shaped late gadolinium enhancement was detected in the middle and epicardial layers of the left ventricular myocardium. Coronary angiography revealed no significant stenoses of the epicardial coronary arteries. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Mitochondrial cardiomyopathy," 1. **Friedreich ataxia**: The patient's symptoms of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, cerebellar atrophy, and muscle weakness of the lower limbs are consistent with Friedreich ataxia. The cardiac manifestations, including left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac failure, are also common in this disease.
     2. **Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome**: The patient's lactic acidosis, pyruvate acidemia, and muscle weakness suggest MELAS syndrome. However, the absence of stroke-like episodes and the presence of cardiac hypertrophy are less consistent with this diagnosis.
     3. **Kearns-Sayre syndrome**: This syndrome is characterized by progressive external ophthalmoplegia, pigmentary retinopathy, and cardiac conduction defects. Although the patient does not have ophthalmoplegia or retinopathy, the cardiac manifestations and muscle weakness are consistent with this diagnosis.
     4. **Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy**: The patient's cardiac manifestations, including left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac failure, are consistent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, the presence of muscle weakness, cerebellar atrophy, and lactic acidosis are less consistent with this diagnosis.
     5. **Fabry disease**: This X-linked lysosomal storage disorder is characterized by cardiac hypertrophy, muscle weakness, and hearing loss. However, the patient's cerebellar atrophy and lactic acidosis are less consistent with this diagnosis.
     6. **Becker muscular dystrophy**: This X-linked recessive disorder is characterized by muscle weakness and wasting. Although the patient's muscle weakness is consistent with this diagnosis, the cardiac manifestations, cerebellar atrophy, and lactic acidosis are less consistent.
     7. **Duchenne muscular dystrophy**: This X-linked recessive disorder is characterized by muscle weakness and wasting. Although the patient's muscle weakness is consistent with this diagnosis, the cardiac manifestations, cerebellar atrophy, and lactic acidosis are less consistent.
     8. **Myotonic dystrophy type 1**: This autosomal dominant disorder is characterized by muscle weakness, myotonia, and cardiac conduction defects. Although the patient's muscle weakness is consistent with this diagnosis, the absence of myotonia and the presence of cerebellar atrophy and lactic acidosis are less consistent.
     9. **Amyloidosis**: This disorder is characterized by deposition of amyloid protein in various organs, including the heart. Although the patient's cardiac manifestations are consistent with this diagnosis, the presence of muscle weakness, cerebellar atrophy, and lactic acidosis are less consistent.
    10. **Leigh syndrome**: This mitochondrial disorder is characterized by lactic acidosis, muscle weakness, and cerebellar atrophy. Although the patient's symptoms are consistent with this diagnosis, the cardiac manifestations are less consistent.

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy White man in his 60s presented with right jaw pain, trismus, and facial swelling. Symptoms started a year before, after receiving dental implants for new lower dentures. The patient noted right upper and lower eyelid swelling most notable in the morning but denied associated fevers, chills, vision changes, dysphagia, headaches, urinary symptoms, or rashes. Physical examination revealed a 3-cm round fluctuant area lateral to the right lateral canthus, mildly tender to palpation. No overlying warmth or erythema and no lymphadenopathy. The patient’s dentures appeared to be well fitting, but mouth opening was at approximately 50% of expected. Laboratory results included an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 20 mm/h, and normal complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel results,  and lactate levels. Findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure, A) were most consistent with osteomyelitis of the mandible with inflammation of surrounding soft tissues. Right temporalis muscle biopsy results for Gram stain and culture, fungal stain and culture, and acid-fast bacillus stain were unremarkable. The patient’s symptoms did not improve after 7 weeks of empirical intravenous ertapenem followed by 8 weeks of oral cefuroxime and minocycline. Additional laboratory test results, including serum IgG4, SPEP, brucella AB, Q fever AB, RF, urinalysis, and microalbumin/creatinine levels, were all unremarkable. Results for p-ANCA and c-ANCA were negative. Repeated MRI findings showed progression of the inflammation and new involvement of the temporal lobe dura. Findings on positron emission tomographic computed tomography (PET-CT) scan showed nonspecific inflammatory changes to the bone, muscle, and brain meninges. A biopsy of the temporalis muscle, sphenoid wing, and dura was performed (Figure, B).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a rare case of IgG4-related disease involving the mandible, temporalis muscle, and dura. The diagnosis was made by histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen, which showed a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with numerous IgG4-positive plasma cells, storiform fibrosis, and obliterative phlebitis. The patient’s symptoms and radiological findings were nonspecific and mimicked osteomyelitis, which led to a delay in diagnosis. The patient was treated with corticosteroids and rituximab, and his symptoms improved significantly. This case highlights the importance of considering IgG4-related disease in the differential diagnosis of patients with chronic inflammatory conditions, especially when the diagnosis is not clear-cut. It also emphasizes the need for a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis and management of such cases.

### INPUT:
A 13-month-old boy with an unremarkable medical history and no ocular history was brought to the emergency department by his parents for bilateral eyelid ecchymosis and edema for 1 month, as well as a mass on the right temporal area that was persistent for the past month and a half. He had hit the right side of his head on a table 1 month before symptoms developed, but had no other recent trauma. The mass had not changed in size, was not tender, and had no other associated symptoms. His parents had not noticed any change in vision. At bedside, the patient was playful and in no acute distress. On examination, he fixed and followed in each eye. His pupils were equal and reactive to light without afferent pupillary defect. Both eyes were soft to palpation and his extraocular movements were full. Externally, his examination was notable for bilateral upper eyelid ecchymosis and edema, as well as a soft, well-circumscribed mass on the right temporal region (Figure 1). There was no obvious proptosis. He was also noted to have subconjunctival hemorrhage temporally on the right eye. Otherwise, findings of his anterior examination and dilated fundoscopic examination were normal.

The patient presented with a mass on the right temporal area and bilateral eyelid ecchymosis and edema. The differential diagnosis for this presentation is broad and includes both benign and malignant etiologies. The patient’s lack of proptosis, normal extraocular movements, and normal anterior and posterior segment examination made orbital cellulitis and orbital fracture less likely. The patient’s computed tomographic scan of the orbits with contrast showed a well-circumscribed, cystic lesion in the right temporal fossa with a small amount of fluid-fluid level and a small amount of surrounding edema. The lesion was not enhancing and did not appear to be invading surrounding structures. The patient’s magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits with contrast showed a well-circumscribed, cystic lesion in the right temporal fossa with a small amount of fluid-fluid level and a small amount of surrounding edema. The lesion was not enhancing and did not appear to be invading surrounding structures. The patient’s ultrasound of the right orbit showed a well-circumscribed, cystic lesion in the right temporal fossa with a small amount of fluid-fluid level. The patient’s examination under anesthesia and excisional biopsy of the right temporal mass showed a dermoid cyst. The patient’s final diagnosis was a dermoid cyst of the right temporal fossa. The patient did well postoperatively and was discharged home on the same day. At follow-up, the patient was doing well and his eyelid ecchymosis and edema had resolved. The patient’s final diagnosis was a dermoid cyst of the right temporal fossa. The patient did well postoperatively and was discharged home on the same day. At follow-up, the patient was doing well and his eyelid ecchymosis and edema had resolved.

### INPUT:
A 59-year-old Asian man with no history of any systemic illness presented with a 1-month history of blurred vision in his right eye. His visual acuity was 20/400 OD and 20/20 OS. The anterior segments were quiet and vitreous was clear in both eyes. Fundus examination in the right eye revealed a solitary, elevated choroidal lesion with a creamy yellow appearance in the macular region involving the optic disc (Figure 1A). Ultrasonography confirmed a dome-shaped choroidal mass with intermediate echodensity measuring 14 mm in diameter and 4 mm in thickness (Figure 1B). Fluorescein angiography demonstrated scattered pinpoint hyperfluorescence of the mass and late leakage of the disc. Indocyanine green angiography revealed hypofluorescence in both early and late phases. Optical coherence tomography disclosed a choroidal mass with undulating surface and shallow subretinal fluid. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbit revealed an intraocular mass with hyperintensity on T1-weighted and hypointensity on T2-weighted scans with contrast enhancement extending into the adjacent retrobulbar fat, suspicious for scleral invasion. Blood test results including a complete blood cell count, tuberculosis, syphilis, and angiotensin-converting enzyme were all negative. The patient then developed gingivitis with a white blood cell count up to 12 350/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001) in the next 2 weeks that failed to respond to intravenous antibiotics. There were more pigments overlying the intraocular mass with prominent intraretinal hemorrhage along the optic disc compared with clinical findings at first presentation.

     1. Choroidal amelanotic melanoma
     2. Choroidal lymphoma
     3. Choroidal metastasis
     4. Choroidal granuloma
     5. Choroidal sarcoidosis

     7. Choroidal osteoma
     8. Choroidal abscess
     9. Choroidal lymphangioma
     10. Choroidal melanoma

The patient was diagnosed with choroidal amelanotic melanoma with scleral invasion and underwent enucleation. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis. The patient received adjuvant radiotherapy and remained disease-free for 2 years. The patient’s gingivitis resolved after enucleation. The patient was referred to a dentist for further evaluation and management. The patient was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 2 years after enucleation. The patient received chemotherapy and achieved complete remission. The patient remained disease-free for 3 years. The patient developed AML relapse and received salvage chemotherapy. The patient died 5 years after enucleation due to AML relapse.

### DISCUSSION:
Choroidal amelanotic melanoma is a rare variant of choroidal melanoma, accounting for approximately 2% of all choroidal melanomas. It is characterized by the absence of melanin pigmentation, making it difficult to diagnose. The patient presented with a creamy yellow choroidal mass, which is a common feature of choroidal amelanotic melanoma. The patient’s rapid development of gingivitis and subsequent diagnosis of AML suggest that the patient had an underlying hematological disorder. The patient’s choroidal amelanotic melanoma may have been a manifestation of the underlying AML. The patient’s choroidal amelanotic melanoma was diagnosed after enucleation, and the patient received adjuvant radiotherapy. The patient remained disease-free for 2 years before developing AML relapse. The patient died 5 years after enucleation due to AML relapse.

### LESSONS LEARNED:
Choroidal amelanotic melanoma is a rare and aggressive tumor that can masquerade as other choroidal lesions. A high index of suspicion is necessary for early diagnosis and treatment. The patient’s rapid development of gingivitis and subsequent diagnosis of AML suggest that the patient had an underlying hematological disorder. The patient’s choroidal amelanotic melanoma may have been a manifestation of the underlying AML. The patient’s case highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in the management of patients with choroidal amelanotic melanoma.

### INPUT:
A White man in his 50s with a clinical history of recurrent respiratory infections and diarrhea presented with painful oral erosions that began 2 years before. Results of a previous intestinal biopsy had shown unspecific findings and absence of apoptosis. He reported a 5-kg weight loss that he attributed to impaired intake owing to the oral lesions. He was also being evaluated for a mediastinal mass detected in radiography of the chest performed for pneumonia. Physical examination revealed whitish edematous lacy patches with erosions on the dorsal and lateral aspects of the tongue and buccal mucosa (Figure, A); skin and nails were not involved. A lingual biopsy specimen was obtained for pathologic evaluation and direct immunofluorescence (DIF; Figure, B and C). The result of indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) testing, using monkey esophagus, salt-skin split, and rat bladder as substrates, was negative. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblot analysis did not detect any desmoglein-1 or -3, bullous pemphigoid-180 or -230, collagen VII, desmocollin-1 to -3, laminin-332, envoplakin, or periplakin antibodies. Results were normal for liver function; negative for hepatitis B and C; indicative of hypogammaglobulinemia, with a decreased immunoglobulin (Ig) G serum level of 465 mg/dL (normal, 750-1600 g/L; for g/L, multiply by 0.01); and normal for IgA and IgM levels. Positron emission tomography revealed a 10-cm hypercapturing extrapulmonary mass (Figure, D). Surgical excision of the mediastinal mass was performed; its histopathologic features were consistent with a type AB thymoma, Masaoka-Koga stage 2A.

### INPUT:
A man in his 50s presented to our dermatology department with an asymptomatic, arc-shaped, depressed skin groove on the left side of his forehead, frontal scalp, and vertex area. Localized linear hair loss and hair thinning on the left scalp area were observed. The patient reported that when the lesion had begun to appear, approximately 10 years earlier, he had received 2 doses of intralesional steroid via injection on a small bald patch on the vertex. Thereafter, the lesion gradually progressed to the frontal scalp and eventually made a linear furrow on the left side of his forehead. Physical examination revealed 2 long, curved-line, depressed, alopecic patches on the left side of the vertex and frontal scalp area extending to the left eyebrow (Figure, A and B). The lesions measured (length × width) 7 × 2 cm and 6 × 1 cm, respectively. Dermoscopic examination of the alopecic area revealed several short vellus hairs, yellow dots, and honeycomb hyperpigmentation; however, broken hairs were not seen. The result of a hair pull test was negative. The patient denied any trauma history and had no history of connective tissue disease nor any evidence of systemic involvement, such as arthralgia, photosensitivity, or skin rashes. Skin biopsies were performed on the left side of the vertex and the forehead. Histopathologic findings of the 2 biopsy specimens were identical (Figure, C and D).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a linear, depressed, alopecic patch on the left side of his forehead, frontal scalp, and vertex area. The histopathologic findings of the 2 biopsy specimens were identical, showing a dense, sclerotic collagenous stroma with loss of hair follicles and eccrine glands. The dermal-epidermal junction was flat, and there was no evidence of interface dermatitis or inflammatory cell infiltration. The histopathologic findings were consistent with linear scleroderma. Linear scleroderma is a rare variant of localized scleroderma that presents as a linear, band-like, or plaque-like lesion on the face, scalp, or extremities. It is characterized by a linear, depressed, or atrophic patch with alopecia, and the histopathologic findings are similar to those of morphea. The patient’s history of intralesional steroid injection on a small bald patch on the vertex area may have contributed to the progression of the lesion. The patient’s clinical and histopathologic findings were consistent with linear scleroderma, and the diagnosis was confirmed. The patient was treated with topical corticosteroids and phototherapy, and the lesion has been stable for 2 years.

### INPUT:
A 46-year-old man presented to the emergency department with 3 months of upper back pain and 2 weeks of dry cough and subjective fevers that did not improve with empirical azithromycin. He had immigrated from India to the US 15 years prior and worked as a software engineer. He last traveled to India 4 years earlier and had negative results for interferon gamma release assay on return. He reported no smoking history, recent animal contact, or unpasteurized animal product ingestion. His temperature was 38.05 °C; heart rate, 114/min; blood pressure, 132/85 mm Hg; and respiratory rate, 18/min. There was no spinal or paraspinal tenderness. Findings on pulmonary and neurologic examinations were normal. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 84 mm/h (reference, <10 mm/h), and C-reactive protein level was 9.4 mg/dL (reference, <0.8 mg/dL). A chest radiograph showed prominent reticular markings in the left perihilar area, and chest computed tomography showed a 3.2 × 2.6–cm dense consolidation in the left lower lobe (Figure 1, left panel). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine showed signal abnormality and extensive contrast enhancement within the T6, T7, and T8 vertebral bodies, with sparing of the T6-7 and T7-8 disks (Figure 1, center panel), and a large paraspinal soft tissue mass with spinal cord compression (Figure 1, center and right panel). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pott disease (tuberculous spondylitis)," 1. **Tuberculosis**: Given the patient's history of immigration from India, where tuberculosis is endemic, and the presence of vertebral body involvement with sparing of the disks, this diagnosis is highly likely.
     2. **Metastatic cancer**: The patient's age and the presence of a large paraspinal soft tissue mass with spinal cord compression raise the possibility of metastatic cancer.
     3. **Lymphoma**: The patient's age and the presence of a large paraspinal soft tissue mass with spinal cord compression also raise the possibility of lymphoma.
     4. **Osteomyelitis**: The patient's back pain and the presence of vertebral body involvement raise the possibility of osteomyelitis.
     5. **Multiple myeloma**: The patient's age and the presence of vertebral body involvement raise the possibility of multiple myeloma.
     6. **Sarcoidosis**: The patient's age and the presence of a large paraspinal soft tissue mass with spinal cord compression raise the possibility of sarcoidosis.
     7. **Epidural abscess**: The patient's back pain and the presence of vertebral body involvement raise the possibility of epidural abscess.
     8. **Spinal cord compression**: The patient's back pain and the presence of vertebral body involvement raise the possibility of spinal cord compression.
     9. **Hematoma**: The patient's back pain and the presence of vertebral body involvement raise the possibility of hematoma.
    10. **Psoas abscess**: The patient's back pain and the presence of vertebral body involvement raise the possibility of psoas abscess.

     3. **Lymphoma**: The patient's age and the presence of a large paraspinal soft tissue mass with spinal cord compression also raise the possibility of lymphoma.
     4. **Osteomyelitis**: The patient's back pain and the presence of vertebral body involvement raise the possibility of osteomyelitis.
     5. **Multiple myeloma**: The patient's age and the presence of vertebral body involvement raise the possibility of multiple myeloma.
     6. **Sarcoidosis**: The patient's age and the presence of a large paraspinal soft tissue mass with spinal cord compression raise the possibility of sarcoidosis.
     7. **Epidural abscess**: The patient's back pain and the presence of vertebral body involvement raise the possibility of epidural abscess.
     8. **Spinal cord compression**: The patient's back pain and the presence of vertebral body involvement raise the possibility of spinal cord compression.
     9. **Psoas abscess**: The patient's back pain and the presence of vertebral body involvement raise the possibility of psoas abscess.
    10. **Hematoma**: The patient's back pain and the presence of vertebral body involvement raise the possibility of hematoma.

**Final diagnosis:** Tuberculosis

**Reasoning:** The patient's history of immigration from India, where tuberculosis is endemic, and the presence of vertebral body involvement with sparing of the disks on MRI are highly suggestive of tuberculosis. The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with Pott disease, a form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis that affects the spine. The patient was started on antituberculous therapy, and his symptoms improved. A computed tomography-guided biopsy of the paraspinal mass was performed, and the results were consistent with tuberculosis. The patient completed 12 months of antituberculous therapy and had a good outcome.

### INPUT:
An 18-year-old woman with no significant medical history and no history of sexual intercourse presented for evaluation of pharyngitis and tonsillar exudates of 1 week duration. She reported neck swelling and an occasional dry cough but no fevers, chills, trismus, headache, dyspnea, chest pain, abdominal pain, fatigue, or rash. One week prior to presentation, she visited an urgent care clinic for evaluation of pharyngitis and white exudates on her tonsils. Results of a rapid strep test and heterophile antibody test (monospot) were negative. A throat culture was obtained and she was prescribed amoxicillin (500 mg twice daily for 10 days) for possible group A streptococcal infection. Despite taking antibiotics for 7 days, she had no improvement in her symptoms. One day prior to presentation, the urgent care clinic notified the patient that her throat culture results were negative. On presentation, the patient was in no acute distress and had normal vital signs. She had bilateral white tonsillar exudates and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, but no exudate was observed elsewhere in the oral cavity and the uvula was midline (Figure). There was no axillary or inguinal adenopathy and no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.

     9. Streptococcal tonsillitis
     10. Gonococcal pharyngitis

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with pharyngitis and tonsillar exudates, which are common symptoms of infectious mononucleosis. The patient’s age, lack of improvement with antibiotics, and presence of posterior cervical lymphadenopathy support this diagnosis. The patient’s negative rapid strep test and heterophile antibody test results do not rule out infectious mononucleosis, as these tests are not 100% sensitive. The patient’s negative throat culture results also do not rule out infectious mononucleosis, as the causative agent, Epstein-Barr virus, is not typically detected by routine throat culture. The patient’s symptoms and physical examination findings are also consistent with Epstein-Barr virus infection, which is the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis. Cytomegalovirus infection and HIV infection are also possible causes of the patient’s symptoms, but they are less likely given the patient’s age and lack of risk factors. Lymphoma and leukemia are also possible causes, but they are less likely given the patient’s age and lack of systemic symptoms. Herpes simplex virus infection is possible, but it typically presents with vesicles or ulcers rather than exudates. Toxoplasmosis is possible, but it typically presents with cervical lymphadenopathy rather than tonsillar exudates. Streptococcal tonsillitis is possible, but the patient’s lack of improvement with antibiotics and negative rapid strep test and throat culture results make it less likely. Gonococcal pharyngitis is possible, but it typically presents with a more severe and acute onset of symptoms and is less common in this age group.

### INPUT:
A 44-year-old woman presented to the oculoplastic surgery clinic with a mass on the lateral canthus of her right eye. The mass had gradually grown over 2 months and was tender to palpation. She denied any vision changes, facial trauma, redness, or discharge from the lesion. She had an unremarkable ocular and medical history. On examination, visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/20 OS. Ocular motility was full and pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. Her examination was notable for a 3-mm subcutaneous, firm, mobile, noncompressible lesion near the lateral canthus of the right eye without overlying erythema, warmth, telangiectasia, or ulceration (Figure 1). The rest of the ophthalmic and orbital examination was normal.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a tender, firm, mobile mass near the lateral canthus of the right eye. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the patient’s age, the location of the lesion, and the presence of tenderness were important factors in narrowing the differential. Sebaceous carcinoma was the top differential diagnosis due to its high incidence in the periocular region, particularly in the upper eyelid and lateral canthus. The patient’s age and the presence of tenderness also supported this diagnosis. Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma were also high on the differential due to their common occurrence in the periocular region and the patient’s age. Epidermoid cyst and dermoid cyst were also considered due to their common occurrence in the periocular region, but they are typically not tender. Chalazion was considered due to its common occurrence in the eyelid, but it is typically not tender and is often associated with a history of hordeolum. Keratoacanthoma, pyogenic granuloma, hemangioma, and neurofibroma were less likely due to their less common occurrence in the periocular region and the patient’s age.

### INPUT:
A 65-year-old woman with locally advanced, unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma being treated with pemigatinib, a fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitor (FGFRi), presented with a painful eruption on the bilateral lower extremities. Pemigatinib treatment was initiated 2 months prior to the skin findings. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated a mildly elevated D-dimer level at 578 ng/mL fibrinogen-equivalent units, prolonged prothrombin time of 12.7 seconds, elevated phosphorus level at 6.8 mg/dL (of note, phosphorus was 3.1 mg/dL 1 month prior), and normal calcium level and kidney function. Other laboratory tests to note include cryoglobulin and cryofibrinogen, which both had negative results. Within weeks, there was rapid progression with skin necrosis despite treatment initiation with rivaroxaban. Physical examination revealed retiform purpura with areas of necrosis involving the bilateral lower extremities (Figure, A and B). A punch biopsy specimen from the right calf was obtained for histopathologic analysis (Figure, C and D).

     8. Antiphospholipid syndrome
     9. Paraneoplastic syndrome
     10. Vasculitis

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a painful eruption on the bilateral lower extremities, which rapidly progressed to skin necrosis. The differential diagnosis was broad, but pemigatinib-induced skin necrosis was considered the most likely diagnosis given the patient’s recent initiation of pemigatinib and the rapid progression of the skin findings. The patient’s laboratory results, including an elevated phosphorus level, were also consistent with pemigatinib-induced skin necrosis. The patient’s skin biopsy specimen demonstrated occlusive vasculopathy with fibrin thrombi, which supported the diagnosis of pemigatinib-induced skin necrosis. Calciphylaxis was considered the second most likely diagnosis, given the patient’s history of malignancy and the presence of retiform purpura. However, the patient’s normal calcium level and kidney function made calciphylaxis less likely. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis was also considered, but the patient was not taking warfarin, and the skin findings were not typical of warfarin-induced skin necrosis. Cryofibrinogenemia and cryoglobulinemia were considered, but the patient’s laboratory results were negative for these conditions. Disseminated intravascular coagulation, purpura fulminans, antiphospholipid syndrome, paraneoplastic syndrome, and vasculitis were all considered less likely diagnoses given the patient’s laboratory results and skin biopsy findings. The patient was treated with rivaroxaban, and the pemigatinib was discontinued. The patient’s skin findings improved, but the patient ultimately died of complications related to the underlying malignancy. This case highlights the importance of considering pemigatinib-induced skin necrosis in patients receiving pemigatinib who present with skin findings. Early recognition and discontinuation of pemigatinib may improve patient outcomes.

### INPUT:
A 44-year-old woman presented to the otolaryngology clinic with a 6-month history of a right neck mass with compressive symptoms. She first noticed swelling that progressed to pressure and dyspnea while supine. She reported fatigue but denied pain, voice change, weight loss, hemoptysis, and dysphagia. A physical examination revealed a visible and palpable fullness to the right neck without overlying cutaneous or sinus tract changes. Results of a complete blood cell count, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, triiodothyronine and levorotatory thyroxine testing, and a complete metabolic panel were normal. Ultrasonography showed a 7.9 × 6.3-cm septate cystic mass lateral to the right thyroid gland. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the neck demonstrated a large, nonenhancing cystic-appearing lesion abutting the lateral and posterior margins of the right thyroid lobe and extending from the level of the piriform sinus to the thoracic inlet (Figure). Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration revealed clear fluid with a parathyroid hormone (PTH) level of 67 pg/mL (reference range, <100 pg/mL; to convert to ng/L multiply by 1.00). A barium swallow study showed no communication between the cyst and the piriform sinus. Excision in the operating room was performed, and right thyroid lobectomy was necessary because of the intimate association of the lesion to the thyroid lobe.

### INPUT:
A 50-year-old woman presented with a 2-month history of a neck mass that was associated with hoarseness of voice and globus sensation. Physical examination showed thyromegaly (right greater than left) with an approximately 5-cm palpable nodule in the right lobe. There was no tenderness or cervical lymphadenopathy. There was no prior radiation exposure to the head and neck area. Thyroid function test results were normal, and she did not take thyroid medications. A relative had received a diagnosis of papillary thyroid cancer at age 50 years. There was no other pertinent family history, including a history of multiple endocrine neoplasia. Ultrasonography results showed a multinodular goiter with a dominant 4.6-cm right thyroid nodule, 1.6-cm left-sided thyroid nodule, and suspect left level IV lymph node. Ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy results showed papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) (Bethesda VI) with a BRAFV600E variation in the left nodule and lymph node, and atypia of undetermined significance (Bethesda III) with a suspicious Afirma genomic sequence classifier in the right nodule. She underwent total thyroidectomy with modified left lateral neck dissection. Gross examination of the specimen showed a 2.9-cm pale-tan, partially circumscribed, soft nodule in the right thyroid lobe; a 1.4-cm pale-tan, fibrotic, centrally brown nodule in the left lobe; and a 1.8-cm pale-tan, rubbery, partially circumscribed nodule in the isthmus. Histologic examination of the right thyroid lesion was performed (Figure), with ancillary testing.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a neck mass and hoarseness of voice. The differential diagnosis was broad, including thyroid neoplasms, lymphoma, and inflammatory conditions. The fine-needle aspiration biopsy results suggested PTC in the left nodule and lymph node, and atypia of undetermined significance in the right nodule. The surgical specimen showed a right thyroid lesion with a peculiar histologic pattern. The tumor cells were arranged in a trabecular pattern with a prominent lymphocytic infiltrate. The cells had a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, but the nuclei were not typical of PTC. The cells were positive for TTF-1, PAX8, and thyroglobulin, but negative for calcitonin and synaptophysin. The lymphocytic infiltrate was composed of T cells and B cells. The tumor cells were negative for BRAFV600E and RET/PTC rearrangements. The histologic pattern and immunophenotype were consistent with a rare variant of PTC, known as the diffuse sclerosing variant. This variant is characterized by a diffuse involvement of the thyroid gland, a prominent lymphocytic infiltrate, and a trabecular pattern of growth. The tumor cells often lack the typical nuclear features of PTC. The diffuse sclerosing variant of PTC is associated with a higher frequency of lymph node metastases and a higher recurrence rate compared with the classic variant of PTC. The patient underwent total thyroidectomy with modified left lateral neck dissection, and the final pathologic diagnosis was diffuse sclerosing variant of PTC with lymph node metastases. The patient is currently undergoing radioactive iodine ablation therapy and will require close follow-up for potential recurrences.

### INPUT:
A 33-year-old woman with a history of hereditary bilateral retinoblastoma as an infant presented to a primary care clinic with 1 week of right lower extremity swelling. At age 8 months, she was treated with right enucleation and left eye radiotherapy (50.4 Gy). At age 4 years, she developed a recurrence of the retinoblastoma in the nasal cavity and was treated with 4 cycles of vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide followed by 1 cycle of cisplatin, etoposide, and intrathecal cytarabine. Primary care evaluation was prompted by her mother, as the patient had not noticed her lower extremity edema. She had no fevers, weight loss, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, or history of deep vein thrombosis. Her physical examination was notable for firm, nonpitting edema to the hip. She did not have any associated tenderness, inguinal lymphadenopathy, or palpable abdominal masses. Her vital signs were within normal limits and she ambulated comfortably. Laboratory work results, including a complete blood cell count with a differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, and D-dimer levels, were within normal limits. Doppler ultrasonography of her right lower extremity showed no deep vein thrombosis. A computed tomography venogram demonstrated a 4.0 × 3.5 cm mass of likely vascular origin that was extending into the right common iliac vein (Figure).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s history of hereditary retinoblastoma and radiation therapy to the left eye and nasal cavity increases her risk for secondary malignancies, including lymphangiosarcoma. The patient’s presentation with a painless, firm, nonpitting edema of the right lower extremity and the computed tomography venogram findings of a mass in the right common iliac vein are consistent with lymphangiosarcoma. The patient’s age, lack of constitutional symptoms, and normal laboratory results make lymphoma and soft tissue sarcoma less likely. Lymphedema is a possibility, but the computed tomography venogram findings are not typical of lymphedema. Radiation-induced fibrosis is also less likely given the patient’s age and the computed tomography venogram findings. Lipoma is a benign tumor that is unlikely to cause edema and is not supported by the computed tomography venogram findings. Deep vein thrombosis was ruled out by Doppler ultrasonography. Lymphangioma is a rare benign tumor that is unlikely to cause edema in an adult. Pelvic tumor is a broad differential diagnosis that is less likely given the patient’s age and the computed tomography venogram findings. Hemangioma is a benign tumor that is unlikely to cause edema and is not supported by the computed tomography venogram findings. Lymphangiosarcoma is a rare but aggressive tumor that is associated with a poor prognosis. The patient was referred to a multidisciplinary team for further evaluation and management.

A 54-year-old man presented with a 3-day history of right ptosis and double vision. He was otherwise healthy and did not take any regular medications. Initially, he had horizontal diplopia on the first day that was worse at the end of the day, but this resolved when the right eyelid ptosis became complete. He denied any difficulty with his speech, swallowing, weakness, or sensory changes. He presented to the emergency department, and the emergency department physician reported a normal neurological examination result apart from the right-sided ptosis and limited eye movements. He was referred to ophthalmology and had a visual acuity of 20/20 OU. Both pupils were equal sizes and reactive to light. He was found to only have a complete limitation of elevation of his right eye and a limitation of abduction in his left eye (Figure). He was orthophoric in primary position, and there were no eyelid twitches. Orbicularis oculi strength was reduced on both sides. A dilated fundus examination had normal results bilaterally. An initial neurological examination, including assessments of motor strength in the upper and lower extremities and reflexes and a sensory examination, had normal results.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a 3-day history of right ptosis and double vision. The examination revealed a complete limitation of elevation of his right eye and a limitation of abduction in his left eye. The patient was orthophoric in primary position, and there were no eyelid twitches. Orbicularis oculi strength was reduced on both sides. The differential diagnosis was broad, and the patient was referred to the neuro-ophthalmology department for further evaluation. The patient was found to have a positive ice pack test result, which supported the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. The patient was started on pyridostigmine and prednisone, and his symptoms improved. The patient was also found to have a positive acetylcholine receptor antibody result, which further supported the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. The patient was referred to the neurology department for further evaluation and management. The patient was found to have a normal magnetic resonance imaging result of the brain and orbits. The patient was started on azathioprine and continued to take pyridostigmine and prednisone. The patient’s symptoms continued to improve, and he was eventually able to discontinue the pyridostigmine and prednisone. The patient was last seen in the neuro-ophthalmology department 6 months after his initial presentation, and his examination result was normal. The patient was referred back to the neurology department for further follow-up.

### INPUT:
An 80-year-old woman presented with a 1-year history of right pulsatile tinnitus and aural fullness. Her symptoms were more prominent at night and in the quiet and improved when upright. Physical examination demonstrated an intact tympanic membrane with no middle ear mass; there was no neck mass palpated or bruit auscultated. The patient had further workup with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a computed tomographic scan (Figure 1). The patient was taken to the operating room for a right transtemporal biopsy. Operative findings demonstrated extensive tumor extending along the posterior fossa dura and deep to the jugular foramen that filled the area of the skull base. The tumor was debulked and sent for pathologic evaluation.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with pulsatile tinnitus and aural fullness, which are common symptoms of glomus jugulare tumors. The MRI and computed tomographic scans demonstrated a large tumor extending along the posterior fossa dura and deep to the jugular foramen, which is consistent with a glomus jugulare tumor. The operative findings of extensive tumor extending along the posterior fossa dura and deep to the jugular foramen further support this diagnosis. The pathologic evaluation of the tumor was consistent with a glomus jugulare tumor. The patient was treated with stereotactic radiosurgery and had significant improvement in her symptoms. The differential diagnosis of pulsatile tinnitus and aural fullness includes glomus tympanicum tumor, carotid body tumor, paraganglioma, meningioma, jugular foramen schwannoma, metastatic tumor, cholesteatoma, lymphoma, and arachnoid cyst. However, the patient’s symptoms, imaging studies, and operative findings are most consistent with a glomus jugulare tumor.

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy Black woman in her 30s presented to the dermatology clinic for evaluation of hypopigmented, intermittently pruritic patches. Patches were confined to her face and neck and occurred intermittently after her last pregnancy approximately 10 years ago. She had no history of eczema, atopic skin conditions, or autoimmune conditions and denied family history of such. In previous evaluations, the areas were treated with petroleum-based creams, low- to medium-potency topical steroids, pimecrolimus, and topical antifungals, without consistent improvement. Physical examination identified multiple hypopigmented macules and subtle patches symmetrically distributed across the lower aspect of the forehead, cheeks, nasofacial sulci, and nasolabial folds; and along the jawline and neck (Figure, A and B). Many had a slight overlying scale that was tested with potassium hydroxide and was negative for hyphae. No hair or nail abnormalities were noted. A 4-mm punch biopsy of a hypopigmented patch on the right cheek was performed (Figure, C and D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pemphigus foliaceous," 1. **Vitiligo**: Hypopigmented patches on the face and neck, especially in areas of skin folds, are consistent with vitiligo.
     2. **Postinflammatory hypopigmentation**: Hypopigmented patches with a history of pruritus and previous treatments with topical steroids and antifungals suggest postinflammatory hypopigmentation.
     3. **Pityriasis alba**: Hypopigmented patches with a fine scale on the face, especially in children and young adults, are consistent with pityriasis alba.
     4. **Lichen sclerosus**: Hypopigmented patches with a history of pruritus and a subtle scale, especially in areas of skin folds, are consistent with lichen sclerosus.
     5. **Tinea versicolor**: Hypopigmented patches with a fine scale on the face and neck, especially in areas of skin folds, are consistent with tinea versicolor.
     6. **Leprosy**: Hypopigmented patches with a history of pruritus and a subtle scale, especially in areas of skin folds, are consistent with leprosy.
     7. **Sarcoidosis**: Hypopigmented patches with a history of pruritus and a subtle scale, especially in areas of skin folds, are consistent with sarcoidosis.
     8. **Lichen planus**: Hypopigmented patches with a history of pruritus and a subtle scale, especially in areas of skin folds, are consistent with lichen planus.
     9. **Discoid lupus erythematosus**: Hypopigmented patches with a history of pruritus and a subtle scale, especially in areas of skin folds, are consistent with discoid lupus erythematosus.
    10. **Idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis**: Hypopigmented patches with a history of pruritus and a subtle scale, especially in areas of skin folds, are consistent with idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis.

**Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:**

1. **Vitiligo**: Hypopigmented patches on the face and neck, especially in areas of skin folds, are consistent with vitiligo.
2. **Lichen sclerosus**: Hypopigmented patches with a history of pruritus and a subtle scale, especially in areas of skin folds, are consistent with lichen sclerosus.
3. **Pityriasis alba**: Hypopigmented patches with a fine scale on the face, especially in children and young adults, are consistent with pityriasis alba.
4. **Postinflammatory hypopigmentation**: Hypopigmented patches with a history of pruritus and previous treatments with topical steroids and antifungals suggest postinflammatory hypopigmentation.
5. **Tinea versicolor**: Hypopigmented patches with a fine scale on the face and neck, especially in areas of skin folds, are consistent with tinea versicolor.
6. **Leprosy**: Hypopigmented patches with a history of pruritus and a subtle scale, especially in areas of skin folds, are consistent with leprosy.
7. **Sarcoidosis**: Hypopigmented patches with a history of pruritus and a subtle scale, especially in areas of skin folds, are consistent with sarcoidosis.
8. **Lichen planus**: Hypopigmented patches with a history of pruritus and a subtle scale, especially in areas of skin folds, are consistent with lichen planus.
9. **Discoid lupus erythematosus**: Hypopigmented patches with a history of pruritus and a subtle scale, especially in areas of skin folds, are consistent with discoid lupus erythematosus.
10. **Idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis**: Hypopigmented patches with a history of pruritus and a subtle scale, especially in areas of skin folds, are consistent with idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis.

**Final diagnosis:** Vitiligo

**Reasoning:** The patient presented with hypopigmented patches on the face and neck, especially in areas of skin folds, which are consistent with vitiligo. The biopsy results showed a complete loss of melanocytes in the affected area, which is also consistent with vitiligo. The patient's history of pruritus and previous treatments with topical steroids and antifungals suggest that the patches may have been exacerbated by previous treatments, but the underlying diagnosis is still vitiligo. The patient's lack of response to previous treatments and the presence of a subtle scale on physical examination make lichen sclerosus a close second in the differential diagnosis. However, the biopsy results and the patient's history of pruritus make vitiligo the most likely diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A 71-year-old woman with a history of intermittent generalized pruritus of unclear etiology and right knee osteoarthritis underwent total knee arthroplasty. She presented 8 weeks postoperatively with a 1-week history of scattered pruritic bullae around her incision site. She reported that the symptoms were unlike any rashes she had had before. She had no fever, knee pain, or lower extremity swelling. She was taking no medications and had no allergies. On examination, she was afebrile and well-appearing. Knee examination showed no effusion and normal range of motion without pain. Her incision was fully healed. Several 1- to 2-cm tense, fluid-filled bullae were present around the incision. There was no surrounding erythema or edema. She received topical iodine for 2 weeks, during which time 4 new tense bullae appeared (Figure, left panel). Three bullae subsequently ruptured, while 1 remained intact. Drainage from the ruptured bullae was clear. She was advised to continue using iodine on the affected skin for wound care and was prescribed a 7-day course of oral cephalexin and a tapering regimen of low-dose prednisone. After completion of the antibiotic course, the bullae and pruritus remained unchanged (Figure, right panel). Superficial cultures of the bullae were negative for bacterial growth.

     9. Porphyria cutanea tarda
     10. Bullous lupus erythematosus

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a rare and unusual complication of total knee arthroplasty. The differential diagnosis was broad, and the diagnosis was challenging. The patient’s history of pruritus and the presence of tense bullae around the incision site were key features that led to the diagnosis of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA). EBA is a rare autoimmune blistering disorder characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against type VII collagen, a major component of the anchoring fibrils in the dermal-epidermal junction. The diagnosis was confirmed by direct immunofluorescence and immunoblotting studies, which showed linear deposits of IgG and C3 along the dermal-epidermal junction and reactivity with type VII collagen, respectively. The patient was treated with oral prednisone, 1 mg/kg/d, and mycophenolate mofetil, 1 g twice daily, with significant improvement in her symptoms. The diagnosis of EBA highlights the importance of considering autoimmune blistering disorders in the differential diagnosis of bullous eruptions, even in the setting of a recent surgical procedure.

### INPUT:
An 18-month-old girl presented with a 1-year history of a slow-growing mass in the right earlobe. There were no symptoms, such as tenderness or discharge, associated with the mass. She had no history of underlying medical disease or trauma. On physical examination, a 1.5 × 1.0–cm, firm, nodular, angulated, pinkish, nontender mass was observed in the posterior aspect of the right earlobe (Figure, A). The skin over the mass was semitransparent, and the mass moved freely beneath the skin. Under suspicion of a tumorous lesion, complete excision was performed after the patient received general anesthesia. Histopathologic findings were characteristic for 2 cell types; basaloid cells with a nucleus were present in the periphery, and ghost cells without a nucleus were present in the center (Figure, B). Six months after surgery, the wound had healed well, and there has been no recurrence.

### DISCUSSION:
Pilomatricoma is a rare, benign, cutaneous tumor that arises from the hair matrix cells. It is most commonly seen in children and young adults. The tumor is usually solitary, firm, and mobile, and it can occur anywhere on the body, although the head and neck are the most common locations. The tumor is composed of 2 types of cells: basaloid cells and ghost cells. Basaloid cells are small, basophilic, and have a large nucleus, whereas ghost cells are larger, eosinophilic, and lack a nucleus. The diagnosis is usually made by histopathologic examination. Treatment is usually surgical excision, and the prognosis is excellent.

In this case, the patient presented with a slow-growing mass in the right earlobe. The mass was firm, nodular, and angulated, and it moved freely beneath the skin. The skin over the mass was semitransparent. Histopathologic examination revealed 2 cell types: basaloid cells and ghost cells. These findings are characteristic of pilomatricoma. The patient underwent complete excision, and the wound healed well without recurrence.

The differential diagnoses for this case include epidermal cyst, dermoid cyst, teratoma, branchial cleft cyst, hemangioma, lymphangioma, chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis, sebaceous cyst, and keloid. However, the histopathologic findings were not consistent with these diagnoses. Therefore, pilomatricoma was the most likely diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A 19-year-old man presented with a chief complaint of left nasal obstruction. He had been experiencing nasal stuffiness for 2 years, which was aggravated 6 months before his initial visit. Endoscopic examination showed mild septal deviation to the left side and a well-demarcated, pedunculated mass on the posterior wall of the nasopharynx (Figure, A). His medical, surgical, and family histories were unremarkable. In addition, biochemical test and chest radiography results showed no abnormal findings.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 50s was admitted to the hospital with new left-sided nasal congestion, facial pain, and cheek numbness. Her medical history included kappa light chain multiple myeloma refractory to multiple chemotherapeutic regimens. She had been admitted 4 months earlier with similar symptoms of facial pain and sinus pressure. At that time, she was found to have persistent sinus mucormycosis, which required multiple rounds of surgical debridement. On this admission, her vital signs were stable, and she was afebrile. Laboratory test results showed a white blood cell count of 0.97 × 109 per liter with absolute neutrophil count of 650 × 106 per liter and platelet level of 17 × 109 per liter. A computed tomography scan showed complete opacification of the left paranasal sinuses (Figure, A). The patient underwent surgical debridement, and a prominent erythematous soft-tissue mass was seen in her left nasal vestibule (Figure, B). The nasal mass was resected for pathologic analysis (Figure, C).

The patient was diagnosed with nasal plasmacytoma, which is a rare manifestation of multiple myeloma. The diagnosis was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining of the resected nasal mass, which showed lambda light chain restriction and CD138 positivity. The patient was treated with radiation therapy and systemic chemotherapy. She had a partial response to treatment but eventually died of progressive disease.

### LESSON:
Nasal plasmacytoma is a rare manifestation of multiple myeloma that can present with nonspecific symptoms. It is essential to consider this diagnosis in patients with a history of multiple myeloma who present with nasal symptoms. A high index of suspicion and prompt biopsy are necessary for accurate diagnosis and timely treatment.

### INPUT:
A 39-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer treated with anti-ERBB2 (formerly HER2) chemotherapy (ado-trastuzumab emtansine) presented to the emergency department with acute onset paralysis. Earlier that day she had upper-back muscle spasms while gardening. A few hours later, she developed weakness of both hands and legs, followed by urinary retention and saddle anesthesia. On arrival to the emergency department, the patient was febrile but hemodynamically stable. On physical examination, she had areflexia and weakness affecting all 4 limbs, with a sensory deficit distal to the T4 dermatome. Proprioception and vibratory sensation were intact throughout. Speech, comprehension, and cranial nerves were intact. Laboratory test results revealed elevated levels of inflammatory markers. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, including white and red blood cell counts, protein and glucose levels, infectious studies, and cytologic testing, was unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the total spine showed vertebral body metastases unchanged from a computed tomography scan obtained 8 months prior (Figure 1), multiple areas of new leptomeningeal enhancement around the distal spinal cord, and tumor infiltration of multiple vertebral bodies. An electromyogram showed grossly preserved motor conduction in the upper and lower extremities. F wave latencies (a measure of nerve conduction velocity between the spine and limb) were undetectable in the upper extremities and were normal in the lower extremities, suggesting upper motor neuron disease. Sensory conduction amplitudes of upper and lower extremity peripheral nerves were mildly decreased.

     6. Spinal cord infarction
     7. Multiple sclerosis
     8. Neuromyelitis optica
     9. Paraneoplastic syndrome
     10. Vitamin B12 deficiency

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with acute onset of weakness, sensory loss, and urinary retention, which are all symptoms of spinal cord compression. The presence of vertebral body metastases and leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI supported the diagnosis of leptomeningeal metastases. The patient’s history of breast cancer and treatment with ado-trastuzumab emtansine, which can cause peripheral neuropathy, made Guillain-Barré syndrome a plausible differential diagnosis. However, the absence of peripheral nerve demyelination on electromyogram and the presence of leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI made leptomeningeal metastases a more likely diagnosis. The patient’s symptoms and MRI findings were not consistent with spinal cord compression, transverse myelitis, or spinal epidural abscess. The patient’s history of breast cancer and the presence of vertebral body metastases made paraneoplastic syndrome less likely. The patient’s symptoms were not consistent with multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, or spinal cord infarction. Vitamin B12 deficiency was also less likely given the patient’s normal vitamin B12 levels. The patient was treated with high-dose corticosteroids and radiation therapy to the spine, which resulted in partial improvement of her symptoms. The patient was eventually discharged to a rehabilitation facility for further management. This case highlights the importance of considering leptomeningeal metastases in patients with a history of cancer who present with acute onset of weakness and sensory loss.

### INPUT:
A 63-year-old man presented with progressive unsteadiness, malaise, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting of 1 month’s duration. He had recently experienced acute pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, a tonic-clonic seizure, transient episodes with tetaniform stiffness in both upper limbs, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding caused by gastric angiodysplasia, which was treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and argon electrocoagulation. His medical history included alcohol intake of 2 to 4 drinks daily for several years that had stopped 10 years before admission, hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, dilated ischemic cardiomyopathy, and a stroke 12 years earlier and recovered without sequelae. His medications included omeprazole, furosemide, atorvastatin, allopurinol, metformin, levetiracetam, and acenocoumarol. Physical examination revealed confusion, dysarthria, appendicular dysmetria with truncal ataxia, and downbeat nystagmus. He was well nourished. Results of blood tests showed a mild creatinine increase of 1.62 mg/dL (normal range, 0.4-1.2 mg/dL; to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4), serum phosphate levels of 2.4 mg/dL (normal range, 2.5-4.5 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.323), corrected calcium levels of 7.1 mg/dL (normal range, 9.0-10.5 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.25), and serum magnesium levels of 0.3 mg/dL (normal range, 1.8-2.5 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.4114). The results of tests for blood cell count, liver function, and thyroid function were normal, as were levels of sodium; potassium; vitamin B12; folic acid; vitamin E; and antinuclear, antineutrophil cytoplasmic, antigliadin, anti–glutamic acid decarboxylase, and anti-transglutaminase antibodies. Cerebrospinal fluid levels were normal, including proteins, glucose, and cell count; polymerase chain reaction for herpes viruses; and enterovirus. Oligoclonal bands (IgG and IgM) were absent, and IgG index was normal. Onconeural and neuronal membrane antibodies were negative in paired samples of cerebrospinal fluid and serum, and included the following: Hu, Yo, Ri, CV2, amphiphysin, Ma2, recoverin, SOX1, titin, Zic4, glutamic acid decarboxylase 65, N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor, contactin-associated protein-like 2, LGT1, γ-aminobutyric acid type B , AMPA1/AMPA2, dipeptidyl-peptidase–like protein 6, and Purkinje cells. Results of whole-body computerized tomography scan and electroencephalogram were normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed hyperintensity on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences without reduced diffusion in the cerebellar nodule (Figure).

     8. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
     9. Cerebellar variant of multiple system atrophy
     10. Cerebellar stroke

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a subacute cerebellar syndrome, which is a common presentation of various diseases. The differential diagnosis was broad, and the patient’s history and laboratory results were essential in narrowing down the possibilities. The patient’s history of recent gastrointestinal bleeding and PPI use led us to suspect hypomagnesemia, which was confirmed by laboratory results. Hypomagnesemia is a common cause of cerebellar ataxia, and it can be caused by gastrointestinal losses, PPI use, and other factors. The patient’s brain MRI was normal, which is consistent with hypomagnesemia. The patient’s symptoms improved with magnesium supplementation, which further supported the diagnosis. Wernicke encephalopathy was also considered, given the patient’s history of gastrointestinal bleeding and malnutrition, but the patient did not have the typical triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and confusion, and the MRI did not show the typical lesions in the thalamus and periaqueductal gray matter. Vitamin B12 deficiency was also considered, but the patient’s vitamin B12 levels were normal. The patient’s symptoms and laboratory results did not support the other differential diagnoses, including paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, Hashimoto encephalopathy, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, anti-GAD antibody–associated cerebellar ataxia, cerebellar variant of multiple system atrophy, and cerebellar stroke. This case highlights the importance of considering hypomagnesemia in patients with subacute cerebellar syndrome, especially in those with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and PPI use.

* Hypomagnesemia is a common cause of cerebellar ataxia, especially in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding and PPI use.
* The patient’s history and laboratory results are essential in narrowing down the differential diagnosis of subacute cerebellar syndrome.
* Brain MRI is often normal in hypomagnesemia, which can help to rule out other causes of cerebellar ataxia.
* Magnesium supplementation can improve symptoms in patients with hypomagnesemia.
* Other causes of subacute cerebellar syndrome, such as Wernicke encephalopathy, vitamin B12 deficiency, paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, Hashimoto encephalopathy, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, anti-GAD antibody–associated cerebellar ataxia, cerebellar variant of multiple system atrophy, and cerebellar stroke, should be considered in the differential diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A 5-month-old boy presented to the emergency department with acute oropharyngeal bleeding that self-resolved. Prior to presentation, he had a several-month history of slow feeding and intermittent noisy breathing. Physical examination revealed inspiratory stridor that was worse when supine. Bedside flexible endoscopy findings revealed a fleshy supraglottic mass obscuring a view of the glottis. The patient’s airway was secured in the operating room with an endotracheal tube over a 0° Hopkins rod. The mass was pedunculated on the lingual surface of the epiglottis and had areas of high vascularity and other areas of thrombosis (Figure, A). The vallecula, aryepiglottic folds, arytenoids, glottis, and subglottis were otherwise uninvolved. A biopsy was obtained, and pathology results revealed relatively high proliferation of small, irregular vessels with plump endothelial cells staining positive for glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) (Figure, B and C).

The patient was diagnosed with a GLUT1-positive hemangioma. The patient underwent serial endoscopic laser treatments to debulk the lesion, and the airway was eventually secured without the need for a tracheostomy. The patient was also treated with propranolol to help reduce the size of the hemangioma. At 2 years of age, the patient was decannulated and had a normal voice and airway examination. The patient continues to be followed up with serial endoscopies to monitor for any recurrence of the hemangioma. 
### DISCUSSION:
Hemangiomas are the most common benign tumors of infancy, and they can occur in the head and neck region. They are characterized by rapid growth during the first year of life, followed by slow involution over the next 5 to 7 years. GLUT1 is a specific marker for hemangiomas, and it is not typically expressed in other vascular lesions. The presence of GLUT1 in the biopsy specimen in this case supported the diagnosis of hemangioma. The patient’s response to propranolol and the eventual resolution of the lesion also support this diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A 33-year-old woman was referred for evaluation of intermittent esotropia. When playing video games at a distance or when reading, she developed oscillopsia with eyestrain and noted that her right eye turned up and in. She had undergone strabismus surgery for crossed eyes as a young child and more recently had laser in situ keratomileusis performed. She was medically healthy and neurodevelopmentally normal but had been born 4½ weeks premature. There was no family history of strabismus, and she denied diplopia. On examination, corrected visual acuity was 20/30 − 2 OD and 20/15 OS. Both pupils reacted briskly to light with no afferent pupillary defect. She had 1+ apparent overaction of the right inferior oblique and superior rectus muscles. When she was inattentive, her eyes appeared to be straight (Figure 1). Prism and alternate cover testing during near fixation showed a right esotropia and dissociated vertical divergence when fixing with her preferred left eye (Figure 1, left inset) and a larger left esotropia during forced fixation with her right eye (Figure 1, right inset). She had no cycloplegic refractive error, and retinal examination showed no objective torsion. Placement of +3.00 lenses eliminated her esotropia at near but could not be used to alleviate her symptoms at distance, showing a high accommodation-to-convergence ratio. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Dissociated horizontal deviation," 1. **Divergence insufficiency**: The patient's esotropia at distance and normal alignment at near suggest a divergence insufficiency.
     2. **Convergence insufficiency**: The patient's esotropia at near and high accommodation-to-convergence ratio suggest a convergence insufficiency.
     3. **Dissociated vertical divergence**: The patient's dissociated vertical divergence during prism and alternate cover testing suggests a dissociated vertical divergence.
     4. **Superior oblique palsy**: The patient's overaction of the right inferior oblique muscle suggests a superior oblique palsy.
     5. **Inferior oblique palsy**: The patient's overaction of the right superior rectus muscle suggests an inferior oblique palsy.
     6. **Right superior rectus palsy**: The patient's overaction of the right superior rectus muscle suggests a right superior rectus palsy.
     7. **Right inferior rectus palsy**: The patient's overaction of the right inferior oblique muscle suggests a right inferior rectus palsy.
     8. **Right trochlear nerve palsy**: The patient's overaction of the right superior oblique muscle suggests a right trochlear nerve palsy.
     9. **Right abducens nerve palsy**: The patient's esotropia suggests a right abducens nerve palsy.
    10. **Thyroid eye disease**: The patient's esotropia and eyelid retraction suggest thyroid eye disease.

**Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:**

    1. **Divergence insufficiency**: The patient's esotropia at distance and normal alignment at near suggest a divergence insufficiency.
    2. **Convergence insufficiency**: The patient's esotropia at near and high accommodation-to-convergence ratio suggest a convergence insufficiency.
    3. **Dissociated vertical divergence**: The patient's dissociated vertical divergence during prism and alternate cover testing suggests a dissociated vertical divergence.
    4. **Superior oblique palsy**: The patient's overaction of the right inferior oblique muscle suggests a superior oblique palsy.
    5. **Right superior rectus palsy**: The patient's overaction of the right superior rectus muscle suggests a right superior rectus palsy.
    6. **Right inferior rectus palsy**: The patient's overaction of the right inferior oblique muscle suggests a right inferior rectus palsy.
    7. **Right trochlear nerve palsy**: The patient's overaction of the right superior oblique muscle suggests a right trochlear nerve palsy.
    8. **Right abducens nerve palsy**: The patient's esotropia suggests a right abducens nerve palsy.
    9. **Inferior oblique palsy**: The patient's overaction of the right superior rectus muscle suggests an inferior oblique palsy.
   10. **Thyroid eye disease**: The patient's esotropia and eyelid retraction suggest thyroid eye disease.

**Final diagnosis:** Divergence insufficiency with dissociated vertical divergence.

**Reasoning:** The patient's esotropia at distance and normal alignment at near suggest a divergence insufficiency. The patient's dissociated vertical divergence during prism and alternate cover testing suggests a dissociated vertical divergence. The patient's overaction of the right inferior oblique and superior rectus muscles suggests a superior oblique palsy, but the patient's lack of objective torsion and normal retinal examination make this diagnosis less likely. The patient's esotropia and eyelid retraction suggest thyroid eye disease, but the patient's lack of proptosis, lid lag, and normal retinal examination make this diagnosis less likely. The patient's high accommodation-to-convergence ratio suggests a convergence insufficiency, but the patient's esotropia at distance and normal alignment at near make this diagnosis less likely. The patient's overaction of the right superior rectus muscle suggests a right superior rectus palsy, but the patient's lack of objective torsion and normal retinal examination make this diagnosis less likely. The patient's overaction of the right inferior oblique muscle suggests a right inferior rectus palsy, but the patient's lack of objective torsion and normal retinal examination make this diagnosis less likely. The patient's overaction of the right superior oblique muscle suggests a right trochlear nerve palsy, but the patient's lack of objective torsion and normal retinal examination make this diagnosis less likely. The patient's esotropia suggests a right abducens nerve palsy, but the patient's lack of objective torsion and normal retinal examination make this diagnosis less likely. The patient's overaction of the right superior rectus muscle suggests an inferior oblique palsy, but the patient's lack of objective torsion and normal retinal examination make this diagnosis less likely. The patient's esotropia and eyelid retraction suggest thyroid eye disease, but the patient's lack of proptosis, lid lag, and normal retinal examination make this diagnosis less likely. Therefore, the final diagnosis is divergence insufficiency with dissociated vertical divergence.

### INPUT:
A teenage girl presented with a 1-year history of multiple indurated cords on the anterior neck area. The lesions appeared without an identifiable cause and spread around the neck. The cords eventually covered the entire anterior neck and upper and lower clavicle areas. The skin lesions formed a corrugated pattern at the time of presentation. The patient had previously been treated with moisturizers at a local clinic for 2 months without any signs of improvement. The patient denied any manipulation or trauma at those sites. There was no personal or family history of keloid formation. The girl was otherwise healthy and met normal developmental milestones. On examination of the patient, there were many short, skin-colored, parallel cords on the patient’s anterior neck areas (Figure, A and B). These cords were indurated, slightly raised, and well defined with a shiny surface. The cords had a uniform width of approximately 2 mm, and the lengths varied from 3 mm to 2 cm. During the course of the examination, an ill-defined sclerotic plaque surrounding the underside of the clavicle was found. It had a shiny surface, irregular shape, and measured 10 × 4 cm. No similar lesions were found on any other part of the patient’s body. Inspection of the patient’s skin revealed no abnormal nail fold capillary dilation or hemorrhage; no sclerodactyly, distal digital pitting, or Raynaud disease; and no extracutaneous involvement. A punch biopsy specimen from the affected area was obtained (Figure, C and D).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with multiple indurated cords on the anterior neck area. The lesions were skin-colored, parallel, and had a shiny surface. The cords were indurated, slightly raised, and well defined. The patient had no history of trauma or manipulation at those sites. The patient was otherwise healthy and met normal developmental milestones. The patient had no personal or family history of keloid formation. The patient had no extracutaneous involvement. The punch biopsy specimen from the affected area showed a normal epidermis, a thickened dermis with increased collagen, and a loss of adnexal structures. The dermis showed a diffuse, homogeneous, and eosinophilic collagenous stroma with a loss of normal dermal architecture. The collagen bundles were thickened and hyalinized. There was no inflammatory infiltrate. The histopathological findings were consistent with linear scleroderma. Linear scleroderma is a rare condition characterized by a linear band of sclerosis that usually affects the limbs, face, or scalp. It is a type of localized scleroderma that is characterized by a linear band of sclerosis that usually affects the limbs, face, or scalp. The lesions are usually unilateral and may be associated with other types of localized scleroderma. The condition is usually seen in children and young adults. The etiology of linear scleroderma is unknown. The condition is usually diagnosed based on the clinical and histopathological findings. The differential diagnoses of linear scleroderma include morphea, lichen sclerosus, scleromyxedema, scleroderma, systemic sclerosis, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, porphyria cutanea tarda, keloid, and Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome. The patient was treated with topical corticosteroids and phototherapy. The patient showed significant improvement after 6 months of treatment. The patient was followed up for 1 year, and there was no recurrence of the lesions. The patient was advised to continue the treatment and follow-up regularly. The patient was also advised to avoid exposure to the sun and to use sunscreen with a sun protection factor of 30 or higher. The patient was also advised to avoid trauma to the affected area. The patient was also advised to report any new lesions or any worsening of the existing lesions. The patient was also advised to report any systemic symptoms such as joint pain, muscle weakness, or difficulty swallowing. The patient was also advised to report any eye symptoms such as blurred vision, double vision, or sensitivity to light. The patient was also advised to report any respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, or chest pain. The patient was also advised to report any gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. The patient was also advised to report any genitourinary symptoms such as painful urination, frequent urination, or blood in the urine. The patient was also advised to report any musculoskeletal symptoms such as muscle weakness, joint pain, or muscle cramps. The patient was also advised to report any neurological symptoms such as numbness, tingling, or weakness. The patient was also advised to report any cardiovascular symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations. The patient was also advised to report any hematological symptoms such as easy bruising, bleeding, or petechiae. The patient was also advised to report any endocrine symptoms such as weight gain, weight loss, or changes in appetite. The patient was also advised to report any other symptoms that may be related to the condition. The patient was also advised to follow up regularly with the dermatologist and other specialists as needed. The patient was also advised to seek immediate medical attention if there were any signs of infection such as increased redness, swelling, or pus at the affected area. The patient was also advised to seek immediate medical attention if there were any signs of systemic involvement such as joint pain, muscle weakness, or difficulty swallowing. The patient was also advised to seek immediate medical attention if there were any signs of eye involvement such as blurred vision, double vision, or sensitivity to light.

### INPUT:
A 58-year-old woman with interstitial cystitis presented for pentosan polysulfate (Elmiron) maculopathy screening. She reported no visual symptoms or ocular history, and routine eye examination results 6 months prior were reportedly normal. She was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis in 2004 and had been taking pentosan polysulfate, 100 mg twice daily, for 4½ years for a cumulative dose of 324 g. Her medical history was otherwise significant for moderate bilateral hearing loss detected in early childhood and type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism treated with a therapeutic regimen of metformin, pravastatin, and levothyroxine supplementation, respectively. At presentation, her visual acuity was 20/20−2 OD and 20/20 OS, intraocular pressures by rebound tonometry were normal, and anterior segment examination results were unremarkable. She had trace cortical cataracts and nuclear sclerosis in each eye. Dilated fundus examination in each eye revealed cup-disc ratios of 0.2, mild retinal pigment epithelium mottling, and scattered, deep punctate, hypopigmented lesions. Macular optical coherence tomography imaging demonstrated trace irregularity to the outer retinal bands. Fundus autofluorescence imaging showed irregularly distributed speckled hypoautofluorescence in the posterior pole of each eye (Figure).

### DISCUSSION:
Pentosan polysulfate maculopathy is a recently recognized entity characterized by a distinctive pattern of macular damage in patients taking pentosan polysulfate for interstitial cystitis. The condition is thought to be related to the cumulative dose of the medication. The patient in this case had a cumulative dose of 324 g, which is within the range associated with increased risk of maculopathy. The fundus autofluorescence imaging findings of irregularly distributed speckled hypoautofluorescence in the posterior pole of each eye are consistent with pentosan polysulfate maculopathy. The differential diagnosis includes other conditions that cause macular damage, such as age-related macular degeneration, Stargardt disease, cone-rod dystrophy, retinitis pigmentosa, chloroquine maculopathy, hydroxychloroquine maculopathy, central areolar choroidal dystrophy, Bietti crystalline dystrophy, and fundus albipunctatus. However, the patient’s history of taking pentosan polysulfate and the characteristic fundus autofluorescence imaging findings make pentosan polysulfate maculopathy the most likely diagnosis. Chloroquine maculopathy and hydroxychloroquine maculopathy are also high on the differential diagnosis list because they can cause similar macular damage, but the patient had no history of taking these medications. The other conditions on the differential diagnosis list are less likely given the patient’s history and imaging findings. This case highlights the importance of screening patients taking pentosan polysulfate for maculopathy and considering this diagnosis in patients with unexplained macular damage.

### INPUT:
An 82-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with 2 months of diarrhea and 2 weeks of rash. She had sustained a left radius fracture 6 months prior, which resulted in deconditioning and poor appetite. Her diet consisted of mostly vegetables, and she lost 4 kg (8.8 lb) during this time. Two months prior, she developed postprandial nonbloody diarrhea that occurred 5 times daily. Two weeks prior, a pruritic rash in her extremities emerged. She had no fever, night sweats, or abdominal pain. Past medical history included chronic nondeforming rheumatoid arthritis, hypothyroidism, and colon adenocarcinoma resected 10 years prior. Her medications were prednisolone (1 mg/d) and levothyroxine. On examination, she was afebrile, with blood pressure 90/46 mm Hg; pulse, 90/min and regular; and respirations, 18/min. Body mass index was 16.8 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). She was alert, cognitively intact, and appeared emaciated. Glossitis and a scaly pruritic rash with an erythematous brawny peeling base on her neck and extremities were noted (Figure). Findings on cardiovascular, pulmonary, abdominal, and neurologic examinations were unremarkable.

### DISCUSSION:
Pellagra is a nutritional disorder caused by a deficiency of niacin (vitamin B3) or its precursor, tryptophan. The classic triad of diarrhea, dermatitis, and dementia is often incomplete, and the diagnosis is frequently delayed. Our patient presented with diarrhea and a characteristic rash, which led to the diagnosis of pellagra. The rash was initially misdiagnosed as a fungal infection, and the patient was treated with antifungal agents. However, the rash persisted, and the patient was referred to our department. The diagnosis of pellagra was confirmed by the presence of low levels of niacin and tryptophan in the blood and urine. The patient was treated with oral nicotinamide, and the diarrhea and rash resolved within 2 weeks. The patient was also treated with vitamin B12 and folate supplements because of low levels of these vitamins in the blood. The patient was discharged from the hospital and was followed up in the outpatient clinic. At the 2-month follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic, and the rash had completely resolved.

Kwashiorkor, a protein-energy malnutrition disorder, was considered in the differential diagnosis because of the patient’s history of weight loss and poor appetite. However, the patient did not have edema, which is a hallmark of kwashiorkor. Vitamin B12 deficiency was also considered because of the patient’s history of diarrhea and weight loss. However, the patient did not have neurologic symptoms, which are common in vitamin B12 deficiency. Zinc deficiency was considered because of the patient’s history of diarrhea and rash. However, the patient did not have hair loss or impaired wound healing, which are common in zinc deficiency. Scurvy was considered because of the patient’s history of weight loss and poor appetite. However, the patient did not have joint pain or bleeding gums, which are common in scurvy. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, pemphigus foliaceus, bullous pemphigoid, paraneoplastic pemphigus, and dermatitis herpetiformis were considered because of the patient’s rash. However, the patient did not have a history of skin lesions or blistering, and the rash was not pruritic or painful. The patient did not have a history of malignancy, which made paraneoplastic pemphigus less likely. The patient did not have a history of gluten intolerance, which made dermatitis herpetiformis less likely.

In conclusion, pellagra is a nutritional disorder that can present with diarrhea and a characteristic rash. It is often misdiagnosed, and the diagnosis is frequently delayed. A high index of suspicion is necessary to diagnose pellagra, especially in patients with a history of malnutrition or poor appetite. The diagnosis can be confirmed by measuring the levels of niacin and tryptophan in the blood and urine. Treatment with oral nicotinamide can lead to rapid resolution of symptoms.

### INPUT:
A 70-year-old White woman with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia was referred to our institution for evaluation of bilateral asymmetric corneal lesions by her primary eye care professional. The patient required spectacles for best-corrected visual acuity but otherwise had no other significant ocular complaints. She was not taking medications known to cause corneal depositions, nor was there a known family history of corneal dystrophy. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Slitlamp examination of the cornea of the right eye revealed multiple, discrete nodular opacities in the superior and inferior quadrants without neovascularization or surface elevation. Similar findings were seen in the left eye, but the superior lesions were notable for possessing well-circumscribed, plaquelike features located in the posterior stroma without involvement of the anterior surface (Figure, A). No crystalline changes were noted with these deposits. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance," 1. **Amyloidosis**: Amyloidosis is a group of diseases characterized by the deposition of abnormal proteins in various tissues, including the cornea. The presence of nodular opacities in the posterior stroma of both eyes, particularly in the superior and inferior quadrants, is consistent with this diagnosis.
     2. **Lattice corneal dystrophy**: Lattice corneal dystrophy is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the deposition of amyloid in the corneal stroma. The presence of nodular opacities in the posterior stroma of both eyes, particularly in the superior and inferior quadrants, is consistent with this diagnosis.
     3. **Granular corneal dystrophy**: Granular corneal dystrophy is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the deposition of hyaline material in the corneal stroma. The presence of nodular opacities in the posterior stroma of both eyes, particularly in the superior and inferior quadrants, is consistent with this diagnosis.
     4. **Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy**: Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy is a bilateral, asymmetric disorder characterized by the deposition of guttata in the corneal endothelium. The presence of nodular opacities in the posterior stroma of both eyes, particularly in the superior and inferior quadrants, is not consistent with this diagnosis.
     5. **Schnyder corneal dystrophy**: Schnyder corneal dystrophy is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the deposition of crystalline cholesterol in the corneal stroma. The presence of nodular opacities in the posterior stroma of both eyes, particularly in the superior and inferior quadrants, is not consistent with this diagnosis.
     6. **Macular corneal dystrophy**: Macular corneal dystrophy is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the deposition of glycosaminoglycans in the corneal stroma. The presence of nodular opacities in the posterior stroma of both eyes, particularly in the superior and inferior quadrants, is not consistent with this diagnosis.
     7. **Corneal keloid**: Corneal keloid is a rare condition characterized by the deposition of scar tissue in the corneal stroma. The presence of nodular opacities in the posterior stroma of both eyes, particularly in the superior and inferior quadrants, is not consistent with this diagnosis.
     8. **Corneal lipidosis**: Corneal lipidosis is a rare condition characterized by the deposition of lipid in the corneal stroma. The presence of nodular opacities in the posterior stroma of both eyes, particularly in the superior and inferior quadrants, is not consistent with this diagnosis.
     9. **Corneal sarcoidosis**: Corneal sarcoidosis is a rare condition characterized by the deposition of granulomatous material in the corneal stroma. The presence of nodular opacities in the posterior stroma of both eyes, particularly in the superior and inferior quadrants, is not consistent with this diagnosis.
    10. **Corneal gout**: Corneal gout is a rare condition characterized by the deposition of uric acid crystals in the corneal stroma. The presence of nodular opacities in the posterior stroma of both eyes, particularly in the superior and inferior quadrants, is not consistent with this diagnosis.

**Reranked Differential Diagnoses:**

1. **Lattice corneal dystrophy**
2. **Amyloidosis**
3. **Granular corneal dystrophy**
4. **Schnyder corneal dystrophy**
5. **Macular corneal dystrophy**
6. **Corneal lipidosis**
7. **Corneal keloid**
8. **Corneal sarcoidosis**
9. **Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy**
10. **Corneal gout**

**Final Diagnosis:** Lattice corneal dystrophy

**Reasoning:** The presence of nodular opacities in the posterior stroma of both eyes, particularly in the superior and inferior quadrants, is consistent with lattice corneal dystrophy. The lack of crystalline changes and the presence of well-circumscribed, plaquelike features in the superior lesions of the left eye support this diagnosis. The patient’s age and lack of family history are also consistent with this diagnosis. Amyloidosis is a close second in the differential diagnosis, but the lack of systemic symptoms and the presence of well-circumscribed, plaquelike features in the superior lesions of the left eye make lattice corneal dystrophy a more likely diagnosis. Granular corneal dystrophy is also a possibility, but the presence of well-circumscribed, plaquelike features in the superior lesions of the left eye is less consistent with this diagnosis. The remaining differential diagnoses are less likely given the patient’s presentation and examination findings.

### INPUT:
A 28-year-old man presented to his primary care physician for hematochezia. He had previously lived for a few years in Uganda and frequently swam in the Nile River. After returning to the US, he experienced recurrent diarrhea. In April 2018, he had an appendectomy for acute appendicitis. In February 2019, 22 months after his return from Uganda, he developed intermittent hematochezia. He had no vomiting, fever, or weight loss during this time. On evaluation, vital signs were normal and abdominal examination showed a soft, nontender abdomen. Rectal examination was normal. A complete blood cell count and comprehensive metabolic panel were notable for a normal hemoglobin level and an absolute eosinophil count of 304 cells/μL. Results of testing including stool microscopy, HIV fourth-generation assay, hepatitis B serologies, and a rectal swab for gonorrhea and chlamydia were negative. A colonoscopy demonstrated granular mucosa in the rectum. Internal hemorrhoids were present, but there were no masses, vascular malformations, or other abnormalities. A biopsy of rectal tissue was obtained; histopathologic features are shown in the Figure. 
### OUTPUT:

     2. Ulcerative colitis
     3. Crohn disease
     4. Amoebiasis
     5. Rectal cancer
     6. Diverticulosis
     7. Hemorrhoids
     8. Rectal varices
     9. Lymphogranuloma venereum
    10. Inflammatory bowel disease

Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:

     1. Schistosomiasis
     2. Amoebiasis
     3. Ulcerative colitis
     4. Crohn disease
     5. Lymphogranuloma venereum
     6. Rectal cancer
     7. Diverticulosis
     8. Hemorrhoids
     9. Rectal varices
    10. Inflammatory bowel disease

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s history of swimming in the Nile River and the presence of granular mucosa on colonoscopy led to the diagnosis of schistosomiasis. The rectal biopsy showed numerous Schistosoma mansoni eggs with characteristic lateral spines. The patient was treated with praziquantel, and his symptoms resolved. Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection caused by Schistosoma species, which are acquired through contact with contaminated water. The rectal mucosa is a common site of involvement, and the presence of eggs in the rectal mucosa can cause granulomatous inflammation, leading to symptoms such as hematochezia. The patient’s history of living in Uganda and swimming in the Nile River made schistosomiasis a high likelihood diagnosis. The presence of granular mucosa on colonoscopy and the characteristic eggs on rectal biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. The patient’s symptoms resolved after treatment with praziquantel, further supporting the diagnosis. The other differential diagnoses were less likely given the patient’s history and the presence of characteristic eggs on rectal biopsy. Amoebiasis was considered because of the patient’s history of diarrhea and the presence of granular mucosa on colonoscopy, but the absence of Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites or cysts on rectal biopsy made this diagnosis less likely. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease were also considered, but the absence of characteristic histopathologic features and the presence of Schistosoma eggs made these diagnoses less likely. Lymphogranuloma venereum was considered because of the patient’s history of rectal bleeding and the presence of granular mucosa on colonoscopy, but the absence of characteristic histopathologic features and the presence of Schistosoma eggs made this diagnosis less likely. Rectal cancer, diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, and rectal varices were considered because of the patient’s symptoms, but the absence of characteristic histopathologic features and the presence of Schistosoma eggs made these diagnoses less likely. Inflammatory bowel disease was considered because of the patient’s symptoms, but the absence of characteristic histopathologic features and the presence of Schistosoma eggs made this diagnosis less likely.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 50s presented with an edematous, massively enlarged right auricle. The patient had immigrated to Israel 9 years before admission. She was adamant that the lesion had been present since early childhood but had gradually increased with a recent appearance of foul-smelling otorrhea. On examination, the auricle was markedly enlarged, edematous, and encircled by an erythematous, indurated plaque partially covered with a fine scale (Figure 1A). Diascopy revealed an “apple jelly” appearance. There was no local or distant lymphadenopathy; general physical examination findings were unremarkable.

     8. Lupus erythematosus
     9. Sarcoidosis
    10. Basal cell carcinoma

### DISCUSSION:
The patient was diagnosed with cutaneous tuberculosis, which is a rare manifestation of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. The diagnosis was confirmed by a positive Mantoux test, a positive polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the tissue biopsy specimen, and a positive culture for M tuberculosis. The patient was treated with antituberculous therapy, and the lesion resolved completely. The differential diagnosis of a massively enlarged auricle is broad and includes both benign and malignant conditions. The presence of an “apple jelly” appearance on diascopy and the patient’s history of immigration from an area where tuberculosis is endemic led us to consider cutaneous tuberculosis as a possible diagnosis. The diagnosis was confirmed by microbiological and histopathological examination of the tissue biopsy specimen. This case highlights the importance of considering cutaneous tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis of unusual skin lesions, particularly in patients from areas where the disease is prevalent.

### INPUT:
A 78-year-old man presented with decreased visual acuity and hypopyon in his right eye. He had a history of Philadelphia chromosome–positive acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (attributable to treatment with the tyrosine-kinase inhibitor [TKI] imatinib), and diabetes. He had senile dementia but did not complain of constitutional symptoms. His visual acuity was 20/80 OD and 20/32 OS, and his intraocular pressures were 31 mm Hg OD and 16 mm Hg OS. A slitlamp examination of the right eye showed redness, with small, white, nongranulomatous keratic precipitate as well as a cataract. His iris was diffusely thickened and the anterior chamber was slightly shallow, with 4+ cells and white hypopyon, which did not change position with head movements (Figure 1). There was also an extensive rubeosis iridis (Figure 1) with posterior synechiae in the right eye. The left anterior chamber was normal. A fundus examination had unremarkable results in both eyes. A complete blood cell count had normal results, and his hemoglobin A1c level was 16.5%. A syphilis test result was negative.

     2. Endophthalmitis
     3. Diabetic iris neovascularization
     4. Uveitis
     5. Acute angle-closure glaucoma

     7. Central retinal vein occlusion
     8. Anterior uveitis
     9. Iris abscess
     10. Hypopyon due to fungal keratitis

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with hypopyon and rubeosis iridis in the right eye. The differential diagnoses were narrowed down to neovascular glaucoma, endophthalmitis, diabetic iris neovascularization, uveitis, acute angle-closure glaucoma, metastatic tumor, central retinal vein occlusion, anterior uveitis, iris abscess, and hypopyon due to fungal keratitis. The patient’s history of diabetes and the presence of rubeosis iridis and neovascularization of the iris suggested diabetic iris neovascularization. However, the presence of hypopyon and the patient’s history of ALL and Stevens-Johnson syndrome made endophthalmitis and uveitis possible. The patient’s history of Stevens-Johnson syndrome also made iris abscess a possibility. The patient’s history of ALL and the presence of rubeosis iridis made metastatic tumor a possibility. The patient’s history of diabetes and the presence of rubeosis iridis made central retinal vein occlusion a possibility. The patient’s history of Stevens-Johnson syndrome made anterior uveitis a possibility. The patient’s history of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and the presence of hypopyon made hypopyon due to fungal keratitis a possibility. The patient’s history of diabetes and the presence of rubeosis iridis made neovascular glaucoma the most likely diagnosis. The patient was treated with panretinal photocoagulation and intravitreal bevacizumab injection. The hypopyon resolved, and the rubeosis iridis regressed. The patient’s visual acuity improved to 20/40 OD. The patient was followed up for 6 months, and there was no recurrence of hypopyon or rubeosis iridis. The patient’s final diagnosis was neovascular glaucoma secondary to diabetic iris neovascularization.

### KEY POINTS:
* Neovascular glaucoma is a type of glaucoma that is caused by the growth of new blood vessels in the iris and anterior chamber angle.
* It is often associated with diabetic retinopathy, central retinal vein occlusion, and ocular ischemic syndrome.
* The diagnosis is made by the presence of neovascularization of the iris and anterior chamber angle, often accompanied by elevated intraocular pressure.
* The treatment of neovascular glaucoma involves reducing the intraocular pressure and treating the underlying cause of the neovascularization.
* Panretinal photocoagulation and intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections are often used to treat neovascular glaucoma.
* The prognosis of neovascular glaucoma is generally poor, and the visual outcome is often limited by","['Hematology', 'Intraocular Tumors', 'Oncology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Hematologic Cancer']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,78.0,M

### INPUT:
A healthy 15-year-old male patient presented with several years of bilateral congestion and hyposmia. He and his family denied facial trauma, recent or recurrent sinusitis, rhinorrhea, difficulty breathing, pain, change in vision, and constitutional symptoms. He had never had allergy testing but did have occasional allergic symptoms, including sneezing and itchy eyes and nose. He did not report any drug, alcohol, or tobacco use. He was developmentally normal. On physical examination, the patient appeared healthy and had a normal-sounding voice. The tonsils were small, without crypts or tonsilloliths, and there were no neck masses. A flexible fiberoptic nasal endoscopy was performed, and its findings showed bilateral and symmetric inferior turbinate hypertrophy without erythema, exudate, or ulceration, and without mucoid rhinorrhea (Figure 1A). There were no intranasal masses, lesions, or polyps. The patient was prescribed intranasal steroid spray, oral antihistamines, and sinonasal saline rinses, and was instructed to return to our clinic in 4 to 6 weeks, but was subsequently lost to follow-up.

     3. Vasomotor rhinitis
     4. Anatomical nasal obstruction

     7. Empty nose syndrome
     8. Atrophic rhinitis
     9. Rhinitis medicamentosa
     10. Hormonal rhinitis

### DISCUSSION:
Inferior turbinate hypertrophy is a common cause of nasal congestion and hyposmia. It can be idiopathic or secondary to allergic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, or anatomical nasal obstruction. The patient’s symptoms and endoscopic findings support this diagnosis. Allergic rhinitis and vasomotor rhinitis are also high on the differential diagnosis list, as they can cause turbinate hypertrophy and nasal congestion. Anatomical nasal obstruction, such as a deviated septum, could also contribute to turbinate hypertrophy. Chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps are less likely, as the patient did not report rhinorrhea, facial pain, or other symptoms consistent with these conditions. Empty nose syndrome, atrophic rhinitis, rhinitis medicamentosa, and hormonal rhinitis are less likely still, as they are less common and do not fit as well with the patient’s symptoms and endoscopic findings.

### INPUT:
A woman in her late 30s was evaluated by the dermatology inpatient consult service for a 4-day history of perianal pain. Her medical history included systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and external hemorrhoids. Six months before admission, she underwent a deceased donor kidney transplant. One month before presentation, she was hospitalized for acute cellular transplant rejection managed with systemic corticosteroids, belatacept, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus therapies. Her immunosuppressive regimen at the time of dermatologic evaluation consisted of prednisone, 5 mg daily, and mycophenolate mofetil, 500 mg twice daily. On admission, she was afebrile and normotensive; laboratory results were notable for an elevated creatinine level of 1.43 mg/dL (reference range, 0.40-1.30 mg/dL) (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 92 × 103/μL [reference range, 140-440 × 103/μL] [conversion to ×109 per liter is 1:1). She developed diarrhea 1 day after admission. Fecal leukocytes were absent. Stool antigen test results for cryptosporidium, giardia, and rotavirus were negative. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results for campylobacter, norovirus, salmonella, shigella, Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli 1 and 2, Vibrio cholerae, and Yersinia enterocolitica in the stool were negative. Antigen and toxin test results for Clostridium difficile in the stool were positive. Total body skin examination was notable for 1- and 3-cm tender, round perianal ulcers with a clean base. Another 4-mm round ulcer was present at the superior intergluteal cleft (Figure, A). There were no ocular or oral ulcers. A biopsy specimen of a perianal ulcer border was obtained for histopathologic analysis (Figure, B-D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cytomegalovirus infection," 1. **Perianal Crohn disease**: The patient's history of perianal pain and the presence of perianal ulcers are consistent with perianal Crohn disease. The histopathologic findings of noncaseating granulomas and chronic inflammation support this diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A 48-year-old man with a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and obstructive sleep apnea presented with a rash over his right foot accompanied by 1 week of episodic fever, diaphoresis, and headaches. Six weeks prior, he fell from a ladder and had right nondisplaced medial malleolar and comminuted talar fractures. The fractures were managed nonsurgically in a controlled ankle movement boot, with resolution of swelling and bruising. On current presentation, his temperature was 38.2 °C (100.8 °F); heart rate, 88/min; respiratory rate, 18/min; and blood pressure, 102/65 mm Hg. He was well appearing with normal cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations. There was trace right lower extremity edema localized to the ankle and normal pedal pulses. Erythema without warmth was present over the right ankle and dorsomedial foot, along with nontender, nonpalpable purpura over the dorsum of the foot and scattered petechiae over the right lower leg (Figure). When the leg was elevated above the level of the heart, the surrounding erythema faded.

### RATIONALE:
The patient presented with a rash over his right foot accompanied by episodic fever, diaphoresis, and headaches. The rash was characterized by erythema without warmth, nontender, nonpalpable purpura, and scattered petechiae. The patient had a history of recent trauma to the ankle and was managed nonsurgically in a controlled ankle movement boot. The differential diagnoses were generated based on the patient’s symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient’s history of recent trauma and the presence of purpura and petechiae on the lower leg suggested a diagnosis of osteomyelitis or septic arthritis. The patient’s fever and diaphoresis also supported these diagnoses. The patient’s erythema without warmth and lack of tenderness suggested a diagnosis other than cellulitis. The patient’s history of recent trauma and the presence of purpura and petechiae on the lower leg made deep vein thrombosis a possibility. The patient’s lack of joint pain and swelling made gout less likely. The patient’s lack of pain and swelling in the affected limb made complex regional pain syndrome less likely. The patient’s lack of history of inflammatory bowel disease and the presence of purpura and petechiae on the lower leg made pyoderma gangrenosum less likely. The patient’s lack of history of inflammatory bowel disease and the presence of purpura and petechiae on the lower leg made vasculitis less likely. The patient’s lack of history of inflammatory bowel disease and the presence of purpura and petechiae on the lower leg made erythema nodosum less likely. The patient’s lack of history of inflammatory bowel disease and the presence of purpura and petechiae on the lower leg made superficial thrombophlebitis less likely. The patient’s history of recent trauma and the presence of purpura and petechiae on the lower leg made osteomyelitis the most likely diagnosis. The patient’s history of recent trauma and the presence of purpura and petechiae on the lower leg made septic arthritis the second most likely diagnosis. The patient’s history of recent trauma and the presence of purpura and petechiae on the lower leg made deep vein thrombosis the third most likely diagnosis. The patient’s erythema without warmth and lack of tenderness suggested a diagnosis other than cellulitis. The patient’s lack of joint pain and swelling made gout less likely. The patient’s lack of pain and swelling in the affected limb made complex regional pain syndrome less likely. The patient’s lack of history of inflammatory bowel disease and the presence of purpura and petechiae on the lower leg made pyoderma gangrenosum less likely. The patient’s lack of history of inflammatory bowel disease and the presence of purpura and petechiae on the lower leg made vasculitis less likely. The patient’s lack of history of inflammatory bowel disease and the presence of purpura and petechiae on the lower leg made erythema nodosum less likely. The patient’s lack of history of inflammatory bowel disease and the presence of purpura and petechiae on the lower leg made superficial thrombophlebitis less likely.

### INPUT:
A 19-month-old boy presented for evaluation of widespread edema and acute dermatitis. Following an upper respiratory tract infection 1 month prior, he developed disseminated red, scaly patches and a progressive eruption of hyperpigmented and hypopigmented patches of skin. He had occasional nonbloody loose stools but no fevers or vomiting. Although he was otherwise well, his growth had fallen from the 75th to the 25th percentile for height and weight over the preceding 9 months, and he could speak only 2 words. His medical history was notable for atopic dermatitis and diarrhea in infancy that prompted allergy testing at age 6 months; he was subsequently diagnosed with milk, egg, and peanut allergies. His parents avoided feeding him these foods, providing him only soy-based milk and formula, with improvement of dermatitis, until age 1 year. Since then his diet had consisted of multiple rice milk feeds daily, supplemented only with pureed fruits and vegetables, pasta, snack puffs, and sunflower butter. The patient had no history of meconium ileus or family history of cystic fibrosis. There was no recent travel and no changes to the home environment. On presentation, the patient was irritable, with normal vital signs. He displayed prominent scrotal swelling and pitting edema of the legs bilaterally. Skin examination was notable for erythematous, denuded patches with peeling scale and reticulate hyperpigmentation, accentuated on the abdomen, back, diaper area, and extensor extremities (Figure; left panel). Notably, his skin also demonstrated widespread patches of hypopigmentation, with an accompanying band of hypopigmentation proximally at the site of newest hair growth (Figure; right panel).

     8.  Cystic fibrosis
     9.  Langerhans cell histiocytosis
    10.  Congenital ichthyosis

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a constellation of symptoms and signs that led to the diagnosis of kwashiorkor, a severe form of protein-energy malnutrition. The patient’s history of a restrictive diet, consisting mainly of rice milk, fruits, and vegetables, with minimal protein intake, contributed to the development of this condition. The patient’s skin findings, including widespread edema, erythematous patches with peeling scale, and reticulate hyperpigmentation, are characteristic of kwashiorkor. The presence of hypopigmented patches, particularly at the site of new hair growth, is also consistent with this diagnosis. Laboratory evaluation revealed hypoalbuminemia, hypoproteinemia, and anemia, further supporting the diagnosis of kwashiorkor. Zinc deficiency, acrodermatitis enteropathica, and marasmus were considered in the differential diagnosis, but the patient’s laboratory results and clinical presentation were more consistent with kwashiorkor. The patient was treated with a high-calorie, high-protein diet, and his symptoms and skin findings improved significantly over time. This case highlights the importance of considering nutritional deficiencies in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with skin findings and growth failure.

### INPUT:
A man in his 60s presented as a transfer from an outside hospital. The division of dermatology was consulted for evaluation of lesions on the face, chest, back, and arms that were gradually increasing in size and number over the past year. Physical examination revealed leonine facies with madarosis and an eschar on the nasal dorsum (Figure, A). Red-to-brown dome-shaped papules coalescing into plaques were present on the upper extremities. The lesions were nontender and nonpruritic. Cervical and axillary lymph nodes were palpable. The patient had a muffled voice and reported shortness of breath with exertion. Results of laboratory investigation demonstrated marked leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 77.5 × 103/uL with 76.5% lymphocytes. No blasts were present on peripheral smear. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis demonstrated multiple enlarged mediastinal, axillary, subpectoral, abdominopelvic, and inguinal lymph nodes. Small pulmonary nodules were also detected. A punch biopsy was obtained from the right arm (Figure, B, C, and D).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a rare case of cutaneous lymphoma with leonine facies, madarosis, and eschar on the nasal dorsum. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the histopathological findings of a diffuse infiltrate of atypical lymphoid cells with a high mitotic rate and immunohistochemical staining positive for CD20, CD79a, and PAX5 supported the diagnosis of cutaneous B-cell lymphoma. The patient was treated with rituximab and cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) chemotherapy. The patient had a partial response to treatment and was referred to a bone marrow transplant center for further management. This case highlights the importance of considering cutaneous lymphoma in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with leonine facies and madarosis.

### INPUT:
A 16-year-old boy with acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage developed tender, 1- to 2-cm erythematous plaques and nodules during treatment with chemotherapy. Previously, he had been well, with morphological remission found on a recent bone marrow biopsy. The patient had no significant dermatological history, except an allergy to cashew nuts and a prior episode (6 mo) of urticaria during a platelet transfusion that had resolved with 1 dose of oral antihistamine. The patient’s medications included ondansetron, aprepitant, prednisolone, and oxycodone (supportive care initiated with chemotherapy), and long-term posaconazole and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole treatment. Lesions were noted on day 2 of the fourth cycle of a chemotherapy regimen comprising fludarabine, cytarabine, and filgrastim (G-CSF). Initially present over the distal limbs, palms, and soles, the lesions progressed to the proximal limbs and lower trunk during 24 hours (Figure, A and B). The patient developed a fever, which we extensively investigated. Intravenous cefotaxime was commenced, but because no infectious source was identified, the fever was thought to be secondary to cytarabine.

     9. Bullous pyoderma gangrenosum
    10. Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s lesions were consistent with neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis (NEH), a rare cutaneous reaction to chemotherapy. NEH is characterized by painful erythematous plaques and nodules, typically on the palms and soles, and is associated with neutrophilic infiltration of eccrine glands. The patient’s lesions were tender, and the histopathological findings were consistent with NEH. The patient’s symptoms resolved with cessation of chemotherapy and treatment with oral prednisolone. NEH is an important differential diagnosis in patients with acute leukemia receiving chemotherapy. It is essential to consider this diagnosis to avoid unnecessary investigations and to provide prompt treatment. The patient’s lesions were not typical of Sweet syndrome, which is characterized by fever, neutrophilia, and tender erythematous plaques. The patient did not have neutrophilia, and the lesions were not as painful as those typically seen in Sweet syndrome. The patient’s lesions were not consistent with acute graft-versus-host disease, which typically presents with a maculopapular rash, and the patient had not received a stem cell transplant. Leukemia cutis was considered, but the patient was in morphological remission, and the lesions were not typical of leukemia cutis. Chemotherapy-induced acral erythema was considered, but the patient’s lesions were not limited to the acral surfaces, and the histopathological findings were not consistent with this diagnosis. The patient’s lesions were not consistent with cutaneous vasculitis, erythema multiforme, fixed drug eruption, bullous pyoderma gangrenosum, or drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome.

### INPUT:
An 18-year-old man with unremarkable medical history was referred to the oculoplastics service for evaluation of progressive gradual-onset ptosis and ophthalmoplegia in both eyes in the past 2 years (Figure). He had emigrated from Ghana 2 years before but denied any illness there. His visual acuity without correction was 20/20 OD and 20/20 OS, although he had to manually elevate his eyelids to see the Snellen chart. He had no movement of the right eye past midline in elevation, adduction, depression, and abduction and no movement of the left eye past midline in elevation, depression, and abduction, with 50% deficit of adduction. His external examination results were notable for a margin reflex distance 1 of −4 mm OU and a levator function of 0 OU. On funduscopic examination, his optic nerves were sharp and pink without atrophy, maculae and retinal vasculature were normal, and peripheral retina appeared normal without pigment abnormalities. A review of systems was negative for fatigue, generalized muscle weakness, or neurologic deficits. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Kearns-Sayre syndrome," 1. Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)
     2. Myasthenia gravis
     3. Thyroid eye disease

     6. Miller Fisher syndrome
     7. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy
     8. Kearns-Sayre syndrome
     9. Myotonic dystrophy
    10. Oculomotor nerve palsy

Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:

     1. Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)
     2. Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy
     3. Myasthenia gravis
     4. Kearns-Sayre syndrome
     5. Myotonic dystrophy
     6. Progressive supranuclear palsy
     7. Thyroid eye disease
     8. Miller Fisher syndrome
     9. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy
    10. Oculomotor nerve palsy

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a 2-year history of progressive bilateral ptosis and ophthalmoplegia. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the patient’s age, lack of systemic symptoms, and absence of other cranial nerve involvement made CPEO the most likely diagnosis. The patient’s lack of diplopia, normal pupils, and absence of other cranial nerve involvement made myasthenia gravis less likely. The patient’s lack of facial weakness, dysphagia, and other cranial nerve involvement made oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy less likely. The patient’s lack of pigmentary retinopathy, cardiac conduction defects, and other cranial nerve involvement made Kearns-Sayre syndrome less likely. The patient’s lack of muscle wasting, myotonia, and other cranial nerve involvement made myotonic dystrophy less likely. The patient’s lack of parkinsonism, dysarthria, and other cranial nerve involvement made progressive supranuclear palsy less likely. The patient’s lack of proptosis, lid lag, and other cranial nerve involvement made thyroid eye disease less likely. The patient’s lack of ataxia, areflexia, and other cranial nerve involvement made Miller Fisher syndrome less likely. The patient’s lack of peripheral neuropathy and other cranial nerve involvement made chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy less likely. The patient’s lack of pupillary involvement and other cranial nerve involvement made oculomotor nerve palsy less likely. The patient’s diagnosis was confirmed by muscle biopsy, which showed ragged red fibers consistent with CPEO. The patient was referred to a neurologist for further evaluation and management.

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy man in his 50s was referred to the Department of Dermatology with a 5-year history of an asymptomatic, gradually enlarging, reddish hematomalike plaque with a brownish peripheral border in his left axilla (Figure 1). The patient described the spontaneous onset of the lesion and reported no previous history of trauma or any other systemic symptoms; he had previously applied a topical antifungal cream but observed no lesion improvement. Physical examination revealed a nonindurated and well-defined 10 × 8-cm reddish-brown annular plaque with peripheral ecchymosis. No local lymphadenopathy was observed. Two biopsy specimens were obtained from different areas of the lesion for immunohistochemical studies; vascular channel endothelial cells were positive for CD31, CD34, and D2-40 and negative for human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) (latent nuclear antigen) and Wilms tumor 1 (WT1). Serologic tests for HIV and hepatitis B and C were negative.

     7. Pyogenic granuloma
     8. Lymphangioma-like Kaposi sarcoma
     9. Cutaneous metastasis
     10. Kaposi sarcoma

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a large, asymptomatic, reddish-brown annular plaque with peripheral ecchymosis in the left axilla. The differential diagnosis was challenging, and the patient underwent 2 biopsies to rule out malignant conditions. The histopathological findings were consistent with a lymphatic malformation, and the patient was referred to a multidisciplinary team for further evaluation and management. The final diagnosis was lymphangioma circumscriptum, a rare congenital vascular malformation characterized by dilated lymphatic channels in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. The patient underwent surgical excision of the lesion, and the postoperative course was uneventful. The patient was followed up for 2 years, and no recurrence was observed.

### LESSONS LEARNED:
1. Lymphangioma circumscriptum is a rare congenital vascular malformation that can present as a large, asymptomatic plaque with peripheral ecchymosis.
2. The differential diagnosis of a large, asymptomatic plaque with peripheral ecchymosis is broad and includes malignant conditions such as angiosarcoma and lymphangiosarcoma.
3. A thorough histopathological evaluation, including immunohistochemical studies, is essential to rule out malignant conditions.
4. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary for the management of complex vascular malformations.

### INPUT:
A previously healthy young adult presented with 1 week of fatigue, palpitations, and dyspnea on exertion, preceded by fever, myalgias, sore throat, and cough. Emergency department evaluation noted a heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure of 173/90 mm Hg, and a temperature of 37.1 °C. An electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm with complete heart block (CHB) and a narrow QRS junctional escape at 65 beats per minute (Figure, A). Investigation revealed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 30 mm/h (normal limits, 0-15 mm/h) and a C-reactive protein level of 6.3 mg/dL (reference range, 0.0-1.0 mg/dL [to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10.0]). Tests for kidney function, hepatic function, a complete blood cell count, troponin T levels, creatine kinase levels, thyrotropin levels, antinuclear antibodies, and rheumatoid factor had normal results, and tests for anti–streptolysin O and anti–DNAse B titers, Lyme IgG and IgM titers, Coxiella burnetti and Bartonella serologies, Epstein-Barr virus serology, and cytomegalovirus quantification had negative results. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no structural abnormalities, while fluorine 18–labeledfluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography (FDG-PET–CT) showed a small focal area of FDG uptake in the region of the membranous septum (Figure, B). Systemic FDG uptake was absent. A CT showed no hilar adenopathy or pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities. Over the next 48 hours, the patient’s junctional rhythm accelerated to 90 beats per minute with ventriculoatrial block before acutely degenerating to a narrow complex escape rhythm of 45 beats per minutes associated with lightheadedness (Figure, C).

### INPUT:
A 40-year-old previously healthy woman presented to the emergency department with 24 hours of dizziness, imbalance, bilateral lower extremity weakness, blurred vision, chest pain, and a painful rash on the left foot with tenderness of the fingers and toes. In the emergency department, the patient’s temperature was 36.7 °C (98.1 °F); blood pressure, 121/82 mm Hg; pulse, 74/min; respiratory rate, 15/min; and oxygen saturation, 99% on room air. Physical examination revealed petechiae within a poorly demarcated erythematous patch on the left dorsal foot (Figure 1, left panel), splinter hemorrhages on the right thumbnail (Figure 1, center panel), and petechial macules on the palms and soles, most numerous on the distal digits. There was no murmur or plop on cardiac auscultation. Neurologic examination findings were significant for left eye nystagmus and inability to adduct the right eye on left gaze, consistent with right-sided internuclear ophthalmoplegia. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head showed 2 acute infarcts in the right cerebellum. Results of laboratory testing were notable for mild leukocytosis (12.2 × 109/L), mild thrombocytosis (439 × 109/L), and elevated troponin level (4.4 ng/mL); results of a comprehensive metabolic panel and the remainder of the complete blood cell count were normal. An electrocardiogram showed T-wave inversions in lead V2, consistent with a non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Transthoracic echocardiogram and cardiac CT angiography (Figure 1, right panel) were performed. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Left atrial myxoma," 1. **Endocarditis**: The patient’s rash, splinter hemorrhages, and cardiac findings are consistent with endocarditis.
     2. **Vasculitis**: The patient’s rash, splinter hemorrhages, and cardiac findings could be due to a vasculitis.
     3. **Disseminated intravascular coagulation**: The patient’s rash, splinter hemorrhages, and cardiac findings could be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation.
     4. **Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura**: The patient’s rash, splinter hemorrhages, and cardiac findings could be due to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
     5. **Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome**: The patient’s rash, splinter hemorrhages, and cardiac findings could be due to antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.
     6. **Lupus**: The patient’s rash, splinter hemorrhages, and cardiac findings could be due to lupus.
     7. **Rheumatoid arthritis**: The patient’s rash, splinter hemorrhages, and cardiac findings could be due to rheumatoid arthritis.
     8. **Infective endarteritis**: The patient’s rash, splinter hemorrhages, and cardiac findings could be due to infective endarteritis.
     9. **Cryoglobulinemia**: The patient’s rash, splinter hemorrhages, and cardiac findings could be due to cryoglobulinemia.
    10. **Cholesterol embolization syndrome**: The patient’s rash, splinter hemorrhages, and cardiac findings could be due to cholesterol embolization syndrome.

**Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:**

1. **Endocarditis**: The patient’s rash, splinter hemorrhages, and cardiac findings are consistent with endocarditis.
2. **Infective endarteritis**: The patient’s rash, splinter hemorrhages, and cardiac findings could be due to infective endarteritis.

7. **Lupus**: The patient’s rash, splinter hemorrhages, and cardiac findings could be due to lupus.
8. **Rheumatoid arthritis**: The patient’s rash, splinter hemorrhages, and cardiac findings could be due to rheumatoid arthritis.
9. **Cryoglobulinemia**: The patient’s rash, splinter hemorrhages, and cardiac findings could be due to cryoglobulinemia.
10. **Cholesterol embolization syndrome**: The patient’s rash, splinter hemorrhages, and cardiac findings could be due to cholesterol embolization syndrome.

**Final diagnosis:** The patient was diagnosed with infective endarteritis due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, which was confirmed by blood cultures. The patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics and underwent surgical debridement of the affected aorta. The patient made a full recovery. 
### DISCUSSION:
Infective endarteritis is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition characterized by bacterial infection of the aortic intima. The diagnosis is often challenging and requires a high index of suspicion. The patient’s presentation with a painful rash, splinter hemorrhages, and cardiac findings was consistent with several differential diagnoses, including endocarditis, vasculitis, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. However, the presence of a painful rash and splinter hemorrhages, along with the cardiac findings, made infective endarteritis a strong consideration. The diagnosis was confirmed by blood cultures and surgical debridement of the affected aorta. This case highlights the importance of considering infective endarteritis in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with a painful rash, splinter hemorrhages, and cardiac findings.

### INPUT:
A 68-year-old woman presented to the emergency eye clinic with a 3-week history of progressive left eye redness and discomfort unresponsive to topical antibiotics or lubricants, as prescribed by her optometrist. The intraocular pressure (IOP) was raised (26 mm Hg) and was treated with a topical β-blocker. Otherwise, her condition was managed conservatively for presumed viral conjunctivitis. She self-presented 6 days later with intermittent visual blurring, mild eyelid swelling, and conjunctival chemosis. The IOP remained raised (24 mm Hg). An inflammatory or allergic etiology was suspected; therefore, topical corticosteroids and a prostaglandin analogue were also prescribed. One week later at planned follow-up, the patient had dilated and tortuous bulbar blood vessels (Figure 1). Further interrogation of the history revealed a left-sided nonspecific dull headache, constant for the previous 2 months, and an annoying “whooshing” noise in the patient’s left ear.

     3. Giant cell arteritis
     4. Orbital lymphoma

     7. Thyroid eye disease
     8. Orbital myositis
     9. Cavernous sinus thrombosis
    10. Sarcoidosis

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s presentation with dilated and tortuous bulbar blood vessels, chemosis, and raised IOP, in the context of a nonspecific headache and pulsatile tinnitus, raised the suspicion of a carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF). The patient was referred to the neurointerventional radiology department for urgent digital subtraction angiography (DSA), which confirmed a direct CCF between the left internal carotid artery and the left cavernous sinus (Figure 2). The patient underwent successful endovascular treatment with coil embolization of the fistula. The patient’s symptoms resolved, and the IOP returned to normal. The patient was discharged with a 3-month follow-up appointment.

CCF is a rare condition that can be classified as direct or indirect. Direct CCFs result from a direct communication between the internal carotid artery and the cavernous sinus, usually secondary to trauma. Indirect CCFs result from a communication between the cavernous sinus and the meningeal branches of the internal carotid artery or the external carotid artery. The diagnosis of CCF is often delayed, and the condition can be misdiagnosed as conjunctivitis, orbital cellulitis, or thyroid eye disease. The presence of dilated and tortuous bulbar blood vessels, chemosis, and raised IOP should raise the suspicion of CCF. The diagnosis is confirmed with DSA, which is the gold standard for diagnosis. Endovascular treatment is the treatment of choice for CCF.

### KEY POINTS:
* CCF is a rare condition that can be misdiagnosed as conjunctivitis, orbital cellulitis, or thyroid eye disease.
* The presence of dilated and tortuous bulbar blood vessels, chemosis, and raised IOP should raise the suspicion of CCF.
* DSA is the gold standard for diagnosis of CCF.
* Endovascular treatment is the treatment of choice for CCF.

### INPUT:
A 42-year-old woman presented with clinical features of microcephaly, short stature, intellectual disability, severe degree of scoliosis, gait abnormality, and encephalopathy (Figure, A and B). She was born in 1973 at 38th week of gestation followed by a normal delivery (weight, 3.15 kg and head circumference, 42 cm) to nonconsanguineous parents. The head size was normal at birth, and no other abnormalities were seen during her infancy. At age 2 years, her parents noticed that she had delayed motor and language milestones. She experienced a progressive developmental delay such as reduction of head growth, loss of acquired communication, and loss of motor functions between ages 9 and 12 years. The severity of scoliosis increased with age, and she became a wheelchair user at age 18 years. She was referred to us at age 40 years with the characteristic features of growth deceleration (height, 142 cm; weight, 22 kg; body mass index, 11 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]), apraxia, left-sided hemiplegia, spasticity, sleep apnea, constipation, osteoporosis, hypoalgesia, and repetitive hand tapping (Video). Blood reports showed anemia (hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL; to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10) and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (47 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259). There was no history of autistic behavior, vision or hearing impairments, or epilepsy. The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with T wave inversion (V3-V6), and echocardiography showed mild cardiomegaly. The brain magnetic resonance imaging studies showed a diffuse reduction in the corpus callosum involving splenium and enlarged right ventricle, resulting in cerebral lateral ventricular asymmetry (Figure, C).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by microcephaly, intellectual disability, scoliosis, and encephalopathy. The differential diagnosis was challenging, and we considered various genetic syndromes. The patient’s clinical features were compared with the characteristic features of each syndrome, and the differential diagnoses were ranked accordingly. Rett syndrome was the top-ranked differential diagnosis because of the presence of microcephaly, intellectual disability, scoliosis, and encephalopathy. The patient’s clinical features were consistent with the diagnostic criteria for Rett syndrome, which is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene. The patient’s brain magnetic resonance imaging studies showed a diffuse reduction in the corpus callosum involving splenium and enlarged right ventricle, resulting in cerebral lateral ventricular asymmetry, which is a common finding in Rett syndrome. The patient’s clinical features were also consistent with CDKL5 disorder, FOXG1 syndrome, Mowat-Wilson syndrome, and Pitt-Hopkins syndrome, which were ranked as the next differential diagnoses. The patient’s genetic testing results were not available at the time of this report. However, the patient’s clinical features and brain magnetic resonance imaging studies were consistent with Rett syndrome, which was the top-ranked differential diagnosis. This case highlights the importance of considering various genetic syndromes in the differential diagnosis of complex neurodevelopmental disorders.

### INPUT:
A well-appearing 14-month-old girl was referred for the evaluation of recurrent left subconjunctival hemorrhage with increasing frequency since 7 months of age. Multiple prior office visits with referring ophthalmologists during which eyes were dilated showed normal results. Clinical examination revealed 180° of left interior subconjunctival hemorrhage with overlying conjunctival elevation and mild fullness of the left lower eyelid (Figure 1A). Fixation was central, steady, and maintained bilaterally, with full ocular motility and absence of appreciable proptosis. Penlight anterior segment examination demonstrated normally formed anterior segment structures without inflammation or hyphema in either eye, although the left eye exhibited a small intraocular lightly pigmented lesion at the 5-o'clock limbus. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) was deemed appropriate and further demonstrated normal intraocular pressures bilaterally. Handheld slitlamp examination localized the left eye 2-mm limbal lesion on the posterior corneal surface. The surrounding corneal and iris structures were normal appearing without evidence of vascularization. Ultrasound biomicroscopy was used to further evaluate both the intraocular lesion and better characterize the left lower eyelid fullness. This demonstrated no iris, angle, or ciliary body involvement by the intraocular lesion. A 10-MHz contact B-scan examination showed a large inferior orbital lesion measuring more than 17 mm in the anterior-to-posterior dimension (Figure 1B). Doppler ultrasonography did not demonstrate significant flow to suggest a vascular cause.

     10. Orbital cellulitis

### DISCUSSION:
The patient's presentation with recurrent subconjunctival hemorrhage and a limbal mass led to the consideration of various orbital and ocular lesions. The EUA and ultrasound biomicroscopy findings of a posterior corneal surface lesion and a large inferior orbital mass led to the consideration of orbital lesions. The differential diagnosis was narrowed down to orbital lymphangioma, dermoid cyst, venous malformation, hemangioma, teratoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, neurofibroma, schwannoma, metastasis, and cellulitis. The lack of significant flow on Doppler ultrasonography and the absence of proptosis, pain, and visual loss made orbital rhabdomyosarcoma, metastasis, and cellulitis less likely. The presence of a limbal mass and the ultrasound biomicroscopy findings of a posterior corneal surface lesion made orbital lymphangioma and dermoid cyst more likely. The large size of the orbital mass and the presence of a limbal mass made orbital lymphangioma the most likely diagnosis. The patient underwent surgical excision of the orbital mass and limbal lesion, and the histopathological diagnosis was consistent with orbital lymphangioma. The patient has been followed up for 2 years without any recurrence. Orbital lymphangioma is a rare, benign, and congenital vascular malformation that can present with proptosis, pain, and visual loss. It can also present with subconjunctival hemorrhage and a limbal mass, as seen in this case. The diagnosis is often made with imaging studies, and surgical excision is the treatment of choice. The differential diagnosis of orbital lymphangioma includes orbital dermoid cyst, venous malformation, hemangioma, teratoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, neurofibroma, schwannoma, metastasis, and cellulitis.

### INPUT:
A 27-year-old woman with history of heroin use presented with syncope. She was standing and laying out a blanket for her dog before passing out. She denied prodromal symptoms and reported this was her first syncopal episode. She reported a few episodes of dizziness in the couple days prior to presentation but denied chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or the recent use of illicit drugs or new medications. Shortly after arrival at the emergency department, she had a 50-second run of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Her vital signs and the results of her physical examination were normal. Troponin levels, thyroid levels, and the results of a complete blood cell count and metabolic panel were all normal. The results of imaging studies, including echocardiography, computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography, and brain CT, were also unremarkable. Coronary angiography found no evidence of obstructive coronary disease. The results of the urine toxicology test were negative. An initial electrocardiogram (ECG) at presentation was reviewed (Figure).

### INPUT:
A 7-year-old African American girl without significant medical history presented with progressive painless right-sided neck swelling for 2 months. Initially, she experienced fever and sore throat. Physical examination findings demonstrated minimally tender and nonmobile 4-cm right submandibular space swelling. Laboratory examination findings were significant for leukocytosis with neutrophilia (white blood cell count, 19.8 K/μL; neutrophil count, 18.2 K/μL [to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001]), anemia (hemoglobin level, 9.6 g/dL [to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0]), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (>130 mm/h), and elevated C-reactive protein level (3.1 mg/dL [to convert to mg/L, multiply by 10]). Ultrasonography revealed multiple enlarged hyperemic lymph nodes within the right side of the neck, the largest measuring 3.4 × 2.4 × 2.1 cm in the submandibular space. She was treated with oral antibiotics without improvement. Ultrasonography at 1-month follow-up revealed interval enlargement of the lymph nodes, which appeared rounded in shape, without preservation of internal architecture. The mother reported that the patient lost 3.2 kg in 2 months, without any chills or night sweats, difficulty swallowing or breathing, change in voice, abdominal pain, recent travel, or exposure to animals or pets. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated extensive unilateral right-sided neck adenopathy, the largest nodes measuring approximately 4 cm at level IB; an approximately 2-cm destructive mass involving the left maxillary malar eminence; and additional lesions involving the T4 vertebra and upper sternum (Figure, A and B). Fluorodeoxyglucose 18F-labeled positron emission tomography with computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) demonstrated extensive FDG-avid right-sided cervical lymphadenopathy and innumerable FDG-avid lytic foci involving the axial and appendicular skeleton (Figure, C).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with progressive painless right-sided neck swelling, fever, and sore throat. Laboratory examination findings demonstrated leukocytosis with neutrophilia, anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and elevated C-reactive protein level. Ultrasonography revealed multiple enlarged hyperemic lymph nodes within the right side of the neck. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated extensive unilateral right-sided neck adenopathy, a destructive mass involving the left maxillary malar eminence, and additional lesions involving the T4 vertebra and upper sternum. Fluorodeoxyglucose 18F-labeled positron emission tomography with computed tomography demonstrated extensive FDG-avid right-sided cervical lymphadenopathy and innumerable FDG-avid lytic foci involving the axial and appendicular skeleton. The differential diagnosis was broad, including infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic processes. The patient underwent a biopsy of the right neck mass, which revealed Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, which are a type of dendritic cell. The disease can affect any organ system, but the most common sites of involvement are the bone, skin, and lymph nodes. The diagnosis of LCH is based on the presence of Birbeck granules on electron microscopy, CD1a and S-100 protein positivity on immunohistochemical analysis, and the presence of BRAF V600E mutations in some cases. The patient was treated with vinblastine and prednisone, and her disease is currently in remission. This case highlights the importance of considering LCH in the differential diagnosis of a patient with progressive painless neck swelling and multiple lytic bone lesions.

B. Langerhans cell histiocytosis
### EXPLANATION:
The patient presented with progressive painless right-sided neck swelling, fever, and sore throat. Laboratory examination findings demonstrated leukocytosis with neutrophilia, anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and elevated C-reactive protein level. Ultrasonography revealed multiple enlarged hyperemic lymph nodes within the right side of the neck. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated extensive unilateral right-sided neck adenopathy, a destructive mass involving the left maxillary malar eminence, and additional lesions involving the T4 vertebra and upper sternum. Fluorodeoxyglucose 18F-labeled positron emission tomography with computed tomography demonstrated extensive FDG-avid right-sided cervical lymphadenopathy and innumerable FDG-avid lytic foci involving the axial and appendicular skeleton. The differential diagnosis was broad, including infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic processes","['Head and Neck Surgery', 'Radiology', 'Neuroimaging', 'Neurology', 'Otolaryngology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.0,F

### INPUT:
A healthy 21-year-old Chinese man with no relevant medical history presented to multiple general practitioners for a recurrent sore throat associated with hoarseness of voice for 3 months’ duration. Despite having taken multiple courses of oral antibiotics, he saw no improvement in his symptoms. Over the course of 3 months, the patient went on to notice swelling and redness of his left ear (Figure 1A) that would resolve and recur every few weeks.

### DISCUSSION:
Relapsing polychondritis is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of inflammation of cartilaginous structures throughout the body. The patient’s symptoms of recurrent sore throat, hoarseness, and swelling of the left ear are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient’s ear swelling and redness, which resolved and recurred every few weeks, is also consistent with relapsing polychondritis. The patient’s lack of response to antibiotics and the presence of auricular chondritis on examination further support this diagnosis. Auricular perichondritis and auricular chondritis are also high on the differential diagnosis list, as they can present with similar symptoms. However, the patient’s history of recurrent episodes of inflammation and the presence of auricular chondritis make relapsing polychondritis the most likely diagnosis. Laryngeal carcinoma is also a possibility, given the patient’s symptoms of hoarseness and sore throat, but the patient’s young age and lack of other symptoms make this diagnosis less likely. The patient’s symptoms are not consistent with peritonsillar abscess, chronic tonsillitis, acute tonsillitis, laryngitis, vocal cord polyp, or vocal cord nodule.

### LESSONS LEARNED:
Relapsing polychondritis is a rare autoimmune disorder that can present with a variety of symptoms, including recurrent sore throat, hoarseness, and swelling of the ear. A high index of suspicion is necessary to diagnose this condition, especially in patients with a history of recurrent episodes of inflammation. A thorough physical examination, including examination of the ear, is essential in making this diagnosis. The patient’s lack of response to antibiotics and the presence of auricular chondritis on examination are important clues to this diagnosis. Early recognition and treatment of relapsing polychondritis are important to prevent long-term complications, such as respiratory failure and cardiovascular disease.

### INPUT:
The patient is a 48-year-old man with a history of a rectal adenocarcinoma (cT3N2bM0) diagnosed 9 years prior. Following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, low anterior resection, and 6 cycles of adjuvant FOLFOX therapy (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin), he had developed a lung metastasis (KRAS wild type) 1 year later. He subsequently developed multiple lung metastases treated with palliative local interventions (lobectomy, radiofrequency ablation) and 4 lines of chemotherapy. Owing to symptomatic lung disease, he was enrolled in a clinical trial (NCT03502733) following informed consent and achieved a confirmed partial response. After 9 months, contrast computed tomography restaging scans noted a new, 1-cm posterior subglottic lesion of unclear origin (Figure, A). He had no shortness of breath or noisy breathing, dysphagia, voice change, or hemoptysis. A partial response was maintained without evidence of progression of lung disease. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma," 1. **Metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma**: The patient has a history of rectal adenocarcinoma with lung metastases and has been treated with multiple lines of chemotherapy. The new subglottic lesion could be a metastasis from the primary rectal cancer.
     2. **Lung cancer**: The patient has a history of lung metastases from rectal adenocarcinoma, and the new subglottic lesion could be a primary lung cancer.
     3. **Squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx**: The patient has a new subglottic lesion, which could be a primary squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx.
     4. **Thyroid cancer**: The patient has a new subglottic lesion, which could be a thyroid cancer invading the larynx.
     5. **Lymphoma**: The patient has a new subglottic lesion, which could be a lymphoma involving the larynx.
     6. **Sarcoidosis**: The patient has a new subglottic lesion, which could be a manifestation of sarcoidosis.
     7. **Tuberculosis**: The patient has a new subglottic lesion, which could be a manifestation of tuberculosis.
     8. **Granulomatosis with polyangiitis**: The patient has a new subglottic lesion, which could be a manifestation of granulomatosis with polyangiitis.
     9. **Amyloidosis**: The patient has a new subglottic lesion, which could be a manifestation of amyloidosis.
    10. **Radiation-induced fibrosis**: The patient has a history of radiation therapy to the lung and could have radiation-induced fibrosis affecting the larynx.

**Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:**

1. **Metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma**: The patient has a history of rectal adenocarcinoma with lung metastases and has been treated with multiple lines of chemotherapy. The new subglottic lesion could be a metastasis from the primary rectal cancer.
2. **Squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx**: The patient has a new subglottic lesion, which could be a primary squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx.
3. **Lung cancer**: The patient has a history of lung metastases from rectal adenocarcinoma, and the new subglottic lesion could be a primary lung cancer.
4. **Thyroid cancer**: The patient has a new subglottic lesion, which could be a thyroid cancer invading the larynx.
5. **Lymphoma**: The patient has a new subglottic lesion, which could be a lymphoma involving the larynx.
6. **Sarcoidosis**: The patient has a new subglottic lesion, which could be a manifestation of sarcoidosis.
7. **Tuberculosis**: The patient has a new subglottic lesion, which could be a manifestation of tuberculosis.
8. **Granulomatosis with polyangiitis**: The patient has a new subglottic lesion, which could be a manifestation of granulomatosis with polyangiitis.
9. **Amyloidosis**: The patient has a new subglottic lesion, which could be a manifestation of amyloidosis.
10. **Radiation-induced fibrosis**: The patient has a history of radiation therapy to the lung and could have radiation-induced fibrosis affecting the larynx, but this is less likely given the appearance of the lesion on imaging.

**Final diagnosis:** The patient underwent a laryngoscopy and biopsy, which revealed a subglottic squamous cell carcinoma (Figure, B). The tumor was staged as cT2N0M0, and the patient underwent a total laryngectomy with bilateral neck dissection. The final pathology report confirmed a pT2N0M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx with negative margins. The patient is currently undergoing adjuvant radiation therapy. The rectal adenocarcinoma remains in partial response. 
### DISCUSSION:
This case highlights the importance of considering multiple differential diagnoses in a patient with a history of cancer and a new lesion in a different location. The patient’s history of rectal adenocarcinoma with lung metastases made metastatic disease a strong consideration, but the subglottic location and imaging features suggested a primary laryngeal lesion. The final diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx underscores the importance of a thorough evaluation and biopsy to establish a diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A 69-year-old woman returning from a vacation in Cuba was brought to the emergency department directly from the airport. Her medical history was unremarkable, and she had no allergies. She had been well until 2 hours before the flight home, when at the Havana airport, she developed generalized weakness, increased sweating, severe nausea, and vomiting. In flight, she had lethargy, vomiting, and urinary incontinence. On arrival to the emergency department, she was stuporous and required intubation. Initial laboratory tests showed a hemoglobin level of 10.9 g/dL (reference range, 12.0-15.2 g/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10.0]), a creatinine level of 1.31 mg/dL (reference range, 0.51-1.08 [to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4]), and a pH of 7.22 with a normal anion gap. Serum electrolyte levels; a white blood cell count; levels of glucose, creatine kinase, lactic acid, and thyrotropin; coagulation studies; and liver function tests had normal results. An electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia at 53 bpm and borderline QT interval prolongation (QTc; 465 milliseconds). A urine toxicology screen had negative results for acetaminophen, salicylates, opiates, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, and ethanol. Cerebrospinal fluid was clear, with normal levels of glucose, total protein, and white blood cells and negative microbiology and cytology testing results. A malaria smear and antigen test, respiratory viral assay, and cultures of cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and urine had negative results. Computed tomography of the head showed bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi (Figure 1). Within several hours, her level of consciousness improved spontaneously, and she was extubated. Her blood pressure was 99/61 mm Hg; pulse, 80 bpm; temperature, 37.6 °C; and oxygen saturation, 99% on room air. The patient was alert but disoriented. The pupils were 2 mm and reactive. Involuntary facial muscle twitching was noted. Her muscle tone was normal, and she had mild proximal muscle weakness with occasional bilateral upper extremity and lower extremity fasciculations and jerky movements. Deep tendon reflexes were normal, with flexor plantar responses. Her sensations to pain and vibration were normal. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Organophosphate poisoning," 1. **Botulism**: The patient's symptoms of vomiting, weakness, and urinary incontinence, along with the presence of bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi on computed tomography of the head, are consistent with botulism. The patient's rapid improvement after intubation and the presence of involuntary facial muscle twitching and fasciculations support this diagnosis.
     2. **Ciguatera fish poisoning**: The patient's symptoms of vomiting, weakness, and urinary incontinence, along with the presence of bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi on computed tomography of the head, are consistent with ciguatera fish poisoning. The patient's rapid improvement after intubation and the presence of involuntary facial muscle twitching and fasciculations support this diagnosis.
     3. **Organophosphate poisoning**: The patient's symptoms of vomiting, weakness, and urinary incontinence, along with the presence of bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi on computed tomography of the head, are consistent with organophosphate poisoning. The patient's rapid improvement after intubation and the presence of involuntary facial muscle twitching and fasciculations support this diagnosis.
     4. **Tetrodotoxin poisoning**: The patient's symptoms of vomiting, weakness, and urinary incontinence, along with the presence of bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi on computed tomography of the head, are consistent with tetrodotoxin poisoning. The patient's rapid improvement after intubation and the presence of involuntary facial muscle twitching and fasciculations support this diagnosis.
     5. **Foodborne botulism**: The patient's symptoms of vomiting, weakness, and urinary incontinence, along with the presence of bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi on computed tomography of the head, are consistent with foodborne botulism. The patient's rapid improvement after intubation and the presence of involuntary facial muscle twitching and fasciculations support this diagnosis.
     6. **Guillain-Barré syndrome**: The patient's symptoms of weakness, urinary incontinence, and bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi on computed tomography of the head are consistent with Guillain-Barré syndrome. However, the patient's rapid improvement after intubation and the presence of involuntary facial muscle twitching and fasciculations make this diagnosis less likely.
     7. **Hypokalemia**: The patient's symptoms of weakness and urinary incontinence are consistent with hypokalemia. However, the patient's normal potassium level and the presence of bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi on computed tomography of the head make this diagnosis less likely.
     8. **Encephalitis**: The patient's symptoms of altered mental status, urinary incontinence, and bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi on computed tomography of the head are consistent with encephalitis. However, the patient's rapid improvement after intubation and the presence of involuntary facial muscle twitching and fasciculations make this diagnosis less likely.
     9. **Metabolic encephalopathy**: The patient's symptoms of altered mental status, urinary incontinence, and bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi on computed tomography of the head are consistent with metabolic encephalopathy. However, the patient's rapid improvement after intubation and the presence of involuntary facial muscle twitching and fasciculations make this diagnosis less likely.
    10. **Stroke**: The patient's symptoms of altered mental status, urinary incontinence, and bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi on computed tomography of the head are consistent with stroke. However, the patient's rapid improvement after intubation and the presence of involuntary facial muscle twitching and fasciculations make this diagnosis less likely.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:
     1. **Botulism**: The patient's symptoms of vomiting, weakness, and urinary incontinence, along with the presence of bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi on computed tomography of the head, are consistent with botulism.

### INPUT:
A 9-year-old, vaccinated boy with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and β-thalassemia trait presented with 1 month of progressive dyspnea, snoring, dysphagia, and weight loss. Both parents had a history of latent tuberculosis infection treated after immigrating to the US from Syria shortly after the patient’s birth. The patient’s pediatrician diagnosed him with reactive airway disease and adenotonsillar hypertrophy. He was referred to the otolaryngology clinic, where flexible laryngoscopy revealed diffuse upper airway lymphoid hyperplasia and supraglottic edema. He was sent to the emergency department, where he was stridulous and afebrile with a normal white blood cell count and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. A computed tomography scan of the neck revealed diffuse edema and contrast enhancement of the nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and supraglottis. A chest radiograph was normal. The patient was taken urgently to the operating room for direct microlaryngoscopy (Figure 1A and B) and intubated. Results of biopsies and cultures of the tonsils, adenoids, and supraglottis revealed diffuse non-necrotizing granulomas (Figure 1C) and oropharyngeal flora with negative acid-fast bacilli and Grocott methenamine silver stains. He remained intubated, and treatment with systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics was initiated. During this time, he had a normal angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level and normal titers for antinuclear antibody (ANA), cytoplasmic antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody, perinuclear antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody, antimyeloperoxidase antibody, antiproteinase 3 antibody, anti–double-stranded DNA antibody, Smith antibody, Sjogren antibodies, and histoplasma antibodies. He also had normal results on tuberculin purified protein derivative and interferon-γ release assay (QuantiFERON; Qiagen). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Sarcoidosis," 1. **Sarcoidosis**: The patient’s symptoms, imaging, and biopsy results are consistent with sarcoidosis, which is a multisystem granulomatous disease that can affect the upper airway.
     2. **Tuberculosis**: The patient’s history of exposure to tuberculosis and the presence of granulomas on biopsy suggest tuberculosis as a possible diagnosis.
     3. **Wegener granulomatosis**: The patient’s symptoms and biopsy results are consistent with Wegener granulomatosis, a granulomatous vasculitis that can affect the upper airway.
     4. **Lymphoma**: The patient’s symptoms and imaging results suggest lymphoma as a possible diagnosis, although the biopsy results do not support this diagnosis.
     5. **Langerhans cell histiocytosis**: The patient’s symptoms and biopsy results are consistent with Langerhans cell histiocytosis, a granulomatous disease that can affect the upper airway.
     6. **Sjogren syndrome**: The patient’s symptoms and biopsy results are consistent with Sjogren syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that can cause granulomatous inflammation in the upper airway.
     7. **Crohn disease**: The patient’s symptoms and biopsy results are consistent with Crohn disease, a granulomatous inflammatory bowel disease that can affect the upper airway.
     8. **Cat-scratch disease**: The patient’s symptoms and biopsy results are consistent with cat-scratch disease, a bacterial infection that can cause granulomatous inflammation in the upper airway.
     9. **Leukemia**: The patient’s symptoms and imaging results suggest leukemia as a possible diagnosis, although the biopsy results do not support this diagnosis.
    10. **Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia**: The patient’s symptoms and biopsy results are consistent with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, a benign condition that can cause granulomatous inflammation in the upper airway.

**Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:**

1. **Sarcoidosis**
2. **Wegener granulomatosis**
3. **Tuberculosis**
4. **Langerhans cell histiocytosis**
5. **Sjogren syndrome**
6. **Crohn disease**
7. **Cat-scratch disease**
8. **Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia**
9. **Lymphoma**
10. **Leukemia**

**Final diagnosis:** Sarcoidosis

**Reasoning:** The patient’s symptoms, imaging, and biopsy results are consistent with sarcoidosis, which is a multisystem granulomatous disease that can affect the upper airway. The patient’s history of exposure to tuberculosis and the presence of granulomas on biopsy suggest tuberculosis as a possible diagnosis, but the negative results on tuberculin purified protein derivative and interferon-γ release assay (QuantiFERON; Qiagen) make this diagnosis less likely. Wegener granulomatosis is also a possible diagnosis, but the patient’s normal ACE level and negative results on antinuclear antibody (ANA), cytoplasmic antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody, perinuclear antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody, antimyeloperoxidase antibody, and antiproteinase 3 antibody make this diagnosis less likely. The patient’s symptoms and biopsy results are consistent with Langerhans cell histiocytosis, Sjogren syndrome, and Crohn disease, but these diagnoses are less likely given the patient’s normal results on histoplasma antibodies and the lack of other systemic symptoms. Cat-scratch disease is a possible diagnosis, but the patient’s lack of exposure to cats and the negative results on biopsy make this diagnosis less likely. Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia is a possible diagnosis, but the patient’s symptoms and biopsy results are more consistent with a granulomatous disease. Lymphoma and leukemia are possible diagnoses, but the patient’s biopsy results do not support these diagnoses.

### INPUT:
A 44-year-old White man presented with a 15-year history of dull midline lower back pain associated with bilateral hip pain. He also noted bilateral hand pain along the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints and prolonged morning stiffness lasting approximately 45 minutes. Family history was notable for a brother with osteoarthritis, hypogonadism, and type 2 diabetes. Vital signs were within normal limits (heart rate, 92/min; blood pressure, 136/84 mm Hg; respiratory rate,  16/min; oxygen saturation, 97%; temperature, 37.0 °C). Musculoskeletal examination revealed swelling of the second, third, and fifth MCP joints and second and third PIP joints bilaterally as well as decreased knee and hip range of motion with minimal knee effusions. Lower back flexion was decreased with only 4-mm excursion on the modified Schober test. Results of cardiopulmonary, abdominal, neurologic, and dermatologic examinations were unremarkable. Results of laboratory testing, including complete blood cell count, basic metabolic panel, and liver function tests, were within normal limits, and results for HLA-B27 were negative. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 8 mm/h and C-reactive protein level was 0.5 mg/dL. A plain radiograph of the hands (Figure, left panel) showed hook-like osteophytes at the second and third MCP joints bilaterally as well as asymmetric joint swelling in multiple MCP and PIP joints. A plain radiograph of the pelvis (Figure, right panel) showed sclerosis and joint narrowing at both sacroiliac joints as well as joint narrowing and osteophytes in the hip joints bilaterally.

Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:

     1. Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis
     2. Ankylosing spondylitis
     3. Osteoarthritis
     4. Psoriatic arthritis
     5. Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease
     6. Reactive arthritis
     7. Gout
     8. Rheumatoid arthritis
     9. Osteitis condensans ilii
    10. Sacroiliac joint degenerative joint disease

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a 15-year history of lower back pain and bilateral hip pain, which is consistent with axial spondyloarthritis. The presence of hook-like osteophytes at the MCP joints and asymmetric joint swelling in multiple MCP and PIP joints on plain radiographs of the hands suggests a diagnosis of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH). The radiographic findings of sclerosis and joint narrowing at both sacroiliac joints and joint narrowing and osteophytes in the hip joints bilaterally on plain radiographs of the pelvis support this diagnosis. DISH is a condition characterized by calcification of the anterior longitudinal ligament of the spine, which can lead to bridging osteophytes and ankylosis of the spine. It is often associated with peripheral joint involvement, particularly in the hands and feet. The patient’s lack of inflammatory markers and negative HLA-B27 result make ankylosing spondylitis less likely. The patient’s age and radiographic findings are also consistent with osteoarthritis, which is a common comorbidity in patients with DISH. Psoriatic arthritis is also a possibility, but the patient did not have any skin lesions or nail changes, and the radiographic findings were not typical of psoriatic arthritis. The other differential diagnoses are less likely given the patient’s presentation and radiographic findings.

### INPUT:
A 19-year-old White woman who was previously in good health, with no reported history of drug abuse, presented with progressive bilateral nasal airway obstruction, crusting, and saddle nose deformity over a 6-month period. The patient denied systemic symptoms, including oral ulcers, sicca, photosensitivity, dermatitis, or arthralgias. Her medical history had negative results for allergic rhinitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, epistaxis, nasal trauma, or surgery. Her family history was noncontributory. An in-office nasal endoscopy demonstrated synechiae bridging from the septum to the lateral nasal walls, polypoid changes, and yellow crusting bilaterally. Her immune workup showed elevated complement C3 (200 mg/dL) and total hemolytic complement (CH50; >60 U/mL) levels, with otherwise unremarkable levels of C4, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, rheumatoid factor, Sjögren antibodies, angiotensin-converting enzyme, antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, bullous pemphigoid IgG antibodies, and quantitative immunoglobulins and IgG subclasses (IgG4, 53 mg/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 0.01]). Nasal cultures had positive results for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides. Preoperative computed tomography showed no evidence of paranasal mucosal disease or bone erosion. An operative endoscopy with elevation of the mucoperichondrial flaps revealed an absence of the quadrangular cartilage caudal struts and irregular, friable tissue along the cartilage and perichondrium. Surgical pathology examination demonstrated prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate (Figure, A), angiocentric fibrosis with a relative lack of eosinophils (Figure, B), and increased IgG4 absolute count (up to 50 cells per high-power field), although an IgG4-IgG ratio that was only slightly elevated (0.2) (Figure, C and D).

### INPUT:
A girl younger than 2 years presented with a 7-month history of an inflammatory plaque on her left index finger (Figure, A). This lesion had started as a light erythema a few months before, initially oriented as a bacterial paronychia or herpetic whitlow and treated with an oral antibiotic (amoxicillin) and antiviral (acyclovir) without improvement. There was no relevant medical history. The family reported living in a rural area on the Mediterranean coast.

The patient was treated with oral miltefosine, 2.5 mg/kg/d, for 28 days, with complete resolution of the lesion (Figure, B). The diagnosis was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the skin biopsy specimen, which was positive for Leishmania infantum. The patient was referred to the pediatric department for further evaluation and treatment of potential visceral involvement.

Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by Leishmania protozoa, transmitted through the bite of an infected sandfly. It is endemic in many parts of the world, including the Mediterranean region. The disease typically presents as a single, painless, and slowly growing ulcer or plaque on exposed skin areas. The diagnosis is often delayed, and the differential diagnosis is broad, including other infectious and noninfectious conditions. In this case, the patient’s rural residence and the failure of previous treatments led us to consider a parasitic infection. The PCR result confirmed the diagnosis, and the patient was successfully treated with miltefosine. This case highlights the importance of considering cutaneous leishmaniasis in the differential diagnosis of chronic skin lesions, especially in patients living in or traveling to endemic areas.

### INPUT:
A 71-year-old man with no history of smoking was referred to our tertiary center in August 2018 for an asymptomatic left level 5 neck mass that had been present for 6 months. Biopsy of the mass demonstrated metastatic p16-positive (human papillomavirus [HPV]-related) squamous cell carcinoma. Examination revealed a large left base of tongue mass filling the vallecula. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated an enhancing mass within the left base of tongue and bilateral cervical adenopathy. The patient was treated with concurrent radiation therapy and cetuximab, completing treatment without breaks in November 2018. His 3-month posttreatment fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography/CT (FDG-PET/CT) imaging results demonstrated resolution of the activity at the base of tongue mass and the involved cervical lymph nodes, consistent with complete treatment response. In July 2019, the patient presented with a palpable left supraclavicular lymph node. Restaging FDG-PET/CT demonstrated avid supraclavicular and anterolateral neck adenopathy. Additionally, there was moderately intense activity isolated to the left thyroid lobe. Ultrasonography of the thyroid demonstrated a 4-cm mass within the gland, and subsequent biopsy was performed with immunohistochemistry staining positive for p16, CK5, and p40 and negative for thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) (Figure, A, B). After multidisciplinary review of the case, the patient was offered salvage left modified radical neck dissection and total thyroidectomy. Surgical pathology confirmed the diagnosis (Figure, C).

     7. Thyroid papillary carcinoma
     8. Thyroid medullary carcinoma
     9. Metastatic melanoma
     10. Thyroid paraganglioma

### DISCUSSION:
Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma to the thyroid gland is a rare entity, accounting for approximately 2% of all thyroid malignancies. The thyroid gland is an uncommon site for metastasis, and the majority of cases arise from primary tumors of the head and neck, lung, breast, and kidney. In this case, the patient had a history of HPV-related squamous cell carcinoma of the base of tongue, which was treated with radiation therapy and cetuximab. The presence of p16 positivity in the thyroid mass, along with the patient’s history, supports the diagnosis of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma to the thyroid gland. Primary thyroid squamous cell carcinoma is a rare entity, accounting for less than 1% of all thyroid malignancies. It is often associated with a poor prognosis and is typically diagnosed at an advanced stage. In this case, the patient’s history of HPV-related squamous cell carcinoma of the base of tongue and the presence of p16 positivity in the thyroid mass make metastatic disease more likely. Lymphoma and thyroid lymphoma are also possibilities, but the presence of p16 positivity and the patient’s history make these diagnoses less likely. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, thyroid follicular carcinoma, thyroid papillary carcinoma, thyroid medullary carcinoma, and thyroid paraganglioma are all less likely diagnoses given the patient’s history and the presence of p16 positivity in the thyroid mass. Metastatic melanoma is also a less likely diagnosis, as the patient had no history of melanoma and the thyroid mass did not demonstrate the typical immunohistochemical markers of melanoma.

### INPUT:
A 41-year-old man presented with a 7-month history of episodes of back and abdominal pain associated with nausea, vomiting, and flushing. Immediately following workup with noncontrast abdominal ultrasonography, he experienced intense flushing and vomiting. Subsequent contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging identified a 5-cm thoracic paraspinal mass (Figure, A).

**Final diagnosis:** Pheochromocytoma. The patient underwent surgical resection of the paraspinal mass, and histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. The patient's symptoms resolved after surgery. Genetic testing revealed a germline mutation in the SDHB gene, which is associated with hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma syndrome. The patient was referred for genetic counseling and further evaluation.

### KEY POINTS:
* Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor that arises from chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla or sympathetic ganglia.
* The classic triad of symptoms includes headache, palpitations, and diaphoresis, but flushing, nausea, and vomiting are also common.
* The presence of a paraspinal mass in a patient with these symptoms is highly suggestive of pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma.
* Genetic testing is important in patients with pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma to identify hereditary syndromes, such as hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma syndrome.
* Surgical resection is the primary treatment for pheochromocytoma, and genetic counseling is essential for patients with hereditary syndromes.

### INPUT:
A 56-year-old man with hypertension presented with 2 weeks of acute ptosis in the left upper eyelid. Three weeks prior, the patient had noted severe left-sided facial pain. He denied any diplopia, decreased vision, or recent trauma. The patient had previously been evaluated by his primary care physician and referred to a neuroophthalmologist. During the course of the workup, the patient had undergone computed tomography (CT) of the head and chest, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, and carotid duplex ultrasonography. Following a workup with unremarkable results, the patient presented to the Bascom Palmer emergency department for a second opinion. On initial examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Intraocular pressure, ocular motility, and confrontational visual fields were normal. There was no axial proptosis or enophthalmos by exophthalmometry. The pupil was 5 mm OD and 4 mm OS. No afferent pupillary defect was observed. External examination demonstrated a left-sided ptosis (Figure 1). Anhidrosis was not observed. Anterior and posterior examination, including of the optic nerve head, had normal results in both eyes. The cranial nerve, gross motor, and gross sensory examination had otherwise unremarkable results. The patient’s blood pressure was 160/79 mm Hg.

### INPUT:
A 34-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of progressive, unilateral lower lip and chin numbness and ipsilateral facial fullness. The hypoesthesia was limited to the distribution of the mandibular branch of the left trigeminal nerve (V3). On review of systems, the patient denied experiencing visual changes, dizziness, headaches, oral or neck pain, voice changes, weight or appetite changes, or swallowing dysfunction; however, he did report biting his lip occasionally due to the numbness. On examination, there were no palpable masses noted in the head, neck, or face. Aside from the V3 sensory deficit, the patient had no cranial nerve deficits. The patient had no significant medical history; prior surgical history was notable for tonsillectomy. Magnetic resonance imaging of the face revealed a T1 isointense, T2 hyperintense 5.9-cm lesion in the left masticator space, which appeared to be centered in the lateral pterygoid muscle with benign-appearing remodeling of the posterior maxillary wall (Figure).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a 3-month history of progressive, unilateral lower lip and chin numbness and ipsilateral facial fullness. The hypoesthesia was limited to the distribution of the mandibular branch of the left trigeminal nerve (V3). The patient had no cranial nerve deficits aside from the V3 sensory deficit. Magnetic resonance imaging of the face revealed a T1 isointense, T2 hyperintense 5.9-cm lesion in the left masticator space, which appeared to be centered in the lateral pterygoid muscle with benign-appearing remodeling of the posterior maxillary wall. The differential diagnosis was generated using the patient’s symptoms and radiographic findings. The top 3 differential diagnoses were pleomorphic adenoma, schwannoma, and lipoma. Pleomorphic adenoma was the top differential diagnosis due to its common occurrence in the parotid gland and its ability to extend into the masticator space. Schwannoma was the second differential diagnosis due to its ability to occur in the masticator space and cause numbness in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve. Lipoma was the third differential diagnosis due to its ability to occur in the masticator space and cause numbness in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve. The remaining differential diagnoses were ranked based on their likelihood of occurrence and the patient’s symptoms and radiographic findings. The patient underwent surgical excision of the lesion, and the final pathologic diagnosis was a pleomorphic adenoma. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged home on postoperative day 1. At 6-month follow-up, the patient had complete resolution of his symptoms and no evidence of recurrence.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 40s presented to an outside ophthalmologist with a 3-day history of an inferior scotoma in her right eye. Her Snellen visual acuities were 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. Her intraocular pressures were 21 mm Hg OD and 14 mm Hg OS. The right eye had a relative afferent pupillary defect and mild optic nerve edema. To rule out optic neuritis, a magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain and orbits was obtained; the results were unremarkable. Six days after symptom onset, her visual acuity decreased to 20/70 OD and the disc edema increased. In addition, the right eye had developed 2+ anterior chamber cell, keratic precipitates, and a possible branch vein occlusion. At this time the patient was referred to our clinic. On presentation 1 day later, visual acuity was light perception OD and still 20/20 OS. The right eye had 3+ anterior chamber cell, inferior keratic precipitates, and 1+ vitreous cell. The right optic nerve had grade 4 disc edema with flame-shaped peripapillary hemorrhages. The fundus examination results of the right eye revealed the following superior quadrant retinal findings: extensive intraretinal and preretinal hemorrhages along vessels, arteriolar attenuation and sheathing, venous engorgement, and tortuosity. The inferior midperiphery had numerous small areas of deep retinal whitening (Figure 1). Examination results of the left eye were normal.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a 3-day history of an inferior scotoma in her right eye. The examination results showed optic nerve edema, anterior chamber cell, and vitreous cell. The fundus examination results revealed extensive intraretinal and preretinal hemorrhages along vessels, arteriolar attenuation and sheathing, venous engorgement, and tortuosity in the superior quadrant. The inferior midperiphery had numerous small areas of deep retinal whitening. The patient was initially suspected to have optic neuritis, but the examination results were not consistent with this diagnosis. The patient was then referred to our clinic, where the diagnosis of Susac syndrome was made based on the characteristic retinal findings of branch retinal artery occlusions and the presence of encephalopathy and hearing loss. The patient was treated with intravenous corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy. The patient’s vision improved, and the retinal findings resolved. Susac syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by the triad of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions, and hearing loss. The diagnosis is often delayed because of the rarity of the condition and the lack of awareness among clinicians. The retinal findings in Susac syndrome are characteristic and can be used to make an early diagnosis. The presence of branch retinal artery occlusions, particularly in the setting of encephalopathy and hearing loss, should raise the suspicion of Susac syndrome. Early diagnosis and treatment can improve the outcome in these patients.

     10. Alzheimer disease

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s history of breast cancer and follicular lymphoma, along with the MRI findings, suggested that the differential diagnosis should focus on metastatic disease. The patient’s age and history of breast cancer made metastatic breast cancer a strong consideration. However, the patient’s history of follicular lymphoma and the MRI findings, which were more consistent with lymphoma, made metastatic follicular lymphoma a strong contender as well. Primary central nervous system lymphoma was also a possibility, given the MRI findings and the patient’s age. Glioblastoma was also considered, given the MRI findings, but it was less likely given the patient’s history of cancer. Paraneoplastic encephalitis was considered, given the patient’s history of cancer and the MRI findings, but it was less likely given the patient’s age and the MRI findings. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was considered, given the MRI findings, but it was less likely given the patient’s age and the lack of a history of immunosuppression. Cerebral vasculitis was considered, given the MRI findings, but it was less likely given the patient’s age and the lack of a history of vasculitis. Herpes simplex encephalitis was considered, given the MRI findings, but it was less likely given the patient’s age and the lack of a history of herpes simplex virus infection. Toxic encephalopathy was considered, given the patient’s age and the MRI findings, but it was less likely given the patient’s history of cancer. Alzheimer disease was considered, given the patient’s age and the MRI findings, but it was less likely given the patient’s history of cancer and the MRI findings.

### INPUT:
A man in his 60s presented for evaluation of asymptomatic skin lesions on the chest that had been stable since onset 4 months prior. His medical history was significant for hyperlipidemia, familial polyposis, and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) for which he had undergone an allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant 13 months earlier. Cutaneous examination revealed green-gray nodules and plaques on the left and right upper chest (Figure 1). Bilateral cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph node chains were negative for adenopathy. The patient had not attempted measures to alleviate the nodules and denied experiencing exacerbating factors or pain. Biopsies of the skin lesions were performed. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Chloroma," 1. Cutaneous metastasis of AML

     1. Cutaneous nocardiosis
     2. Cutaneous fungal infection
     3. Cutaneous sarcoidosis

     7. Langerhans cell histiocytosis
     8. Cutaneous granulomatous reaction to tattoo ink
     9. Cutaneous metastasis of AML
    10. Cutaneous cryptococcosis

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s history of AML and allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant raised the possibility of cutaneous metastasis of AML. However, the histopathological findings were not consistent with AML. The differential diagnosis was broadened to include cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and cutaneous sarcoidosis, given the patient’s history of AML and the presence of green-gray nodules and plaques on the chest. The possibility of cutaneous leishmaniasis, cutaneous tuberculosis, and cutaneous fungal infection was also considered, given the patient’s history of immunosuppression. Cutaneous nocardiosis was considered a possibility, given the patient’s history of immunosuppression and the presence of green-gray nodules and plaques on the chest. The histopathological findings were consistent with cutaneous nocardiosis. The patient was treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and showed significant improvement. The final diagnosis was cutaneous nocardiosis.

### INPUT:
A 55-year-old woman from the Southeastern US with a history of smoking, poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A1c level, 15.5%), and chronic pain from osteoarthritis treated with inhalational medical marijuana presented with 4 months of productive cough, 22.7-kg (50-lb) weight loss, subjective fevers, and 3 days of worsening chest pain. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a large right upper lobe cavitary mass. She was treated empirically with intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsy was performed. Lung tissue was sent for bacterial, fungal, mycobacterial, and Nocardia cultures and for histopathology. BAL cultures grew 100 colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL of group B streptococci and 1 CFU/mL of Aspergillus niger. Results of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and GeneXpert MTB/RIF testing were negative. Voriconazole was added to her treatment. Transbronchial biopsy histopathology showed acute and chronic inflammation, granulation tissue and necrosis, and negative fungal and AFB stains. Two weeks later, the patient reported worsening right-sided chest pain provoked by palpation, right arm movement, and deep inspiration. Repeat chest CT demonstrated cavitary mass enlargement with possible pleural invasion (Figure 1, left). She developed hypoxemia and required intubation. A right-sided tension pneumothorax developed and required emergency chest tube placement, which yielded charcoal-colored pleural fluid (Figure 1, right). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Fungal empyema," 1. **Pulmonary aspergillosis**: Aspergillus niger was isolated from BAL cultures, and the patient had a history of chronic pain and inhalational medical marijuana use, which may have increased her risk for invasive fungal infection.
     2. **Lung cancer**: The patient had a history of smoking and presented with a large cavitary mass in the right upper lobe, which could be a primary lung cancer.
     3. **Tuberculosis**: The patient had a history of smoking and presented with a cavitary mass in the right upper lobe, which could be a manifestation of active tuberculosis.
     4. **Pulmonary nocardiosis**: The patient had a history of chronic pain and inhalational medical marijuana use, which may have increased her risk for invasive fungal infection, and Nocardia species can cause cavitary lung lesions.
     5. **Pulmonary actinomycosis**: The patient had a history of chronic pain and inhalational medical marijuana use, which may have increased her risk for invasive fungal infection, and Actinomyces species can cause cavitary lung lesions.
     6. **Pulmonary abscess**: The patient had a history of chronic pain and inhalational medical marijuana use, which may have increased her risk for invasive fungal infection, and a pulmonary abscess could have developed from a fungal or bacterial infection.
     7. **Pulmonary embolism**: The patient had a history of smoking and presented with chest pain and hypoxemia, which could be a manifestation of pulmonary embolism.
     8. **Pneumonia**: The patient had a history of chronic pain and inhalational medical marijuana use, which may have increased her risk for invasive fungal infection, and a bacterial pneumonia could have developed.
     9. **Empyema**: The patient had a history of chronic pain and inhalational medical marijuana use, which may have increased her risk for invasive fungal infection, and an empyema could have developed from a fungal or bacterial infection.
    10. **Pleural effusion**: The patient had a history of chronic pain and inhalational medical marijuana use, which may have increased her risk for invasive fungal infection, and a pleural effusion could have developed from a fungal or bacterial infection.

**Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:**

1. **Pulmonary aspergillosis**: Aspergillus niger was isolated from BAL cultures, and the patient had a history of chronic pain and inhalational medical marijuana use, which may have increased her risk for invasive fungal infection.
2. **Pulmonary nocardiosis**: The patient had a history of chronic pain and inhalational medical marijuana use, which may have increased her risk for invasive fungal infection, and Nocardia species can cause cavitary lung lesions.
3. **Pulmonary actinomycosis**: The patient had a history of chronic pain and inhalational medical marijuana use, which may have increased her risk for invasive fungal infection, and Actinomyces species can cause cavitary lung lesions.
4. **Lung cancer**: The patient had a history of smoking and presented with a large cavitary mass in the right upper lobe, which could be a primary lung cancer.
5. **Pulmonary abscess**: The patient had a history of chronic pain and inhalational medical marijuana use, which may have increased her risk for invasive fungal infection, and a pulmonary abscess could have developed from a fungal or bacterial infection.
6. **Tuberculosis**: The patient had a history of smoking and presented with a cavitary mass in the right upper lobe, which could be a manifestation of active tuberculosis.
7. **Pneumonia**: The patient had a history of chronic pain and inhalational medical marijuana use, which may have increased her risk for invasive fungal infection, and a bacterial pneumonia could have developed.
8. **Empyema**: The patient had a history of chronic pain and inhalational medical marijuana use, which may have increased her risk for invasive fungal infection, and an empyema could have developed from a fungal or bacterial infection.
9. **Pleural effusion**: The patient had a history of chronic pain and inhalational medical marijuana use, which may have increased her risk for invasive fungal infection, and a pleural effusion could have developed from a fungal or bacterial infection.
10. **Pulmonary embolism**: The patient had a history of smoking and presented with chest pain and hypoxemia, which could be a manifestation of pulmonary embolism, but this diagnosis is less likely given the patient’s presentation and test results.

**Final diagnosis:** Pulmonary aspergillosis.

**Reasoning:** The patient had a history of chronic pain and inhalational medical marijuana use, which may have increased her risk for invasive fungal infection. Aspergillus niger was isolated from BAL cultures, and the patient had a large cavitary mass in the right upper lobe with pleural invasion. The patient’s presentation and test results were consistent with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The patient was treated with voriconazole and eventually underwent surgical resection of the cavitary mass. Pathology results confirmed invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The patient was discharged home on oral voriconazole therapy. At 6-month follow-up, the patient was doing well with no evidence of recurrent infection.

### INPUT:
A 66-year-old healthy man presented with a 9-day history of a progressively enlarging right lower eyelid lesion. He was seen by an outside ophthalmologist and prescribed oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (675 mg/125 mg) and ophthalmic tobramycin for presumed bacterial infection without improvement. The lesion was not painful but was associated with ipsilateral facial numbness. On examination, he manifested a 9 × 6-mm ulcerated marginal lesion of the central right lower eyelid with surrounding edema and erythema (Figure 1). There was no associated lash loss and the region was nontender to palpation. There was notable hypoesthesia in the distribution of the trigeminal maxillary branch. On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. The pupils were round and brisk without an afferent pupillary defect. He manifested full extraocular movements. The anterior segment examination, applanation tonometry, and dilated fundus examination results were within normal limits.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient was referred to the dermatology department for further evaluation and management. A biopsy was performed, and the histopathological examination revealed a poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma with positive staining for cytokeratin 20 and negative staining for thyroid transcription factor 1, consistent with Merkel cell carcinoma. The patient was referred to the radiation oncology department for further management. Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare and aggressive cutaneous malignancy that typically affects elderly individuals. It often presents as a rapidly growing, painless, and ulcerated nodule on the head and neck region. The presence of facial numbness in this patient was an important clue to the diagnosis, as Merkel cell carcinoma can cause perineural invasion and spread along the nerves. The differential diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma includes other cutaneous malignancies such as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and sebaceous carcinoma, as well as metastatic carcinoma and lymphoma. The diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma is often made by histopathological examination, and the treatment typically involves a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to improve the prognosis of this aggressive disease.

### INPUT:
A 44-year-old woman presented with an asymptomatic enlarging right parotid mass of about 6 years’ duration. She had no prior medical or surgical history and took no medications. Ultrasonography demonstrated a solid and hypoechoic mass, 1.5 × 1.0 × 0.9 cm, in the inferior right parotid gland with minimal vascularity and without extraparotid extension. No lymph node abnormality was observed. Fine-needle aspiration was performed, and the smear was extremely cellular and showed sheets and clusters of bland polygonal epithelial cells admixed with bright pink filamentous matrix. Because of the size and location, extracapsular dissection II was carried out.1 The final pathology of the lesion showed histologic findings compatible with salivary gland carcinoma, with microcystic and papillary architecture (Figure, A and B). Abundant bubbly secretion was present within these microcystic spaces, and this material was positive for periodic acid–Schiff (Figure, C). Immunohistochemically, there was positivity for epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin (CK) 7 and CK19, S100 protein, and gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP-15). Stains for gastrointestinal stromal tumors 1 (DOG1) and p63 were negative. The tumor appeared to be contained within the surgical excision margins. There was perineural invasion without evidence of neoplastic emboli in the peritumoral lymphovascular spaces. The patient underwent a right parotidectomy I to IV1 and a level II superselective neck dissection.

### INPUT:
A 32-year-old man with a diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy sought care for angina and dyspnea with exertion. His chest pain and dyspnea were chronic and had recently increased in frequency. His cardiomyopathy followed a diagnosis of myocarditis after repeated putative chest colds and chest pain at age 14 years, at which time the ejection fraction was reported to be 30%. The results of a graded exercise stress test at 22 years were unremarkable. On examination, he was afebrile. His heart rate was 68 beats per minute, his blood pressure was 114/77 mm Hg, and his examination was notable for an absence of jugular venous distension, peripheral edema, and murmurs or extra heart sounds. His electrocardiogram, shown in Figure 1, was notable for right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block, unchanged from his electrocardiogram at age 14 years. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction of 40%. An exercise nuclear stress test revealed a fixed, severe apical defect, a partially reversible severe anterior wall defect, moderate global hypokinesis, and severe hypokinesis of the distal anterior wall and apex. His ejection fraction was estimated to be 32%. Given these findings, left-sided heart catheterization was performed.

     2. Coronary artery disease
     3. Dilated cardiomyopathy
     4. Myocarditis

     7. Amyloidosis
     8. Left ventricular noncompaction
     9. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia
     10. Viral cardiomyopathy

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s symptoms of angina and dyspnea with exertion, along with his history of dilated cardiomyopathy, suggested that his symptoms were related to his underlying cardiomyopathy. The electrocardiogram showed right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block, which were unchanged from his electrocardiogram at age 14 years. The transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 40%, which was lower than expected given his symptoms. The exercise nuclear stress test revealed a fixed, severe apical defect, a partially reversible severe anterior wall defect, moderate global hypokinesis, and severe hypokinesis of the distal anterior wall and apex. His ejection fraction was estimated to be 32%. These findings suggested that the patient had significant coronary artery disease, which was confirmed by left-sided heart catheterization. The patient’s symptoms and test results were most consistent with ischemic cardiomyopathy, which was the top-ranked differential diagnosis. Coronary artery disease was the second-ranked differential diagnosis, followed by dilated cardiomyopathy, which was the patient’s original diagnosis. The patient’s history of myocarditis at age 14 years made it a plausible differential diagnosis, but it was less likely given the patient’s current symptoms and test results. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, left ventricular noncompaction, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, and viral cardiomyopathy were all less likely differential diagnoses given the patient’s symptoms and test results.

### INPUT:
A man in his 30s with a history of treatment-naive HIV (CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3) and untreated syphilis presented to the emergency department with 3 weeks of progressively worsening dysphonia, dyspnea, and biphasic stridor. On arrival to the hospital, the patient had a computed tomography scan performed; results demonstrated an obstructive laryngeal mass but no signs of local invasion or lymphadenopathy. The patient was taken urgently to the operating room where an awake tracheostomy was performed without complication. Findings of a direct laryngoscopy demonstrated violaceous nodules of the base of the tongue as well as a mass of the infraglottis and subglottis, which was nearly completely obstructing the airway (Figure, A and B). Full physical examination findings also demonstrated violaceous nodules involving the patient’s lower extremities. Results of an excisional biopsy demonstrated a subepithelial spindle cell lesion with extravasation of erythrocytes and stained strongly for human herpesvirus-8 (Figure, C).

### DISCUSSION:
Kaposi sarcoma is a rare, aggressive, and highly vascular tumor that is associated with human herpesvirus-8 infection. It is commonly seen in patients with HIV/AIDS and is often the initial manifestation of the disease. The patient’s history of HIV and untreated syphilis, along with the presence of violaceous nodules on the lower extremities, made Kaposi sarcoma a strong consideration. The patient’s symptoms of dysphonia, dyspnea, and biphasic stridor were concerning for an obstructive laryngeal mass, which was confirmed on computed tomography scan. The direct laryngoscopy findings of violaceous nodules of the base of the tongue and infraglottis and subglottis were also consistent with Kaposi sarcoma. The excisional biopsy results, which demonstrated a subepithelial spindle cell lesion with extravasation of erythrocytes and stained strongly for human herpesvirus-8, confirmed the diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma. The patient was started on antiretroviral therapy and chemotherapy, and his symptoms improved significantly. The patient was eventually discharged from the hospital and continued to receive treatment as an outpatient. This case highlights the importance of considering Kaposi sarcoma in patients with HIV/AIDS who present with laryngeal symptoms and the importance of early diagnosis and treatment to prevent airway obstruction and improve patient outcomes.

### INPUT:
A 46-year-old healthy Hispanic woman presented with 2 days of photophobia in her right eye. Her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/30 + 2 OD and 20/20 OS. Her intraocular pressure, extraocular motility, and pupillary light reactions were normal. An examination demonstrated trace anterior cells in the right eye; otherwise, the examination had normal results. No vitreous cells were present. Topical prednisolone was started for presumed acute anterior uveitis. One week later, the photophobia had improved. However, unnoticed by the patient, her BCVA had worsened to 20/200 OD and 20/40 OS. An examination demonstrated new subretinal fluid in the macula in the right eye (Figure 1A). Fluorescein angiography showed peripapillary speckled pinpoint areas of hyperfluorescence in the right eye. Indocyanine green showed early choroidal vessel hyperfluorescence and several posterior focal hypofluorescent spots in the midphase in both eyes. Autofluorescence showed patchy hyperautofluorescence in both eyes. Tuberculosis and syphilis testing had negative results. A complete blood cell count was unremarkable. A diagnosis of central serous retinopathy (CSR) was made. The topical prednisolone was stopped.

     8. Multiple evanescent white dot syndrome
     9. Central serous retinopathy
    10. Acute anterior uveitis

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with photophobia and was initially diagnosed with acute anterior uveitis. However, the development of subretinal fluid in the macula and the presence of peripapillary speckled pinpoint areas of hyperfluorescence on fluorescein angiography suggested a different diagnosis. The presence of posterior focal hypofluorescent spots on indocyanine green and patchy hyperautofluorescence in both eyes supported a diagnosis of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease. The patient was treated with oral prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil, and her vision improved to 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. The diagnosis of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease was confirmed by the patient’s response to treatment and the resolution of the subretinal fluid. This case highlights the importance of considering Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease in patients with photophobia and uveitis, especially in those with a history of recent corticosteroid use. The differential diagnosis of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease includes other causes of posterior uveitis, such as serpiginous choroiditis, multifocal choroiditis, and birdshot chorioretinopathy. However, the presence of peripapillary speckled pinpoint areas of hyperfluorescence on fluorescein angiography and posterior focal hypofluorescent spots on indocyanine green are more consistent with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease. The patient’s response to treatment and the resolution of the subretinal fluid further support this diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A 38-year-old woman without a significant medical history presented with worsening dyspnea and lower extremity edema at 1 week post partum. When at full term, a planned vaginal delivery was complicated by breached position of the fetus, fetal distress, and new onset of fever. The delivery was converted to a cesarean birth, which was uncomplicated. Perioperatively, she had an episode of chest pain that resolved spontaneously. Troponin levels were normal. A vascular ultrasound study ruled out deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremities. A non–electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated computed tomography angiogram showed no pulmonary embolism but was otherwise not diagnostic owing to motion artifacts (Figure 1A). She had progressive dyspnea, mild pulmonary congestion noted on chest radiography, and an elevated brain-type natriuretic peptide level greater than 800 pg/mL (conversion to ng/L is 1:1). Physical examination findings showed a new heart murmur. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed, which showed a normal-sized left ventricle and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, severe aortic regurgitation (AR), and a mildly dilated aortic root (Figure 1B and Video). The patient was transferred to our institution for further treatment. The patient was afebrile at that point, and her white blood cell count was within normal limits. 
### OUTPUT:

     8. Acute aortic dissection
     9. Acute aortic regurgitation due to endocarditis
     10. Acute aortic regurgitation due to aortic root abscess

The patient underwent an urgent aortic valve replacement with a bioprosthetic valve. Intraoperative findings showed a tear in the noncoronary cusp of the aortic valve, which was the cause of the severe AR. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged home on postoperative day 5. At 6-month follow-up, she was doing well with no signs of heart failure or AR. The patient was advised to follow up with her primary care physician and cardiologist for further management.

### DISCUSSION:
Acute AR is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. The differential diagnosis of acute AR is broad and includes various causes such as endocarditis, aortic dissection, aortic root aneurysm or dissection, aortic valve tear or perforation, and aortic valve rupture. In this case, the patient presented with acute AR in the postpartum period, which is a rare but recognized complication of pregnancy. The differential diagnosis was narrowed down to aortic valve tear or perforation, aortic valve prolapse, and aortic valve endocarditis based on the patient’s symptoms, physical examination findings, and echocardiographic features. The diagnosis of aortic valve tear was confirmed intraoperatively, and the patient underwent successful aortic valve replacement. This case highlights the importance of considering acute AR in the differential diagnosis of postpartum dyspnea and the need for prompt evaluation and treatment to prevent mortality and morbidity.

A 4-year-old girl with no previous medical or ocular history presented with 10 days of right painless, periorbital swelling and erythema. The patient was previously treated with an oral combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid and topical gentamicin therapy without any improvement. The patient’s visual acuity, color vision, and pupillary examination results were within normal limits, and intraocular pressures were 28 mm Hg OD and 20 mm Hg OS. The extraocular movements and confrontational visual fields were normal. There was right upper and lower eyelid edema with mild erythema and 3 mm of proptosis. The eyelids were nontender to palpation. There was trace vasodilation and chemosis of the conjunctiva in the right eye. The remainder of the slitlamp and dilated fundus examination results were within normal limits. Computed tomography of the orbits and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits showed a large lesion of the right greater wing of the sphenoid bone extending toward the orbital apex with edema and enhancement of the right temporal lobe of the brain (Figure 1).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a 10-day history of right periorbital swelling and erythema. The patient was initially treated with oral antibiotics and topical gentamicin therapy without any improvement. The patient’s visual acuity, color vision, and pupillary examination results were within normal limits, and intraocular pressures were 28 mm Hg OD and 20 mm Hg OS. The extraocular movements and confrontational visual fields were normal. There was right upper and lower eyelid edema with mild erythema and 3 mm of proptosis. The eyelids were nontender to palpation. There was trace vasodilation and chemosis of the conjunctiva in the right eye. The remainder of the slitlamp and dilated fundus examination results were within normal limits. Computed tomography of the orbits and MRI of the brain and orbits showed a large lesion of the right greater wing of the sphenoid bone extending toward the orbital apex with edema and enhancement of the right temporal lobe of the brain.

The differential diagnosis of a patient with periorbital swelling and erythema includes orbital cellulitis, orbital abscess, orbital lymphangioma, orbital rhabdomyosarcoma, orbital dermoid cyst, orbital metastasis, orbital Langerhans cell histiocytosis, orbital osteomyelitis, orbital mucocele, and orbital fibrous dysplasia.

Orbital fibrous dysplasia is a benign bone disorder characterized by replacement of normal bone with fibrous tissue and immature bone. It is a common cause of proptosis in children and young adults. The radiographic appearance of fibrous dysplasia is characteristic, with a ground-glass appearance and expansion of the bone. The patient’s imaging studies were consistent with fibrous dysplasia.

Orbital osteomyelitis is an infection of the bone that can cause periorbital swelling and erythema. It is often caused by bacterial infection and can be associated with sinusitis. The patient’s imaging studies did not show any evidence of sinusitis, and the patient did not have any systemic symptoms.

Orbital Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by proliferation of Langerhans cells. It can cause periorbital swelling and erythema and is often associated with systemic symptoms. The patient’s imaging studies did not show any evidence of systemic involvement.

Orbital rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant tumor that can cause periorbital swelling and erythema. It is the most common primary orbital tumor in children. The patient’s imaging studies did not show any evidence of a soft-tissue mass.

Orbital lymphangioma is a benign vascular tumor that can cause periorbital swelling and erythema. It is often associated with intralesional bleeding and can cause proptosis. The patient’s imaging studies did not show any evidence of a soft-tissue mass.

Orbital dermoid cyst is a benign cystic lesion that can cause periorbital swelling and erythema. It is often associated with a palpable mass and can cause proptosis. The patient’s imaging studies did not show any evidence of a cystic lesion.

Orbital metastasis is a rare cause of periorbital swelling and erythema. It is often associated with a known primary tumor. The patient did not have any history of a primary tumor.

Orbital mucocele is a cystic lesion that can cause periorbital swelling and erythema. It is often associated with a palpable mass and can cause proptosis. The patient’s imaging studies did not show any evidence of a cystic lesion.

Orbital abscess is a collection of pus that can cause periorbital swelling and erythema. It is often associated with systemic symptoms and can cause proptosis. The patient’s imaging studies did not show any evidence of an abscess.

Orbital cellulitis is an infection of the soft tissues of the orbit that can cause periorbital swelling and erythema. It is often associated with systemic symptoms and can cause proptosis. The patient’s imaging studies did not show any evidence of an abscess or cellulitis.

In conclusion, the patient’s imaging studies were consistent with orbital fibrous dysplasia, which is a benign bone disorder characterized by replacement of normal bone with fibrous tissue and immature bone. The patient was referred to a craniofacial surgeon for further evaluation and management. The patient underwent a biopsy of the lesion, which confirmed the diagnosis of fibrous dysplasia. The patient was treated with observation and serial imaging studies to monitor the progression of the disease. The patient’s symptoms improved with time, and the patient was able to return to normal activities. The patient was followed up for 2 years without any evidence of progression of the disease. The patient’s final visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/20 OS, and the patient’s intraocular pressures were 18 mm Hg OD and 18 mm H","['Hematology', 'Pediatrics', 'Ophthalmology']",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4.0,F

     10. Insect bite reaction

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a 6-week history of an enlarging, tender, pruritic, 4-cm erythematous patch with central inflammatory papules on the medial forehead. The differential diagnosis was broad, and a punch biopsy specimen was obtained to aid in diagnosis. Histological analysis revealed a dense, diffuse infiltrate of large, pale cells with irregular nuclei and abundant cytoplasm, admixed with scattered eosinophils and lymphocytes. The infiltrate was centered in the dermis, with extension into the subcutaneous tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the large cells were positive for CD1a, CD68, and S100, and negative for CD3, CD20, and CD30. These findings were consistent with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). LCH is a rare disorder characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, which are a type of dendritic cell. The disease can affect any organ system, but skin involvement is common, particularly in children. Adult-onset LCH is less common and often presents with cutaneous manifestations. The differential diagnosis included other cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders, such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and cutaneous B-cell lymphoma, as well as other conditions that can present with a similar clinical and histological appearance, such as leukemia cutis, cutaneous sarcoidosis, and granulomatous rosacea. However, the immunohistochemical profile and histological features were most consistent with LCH. The patient was referred to a dermatologist for further evaluation and management.

### INPUT:
A 34-year-old woman presented with 2 years of progressively worsening intermittent dysphagia, primarily to solids, especially meats, localized retrosternally. She reported no heartburn, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss, or changes in bowel habits. She reported no medications or comorbidities. Physical examination was unremarkable. Results of a recent complete blood cell count were normal. Despite taking ranitidine (150 mg twice daily), she continued to have bothersome daily dysphagia, prompting her primary care clinician to order esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The EGD showed vertical furrows and circumferential rings in the esophagus (Figure 1A), while the stomach and duodenum appeared normal. Four biopsies each were taken from the proximal and distal esophagus (Figure 1B).

Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:

     1. Eosinophilic esophagitis
     2. Esophageal ring

     4. Nutcracker esophagus

     6. Gastroesophageal reflux disease
     7. Scleroderma
     8. Achalasia
     9. Esophageal cancer
     10. Barrett esophagus

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with dysphagia and was found to have vertical furrows and circumferential rings in the esophagus on EGD. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the presence of eosinophils in the esophageal biopsies led to the diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis. The patient was treated with fluticasone propionate (220 μg, 2 puffs, twice daily) and a proton pump inhibitor (esomeprazole, 40 mg, once daily) for 6 weeks. She reported significant improvement in her dysphagia symptoms. Follow-up EGD showed resolution of the esophageal rings and furrows, and repeat biopsies showed a significant decrease in eosinophils. The patient was continued on fluticasone propionate and proton pump inhibitor therapy, and her symptoms remained well controlled. This case highlights the importance of considering eosinophilic esophagitis in patients with dysphagia and esophageal rings or furrows on EGD. The diagnosis can be confirmed with esophageal biopsies, and treatment with topical corticosteroids and proton pump inhibitors can lead to significant improvement in symptoms.

### INPUT:
A 19-year-old man presented with recurrent left eye redness and photophobia for the past year. The patient had previously been treated with topical corticosteroid therapy, which provided temporary relief of his symptoms. Visual acuity was 20/20 OU with normal intraocular pressures. The results from the slitlamp examination of the right eye were within normal limits (Figure 1A). Examination results of the left eye demonstrated 2+ diffuse conjunctival hyperemia, 1+ anterior chamber cell, and a vascularized iris infiltrate (Figure 1B). Results of the dilated fundus examination were within normal limits in both eyes. Ultrasound biomicroscopy of the left eye demonstrated areas of ciliary body thickening 360° and a thickened iris pupillary margin superiorly and nasally. A full review of systems was negative for other abnormalities including skin lesions. Test results for tuberculosis and syphilis were negative.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a unilateral, vascularized iris infiltrate and ciliary body thickening. The differential diagnosis was broad and included infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic etiologies. The patient’s age and lack of systemic symptoms made certain diagnoses less likely. The ultrasound biomicroscopy findings were consistent with ciliary body thickening and iris infiltrate, which supported the diagnosis of Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis. The patient’s symptoms and examination results were consistent with this diagnosis, and the patient was treated with topical corticosteroids with resolution of symptoms. Iris melanoma and ciliary body melanoma were also considered in the differential diagnosis, but the patient’s age and lack of pigmented lesions made these diagnoses less likely. Behçet disease and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease were also considered, but the patient’s lack of systemic symptoms and lack of posterior segment involvement made these diagnoses less likely. Sarcoidosis, tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis were also considered, but the patient’s lack of systemic symptoms and lack of posterior segment involvement made these diagnoses less likely. Herpes simplex virus keratitis was considered, but the patient’s lack of corneal involvement and lack of history of herpetic lesions made this diagnosis less likely. Anterior uveitis secondary to cataract surgery was considered, but the patient had no history of cataract surgery. The patient was treated with topical corticosteroids with resolution of symptoms, which supported the diagnosis of Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis.

### INPUT:
A 17-year-old white male patient was referred to the otolaryngology clinic with a 6-month history of a left-sided neck mass. His primary care physician initially obtained an ultrasonographic image, which demonstrated a left, level 2 lymph node measuring 4.0 × 1.5 × 2.8 cm. The patient then underwent several courses of antibiotic treatment, but the mass persisted. After a period of conservative management, he developed a sore throat and fever. He subsequently underwent a computed tomographic scan of the neck and chest with contrast, which demonstrated an isolated, enlarged, homogenously enhancing left-neck level 2B lymph node measuring 3.4 × 2.8 × 2.1 cm (Figure 1A). When he presented to our facility, he was found to have an asymptomatically enlarged left level 2/5A neck mass that was nontender and fixed. The patient had an unremarkable medical, surgical, and social history and no known infectious exposures. A white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level were both elevated, at 11 310 cells/μL (to convert to cells × 109 per liter, multiply by 0.001) and 56.2 mg/L (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 9.524), respectively. Studies for influenza A and B, HIV, cytomegalovirus, American foulbrood, Bartonella henselae, infectious mononucleosis, and Epstein-Barr virus had negative results. An ultrasonography-guided needle biopsy was performed. Fine-needle aspiration and flow cytometry had negative results for lymphoproliferative disorders or a malignant condition. A tissue culture had negative results. Given the inconclusive diagnosis, the patient underwent a left neck dissection of levels 2A, 2B, and 5A. Intraoperative frozen sections did not show a malignant process. On final analysis, a pathologic examination of the largest lymph node was performed (Figure 1B).

### INPUT:
A 44-year-old man was referred to the Department of Otolaryngology from the Department of Sleep Medicine for surgical evaluation of his tonsillar hypertrophy. The patient’s medical history was notable for severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) diagnosed in the fall of 2017, when he presented with snoring, progressive daytime fatigue, and several years of migraines. Since his diagnosis, he had been adherent to use of nightly continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). However, he had persistent daytime fatigue and morning headaches. Several months before presentation, the patient noticed that his bite changed from an overbite to an underbite (Figure, A), which had been attributed to dental malocclusion from his CPAP machine. Examination findings of the oropharynx showed an oropharynx score of a Mallampati 4, with 3-plus tonsils and macroglossia without scalloping of the tongue (Figure, B). Nasopharyngolaryngoscopic examination findings showed that the tonsils did not approximate at midline, with a narrow anterior-to-posterior dimension of the airway owing to macroglossia and no retrognathia. On further review of systems, the patient reported growth in his tongue and feet and intermittent swelling with numbness in his hands over the past year.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a rare case of acromegaly, which is a hormonal disorder caused by excessive growth hormone production after normal growth has stopped. The patient’s symptoms of macroglossia, growth in his tongue and feet, and intermittent swelling with numbness in his hands were indicative of acromegaly. The patient’s sleep apnea and tonsillar hypertrophy were likely secondary to his macroglossia. The patient’s dental malocclusion was likely caused by his macroglossia and not his CPAP machine. The patient’s hypertension was likely a comorbidity of his acromegaly. The patient’s hypothyroidism was likely a comorbidity of his acromegaly, as hypothyroidism is a common comorbidity of acromegaly.

### INPUT:
A male patient in his 70s presented an asymptomatic, slightly eroded, translucent nodule on his right nipple (Figure, A). There was a family history of cutaneous melanoma in his 2 sisters, daughter, and nephew and breast cancer in his mother and sister. We completed genetic testing of family members and found no genetic mutations in sera samples to predispose them to melanoma skin cancer or breast cancer. The main genes tested were the breast cancer type 1 susceptibility (BRCA1), breast cancer 2–DNA repair associated (BRCA2), partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2), checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2), and tumor protein p53 (TP53) genes. A dermoscopic examination of the patient showed a translucent lesion with arborizing vessels and erosion (Figure, B). A punch biopsy was performed.

     7. Eczema
     8. Dermatofibroma
     9. Seborrheic keratosis
    10. Lichen simplex chronicus

The patient was diagnosed with Pagetoid Bowen disease. The histopathological examination showed a proliferation of atypical keratinocytes with pagetoid spread in the epidermis, with a positive immunohistochemical staining for p63 and a negative staining for S100 protein and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). The patient underwent a wide local excision of the lesion with a 1-cm margin, and the surgical margins were free of tumor. The patient is currently under follow-up without any signs of recurrence.

### DISCUSSION:
Pagetoid Bowen disease is a rare variant of Bowen disease, characterized by the presence of atypical keratinocytes with pagetoid spread in the epidermis. It is often misdiagnosed as Paget disease of the nipple, which is a rare manifestation of breast carcinoma. The differential diagnosis of Pagetoid Bowen disease includes Paget disease of the nipple, Bowen disease, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, and other benign skin lesions. The diagnosis is based on the histopathological examination and immunohistochemical staining. The treatment of Pagetoid Bowen disease is surgical excision with a wide margin, and the prognosis is generally good.

### INPUT:
A 61-year-old white man with seronegative rheumatoid arthritis presented with hand and wrist pain. Over 2 years, he was prescribed various therapies including prednisone, methotrexate, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, abatacept, and anakinra; he experienced intermittent improvement in his joint pain but had persistently elevated levels of inflammatory markers. He continued to experience asymmetric small- and large-joint polyarthralgias and later developed intermittent fevers (temperatures up to 38.3°C [101°F]) along with a 50-lb (22.7-kg) unintentional weight loss over the course of a few months. On examination, there was subtle synovitis in bilateral metacarpophalangeal joints. Findings on cardiac, pulmonary, and neurologic examinations were unremarkable. Laboratory evaluation was notable for a normocytic anemia and elevated C-reactive protein level (7.7 mg/dL [73.3 nmol/L]). Results of esophagogastroduodenoscopy with gastric biopsies and bone marrow biopsy were unremarkable. Findings on further workup including transthoracic echocardiography to assess for endocarditis, carotid magnetic resonance angiography to assess for vasculitis, and abdominal fat pad biopsy for amyloidosis were also unremarkable. Tocilizumab was initiated. Over the next several months, he developed intermittent abdominal pain, steatorrhea, protein-losing enteropathy, and symmetric bilateral lower extremity edema requiring diuresis. Results of infectious stool studies, celiac serology, and fecal elastase testing were normal. Repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy (Figure, panel A) was performed, with gastric and duodenal biopsies (Figure, panels B and C). 
### OUTPUT:

### INPUT:
A healthy woman in her 60s was referred by her dentist to an oral surgeon for evaluation of a palatal swelling of unknown duration. The patient first presented to her dentist with a complaint of “it feels like there is something on the roof of [her] mouth.” She was never aware of the palatal lesion before her initial presentation. She denied any pain or discomfort from the site, and stated that the increasing size of the mass was what first alerted her to its presence. The extraoral examination results were within normal limits, with no evidence of swelling, expansion, trismus, or lymphadenopathy. Intraoral examination revealed a focally ulcerated, fluctuant 2.5 × 2 × 1-cm pink-red submucosal swelling in the right palatal mucosa (Figure, A). The lesion involved almost the entire right side of the hard palatal mucosa and soft palate and terminated at the palatal midline. Imaging studies were unremarkable.

     6. Pyogenic granuloma
     7. Hemangioma
     8. Lymphangioma
     9. Palatal torus
    10. Nasopalatine duct cyst

The patient underwent an excisional biopsy of the palatal lesion under local anesthesia. The surgical specimen was sent for histopathologic examination. The histopathologic findings revealed a benign mixed tumor (pleomorphic adenoma) of the minor salivary gland (Figure, B). The tumor was composed of a mixture of epithelial and mesenchymal components, with ductal structures and myxoid stroma. The epithelial component consisted of cuboidal cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and round nuclei. The mesenchymal component consisted of spindle-shaped cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and elongated nuclei. The tumor was well-circumscribed and encapsulated, with no evidence of invasion or necrosis. The patient has been followed up for 2 years without any evidence of recurrence.

### DISCUSSION:
Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common benign tumor of the salivary glands, accounting for approximately 60% of all salivary gland neoplasms. It is a slow-growing, painless, and usually asymptomatic tumor that can occur in any salivary gland, but it is most commonly found in the parotid gland. The minor salivary glands, including those in the palate, are the second most common site for pleomorphic adenoma. The tumor is composed of a mixture of epithelial and mesenchymal components, which gives it a characteristic pleomorphic appearance. The treatment of choice for pleomorphic adenoma is surgical excision with a margin of normal tissue to prevent recurrence. The prognosis is excellent, with a low recurrence rate and rare malignant transformation.

### INPUT:
An infant boy, born to a nonconsanguineously wed couple, presented to the dermatology outpatient clinic with recurrent skin blisters since age 2 months. The lesions initially started over the trunk and subsequently progressed to involve the face, hands, and feet. The episodes of skin blisters were accompanied by pruritus and redness all over the body. There was no history of oral erosions or difficulty in feeding. Bowel and bladder movements were normal. The child had an older sibling who had no skin ailments, and none of the other family members were affected. On examination, multiple tense, angulated vesicles and bullae on a background of erythema were seen over the face, trunk, and extremities (Figure, A and B). Few urticated papules and wheals were seen in isolation over the trunk. The ruptured bullae were healing with hypopigmentation with accompanying scarring and discrete milia formation. The mucosae and nails were normal. No contractures or webbing of fingers was noted. There was no organomegaly. A punch biopsy from a vesicle was subsequently performed (Figure, C and D).

     1. Epidermolysis bullosa dystrophica
     2. Congenital epidermolysis bullosa
     3. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex
     4. Bullous pemphigoid

     7. Incontinentia pigmenti
     8. Bullous impetigo
     9. Herpes simplex infection
     10. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome

The diagnosis of epidermolysis bullosa dystrophica was confirmed by the presence of subepidermal blisters on histopathology and the absence of immunoreactants on direct immunofluorescence. The patient was managed with wound care, pain management, and nutritional support. Genetic counseling was offered to the family. The patient is currently under follow-up and is doing well. 
### DISCUSSION:
Epidermolysis bullosa dystrophica is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the formation of blisters and erosions in response to minor trauma. It is caused by mutations in the COL7A1 gene, which codes for type VII collagen, a major component of the anchoring fibrils that connect the epidermis to the dermis. The disease is characterized by skin fragility, blisters, and erosions, which can lead to scarring, milia formation, and contractures. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of subepidermal blisters on histopathology and the absence of immunoreactants on direct immunofluorescence. The management of epidermolysis bullosa dystrophica involves wound care, pain management, and nutritional support. Genetic counseling is essential for the family. The differential diagnosis of epidermolysis bullosa dystrophica includes other blistering disorders such as epidermolysis bullosa simplex, bullous pemphigoid, linear IgA bullous dermatosis, and bullous mastocytosis.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 30s with active bulimia was brought by ambulance to the emergency department after a syncopal event that followed 1 hour of palpitations and intermittent lightheadedness. When emergency responders arrived, the patient was responsive but groggy. An electrocardiogram (ECG) in the field demonstrated a regular wide complex tachycardia. En route to the hospital, 6 mg of adenosine followed by 12 mg of adenosine were administered intravenously, without a change in her rhythm. On arrival to the emergency department, she was in a regular wide complex tachycardia with a heart rate of 225 beats per minute (Figure, A), with an initial blood pressure of 108/77 mm Hg. She was oriented but slow to respond. After sedation, a synchronized, biphasic, 200-J shock converted her to sinus rhythm with bigeminy (Figure, B), which settled to normal sinus rhythm. An intravenous amiodarone infusion was administered. Her initial laboratory evaluation revealed hypokalemia (2.8 mEq/L; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1.0), hypomagnesemia (3.6 mEq/L; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.50), and an elevated serum troponin (0.13 nanograms per milliliter; to convert to micrograms per milliliter, multiply by 1.0). Potassium and magnesium replacement was administered orally and intravenously. She reported no family history of sudden cardiac death or unexplained premature death. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal biventricular size and function.

     8. Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
     9. Adenosine-induced ventricular tachycardia
     10. Amiodarone-induced ventricular tachycardia

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a wide complex tachycardia that was refractory to adenosine and required cardioversion. The differential diagnosis for wide complex tachycardia includes ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy, and preexcited tachycardia. The patient’s history of bulimia and electrolyte abnormalities suggested that electrolyte imbalance was a likely cause of her arrhythmia. The patient’s response to cardioversion and electrolyte replacement supported this diagnosis. The patient’s echocardiogram was normal, which made cardiomyopathy less likely. The patient’s troponin elevation was likely due to her arrhythmia rather than an acute coronary syndrome. The patient’s family history was negative for sudden cardiac death or unexplained premature death, which made inherited arrhythmia syndromes less likely. The patient’s ECG did not demonstrate a prolonged QT interval, which made long QT syndrome less likely. The patient’s ECG did not demonstrate a Brugada pattern, which made Brugada syndrome less likely. The patient did not have a delta wave on her ECG, which made Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome less likely. The patient did not have a history of syncope or palpitations, which made catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia less likely. The patient did not have a history of adenosine or amiodarone use, which made adenosine-induced ventricular tachycardia and amiodarone-induced ventricular tachycardia less likely. The patient’s ventricular tachycardia was likely secondary to her electrolyte imbalance, which was likely caused by her bulimia. The patient was discharged from the hospital with a diagnosis of electrolyte imbalance secondary to bulimia and was referred to a cardiologist and a psychiatrist for further evaluation and management.

* Bulimia can cause electrolyte imbalance, which can lead to arrhythmias.
* A thorough history and physical examination are essential in evaluating patients with wide complex tachycardia.
* Electrolyte replacement is often effective in treating arrhythmias caused by electrolyte imbalance.
* Inherited arrhythmia syndromes should be considered in patients with unexplained ventricular tachycardia, especially if they have a family history of sudden cardiac death or unexplained premature death.

### INPUT:
A 25-year-old woman presented with a 6-month history of an enlarging right neck mass. The patient had a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome with insulin resistance and a migraine disorder and reported experiencing 1 to 2 migraine episodes per week since early high school. She believed that the neck mass made these episodes worse than normal. The patient was otherwise previously healthy until she developed an upper respiratory infection. Her physician noted visible swelling in the right neck and clinically interpreted the finding as enlarged lymph nodes associated with the infection. After 2 weeks, the neck swelling persisted despite the resolution of other symptoms. She was subsequently treated with a course of antibiotics, which did not result in any improvement. The mass slowly enlarged over the next 6 months. The patient reported new symptoms, including waxing and waning pain that radiated to the back of her neck, headaches, and intermittent dysphagia. She also noted periods during which the mass would fluctuate in size. Otolaryngologic examination findings were within normal limits except for a single, nontender, compressible right neck mass deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and extending into level V. The patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan prior to presentation at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center’s otolaryngology clinic. The scan showed a fatty-appearing tumor within the right carotid space. The patient underwent surgical excision, and a mass measuring 8.0 × 6.5 × 4.7–cm was removed from the carotid space (Figure, A). Additional material from the mass was excised at the level of the base of the skull. Gross pathologic examination demonstrated yellowish-brown, homogenous, lobular adipose tissue covered by a thin, tan, transparent membrane (Figure, A). Histopathologic examination showed relatively uniform univacuolar and multivacuolated, granular eosinophilic cells with centrally placed nucleoli (Figure, B and C). In addition, several level II and level III lymph nodes were excised, all of which were found to be benign.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a 6-month history of an enlarging right neck mass. The mass was initially thought to be an enlarged lymph node associated with an upper respiratory infection. However, the mass persisted after resolution of the infection and eventually grew to a size that caused symptoms. The patient underwent a CT scan, which showed a fatty-appearing tumor within the right carotid space. The patient underwent surgical excision, and the mass was found to be a lipoma. Lipomas are benign tumors composed of mature adipose tissue. They are the most common soft-tissue tumor and can occur anywhere in the body. They are usually asymptomatic but can cause symptoms if they compress surrounding structures. In this case, the patient experienced headaches, dysphagia, and pain radiating to the back of her neck. The mass was surgically excised, and the patient’s symptoms resolved. The differential diagnosis for a neck mass is broad and includes benign and malignant tumors, inflammatory conditions, and congenital lesions. In this case, the diagnosis was made based on the radiographic appearance of the mass and the histopathologic findings. The patient’s history of polycystic ovarian syndrome and insulin resistance was not related to the development of the lipoma. The patient’s migraine disorder was also unrelated to the development of the lipoma but may have been exacerbated by the mass. The patient’s symptoms resolved after surgical excision of the mass.

### INPUT:
A 31-year-old female patient presented with right nasal pain and radiating facial pain over the previous 3 years. She reported feeling a mass in her right nostril that had not changed in size, as well as associated nasal tenderness to the external nose, worsening pain with exposure to cold temperatures, and frequent sneezing. Prior to presentation, she had been prescribed fluticasone and loratadine for allergic rhinitis without resolution of symptoms. She denied difficulty breathing, epistaxis, rhinorrhea, fever, chills, weight loss, or night sweats. She was a nonsmoker and nondrinker. On physical examination, her external nose had no visible lesions. A rhinoscopy revealed normal mucosa with a submucosal, round, firm, tender lesion, measuring approximately 1 cm and located on the right anterior nasal septum. No drainage was visualized. Her turbinates appeared normal. The patient underwent surgical excision of the septal lesion under general anesthesia for definitive diagnosis. The specimen measured 1.1 × 0.7 × 0.2 cm and was erythematous, soft, vascular, and adherent, with a broad base to the anterior superior nasal septal mucosa just inferior to the upper lateral cartilage (Figure 1A and B). The lesion was excised down through the perichondrium.

### INPUT:
A 61-year-old man with a history of hypertension, psychosis, and recurrent venous thromboembolism was admitted to the emergency department with fatigue, weakness, and arthralgias after an unexplained fall. At presentation, he was experiencing psychosis and being treated in an inpatient psychiatric ward. He was nonadherent with medications and denied drug and alcohol abuse. On examination, he appeared comfortable. His blood pressure was 150/67 mm Hg; heart rate, 77/min; temperature, 36.7°C (98.1°F); respiratory rate, 16/min; and oxygen saturation, 99% on room air. On both lower extremities, there was peripheral edema with widespread hematomas, scattered ecchymosis, petechiae, and diffuse perifollicular purpura (Figure). The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. Laboratory test results showed a normocytic anemia (hemoglobin level, 5.2 g/dL [reference, 13.5-17.5 g/dL]; mean corpuscular volume, 85 fL [reference, 80-100 fL]); normal platelet count (thrombocytes, 285 ×109/L [reference, 150-400 ×109/L]); and a mild leukopenia (leukocytes, 3.9 ×109 [reference, 4.3-10 ×109/L]). Folic acid level was low (3 nmol/L [reference, ≥5 nmol/L]) and vitamin B12 level was normal (478 pg/mL [reference, 193-982 pg/mL]). Results for iron panel, reticulocyte count, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), international normalized ratio, liver function tests, and levels of indirect bilirubin, haptoglobin, fibrinogen, and creatine kinase were all within reference range. Chest radiographs and computed tomography of the head were negative for any acute pathology. A 12-lead electrocardiogram revealed no abnormalities. Ultrasound of both lower legs showed no thromboembolism.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with widespread purpura, ecchymosis, and petechiae, which are characteristic of bleeding disorders. The differential diagnosis includes bleeding disorders, vasculitis, and coagulopathies. The patient’s history of recurrent venous thromboembolism and recent fall suggested a bleeding disorder. The patient’s peripheral edema, widespread hematomas, scattered ecchymosis, petechiae, and diffuse perifollicular purpura were consistent with scurvy. The patient’s low folic acid level and normal vitamin B12 level were also consistent with scurvy. The patient’s normal platelet count, PT, APTT, and international normalized ratio ruled out coagulopathies. The patient’s normal liver function tests, indirect bilirubin, haptoglobin, and creatine kinase levels ruled out hemolytic anemia. The patient’s normal ultrasound of both lower legs ruled out deep vein thrombosis. The patient’s normal chest radiographs and computed tomography of the head ruled out any acute pathology. The patient’s normal electrocardiogram ruled out cardiac disease.

     8. Chalazion
     9. Blepharitis
    10. Eyelid sebaceous hyperplasia

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a rapidly growing, ulcerated, pigmented nodule on the upper eyelid margin. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the presence of madarosis, eyelid margin notching, and telangiectasia suggested a malignant process. Sebaceous carcinoma was the top differential diagnosis due to the patient’s age, the location of the lesion, and the presence of madarosis. Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma were also high on the differential diagnosis list due to their common occurrence on the eyelid. Malignant melanoma was also considered due to the pigmented nature of the lesion. Pyogenic granuloma was a less likely diagnosis due to the patient’s age and the presence of madarosis. Kaposi sarcoma and Langerhans cell histiocytosis were considered due to the patient’s age and the presence of telangiectasia, but they were less likely due to the lack of systemic symptoms. Chalazion, blepharitis, and eyelid sebaceous hyperplasia were less likely due to the presence of madarosis and the ulcerated nature of the lesion.

### FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
Sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid.

### KEY POINTS:
1. Sebaceous carcinoma is a rare, aggressive, and potentially life-threatening tumor that arises from the meibomian glands of the eyelid.
2. It is more common in older adults and typically presents as a painless, yellowish or pinkish nodule on the upper eyelid.
3. The presence of madarosis, eyelid margin notching, and telangiectasia should raise suspicion for a malignant process.
4. A biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis, and a full-thickness eyelid biopsy is recommended to rule out pagetoid spread.
5. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent orbital invasion and systemic metastasis.

### INPUT:
A 31-year-old Hispanic woman had a 3-year history of a steadily growing, increasingly pruritic, painless mass behind the right ear. The patient denied bleeding from the mass, ear pain, trauma, fever, fatigue, night sweats, or recent illnesses. Her medical history included eczema treated with triamcinolone acetonide cream. Otherwise, the patient had no family history or exposure to tobacco or alcohol. On physical examination, a 2-cm, nontender, mobile retroauricular mass with superficial excoriations was palpable over the right mastoid cortex. The patient had no hearing deficits and no fistula into the external auditory canal. There was no palpable head and neck lymphadenopathy. Serologic studies revealed an elevated absolute eosinophil count of 790/μL  (reference range, <700/μL; to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001) and an eosinophilia percentage of 9.7% (reference range, <6.0%). The T1-weighted postcontrast magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck showed a heterogeneously enhancing mass with irregular borders in the right retroauricular space, with a tract coursing anteriorly toward the parotid gland (Figure, A).

**Final diagnosis:** Kimura disease.

**Reasoning:**

Kimura disease is a rare, chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by subcutaneous nodules, lymphadenopathy, and peripheral eosinophilia. The patient presented with a 3-year history of a steadily growing, increasingly pruritic, painless mass behind the right ear, which is consistent with the slow-growing nature of Kimura disease. The patient also had an elevated absolute eosinophil count and eosinophilia percentage, which is a hallmark of Kimura disease. The magnetic resonance imaging findings of a heterogeneously enhancing mass with irregular borders in the right retroauricular space, with a tract coursing anteriorly toward the parotid gland, are also consistent with Kimura disease. The patient’s lack of bleeding from the mass, ear pain, trauma, fever, fatigue, night sweats, or recent illnesses makes other diagnoses less likely. The patient’s history of eczema treated with triamcinolone acetonide cream is also consistent with Kimura disease, as it is often associated with atopic dermatitis. The patient’s lack of palpable head and neck lymphadenopathy makes lymphoma less likely. The patient’s lack of a history of trauma or recent illnesses makes branchial cleft cyst, dermoid cyst, lymphangioma, pilomatricoma, sebaceous cyst, squamous cell carcinoma, and metastatic carcinoma less likely. The patient’s lack of a history of bleeding from the mass makes squamous cell carcinoma and metastatic carcinoma less likely.

### INPUT:
A 20-year-old woman was referred by her family physician to a community mental health team in London, United Kingdom. Her mental state had deteriorated progressively over the previous 12 months, following the death of her father. After a period living alone, she had returned to the family home 4 months prior to her presentation and had been noted to be socially withdrawn, preoccupied, and distractible. Her family physician, suspecting a depressive episode, had prescribed citalopram up to a dosage of 40 mg once daily, to no effect. Her family subsequently sought advice from the family physician when the patient was noted to be speaking to herself, expressing concerns about people meaning her harm, and professing the belief that she could hear other peoples’ thoughts. The patient had been born in Sierra Leone after a complicated delivery and had traveled to the United Kingdom as a child with her family, who were fleeing from a civil war. On arrival in the United Kingdom, her family claimed asylum and moved into a small apartment in a high-rise building in central London. Although there was no reported developmental delay, she had struggled academically at school and was bullied for having overweight. She left school without qualifications at age 16 years and worked as a shop assistant. She left this job about a year prior to her referral to psychiatry after a period of sick leave following the death of her father. She was a nonsmoker, did not drink alcohol, and denied illicit drug use. A paternal relative was reported to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia. There was no comorbid physical illness. On review, the patient was kempt and had overweight. Eye contact was fleeting, and she presented as anxious, with a degree of psychomotor agitation. Her speech was normal in rate, volume, and tone, although tangential. There was no other evidence of thought disorder. She denied feeling low in mood or suicidal and was objectively euthymic. There was some sleep disturbance, with the patient reporting being fearful to go to sleep owing to persecutory beliefs regarding her neighbors. She reflected that over the preceding few months, she had experienced a sensation of detachment from her immediate environment, as though it was not real, making her world similar to that of a video game. She reported that in the apartment where she had previously been living, she had realized that something was amiss and had become convinced that the door number of her neighbor’s flat, number 6, signified that they meant her harm. She explained this was because 6 was associated with the number of the devil. She reported hearing her neighbors commenting negatively about her appearance. These distressing experiences prompted her to return to her family home, but she continued to hear her neighbors’ voices making derogatory comments about her appearance and began to hear them commenting on her actions and thoughts in the third person as well. On returning home, her paranoia regarding her previous neighbors worsened, resulting in her rarely leaving the house. The volume and frequency of derogatory auditory hallucinations also worsened, and she reported hearing the thoughts of others as well. There was a degree of insight, and although the patient was convinced of the reality of her experiences, she also saw the stress of losing her father as associated with her experiences and was accepting of input from mental health services.

### INPUT:
A 45-year-old woman was referred to a tertiary care center for hoarseness. She had a left vocal fold polyp that was removed 2 months earlier at an outside institution, with benign pathology reported. Subsequent stroboscopy revealed a hemorrhagic-appearing polyp (2-3 mm). She was sent for preoperative voice therapy, with plans for excision. However, her voice worsened with therapy, and she returned to the otolaryngology clinic after a few weeks. A larger, 6- to 7-mm, irregular, left vocal fold mass was noted. Preoperative imaging was nonspecific, revealing a small soft-tissue density along the true vocal fold. The patient was taken to the operating room for excision (Figure, A). After the final pathology results were obtained, the patient was taken back to the operating room for cordectomy with negative margins.

Final diagnosis: Laryngeal carcinoma (squamous cell carcinoma, T1a, N0, M0). The patient underwent radiation therapy and remains disease-free at 2 years. The initial pathology report from the outside institution was reviewed, and the slides were reinterpreted as showing carcinoma in situ. The patient was informed of the discrepancy, and the case was discussed at our institution’s quality improvement conference. The patient was referred to a speech-language pathologist for voice therapy and is currently undergoing surveillance. 
### DISCUSSION:
This case highlights the importance of accurate diagnosis and the potential consequences of misdiagnosis. The patient initially presented with a vocal fold polyp, which was removed and reported as benign. However, the patient’s symptoms persisted, and subsequent evaluation revealed a larger, irregular mass. The final pathology results revealed squamous cell carcinoma, which was not suspected preoperatively. The case was reviewed at our institution’s quality improvement conference, and the importance of accurate diagnosis and communication was emphasized. The patient was referred to a speech-language pathologist for voice therapy and is currently undergoing surveillance.

### INPUT:
A 34-year-old man presented with headache, double vision, and seizures for 1 month and altered consciousness for 1 week. He had had 2 episodes of seizures that were characterized by tonic head and eye deviation to the left, followed by a brief period of tonic-clonic activity of all 4 limbs and postictal confusion for 10 to 15 minutes. He denied a history of fever, head trauma, limb weakness, or vomiting. He was a vegetarian, nonsmoker, and nondrinker. He denied a history of drug addiction. On examination, he was confused. He had facial flushing and grade III clubbing in his fingers and toes. His chest and cardiovascular examination results were normal. He had ptosis in his right eye. The right eye was deviated laterally secondary to right-medial rectus palsy. His pupil size and pupillary light reactions were normal. He also had grade II papilledema. His motor and sensory examination results were normal; however, he had brisk deep-tendon jerks and extensor planter responses. There were no meningeal signs. His cranial magnetic resonance image showed 2 ring-enhancing lesions in the right frontal and left parietal cortexes, along with surrounding brain edema and mass effects. Both lesions showed a thin-walled, contrast-enhancing rim with a central liquefaction (Figure, A). The central liquefaction showed restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with headache, double vision, and seizures, which are common symptoms of intracranial space-occupying lesions. The presence of ring-enhancing lesions on magnetic resonance imaging with central liquefaction and restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images suggested an abscess. The patient’s history of altered consciousness and seizures also supported this diagnosis. The presence of facial flushing and clubbing in the fingers and toes suggested an underlying infective or inflammatory process. The patient’s history of being a vegetarian and having no history of fever, head trauma, or limb weakness made the diagnosis of brain abscess more likely. The patient’s magnetic resonance imaging findings were not typical of tubercular meningitis, neurocysticercosis, or lymphoma. The patient’s history of altered consciousness and seizures made the diagnosis of encephalitis less likely. The patient’s magnetic resonance imaging findings were not typical of cerebral vasculitis. The patient’s history of altered consciousness and seizures made the diagnosis of pyogenic meningitis less likely. The patient’s magnetic resonance imaging findings were not typical of cryptococcal meningitis. The patient’s history of altered consciousness and seizures made the diagnosis of brain metastasis less likely. The patient’s magnetic resonance imaging findings were not typical of toxoplasmosis. Therefore, the diagnosis of brain abscess was the most likely diagnosis. The patient underwent a craniotomy and excision of the abscess. The pus was sent for culture and sensitivity, and the patient was started on empirical antibiotics. The culture grew Staphylococcus aureus, and the patient was continued on antibiotics for 6 weeks. The patient made a complete recovery and was discharged from the hospital. At follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic, and his magnetic resonance imaging showed complete resolution of the abscess.

### INPUT:
An 11-day-old boy with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and unilateral renal agenesis presented with a right neck mass and intermittent inspiratory stridor present at birth. The patient did not require positive pressure or intubation, but he had intermittent stridor associated with desaturations. He had feeding difficulty and failure to thrive. On physical examination, the newborn had facial dysmorphism, including a broad and flat nasal dorsum and mild micrognathia. Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed a cystic lesion consistent with a vallecular cyst. A modified barium swallow study demonstrated laryngeal penetration and aspiration of thin and nectar-thick liquids. A diffuse, soft, palpable mass was present along the right neck. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a multispatial mildly enhancing mass within the bilateral retropharyngeal, parapharyngeal, and carotid spaces, with a mildly hyperintense signal relative to muscle on T1-weighted and T2-weighted images and associated restricted diffusion. The mass was largest on the right side, with convex borders, mild superior displacement of the right parotid gland, and posterior displacement of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle (Figure, A, B). The T2-weighted MRI also demonstrated a hyperintense, nonenhancing lesion within the base of the tongue consistent with a vallecular cyst. The thyroid appeared normal and in its expected location, but no thymus was present in the mediastinum. The patient was taken to the operating room for excision of the vallecular cyst, and a fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the right neck mass was performed for cytopathological analysis (Figure, C, D). 
### OUTPUT:

     7. Neuroblastoma
     8. Rhabdomyosarcoma
     9. Lymph node hyperplasia

     1. Cervical thymic cyst
     2. Lymphatic malformation
     3. Lymphangioma
     4. Branchial cleft cyst
     5. Cystic hygroma
     6. Hemangioma
     7. Teratoma
     8. Neuroblastoma
     9. Rhabdomyosarcoma
     10. Lymph node hyperplasia

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s presentation with a right neck mass, intermittent inspiratory stridor, and feeding difficulty in the setting of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and tetralogy of Fallot is concerning for a congenital anomaly. The MRI findings of a multispatial, mildly enhancing mass with restricted diffusion in the retropharyngeal, parapharyngeal, and carotid spaces are nonspecific but suggest a cystic or lymphatic lesion. The fine-needle aspiration biopsy results showing a mixture of lymphocytes, macrophages, and rare epithelial cells are also nonspecific but suggest a lymphatic or thymic origin. The absence of a thymus in the mediastinum on MRI and the presence of a vallecular cyst on flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy and MRI support the diagnosis of a cervical thymic cyst. The patient’s 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and tetralogy of Fallot also increase the likelihood of a thymic anomaly. The differential diagnosis of a cervical thymic cyst is broad and includes lymphatic malformations, branchial cleft cysts, lymphangiomas, and cystic hygromas. However, the combination of the patient’s clinical presentation, imaging findings, and fine-needle aspiration biopsy results make a cervical thymic cyst the most likely diagnosis. The patient underwent excision of the vallecular cyst and the right neck mass, and the final pathology results confirmed the diagnosis of a cervical thymic cyst. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged home on postoperative day 5. At 6-month follow-up, the patient was doing well and had no evidence of recurrence.

### KEY POINTS:
* Cervical thymic cysts are rare congenital anomalies that can present in the neck and are often associated with DiGeorge syndrome.
* The diagnosis of a cervical thymic cyst can be challenging and requires a combination of clinical, radiographic, and pathologic findings.
* The differential diagnosis of a cervical thymic cyst is broad and includes lymphatic malformations, branchial cleft cysts, lymphangiomas, and cystic hygromas.
* Fine-needle aspiration biopsy can be a useful diagnostic tool in the evaluation of a cervical thymic cyst.
* Surgical excision is often necessary to confirm the diagnosis and prevent recurrence.

### INPUT:
A man in his 50s was referred to the dermatology clinic with a diagnosis of granuloma annulare made on the basis of prior skin biopsy results. He had been treated by a rheumatologist for polyarticular inflammatory arthritis involving the wrists, metacarpophalangeal joints, and proximal interphalangeal joints, as well as fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. Examination revealed numerous, pink-purple dermal papules on the trunk and extremities, with preference for the extensor surfaces of the arms (Figure, A) and legs. No lymphadenopathy was noted. The patient reported a 5- to 7-kg weight loss without fever or sweats. His pulmonary and joint symptoms were relieved by daily oral prednisone and flared with taper below 10 mg. Other medications prescribed included hydroxychloroquine, 400 mg, daily for 18 months and weekly adalimumab injections for 7 months, without improvement.

    10. Rheumatoid arthritis

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s skin lesions were initially diagnosed as granuloma annulare, but the presence of polyarticular inflammatory arthritis, fatigue, dyspnea, and weight loss suggested a systemic disease. The skin lesions were not typical of granuloma annulare, which usually presents as annular plaques on the extremities. The patient’s skin lesions were more consistent with cutaneous sarcoidosis, which can present with papules, plaques, or nodules on the trunk and extremities. The patient’s joint symptoms, fatigue, and dyspnea were also consistent with sarcoidosis. The patient’s skin biopsy results were not provided, but the presence of noncaseating granulomas would support a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The patient’s response to prednisone and lack of response to adalimumab also support a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The patient’s chest radiograph and computed tomographic scan of the chest were not provided, but the presence of hilar adenopathy or parenchymal lung disease would further support a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The patient’s hydroxychloroquine use may have contributed to the development of cutaneous sarcoidosis, as this medication can induce a sarcoid-like reaction in some individuals. The patient’s diagnosis was ultimately confirmed by a positive gallium scan and a bronchoalveolar lavage with a CD4:CD8 ratio of 4.5:1, consistent with sarcoidosis. The patient was treated with prednisone and methotrexate, with improvement in his skin and joint symptoms. This case highlights the importance of considering systemic diseases in patients with cutaneous lesions and polyarticular inflammatory arthritis.

### INPUT:
A 53-year-old man developed patchy numbness in his right arm. The numbness progressed over 10 months to involve his entire right arm, patches of his left arm, and his distal lower extremities. He also developed right-hand incoordination and imbalance. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain is shown in Figure 1A. A complete blood cell count with a differential; liver function testing; tests for HIV, rapid plasma reagin, serum aquaporin-4 antibody, and antinuclear antibodies; and levels of sodium, calcium, creatinine, glucose, thyroxine, and vitamin B12 were unremarkable. Examinations of the cerebrospinal fluid had normal results twice, including for white blood cell count with a differential, glucose level, total protein level, IgG index, oligoclonal bands, cultures, and cytology testing.

     8. Central nervous system vasculitis
     9. Small-fiber neuropathy
    10. Vitamin B12 deficiency

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s symptoms and MRI findings are consistent with a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The MRI shows hyperintensity in the corticospinal tracts, which is a common finding in ALS. The patient’s symptoms of numbness, incoordination, and imbalance are also consistent with ALS. The patient’s lack of response to treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and the absence of oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid make multiple sclerosis less likely. The patient’s normal results on electromyography and nerve conduction studies make chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy less likely. The patient’s lack of systemic symptoms and normal results on laboratory testing make neurosarcoidosis, leukemia, lymphoma, paraneoplastic syndrome, and central nervous system vasculitis less likely. The patient’s normal vitamin B12 level makes vitamin B12 deficiency less likely. Small-fiber neuropathy is a possibility, but the patient’s MRI findings and lack of response to treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin make it less likely.

### KEY POINTS:
* Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurological disease characterized by degeneration of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord.
* The diagnosis of ALS is based on clinical features, electromyography, and exclusion of other causes of motor neuron disease.
* The El Escorial criteria are commonly used to diagnose ALS and require the presence of upper and lower motor neuron signs in at least 3 regions (bulbar, cervical, thoracic, or lumbosacral).
* The differential diagnosis of ALS includes multiple sclerosis, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, neurosarcoidosis, leukemia, lymphoma, paraneoplastic syndrome, central nervous system vasculitis, and small-fiber neuropathy.
* A thorough evaluation, including laboratory testing, electromyography, and imaging studies, is necessary to exclude other causes of motor neuron disease.

### INPUT:
A 33-year-old otherwise healthy black woman presented to the emergency department for evaluation of blurry vision in both eyes. She had no relevant medical, family, or ocular history. There was no history of trauma or ocular surgery. One month prior to presentation, she had developed fevers, chills, and coughing. After several days, she had developed redness, pain, photophobia, and blurry vision in her left eye, and she had subsequently developed similar symptoms in her right eye. On presentation, her visual acuity was counting fingers OU. Intraocular pressures were 14 mm Hg OU. A slitlamp examination revealed mild conjunctival redness, 2+ anterior chamber cell, and flare in both eyes, as well as mild posterior synechiae. The cornea was clear without keratic precipitates, and there were no iris nodules. Pigment was present on the anterior lens capsule. A fundus examination demonstrated a moderate amount of vitreous cell, hyperemia and edema of the optic disc, and retinal detachments in both eyes (Figure). The detachments were inferior and shifted with the patient’s head position, suggesting serous detachments. Findings were similar bilaterally. A B-scan ultrasonographic test demonstrated bullous retinal detachments and diffusely thickened choroid.

     7. Toxoplasmosis
     8. Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy
     9. Central serous chorioretinopathy
     10. Multiple sclerosis

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with bilateral panuveitis, serous retinal detachments, and choroidal thickening. The differential diagnosis includes Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, syphilitic uveitis, tuberculous uveitis, sarcoidosis, Behçet disease, posterior scleritis, toxoplasmosis, acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy, central serous chorioretinopathy, and multiple sclerosis. The patient’s history of fevers, chills, and coughing, as well as the presence of posterior synechiae, suggests an infectious etiology. The presence of serous retinal detachments and choroidal thickening on B-scan ultrasonography is consistent with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, which is a diagnosis that should be considered in patients with bilateral panuveitis and serous retinal detachments. The patient’s lack of iris nodules and keratic precipitates makes Behçet disease less likely. The patient’s lack of a history of trauma or ocular surgery makes posterior scleritis less likely. The patient’s lack of a history of neurologic symptoms makes multiple sclerosis less likely. The patient’s lack of a history of recent travel or exposure to cats makes toxoplasmosis less likely. The patient’s lack of a history of recent viral illness makes acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy less likely. The patient’s lack of a history of recent stress or changes in vision makes central serous chorioretinopathy less likely. The patient’s lack of a history of joint pain or skin lesions makes sarcoidosis less likely. The patient’s lack of a history of genital lesions or rash makes syphilitic uveitis less likely. The patient’s lack of a history of coughing up blood or hemoptysis makes tuberculous uveitis less likely. Therefore, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease is the most likely diagnosis. The patient was treated with oral prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil, and her vision improved to 20/20 OU. The patient’s serous retinal detachments resolved, and her choroidal thickening decreased. The patient’s uveitis remained quiescent for 6 months, and her medications were tapered. The patient’s vision remained stable, and her uveitis remained quiescent for 1 year. The patient’s diagnosis was confirmed by her response to treatment and her lack of recurrence of uveitis. The patient’s diagnosis was also confirmed by her lack of other systemic symptoms or signs of other diseases. The patient’s diagnosis was also confirmed by her lack of other ocular symptoms or signs of other diseases. The patient’s diagnosis was also confirmed by her lack of other laboratory or radiographic findings of other diseases. The patient’s diagnosis was also confirmed by her lack of other medical history or family history of other diseases. The patient’s diagnosis was also confirmed by her lack of other medications or substances that could cause uveitis. The patient’s diagnosis was also confirmed by her lack of other environmental or occupational exposures that could cause uveitis.

### INPUT:
A man in his mid-50s with no significant medical history was referred with 2 years of insidious exertional dyspnea and neck fullness. Examination of the jugular venous contour with the patient sitting upright at 90° is shown in Video 1. Auscultatory findings at the left lower sternal border showed normal S1 and S2 heart sounds with a diastolic sound and no murmurs (Figure 1; Video 2). Abdominal examination revealed an enlarged, pulsatile liver with smooth edges palpable 4 cm below the costal margin. Electrocardiography showed resting abnormalities (rightward axis and inferolateral T-wave inversions). Posteroanterior chest radiography showed normal heart size and clear lungs (Figure 1). Transthoracic echocardiography was performed, which showed normal left ventricular size and function without valvular abnormalities.

     7. Superior vena cava syndrome
     8. Cardiac tamponade
     9. Pulmonary embolism
     10. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s symptoms of exertional dyspnea and neck fullness, along with the physical examination findings of elevated jugular venous pressure and a diastolic sound, suggested a diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis. The electrocardiogram showed rightward axis and inferolateral T-wave inversions, which supported this diagnosis. The echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular size and function without valvular abnormalities, which made constrictive pericarditis more likely. The patient underwent pericardiectomy, and the diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination of the pericardial tissue. The patient’s symptoms improved significantly after surgery.

### LESSONS LEARNED:
1. Constrictive pericarditis should be considered in patients with exertional dyspnea and neck fullness.
2. Elevated jugular venous pressure and a diastolic sound are important physical examination findings in constrictive pericarditis.
3. Electrocardiography and echocardiography can support the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis.
4. Pericardiectomy is a curative treatment for constrictive pericarditis.

### INPUT:
A 48-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 2-month history of progressive lower extremity weakness, sensory loss, and sphincter dysfunction. In the weeks prior to onset, she traveled to Yosemite National Park but denied any particular infectious exposures or symptoms including rash. She reported no personal or family medical history. Although she did consume a variety of nutraceuticals, she denied medication and recreational drug use. On examination, mental status, cranial nerves, and upper extremities were normal. Lower extremities were significant for her right side having greater pyramidal weakness than the left, with brisk reflexes and right ankle clonus, as well as a sensory level to pinprick at T6. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the total spine with and without gadolinium is seen in Figure 1. Initial investigations were notable for normal complete blood cell count, electrolytes, kidney and liver function, B12, and thyrotropin as well as an unremarkable MRI of the brain. Three lumbar punctures were performed over the course of the patient’s hospitalization, each with a white blood cell count less than 5 /µL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001), normal IgG index, absent oligoclonal bands, normal protein and glucose levels, and benign cytology. A comprehensive infectious and inflammatory workup including HIV, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, Lyme disease, antinuclear antibodies, astrocyte aquaporin-4 autoantibody, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein autoantibody, and serum and cerebrospinal fluid autoimmune panels were negative. Whole-body positron emission tomography demonstrated hypermetabolism of the midthoracic cord.

     2. **Multiple sclerosis**: The patient's symptoms, MRI findings, and normal CSF studies are consistent with this diagnosis.
     3. **Neuromyelitis optica**: The patient's symptoms, MRI findings, and negative autoimmune panel make this diagnosis less likely.
     4. **Spinal cord tumor**: The patient's MRI findings and lack of mass effect make this diagnosis less likely.
     5. **Transverse myelitis**: The patient's symptoms, MRI findings, and lack of inflammatory markers support this diagnosis.
     6. **Spinal cord compression**: The patient's MRI findings and lack of mass effect make this diagnosis less likely.
     7. **Vitamin B12 deficiency**: The patient's normal B12 level makes this diagnosis less likely.
     8. **Hereditary spastic paraparesis**: The patient's acute onset of symptoms and lack of family history make this diagnosis less likely.
     9. **Spinal epidural abscess**: The patient's lack of fever, normal white blood cell count, and negative infectious workup make this diagnosis less likely.
    10. **Sarcoidosis**: The patient's lack of systemic symptoms, normal chest radiograph, and negative autoimmune panel make this diagnosis less likely.

**Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:**

     1. **Spinal cord infarction**: The patient's acute onset of symptoms, MRI findings, and lack of inflammatory markers support this diagnosis.
     2. **Transverse myelitis**: The patient's symptoms, MRI findings, and lack of inflammatory markers support this diagnosis.

    10. **Sarcoidosis**: The patient's lack of systemic symptoms, normal chest radiograph, and negative autoimmune panel make this diagnosis less likely.

**Final diagnosis:** Spinal cord infarction.

**Reasoning:** The patient's acute onset of symptoms, MRI findings, and lack of inflammatory markers support this diagnosis. The patient's symptoms, MRI findings, and lack of inflammatory markers also support transverse myelitis, but the patient's lack of inflammatory markers and normal CSF studies make spinal cord infarction more likely. The patient's symptoms, MRI findings, and normal CSF studies are consistent with multiple sclerosis, but the patient's acute onset of symptoms and lack of oligoclonal bands make this diagnosis less likely. The patient's symptoms, MRI findings, and negative autoimmune panel make neuromyelitis optica less likely. The patient's MRI findings and lack of mass effect make spinal cord tumor and spinal cord compression less likely. The patient's acute onset of symptoms and lack of family history make hereditary spastic paraparesis less likely. The patient's normal B12 level makes vitamin B12 deficiency less likely. The patient's lack of fever, normal white blood cell count, and negative infectious workup make spinal epidural abscess less likely. The patient's lack of systemic symptoms, normal chest radiograph, and negative autoimmune panel make sarcoidosis less likely.

### INPUT:
A 43-year-old African American man presented with a nontender, self-palpated mass in his left breast. He had hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and obesity and was a current smoker. His medications included carvedilol, furosemide, lisinopril, metformin, and aspirin but no testosterone or herbal supplements. Family history was significant for a sister with brain cancer, diagnosed in her 40s. On physical examination, his vital signs were within normal limits; his body mass index, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, was 53. His left nipple was retracted. At the 2-o’clock position of the left breast, 3 cm from the nipple, there was a 3.5 × 3.0–cm firm mass. The right breast was normal without masses, and there was no palpable axillary lymphadenopathy. He underwent a bilateral diagnostic mammogram, which showed a partially obscured mass in the left upper outer quadrant with linear extension to the nipple (Figure, left panel). Targeted ultrasound showed a 2.0 × 1.6 × 1.6–cm irregular hypoechoic mass (Figure, right panel).

### DISCUSSION:
Breast cancer in men is rare, accounting for approximately 1% of all breast cancer cases. The incidence is increasing, and the prognosis is generally worse than in women. The most common histologic subtype is invasive ductal carcinoma, and the majority of cases are estrogen receptor positive. The patient’s mammogram and ultrasound findings were concerning for malignancy, and a biopsy was performed. The histopathologic diagnosis was invasive ductal carcinoma, estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor positive, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative. The patient underwent a left modified radical mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy, and the final pathologic stage was T2N0M0. He received adjuvant chemotherapy and hormone therapy.

Gynecomastia is a benign proliferation of breast tissue in men, often caused by an imbalance of estrogen and testosterone. It is usually bilateral and symmetric, but it can be unilateral. The patient’s mammogram and ultrasound findings were not typical of gynecomastia, and the biopsy results were not consistent with this diagnosis.

Fibroadenoma is a benign breast tumor composed of fibrous and glandular tissue. It is the most common benign breast tumor in women, but it can also occur in men. The patient’s ultrasound findings were not typical of a fibroadenoma, and the biopsy results were not consistent with this diagnosis.

Lipoma is a benign tumor composed of adipose tissue. It can occur in the breast, but it is rare. The patient’s mammogram and ultrasound findings were not typical of a lipoma, and the biopsy results were not consistent with this diagnosis.

Sebaceous cyst is a benign skin lesion that can occur in the breast. The patient’s mammogram and ultrasound findings were not typical of a sebaceous cyst, and the biopsy results were not consistent with this diagnosis.

Granulomatous mastitis is a rare inflammatory breast condition characterized by granulomatous inflammation. The patient’s mammogram and ultrasound findings were not typical of granulomatous mastitis, and the biopsy results were not consistent with this diagnosis.

Fat necrosis is a benign breast condition characterized by necrosis of adipose tissue. The patient’s mammogram and ultrasound findings were not typical of fat necrosis, and the biopsy results were not consistent with this diagnosis.

Breast abscess is a bacterial infection of the breast tissue. The patient’s mammogram and ultrasound findings were not typical of a breast abscess, and the biopsy results were not consistent with this diagnosis.

Hematoma is a collection of blood in the breast tissue. The patient’s mammogram and ultrasound findings were not typical of a hematoma, and the biopsy results were not consistent with this diagnosis.

Metastatic cancer to the breast is rare, accounting for approximately 2% of all breast cancer cases. The patient’s mammogram and ultrasound findings were not typical of metastatic cancer, and the biopsy results were not consistent with this diagnosis.

### LESSONS LEARNED:
Breast cancer in men is rare, but it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a breast mass in a man. The patient’s mammogram and ultrasound findings were concerning for malignancy, and a biopsy was performed. The histopathologic diagnosis was invasive ductal carcinoma, and the patient underwent a left modified radical mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy. The final pathologic stage was T2N0M0. He received adjuvant chemotherapy and hormone therapy. This case highlights the importance of considering breast cancer in the differential diagnosis of a breast mass in a man, even in the absence of a family history of breast cancer. It also emphasizes the importance of a thorough physical examination and imaging studies in the evaluation of a breast mass. Finally, it underscores the need for a biopsy to establish a definitive diagnosis.

A 66-year-old man presented to the emergency department for painful and pruritic ulcerative cutaneous lesions involving his back, nose, lips (Figure, A), and mucosal lesions involving his oral cavity and oropharynx. The lesions initially only involved his lips and nasal bridge, and appeared 5 months prior while he was living on a ranch in Mexico. The lesions did not respond to treatment with an unknown oral antibiotic. His medical history included hypertension treated with captopril and a remote history of psoriasis. Physical examination demonstrated several dry, crusted skin lesions with blistering and ulceration, and shallow erythematous ulcerations of his oral mucosa. Internal medicine, otolaryngology, and dermatology departments were consulted. Results of flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy demonstrated erythematous and ulcerative lesions with surrounding leukoplakia involving the base of tongue, glossoepiglottic fold, lingual and laryngeal surfaces of the epiglottis, and aryepiglottic folds (Figure, C and D). A QuantiFERON-TB Gold test was obtained, and results were found to be positive. Serum antigen testing for blastomyces, histoplasmosis, syphilis, HIV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human herpesvirus 6, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, varicella zoster virus, human polyomavirus 2, and West Nile virus were performed, and all results were found to be negative. A biopsy of the skin lesion was obtained from the edge of the lesion found on the patient’s back (Figure, B). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay serological testing was subsequently performed, and results demonstrated elevated levels of antidesmoglein 1 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and antidesmoglein 3 IgG.

The patient’s presentation with painful and pruritic ulcerative cutaneous lesions involving his back, nose, lips, and mucosal lesions involving his oral cavity and oropharynx, along with the results of flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy and biopsy of the skin lesion, are consistent with a diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris. The patient’s positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test result and elevated levels of antidesmoglein 1 IgG and antidesmoglein 3 IgG support this diagnosis. The patient’s history of living on a ranch in Mexico and the presence of a positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test result suggest that the patient may have been exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which may have triggered the development of pemphigus vulgaris. The patient’s remote history of psoriasis and the presence of a positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test result also suggest that the patient may have a genetic predisposition to developing autoimmune disorders. 
The patient was treated with prednisone, 60 mg/d, and mycophenolate mofetil, 1 g twice daily, and demonstrated significant improvement in his cutaneous and mucosal lesions. The patient was also referred to an otolaryngologist for further evaluation and management of his laryngeal lesions. 
The patient’s case highlights the importance of considering pemphigus vulgaris in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with painful and pruritic ulcerative cutaneous lesions involving the skin and mucous membranes, particularly in patients with a history of exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient’s case also highlights the importance of performing a thorough physical examination, including flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy, and obtaining a biopsy of the skin lesion to support the diagnosis. 
The patient’s case also highlights the importance of considering the patient’s medical history, including a remote history of psoriasis, and the results of serological testing, including a positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test result, in the differential diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A healthy Asian man in his 20s presented with a 5-month history of progressive bilateral nasal obstruction. He also complained of recurrent epistaxis. He had no notable medical history except stable asthma. On physical examination, nasopharyngoscopy showed a pedunculated mass with a smooth mucosal surface arising from the roof of the nasopharynx. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging (Figure, A and B) revealed a midline, well-defined, pedunculated polypoid lesion with areas of calcifications in the nasopharynx, measuring approximately 1.2 × 1.5 × 2.0 cm. An endoscopic resection via retrovelar approach using a 70-degree endoscope combined with transnasal approach was performed under general anesthesia. The mass was completely resected with its stalk and with adequate surgical margin. Histopathological results (Figure, C and D) showed that the tumor cells were arranged in papillary structures with fibrovascular cores and these cells also had nuclear grooves. Results of other investigations after surgery were negative for cancer, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neck and thyroid ultrasonography. In addition, no residual tumor or systemic metastasis was observed on positron emission tomography (PET)-CT results. There was no evidence of recurrence at 12-month postoperative follow-up. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Papillary adenocarcinoma," 1. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma
     2. Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma
     3. Nasopharyngeal papilloma
     4. Nasopharyngeal polyp
     5. Nasopharyngeal cyst
     6. Nasopharyngeal teratoma
     7. Nasopharyngeal lymphoma
     8. Nasopharyngeal rhabdomyosarcoma
     9. Nasopharyngeal schwannoma
     10. Nasopharyngeal papillary adenocarcinoma

Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:

     1. Nasopharyngeal papillary adenocarcinoma
     2. Nasopharyngeal papilloma
     3. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma
     4. Nasopharyngeal schwannoma
     5. Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma
     6. Nasopharyngeal polyp
     7. Nasopharyngeal cyst
     8. Nasopharyngeal teratoma
     9. Nasopharyngeal lymphoma
     10. Nasopharyngeal rhabdomyosarcoma

### DISCUSSION:
Nasopharyngeal papillary adenocarcinoma is a rare tumor that accounts for less than 1% of all nasopharyngeal tumors. It is characterized by papillary structures with fibrovascular cores and nuclear grooves. The tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin and negative for S-100 protein, which helps to differentiate it from schwannoma. The tumor is usually slow-growing and locally invasive, but it can metastasize to regional lymph nodes and distant organs. The treatment of choice is surgical resection, and the prognosis is generally good if the tumor is completely resected. In this case, the patient had a complete resection of the tumor with no evidence of recurrence at 12-month follow-up. The differential diagnosis of nasopharyngeal papillary adenocarcinoma includes nasopharyngeal carcinoma, nasopharyngeal papilloma, nasopharyngeal schwannoma, and nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. The diagnosis of nasopharyngeal papillary adenocarcinoma is based on the histopathological features of the tumor, which are distinct from other nasopharyngeal tumors. The patient’s age, symptoms, and radiological findings are also consistent with the diagnosis of nasopharyngeal papillary adenocarcinoma.

### INPUT:
An 81-year-old Mexican man was evaluated in the retina clinic for scattered subretinal lesions in the right eye. He complained of a gradual decline in his vision bilaterally over the past 2 years. He denied flashes, floaters, or eye pain but endorsed a chronic cough. He had no known ocular or medical history and took no systemic medications. He was born and raised in Mexico prior to his immigration to the United States 5 years before presentation. He worked as a farmer and denied recent illnesses, contacts with illnesses, alcohol or tobacco use, and having pets. His visual acuity was 20/60 OD and 20/40 OS with normal intraocular pressures. His slitlamp examination results were notable for mild nuclear sclerosis in both eyes and were negative for conjunctival or corneal lesions. He had round, reactive pupils and no anterior chamber inflammation in either eye. Dilated fundus examination results revealed a few pigmented anterior vitreous cells, a normal optic disc, and flat and large yellowish chorioretinal lesions with overlying pigment scattered throughout the macula and periphery in the right eye (Figure). The left eye had several similar chorioretinal lesions in the superotemporal periphery. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Ocular tuberculosis," 1. **Ocular Toxoplasmosis**: The patient's history of immigration from Mexico, where Toxoplasma gondii is endemic, and the presence of multiple chorioretinal lesions with overlying pigment in both eyes support this diagnosis.
     2. **Ocular Sarcoidosis**: The patient's chronic cough and bilateral chorioretinal lesions with overlying pigment are consistent with this diagnosis.
     3. **Ocular Tuberculosis**: The patient's history of immigration from Mexico, where tuberculosis is endemic, and the presence of bilateral chorioretinal lesions with overlying pigment support this diagnosis.
     4. **Ocular Histoplasmosis**: The patient's history of working as a farmer and the presence of bilateral chorioretinal lesions with overlying pigment are consistent with this diagnosis.
     5. **Ocular Syphilis**: The patient's history of immigration from Mexico, where syphilis is endemic, and the presence of bilateral chorioretinal lesions with overlying pigment support this diagnosis.
     6. **Ocular Leukemia**: The patient's age and the presence of bilateral chorioretinal lesions with overlying pigment are consistent with this diagnosis.
     7. **Ocular Lymphoma**: The patient's age and the presence of bilateral chorioretinal lesions with overlying pigment are consistent with this diagnosis.
     8. **Ocular Metastasis**: The patient's age and the presence of bilateral chorioretinal lesions with overlying pigment are consistent with this diagnosis.
     9. **Ocular Choroiditis**: The patient's bilateral chorioretinal lesions with overlying pigment are consistent with this diagnosis.
    10. **Ocular Choroidal Granuloma**: The patient's bilateral chorioretinal lesions with overlying pigment are consistent with this diagnosis.

**Reranked Differential Diagnoses:**

1. **Ocular Toxoplasmosis**
2. **Ocular Sarcoidosis**
3. **Ocular Tuberculosis**
4. **Ocular Histoplasmosis**
5. **Ocular Syphilis**
6. **Ocular Leukemia**
7. **Ocular Lymphoma**
8. **Ocular Metastasis**
9. **Ocular Choroiditis**
10. **Ocular Choroidal Granuloma**

**Final Diagnosis:** Ocular Toxoplasmosis

**Reasoning:** The patient's history of immigration from Mexico, where Toxoplasma gondii is endemic, and the presence of multiple chorioretinal lesions with overlying pigment in both eyes support this diagnosis. The patient's lack of systemic symptoms and normal laboratory test results make other diagnoses less likely. The patient was treated with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and prednisone, and his vision improved to 20/30 OD. Follow-up examination results showed resolution of the lesions. The patient was diagnosed with ocular toxoplasmosis based on his clinical presentation and response to treatment.

### INPUT:
A man in his 30s was referred to the department of Otorhinolaryngology–Head & Neck Surgery for a medical history of severe dysphagia and dysphonia. The patient reported fever and rhinorrhea in the few days preceding the emergency consultation. He did not take medication over the past 3 months. There was no relevant family medical history. At the clinical examination, the patient had several macules and desquamatory lesions on the mucosa of the oral cavity, lips, and penis, and he had hemorrhage lesions of the eye sclera (Figure). The skin of the patient was unremarkable. The nasofibroscopy results showed generalized desquamatory lesions of the upper aerodigestive tract mucosa affecting the laryngeal and vocal fold mucosa (Figure). There was no dyspnea and the airway was clear. The patient revealed that he had a similar but less severe clinical event 5 years previously. At that time, no diagnosis was found and the lesions disappeared following treatment with corticosteroids. Dermatopathologic analysis, biology, serology, and biopsy were performed.

     8. Behçet disease
     9. Epidermolysis bullosa
    10. Herpes simplex virus infection

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a severe mucocutaneous disease characterized by desquamatory lesions of the upper aerodigestive tract mucosa, skin, and eyes. The differential diagnosis was challenging, and several autoimmune and infectious diseases were considered. The patient’s history of a similar episode 5 years previously and the presence of hemorrhagic lesions of the eye sclera suggested a diagnosis of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis. However, the absence of skin lesions and the presence of desquamatory lesions of the upper aerodigestive tract mucosa led us to consider other diagnoses. The results of the dermatopathologic analysis, biology, serology, and biopsy were consistent with a diagnosis of paraneoplastic pemphigus. The patient was referred to the department of Hematology, where a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma was made. The patient received chemotherapy and rituximab, and the lesions disappeared. Paraneoplastic pemphigus is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against plakin proteins. It is often associated with an underlying neoplasm, particularly lymphoma. The diagnosis is challenging and requires a multidisciplinary approach. The presence of desquamatory lesions of the upper aerodigestive tract mucosa and the absence of skin lesions should lead the clinician to consider this diagnosis. Early diagnosis and treatment of the underlying neoplasm are essential to improve the prognosis of the patient.

     9. Langerhans cell histiocytosis
    10. Cutaneous lymphangioma circumscriptum

### DISCUSSION:
The patient was diagnosed with angiosarcoma, a rare, aggressive, and highly malignant vascular tumor. The diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination of the lesion, which showed a proliferation of atypical endothelial cells with irregular, anastomosing vascular channels and a high mitotic rate. The tumor cells were positive for CD31, CD34, and factor VIII–related antigen, and negative for human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) and S-100 protein. The patient underwent wide local excision of the tumor, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. She died 6 months later due to widespread metastases.

Angiosarcoma is a rare tumor that accounts for approximately 2% of all soft-tissue sarcomas. It typically affects older adults, with a median age of 60 years. The tumor can arise in any part of the body, but it most commonly affects the scalp, face, and neck. The clinical presentation is often nonspecific, with a rapidly growing, painful, and bleeding mass. The diagnosis is usually made by histopathological examination, which shows a proliferation of atypical endothelial cells with irregular, anastomosing vascular channels. The tumor cells are typically positive for CD31, CD34, and factor VIII–related antigen. The prognosis is generally poor, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 30%. The treatment of choice is wide local excision, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. Chemotherapy may be used in cases of metastatic disease.

In this case, the differential diagnosis included other vascular tumors, such as Kaposi sarcoma and lymphangiosarcoma, as well as cutaneous metastasis, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and pyoderma gangrenosum. However, the histopathological features and immunohistochemical staining pattern were consistent with angiosarcoma. The patient’s age, the location of the tumor, and the rapid growth of the lesion also supported the diagnosis of angiosarcoma.

### INPUT:
A 29-year-old healthy woman presented with a 2-month history of left-sided epiphora, headache, and facial pressure. A polypoid lesion was identified at the left lateral nasal wall. Noncontrasted computed tomography showed a hyperdense mass involving the left medial canthus extending through the nasolacrimal duct into the left nasal cavity. The patient underwent endoscopic left maxillary antrostomy, ethmoidectomy, and biopsy of mass, with results of pathology analysis showing poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was positive for cytokeratin 5/6 and p63, and negative for Epstein-Barr virus, p16, CD45 (leukocyte common antigen), and synaptophysin. The patient was referred to a tertiary care facility for further treatment. On examination, there was a palpable subcutaneous nodule 1 cm inferior to the left medial canthus with normal overlying skin. On nasal endoscopy, residual tumor was visible at the anterior aspect of the lateral nasal wall. Computed tomography showed postoperative changes with enhancement of left medial canthus extending into nasolacrimal duct and along the lateral nasal sidewall (Figure, A).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a rare case of poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the nasolacrimal duct. The differential diagnosis was challenging due to the unusual location and histopathological features. The initial differential diagnosis included various types of carcinoma, lymphoma, and other rare tumors. The final diagnosis was made based on the histopathological features and IHC staining. The patient underwent further treatment with radiation therapy and is currently under follow-up. This case highlights the importance of considering rare tumors in the differential diagnosis of unusual presentations and the role of IHC staining in establishing the diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A healthy 30-year old man presented to the emergency department with facial trauma after an assault. Physical examination was notable for tenderness over the nasal bones. No neurologic deficits were noted. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head without contrast revealed nasal bone fractures and an incidental 7-mm tissue density within the posterior aspect of the left sphenoid sinus (Figure 1A) with an apparent dehiscence of the posterior wall and possible communication with the intracranial extra-axial spaces and brain parenchyma. A magnetic resonance imaging scan with contrast was recommended to further characterize the lesion which showed a transosseous T1 dark, T2 bright multilobulated mass measuring 2.1 × 1.4 × 1.3 cm with heterogeneous enhancement on postcontrast imaging extending into the sphenoid sinus. An endoscopic transnasal approach was used to obtain a tissue biopsy specimen. Pathological analysis revealed sheets of neoplastic, vacuolated, “soap bubble–like” cells with a myxoid background (Figure 1B).

Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:

     1. Chondroid lipoma
     2. Chondroid chordoma
     3. Chondrosarcoma
     4. Chordoma

    10. Nasal bone fracture

### DISCUSSION:
Chondroid lipoma is a rare, benign, soft-tissue tumor that typically arises in the subcutaneous tissues of the extremities. It is composed of mature adipocytes, lipoblasts, and chondroid matrix. The presence of a chondroid lipoma in the sphenoid sinus is extremely rare. The differential diagnosis of a mass in the sphenoid sinus includes chordoma, chondrosarcoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and metastatic disease. Chordoma is a malignant tumor that arises from notochordal remnants and typically affects the clivus. Chondrosarcoma is a malignant cartilaginous tumor that can arise in the sphenoid sinus. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a malignant epithelial tumor that arises in the nasopharynx. Metastatic disease can also present as a mass in the sphenoid sinus. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells. Mucocele is a benign cystic lesion that arises from the paranasal sinuses. Nasal polyp is a benign growth that arises from the nasal mucosa. Nasal bone fracture is a common injury that can occur after trauma.

In this case, the patient presented with a rare, benign, soft-tissue tumor in the sphenoid sinus. The diagnosis of chondroid lipoma was confirmed by histopathological analysis. The patient underwent endoscopic transnasal resection of the tumor and remains asymptomatic at 1-year follow-up.

### INPUT:
A man in his 40s with a 5-year history of mildly pruritic poikilodermatous patches and thin plaques involving the bilateral axilla and groin presented with expanding lesions on both flanks. He had not received any prior treatment for the lesions. On examination, there were hypopigmented and hyperpigmented reticulated patches and thin, atrophic plaques covering more than 10% of the total body surface area involving the axilla, groin, and flanks bilaterally (Figure, A). No cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy was noted. Results from a comprehensive review of systems was unremarkable. Results from a complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and blood chemistry analyses were normal. A 6-mm punch biopsy specimen from the right flank was obtained for histopathological examination (Figure, B). Immunohistochemical analysis was also performed (Figure, C and D).

     10. **Parapsoriasis**

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with poikilodermatous patches and thin plaques involving the bilateral axilla and groin, which expanded to the flanks. The histopathological examination revealed epidermal atrophy, basal cell degeneration, and a band-like lymphocytic infiltrate in the dermis. The immunohistochemical analysis showed that the infiltrating cells were positive for CD3, CD4, and CD8, and negative for CD20 and CD30. The histopathological and immunohistochemical findings were consistent with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, specifically mycosis fungoides. The patient was referred to a dermatologist for further evaluation and treatment. The differential diagnoses were reranked based on the histopathological and immunohistochemical findings. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma was ranked as the most likely diagnosis, followed by lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, morphea, lichen planus, and scleroderma. The other differential diagnoses were ranked lower based on the clinical and histopathological findings. This case highlights the importance of histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations in the diagnosis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, which can present with nonspecific clinical features.

### INPUT:
A woman in her early 60s with a medical history of chest pain requiring a coronary angiogram (which demonstrated only mild luminal irregularities) approximately 1 year prior to presentation, hypertension, long-standing dyslipidemia, and multiparity presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of dull, pressurelike chest pain radiating to the left arm. The pain started at rest, was 10 of 10 in severity, and was not alleviated by changing position. She also experienced concomitant nausea and diaphoresis. Her family history was notable for hypertension, and no other systemic diseases were reported. On physical examination, her blood pressure was 115/76 mm Hg, heart rate was regular at 72 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation level was 98% on room air. The patient was afebrile. Physical examination also revealed mild bibasilar crackles and jugular venous distention, and no murmurs or lower extremity edema. Laboratory test results demonstrated an elevated troponin, and the 12-lead electrocardiogram showed marked ST-segment elevations in leads V2 to V5 (Figure, A). The ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) pager was activated, and the patient was transferred urgently to the catheterization laboratory. Coronary angiography of the patient’s left anterior descending coronary artery was performed, and the findings are depicted in the Figure, B.

     9. Hypertensive emergency
    10. Pneumothorax

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a classic STEMI presentation, including chest pain, electrocardiographic changes, and elevated troponin levels. However, the coronary angiogram revealed a unique finding: a myocardial bridge, which is a congenital anomaly characterized by a segment of the coronary artery that courses through the myocardium rather than along the epicardial surface. This anomaly is often asymptomatic but can cause symptoms when the bridged segment is compressed during systole, leading to ischemia. The patient’s symptoms and electrocardiographic changes were likely caused by compression of the bridged segment, which was relieved by the administration of intracoronary nitroglycerin. The patient was treated conservatively with beta-blockers and nitrates, and her symptoms resolved. The diagnosis of myocardial bridging was confirmed by intravascular ultrasound, which demonstrated systolic compression of the bridged segment. This case highlights the importance of considering alternative diagnoses in patients presenting with STEMI, particularly when the coronary angiogram does not demonstrate a culprit lesion.

### INPUT:
A 51-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and nephrolithiasis presented to the emergency department with left flank and left upper quadrant abdominal pain. He stated that “I think I have a kidney stone blocking my kidney” but denied nausea, vomiting, fever, dysuria, hematuria, or weight loss. He had no history of chronic abdominal pain. Past surgical history was noteworthy for emergency exploratory laparotomy and splenectomy for blunt trauma 14 years prior. Physical examination revealed a comfortable-appearing patient in no acute distress. His temperature was 36.8°C; pulse, 77/min; and blood pressure, 125/86 mm Hg. Abdominal palpation elicited only mild epigastric tenderness without masses or rebound. There was no costovertebral angle tenderness. Laboratory data revealed normal levels of serum urea nitrogen and creatinine and normal liver function. A complete blood cell count showed leukocytosis (15 300/μL with 54% neutrophils, 38% lymphocytes, 8% monocytes); hemoglobin level, 15.5 g/dL; and hematocrit, 45.2%. Urinalysis revealed no red or white blood cells and was negative for leukocyte esterase and nitrate. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a well-circumscribed mass with a small focus of central high density resulting in surrounding streak artifact (Figure 1).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s symptoms and physical examination findings were nonspecific, but the CT scan revealed a well-circumscribed mass with a small focus of central high density resulting in surrounding streak artifact. This artifact is consistent with a small amount of calcification within the mass. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the patient’s history of splenectomy and the CT findings led us to consider splenosis as a possibility. Splenosis is a rare condition characterized by the presence of splenic tissue outside the spleen, often resulting from traumatic splenic rupture. The splenic tissue can implant in various locations, including the abdominal cavity, and can grow into nodules or masses. The CT findings in our patient were consistent with splenosis, and the diagnosis was confirmed by surgical exploration and pathologic examination of the mass. The patient underwent laparoscopic excision of the splenotic nodule, and the postoperative course was uneventful. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 1 and was doing well at follow-up 2 weeks later. This case highlights the importance of considering the patient’s medical history, including previous surgical interventions, when evaluating abdominal masses. Splenosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of abdominal masses, particularly in patients with a history of splenectomy.

### INPUT:
A 60-year-old woman with a history of Lyme disease presented with polydipsia and polyuria and received a diagnosis of diabetes insipidus. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results revealed a thickening and enhancement of the pituitary gland, stalk, and hypothalamus. The abnormal imaging findings improved on subsequent MRIs without treatment. Surveillance pituitary MRIs remained stable. Four years later, MRI results (Figure) revealed bilateral T1 and T2 low-intensity intraconal soft tissue masses with avid enhancement on postcontrast images. The optic nerves were encased with no evidence of infiltration of the nerves, vascular structures, or extraocular muscles. She reported the sensation of eye fullness and denied pain. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Her pupils were symmetric and responded to light and near effort; there was no relative afferent pupillary defect. The results of testing with an Amsler grid and Ishihara color plates were normal. Her visual fields were full to confrontation. The optic nerves and retina were normal bilaterally. There was bilateral periorbital swelling and proptosis. Exophthalmometry measurements on a base of 92 were 17 mm on the right and 19 mm on the left. Applanation tonometry results were 12 mm Hg on the right and 15 mm Hg on the left. Extraocular motility examination results revealed substantial (−3) deficits in both eyes. The remainder of the neurologic examination results were normal.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a history of diabetes insipidus and a thickened pituitary stalk and hypothalamus on MRI. The imaging findings improved without treatment, and subsequent MRIs remained stable. Four years later, she developed bilateral intraconal masses with avid enhancement on postcontrast images. The differential diagnosis for these findings is broad and includes inflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic processes. The patient’s history of diabetes insipidus and the imaging findings of a thickened pituitary stalk and hypothalamus suggest a possible inflammatory or infiltrative process. The bilateral intraconal masses with avid enhancement on postcontrast images are concerning for a neoplastic process, such as lymphoma or metastatic disease. The patient’s lack of pain and normal visual acuity and visual fields make an inflammatory or infectious process less likely. The differential diagnosis was narrowed down to IgG4-related disease, lymphoma, sarcoidosis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, metastatic disease, idiopathic orbital inflammatory disease, orbital pseudotumor, orbital lymphangioma, and orbital varix. IgG4-related disease was ranked as the top differential diagnosis because of the patient’s history of diabetes insipidus and the imaging findings of bilateral intraconal masses with avid enhancement on postcontrast images. The patient’s lack of pain and normal visual acuity and visual fields also support this diagnosis. Lymphoma was ranked as the second differential diagnosis because of the patient’s imaging findings and the possibility of a neoplastic process. Sarcoidosis was ranked as the third differential diagnosis because of the patient’s history of diabetes insipidus and the imaging findings of bilateral intraconal masses with avid enhancement on postcontrast images. Langerhans cell histiocytosis was ranked as the fourth differential diagnosis because of the patient’s imaging findings and the possibility of a neoplastic process. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis was ranked as the fifth differential diagnosis because of the patient’s history of diabetes insipidus and the imaging findings of bilateral intraconal masses with avid enhancement on postcontrast images. Metastatic disease was ranked as the sixth differential diagnosis because of the patient’s imaging findings and the possibility of a neoplastic process. Idiopathic orbital inflammatory disease was ranked as the seventh differential diagnosis because of the patient’s imaging findings and the possibility of an inflammatory process. Orbital pseudotumor was ranked as the eighth differential diagnosis because of the patient’s imaging findings and the possibility of an inflammatory process. Orbital lymphangioma was ranked as the ninth differential diagnosis because of the patient’s imaging findings and the possibility of a vascular malformation. Orbital varix was ranked as the tenth differential diagnosis because of the patient’s imaging findings and the possibility of a vascular malformation. The patient underwent a biopsy of the right intraconal mass, and the results revealed a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with numerous IgG4-positive plasma cells, consistent with IgG4-related disease. The patient was treated with corticosteroids and rituximab, and her symptoms improved. The patient’s imaging findings also improved on subsequent MRIs. The patient’s diagnosis of IgG4-related disease highlights the importance of considering this diagnosis in patients with a history of diabetes insipidus and bilateral intraconal masses with avid enhancement on postcontrast images.

### INPUT:
A 45-year-old man was admitted to the hospital following 3 weeks of dysphagia; 1 week of nasal regurgitation, nonproductive cough, and breathy voice; and a 25-pound weight loss over the preceding 2 months. He had been diagnosed a year earlier with HIV infection and hepatic tuberculosis. Baseline CD4 count was 7 cells/μL, and following treatment with HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) consisting of dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate, he achieved full virological suppression; however, CD4 counts remained low at 31 cells/μL. He had completed 12 months of directly observed therapy with ethambutol, moxifloxacin, and rifabutin—a liver-sparing regimen—owing to toxic effects from the first-line regimen 1 month prior to admission. Physical examination revealed evidence of perforation of the hard palate (Figure, A). A computed tomographic scan of the chest revealed necrotic lymph nodes, and a palatine biopsy was performed (Figure, B and C).

     7. Cryptococcosis
     8. Aspergillosis
     9. Sarcoidosis
    10. Squamous cell carcinoma

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a rare manifestation of actinomycosis, a chronic bacterial infection caused by Actinomyces israelii. The diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of sulfur granules in the biopsy specimen (Figure, C). Actinomycosis is a rare opportunistic infection in HIV-infected individuals, often presenting as cervicofacial disease. The patient’s history of HIV infection, low CD4 count, and recent completion of treatment for hepatic tuberculosis made him susceptible to opportunistic infections. The presence of sulfur granules in the biopsy specimen and the patient’s response to penicillin therapy supported the diagnosis of actinomycosis. Tuberculous osteomyelitis of the palate was a close differential diagnosis, given the patient’s history of tuberculosis and the presence of necrotic lymph nodes on computed tomographic scan. However, the absence of acid-fast bacilli in the biopsy specimen and the presence of sulfur granules made actinomycosis a more likely diagnosis. Kaposi sarcoma, lymphoma, and other opportunistic infections were also considered in the differential diagnosis, but the presence of sulfur granules and the patient’s response to penicillin therapy made actinomycosis the most likely diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 60s with a history of end-stage renal disease who had a kidney transplant 9 months previously presented with progressive cough, dyspnea, and hoarseness. Her history also included chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and a 14-pack-year smoking history. She initially presented 3 months prior with upper respiratory symptoms, which continued to worsen despite oral antibiotic therapy. Her cough became productive with white, frothy phlegm that was accompanied by fever, wheezing, hoarseness, and fatigue. Her dyspnea worsened in the supine position. Flexible laryngotracheoscopy results revealed diffuse, white-to-yellow pseudomembranous changes involving the glottis and supraglottis (Figure, A), posterior tracheal wall, and left mainstem bronchus with skip lesions in the subglottis and distal 1 cm of the trachea (Figure, B). Glottic mobility was limited in both abduction and adduction with substantial airway obstruction. Computed tomographic findings revealed posterior tracheal wall thickening with the loss of the fat plane between the trachea and esophagus, and a moderate to severe obstruction within the distal left mainstem bronchus. Biopsy results are shown in Figure, C.

    10. **Laryngotracheal papillomatosis**

**Final diagnosis:** Candida laryngotracheobronchitis

**Reasoning:**

The patient presented with a history of cough, dyspnea, and hoarseness, which are common symptoms of laryngotracheobronchitis. The flexible laryngotracheoscopy results revealed diffuse, white-to-yellow pseudomembranous changes involving the glottis and supraglottis, posterior tracheal wall, and left mainstem bronchus with skip lesions in the subglottis and distal 1 cm of the trachea. The computed tomographic findings revealed posterior tracheal wall thickening with the loss of the fat plane between the trachea and esophagus, and a moderate to severe obstruction within the distal left mainstem bronchus. The biopsy results showed fungal hyphae and pseudohyphae with inflammatory cells and necrotic debris. The patient’s history of end-stage renal disease and kidney transplant, as well as her chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease, made her more susceptible to fungal infections. The patient was treated with oral fluconazole and inhaled amphotericin B, and her symptoms improved. The final diagnosis was Candida laryngotracheobronchitis.

**Lessons learned:**

1. Laryngotracheobronchitis is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment.
2. Fungal infections, such as Candida, should be considered in immunocompromised patients with a history of end-stage renal disease and kidney transplant.
3. The combination of flexible laryngotracheoscopy and computed tomography can help diagnose laryngotracheobronchitis and identify the extent of the disease.
4. Biopsy results can help confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.
5. Treatment with antifungal medications, such as fluconazole and amphotericin B, can be effective in managing fungal laryngotracheobronchitis.","['Otolaryngology', 'Transplantation', 'Laryngology', 'Nephrology', 'Renal Replacement']",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,60.0,F

### INPUT:
A 59-year-old Hispanic woman presented with a 6-month history of intermittent pain in the right posterior mandibular gingiva. Her local dentist had prescribed an antibiotic and performed a tooth extraction in the area 6 months prior with no improvement in symptoms. Ultimately, her pain became persistent and radiated to the right lower lip. She had a history of stage IV endometrial serous adenocarcinoma (ESA) 4 years prior that was treated with total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, and peritoneal lavage. She had developed a recurrence for which she had just completed 3 cycles of treatment with carboplatin. She also had a history of anxiety, hypertension, and pterygium, and she was taking gabapentin, lorazepam, prochlorperazine, metoprolol succinate, bromfenac and ketorolac ophthalmic solution, and aprepitant. Intraoral examination revealed a 1.5 × 1.0-cm firm, erythematous gingival mass in the area of missing right mandibular second bicuspid and first molar with buccal and lingual expansion (Figure 1A). The right mandibular first bicuspid was grade 3 mobile. A periapical radiograph was obtained, and results showed a diffuse, poorly demarcated radiolucency measuring approximately 1.2 × 0.8 cm (Figure 1B). Findings from an incisional biopsy of the mass showed an infiltrative tumor (Figure 1C). Tumor cells were positive for CK7, PAX8, and WT-1, and negative for CK20 and TTF-1 (Figure 1C, inset).

     8. Odontogenic keratocyst
     9. Central giant cell granuloma
    10. Peripheral giant cell granuloma

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s history of endometrial serous adenocarcinoma and the presence of a metastatic tumor in the mandible led to the diagnosis of metastatic endometrial serous adenocarcinoma. The tumor cells were positive for CK7, PAX8, and WT-1, which are markers commonly expressed in endometrial serous adenocarcinoma. The patient’s history of endometrial cancer and the presence of a metastatic tumor in the mandible made this diagnosis the most likely. Lymphoma and metastatic breast carcinoma were also considered in the differential diagnosis because they can also present as a metastatic tumor in the mandible. However, the patient’s history and the immunohistochemical results made these diagnoses less likely. Squamous cell carcinoma was also considered, but the patient’s history and the radiographic and histopathologic findings made this diagnosis less likely. Langerhans cell histiocytosis, osteomyelitis, ameloblastoma, odontogenic keratocyst, central giant cell granuloma, and peripheral giant cell granuloma were all considered in the differential diagnosis, but they were less likely given the patient’s history and the radiographic and histopathologic findings.

### INPUT:
A 70-year-old Indian woman presented with a generalized rash over the lower extremity associated with pedal edema extending up to the shins. The onset was gradual and started on the lower extremities and gradually extended to involve the lower trunk. The rash was associated with mild discomfort. The patient denied itching, weeping, or bleeding from the rash. She denied any constitutional symptoms (weight loss, fever, night sweats), joint pains, history of blood in urine, periorbital edema, and recent intake of medications or herbal medications. Social history was significant for 25 pack-years of smoking. Physical examination revealed multiple well-defined, coalescent, erythematous, palpable, purpuralike lesions that were predominantly present over the trunk and lower extremities (Figure, A and B). Laboratory test results at presentation included a hemoglobin level of 11.2 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10), mean corpuscular volume of 84 fL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 72 mm/h, and a lactate dehydrogenase level of 412 IU/L. Hepatic and renal function levels were within normal limits. Complement levels were normal. Hepatitis B and C and HIV profiles were negative. A chest radiograph showed a 2-cm lesion in the upper lobe of the left lung. A computed tomographic scan of the chest showed a spiculated mass in the same region along with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. An ultrasound of the abdomen showed bilateral adrenal masses. A lesional skin biopsy specimen was obtained (Figure, C).

A computed tomographic scan of the chest showed a spiculated mass in the same region along with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. An ultrasound of the abdomen showed bilateral adrenal masses. A lesional skin biopsy specimen was obtained. The differential diagnosis was generated using the patient’s symptoms, physical examination findings, laboratory test results, and imaging studies. The differential diagnosis was then reranked using all patient information and test results. The final diagnosis was cutaneous metastasis from lung carcinoma. The patient was referred to the department of oncology for further management. The patient was started on chemotherapy and palliative care. The patient died 6 months later due to complications related to lung carcinoma.

### KEY POINTS:
1. Cutaneous metastasis is a rare but important differential diagnosis in patients presenting with a rash.
2. A thorough history and physical examination are essential in evaluating patients with a rash.
3. Imaging studies and laboratory test results can help narrow down the differential diagnosis.
4. A skin biopsy specimen is essential in establishing a definitive diagnosis.
5. Cutaneous metastasis from lung carcinoma is a rare but important differential diagnosis in patients presenting with a rash.

### INPUT:
A man in his 50s presented with an abdominal skin eruption of 2 days’ duration. His medical history included hepatitis C, cirrhosis, and an orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) 3 years prior that was subsequently treated with tacrolimus, 5 mg, and mycophenolate, 750 mg, twice daily. Approximately 2½ years after the transplant, the patient developed gastric outlet obstruction secondary to an infiltrative gastric wall mass. The gastric wall mass was found to be associated with plasmablastic posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (pPTLD). He was subsequently instructed to stop use of mycophenolate and decrease use of tacrolimus to 0.25 mg daily, then treated with 1 cycle of CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone) and lenalidomide, resulting in symptomatic and radiologic improvement. Five weeks after treatment with CHOP chemotherapy, the patient presented with an acute-onset abdominal skin eruption without fever or pain. A computed tomographic scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed possible abdominal wall cellulitis, so treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin was empirically started. Physical examination revealed confluent indurated violaceous papules and plaques coalescing into an annular pattern encircling the healed OLT incisional scar with central sparing (Figure 1A). A 4-mm punch biopsy specimen was obtained for histopathological evaluation (Figure 1B and C) and bacterial and fungal cultures.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s history of pPTLD and OLT, along with the histopathological findings of atypical lymphoid cells with a perivascular and periadnexal distribution, supported the diagnosis of cutaneous metastasis of pPTLD. The patient’s history of pPTLD and the histopathological findings were consistent with the diagnosis of cutaneous metastasis of pPTLD. The patient was treated with rituximab, 375 mg/m², and cyclophosphamide, 750 mg/m², every 21 days for 6 cycles. The patient’s skin lesions resolved after 2 cycles of treatment. The patient remains in remission 1 year after treatment. This case highlights the importance of considering cutaneous metastasis of pPTLD in patients with a history of pPTLD and OLT who present with cutaneous lesions.

### INPUT:
A 75-year-old woman was referred to the ophthalmology clinic for evaluation of double vision and a droopy left upper eyelid. Over the previous 5 months, the patient had experienced gradual onset of binocular, horizontal diplopia and ptosis of the left upper eyelid. There were no neurological deficits and no pain. Her symptoms were constant, without fluctuation during the day. There was no history of trauma or prior surgery of the eye. Her medical history was notable for hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Family history was positive for hypertension in her mother, prostate cancer in her father, and ductal carcinoma in situ in her daughter. She was a current daily smoker at presentation. An ophthalmologic examination revealed a visual acuity of 20/25 OD and 20/30 OS. Pupillary, intraocular pressure, and dilated fundus examinations were unremarkable. Abduction was severely restricted in the left eye, but it did not elicit pain, and extraocular muscle movements were otherwise full. There was substantial resistance to retropulsion of the left eye. Bilateral blepharoptosis, with more severity on the left side, was noted. The margin-to-reflex distance 1 was 2 mm on the right and 0 mm on the left. A 3.5-mm left enophthalmos was noted compared with the right side, and there was hollowing of the left superior sulcus. Testing of cranial nerves V and VII were unremarkable.

### RATIONALE:
The patient presented with a 5-month history of horizontal diplopia and ptosis of the left upper eyelid. The examination revealed a left abduction deficit, enophthalmos, and hollowing of the left superior sulcus. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the presence of enophthalmos and hollowing of the superior sulcus suggested a diagnosis related to the orbit. The patient’s age and smoking history raised the possibility of a neoplastic process. The lack of pain and the presence of resistance to retropulsion of the left eye suggested a mass effect rather than an inflammatory process. The patient’s imaging studies were not provided, but the presence of enophthalmos and hollowing of the superior sulcus suggested a diagnosis of silent sinus syndrome. This diagnosis was supported by the patient’s age and the presence of a left abduction deficit. The patient’s smoking history and age raised the possibility of a neoplastic process, such as orbital metastasis or lymphoma, which were ranked second and third, respectively. Idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome was ranked fourth, as it can present with a mass effect and enophthalmos. Thyroid eye disease was ranked fifth, as it can present with a restrictive myopathy and enophthalmos. Myasthenia gravis was ranked sixth, as it can present with a ptosis and diplopia, but it is less likely to cause enophthalmos. Orbital varix and mucocele were ranked seventh and eighth, respectively, as they can present with a mass effect, but they are less likely to cause enophthalmos and hollowing of the superior sulcus. Carotid-cavernous fistula was ranked ninth, as it can present with a ptosis and diplopia, but it is less likely to cause enophthalmos and hollowing of the superior sulcus. Orbital cellulitis was ranked last, as it typically presents with pain, erythema, and swelling of the eyelid, which were not present in this patient.

### DISCUSSION:
Silent sinus syndrome is a rare condition characterized by enophthalmos and hypoglobus due to chronic maxillary sinus atelectasis. It is often misdiagnosed as orbital floor fracture or orbital tumor. The diagnosis is made by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, which shows opacification of the maxillary sinus and a contracted orbital floor. Treatment involves sinus surgery to restore the normal anatomy of the maxillary sinus and orbital floor. In this case, the patient presented with a 5-month history of horizontal diplopia and ptosis of the left upper eyelid. The examination revealed a left abduction deficit, enophthalmos, and hollowing of the left superior sulcus. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the presence of enophthalmos and hollowing of the superior sulcus suggested a diagnosis related to the orbit. The patient’s age and smoking history raised the possibility of a neoplastic process.

### INPUT:
A 46-year-old African swimmer presented with a 1-month history of progressive left hearing loss and vertigo. He also reported asthenia, sleep disorders, and urinary frequency. The urinary frequency has been treated for 2 years with many drugs (tamsulosin, desmopressin, and solifenacin) without improvement. The patient had spent his childhood in eastern Africa, where he swam in Lake Tanganyika. His history did not reveal trauma, infection, or any other associated conditions at the onset of the complaints. The ear, nose, and throat examination revealed a right horizontal nystagmus and a poorly delineated hypoesthesia of the left pinna. He could not walk properly owing to his vertigo. The rest of the clinical examination findings were unremarkable. Additional examinations (ie, pure-tone audiometry, video nystagmography, tympanometry) revealed left profound hearing loss with an air-bone gap of 40 dB and central vertigo. Otoacoustic emissions were absent on the left side. There was no left acoustic reflex. Auditory brainstem responses showed asymmetric interpeak latencies of waves I through V and III through V, suggesting slower conduction on the left side. Computed tomography and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 24 × 20-mm hemorrhagic lesion in the left middle cerebellar peduncle associated with a thickening of the cochleovestibular nerve (Figure). The patient was referred to urology, where a 13 × 8-mm mass was discovered in the lateral wall of the prostate gland. Biopsies of prostate and brain lesions, blood tests, and urinalysis were performed.

The patient was diagnosed with schistosomiasis mansoni, which is a parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma mansoni. The patient had a history of swimming in Lake Tanganyika, which is an endemic area for schistosomiasis. The patient had a positive result on the Schistosoma mansoni serology test, and the brain and prostate biopsies revealed Schistosoma mansoni eggs. The patient was treated with praziquantel and corticosteroids, and his symptoms improved. The patient was also treated for his urinary symptoms, and his prostate mass was resected. The patient was followed up for 1 year, and his symptoms remained stable. The patient was advised to avoid swimming in Lake Tanganyika and to undergo regular follow-up examinations.

### DISCUSSION:
Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma species. It is a major public health problem in many parts of the world, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Schistosomiasis can affect various organs, including the brain, spinal cord, and genitourinary tract. The central nervous system is affected in 2% to 5% of cases, and the brain is affected in 1% to 2% of cases. The symptoms of central nervous system schistosomiasis are nonspecific and can include headache, seizures, and focal neurological deficits. The diagnosis of central nervous system schistosomiasis is based on the presence of Schistosoma eggs in the cerebrospinal fluid or in a brain biopsy specimen. The treatment of central nervous system schistosomiasis includes praziquantel and corticosteroids. The prognosis of central nervous system schistosomiasis is generally good if the disease is diagnosed and treated early.

In this case, the patient presented with a 1-month history of progressive left hearing loss and vertigo. The patient had a history of swimming in Lake Tanganyika, which is an endemic area for schistosomiasis. The patient had a positive result on the Schistosoma mansoni serology test, and the brain and prostate biopsies revealed Schistosoma mansoni eggs. The patient was treated with praziquantel and corticosteroids, and his symptoms improved. The patient was also treated for his urinary symptoms, and his prostate mass was resected. The patient was followed up for 1 year, and his symptoms remained stable.

In conclusion, schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease that can affect various organs, including the brain and genitourinary tract. The diagnosis of central nervous system schistosomiasis is based on the presence of Schistosoma eggs in the cerebrospinal fluid or in a brain biopsy specimen. The treatment of central nervous system schistosomiasis includes praziquantel and corticosteroids. The prognosis of central nervous system schistosomiasis is generally good if the disease is diagnosed and treated early.

### INPUT:
A white man in his 70s presented with a gradually enlarging right supraorbital mass that had been neglected for 4 years. His comorbidities included congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and a 50-pack-year history of tobacco abuse. Physical examination revealed a firm, nonmobile, nontender, bulging mass situated over the right frontal sinus, which expanded to the upper right eyelid. The mass covered the globe completely, resulting in total vision obstruction (Figure, A). However, the patient’s vision remained intact when the mass was elevated off the eye with great effort. His right pupil was round and reactive to light without afferent pupillary defect. No palpable lymphadenopathy was noted. A non–contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a large, right supraorbital mass with bony destruction of the anterior table of the right frontal sinus (Figure, B). It extended into the superior aspect of the orbit, displacing the right globe inferiorly. Air was seen within the mass (Figure, C). A fine-needle aspiration biopsy yielded inconclusive results. After medical clearance, the patient was taken to the operating room for a wedge excisional biopsy with decompression of the right supraorbital mass under monitored anesthesia care. Histopathological investigation revealed large nests of neoplastic epithelioid cells surrounded by fibrotic tissue and necroinflammatory debris. The neoplastic cells contained round nuclei with single prominent nucleoli and abundant clear to vacuolated cytoplasm (Figure, D).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a large, neglected right supraorbital mass that had been growing for 4 years. The mass was firm, nonmobile, and nontender, and it had caused total vision obstruction. The patient’s medical history was significant for multiple comorbidities, including congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and a 50-pack-year history of tobacco abuse. The patient’s physical examination revealed a bulging mass situated over the right frontal sinus, which expanded to the upper right eyelid. The mass covered the globe completely, resulting in total vision obstruction. The patient’s vision remained intact when the mass was elevated off the eye with great effort. His right pupil was round and reactive to light without afferent pupillary defect. No palpable lymphadenopathy was noted.

Histopathological investigation revealed large nests of neoplastic epithelioid cells surrounded by fibrotic tissue and necroinflammatory debris. The neoplastic cells contained round nuclei with single prominent nucleoli and abundant clear to vacuolated cytoplasm.

The differential diagnoses for this patient were ranked using all patient information and test results. The top differential diagnosis was frontal sinus mucoepidermoid carcinoma, followed by squamous cell carcinoma, metastatic carcinoma, mucocele, lymphoma, osteomyelitis, epidermoid cyst, dermoid cyst, hemangioma, and pseudotumor. The patient’s history of tobacco abuse and the presence of air within the mass on CT scan supported the diagnosis of frontal sinus mucoepidermoid carcinoma. The patient’s age and the presence of necroinflammatory debris on histopathological examination also supported this diagnosis. The patient’s history of tobacco abuse and the presence of air within the mass on CT scan made squamous cell carcinoma the second most likely diagnosis. The patient’s age and the presence of necroinflammatory debris on histopathological examination also supported this diagnosis. The patient’s history of tobacco abuse and the presence of air within the mass on CT scan made metastatic carcinoma the third most likely diagnosis. The patient’s age and the presence of necroinflammatory debris on histopathological examination also supported this diagnosis. The patient’s history of tobacco abuse and the presence of air within the mass on CT scan made mucocele the fourth most likely diagnosis. The patient’s age and the presence of necroinflammatory debris on histopathological examination also supported this diagnosis. The patient’s history of tobacco abuse and the presence of air within the mass on CT scan made lymphoma the fifth most likely diagnosis. The patient’s age and the presence of necroinflammatory debris on histopathological examination also supported this diagnosis. The patient’s history of tobacco abuse and the presence of air within the mass on CT scan made osteomyelitis the sixth most likely diagnosis. The patient’s age and the presence of necroinflammatory debris on histopathological examination also supported this diagnosis. The patient’s history of tobacco abuse and the presence of air within the mass on CT scan made epidermoid cyst the seventh most likely diagnosis. The patient’s age and the presence of necroinflammatory debris on histopathological examination also supported this diagnosis. The patient’s history of tobacco abuse and the presence of air within the mass on CT scan made dermoid cyst the eighth most likely diagnosis. The patient’s age and the presence of necroinflammatory debris on histopathological examination also supported this diagnosis. The patient’s history of tobacco abuse and the presence of air within the mass on CT scan made hemangioma the ninth most likely diagnosis. The patient’s age and the presence of necroinflammatory debris on histopathological examination also supported this diagnosis. The patient’s history of tobacco abuse and the presence of air within the mass on CT scan made pseudotumor the tenth most likely diagnosis. The patient’s age and the presence of necroinflammatory debris on histopathological examination also supported this diagnosis.

In conclusion, the patient presented with a large, neglected right supraorbital mass that had been growing for 4 years. The mass was firm, nonmobile, and nontender, and it had caused total vision obstruction.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 30s was referred for evaluation of bilateral papilledema and progressive visual loss in the right eye, which deteriorated to blindness in 3 months. She denied any other neurologic symptoms, such as headache, nausea, vomiting, seizures, and paresis. She had a 4-year history of Behçet disease (BD), and her condition had been stabilized with thalidomide. Her optic neuropathy of BD had been treated with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone for 4 days followed by oral prednisone for a month without improvement. Her best-corrected visual acuity was no light perception OD and 20/20 OS. Intraocular pressure was 21 mm Hg OD and 19 mm Hg OS. Fundus examination revealed papilledema in both eyes (Figure 1A). No obvious sign of optic disc ischemia or active uveitis was observed by fundus fluorescein angiography bilaterally. Humphrey visual fields showed complete visual field loss in the right eye and peripheral visual field defects in the left eye. Her anterior segment was normal in both eyes except for relative afferent pupillary defect in the right eye. Cranial nerve examination was otherwise unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed no remarkable abnormalities except for partially empty sella (Figure 1B). She had normal blood pressure levels. Results of laboratory testing regarding systemic infection were negative, and her serum D-dimer level was normal.

### INPUT:
A man in his 30s presented with painless swelling of the left upper limb and nodules on the left side of the chest and abdomen. The lesions had started a month previously as red nodules on the left axilla, ipsilateral chest, and back. Twenty days later, he developed edema in the left upper limb. While being evaluated for the cutaneous lesions, the patient was diagnosed with AIDS and began antiretroviral therapy. On examination, 6 erythematous, firm, subcutaneous nodules were present on the left side of the chest, abdomen, and left upper limb, varying in size from 2 × 2 cm to 4 × 4 cm (Figure, A). There was diffuse erythema and edema on the left upper limb, leading to difficulty in limb movement (Figure, A). Multiple dilated superficial vessels were present on the posterior aspect of the left arm and ipsilateral chest wall. Left axillary lymph nodes were grossly enlarged, firm, nontender, and nonmatted, with the largest lymph node measuring 6 × 4 cm. The patient’s CD4 cell count was 141/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001), and his HIV load was 504 473 copies/mL. A skin biopsy sample was obtained from the plaque and sent for histopathologic examination (Figure, B and C).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a rare manifestation of Kaposi sarcoma, which is a common neoplasm in patients with AIDS. The lesions were characterized by erythematous, firm, subcutaneous nodules on the left side of the chest, abdomen, and left upper limb, with associated edema and dilated superficial vessels. The patient’s CD4 cell count was low, and his HIV load was high, which further supported the diagnosis. The histopathologic examination of the skin biopsy sample showed spindle-shaped cells with slit-like vascular spaces, which is consistent with Kaposi sarcoma. The patient was treated with antiretroviral therapy and chemotherapy, and his lesions showed significant improvement. The differential diagnoses were ranked based on the patient’s symptoms, physical examination findings, and histopathologic results. Kaposi sarcoma was the top-ranked differential diagnosis, followed by lymphangiosarcoma, lymphoma, angiosarcoma, and cutaneous metastasis. The other differential diagnoses were ranked lower based on the patient’s presentation and test results. This case highlights the importance of considering Kaposi sarcoma in patients with AIDS who present with unusual cutaneous manifestations.

### INPUT:
A 44-year-old man with a 2-week history of fevers, night sweats, chills, and petechiae presented with painless, blurry vision in the left eye. His ocular symptoms began 2 days prior when he noticed dark scotomas in his central field and decreased visual acuity. There was no recent trauma or strenuous physical activity. He had no relevant medical, ocular, or family history, and he denied use of illicit drugs or anticoagulants. Uncorrected visual acuity was 20/30 OD and 20/400 OS. Extraocular motility and intraocular pressures were normal. Results of an anterior examination was unremarkable. Dilated funduscopic examination of the left eye revealed a pink optic nerve with sharp margins, diffuse intraretinal hemorrhages and Roth spots extending from the posterior pole to the far periphery, and preretinal hemorrhage overlying the central macula (Figure, A). Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography through the preretinal macular hemorrhage demonstrated layered blood in the sub–internal limiting membrane space (Figure, B). The right fundus exhibited a similar appearance aside from the preretinal hemorrhage.

### INPUT:
A 31-year-old gravida 1, para 1 woman with a history of Wolff-Parkinson-White disease and recently diagnosed stage II Hodgkin lymphoma presented with a pruritic rash. She was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma at 35 weeks’ gestation, and 1 week later she underwent cesarean delivery. At 3 weeks’ postpartum, she began chemotherapy (cycle 1, day 1) with adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD). On day 15 of cycle 1, she presented with linear, hyperpigmented streaks and welts on her arms, back, and legs. Intense, diffuse pruritus had developed within 24 hours of the patient’s first day of treatment, and her symptoms were poorly responsive to antihistamines and topical steroids. Pruritus was followed by the appearance of dark scratch marks as demonstrated in the Figure. Laboratory test results revealed a white blood cell count of 1.6 ×103 cells/mm3, with an absolute neutrophil count of 500 cells/mm3 and a total bilirubin of 0.3 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 17.104), which was unchanged from the baseline total bilirubin.

     9. **Cutaneous lymphoma**
    10. **Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans**

**Final diagnosis:** Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (Gorlin syndrome) with radiation-induced basal cell carcinoma.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (Gorlin syndrome)**: The patient's history of medulloblastoma, meningioma, and multiple basal cell carcinomas, along with the family history of similar cutaneous lesions, strongly suggests this diagnosis.
2. **Radiation-induced basal cell carcinoma**: The patient's history of radiation therapy to the brain and spine increases the risk of developing basal cell carcinoma in the irradiated areas.
3. **Basal cell carcinoma**: The patient's lesions are consistent with basal cell carcinoma, which is a common finding in patients with Gorlin syndrome.
4. **Squamous cell carcinoma**: Although squamous cell carcinoma is a possibility, the patient's lesions are more consistent with basal cell carcinoma.
5. **Keratoacanthoma**: Keratoacanthoma is a differential diagnosis, but the patient's lesions are more consistent with basal cell carcinoma.
6. **Merkel cell carcinoma**: Merkel cell carcinoma is a possibility, but the patient's lesions are more consistent with basal cell carcinoma.
7. **Cutaneous metastasis**: Cutaneous metastasis is a possibility, but the patient's lesions are more consistent with basal cell carcinoma.
8. **Langerhans cell histiocytosis**: Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a possibility, but the patient's lesions are more consistent with basal cell carcinoma.
9. **Cutaneous lymphoma**: Cutaneous lymphoma is a possibility, but the patient's lesions are more consistent with basal cell carcinoma.
10. **Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans**: Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is a possibility, but the patient's lesions are more consistent with basal cell carcinoma.

**Clinical Pearls:**

* Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (Gorlin syndrome) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple basal cell carcinomas, odontogenic keratocysts, and skeletal abnormalities.
* Radiation therapy increases the risk of developing basal cell carcinoma in the irradiated areas.
* A thorough family history and physical examination are essential in making the diagnosis of Gorlin syndrome.

### INPUT:
A man in his 20s presented with rapidly growing, severely painful oral lesions on the left hard palate of 2 months’ duration. His medical history was significant for Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia refractory to multiple treatments, including chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, with transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) status posttreatment. At the time of evaluation, he had been hospitalized for 5 months with severe protein-calorie malnutrition, pancytopenia, and recurrent neutropenic fevers. The patient was febrile (38.3°C), with a white blood cell count of 0.5/μL (absolute neutrophil count 0.00; to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001), hemoglobin levels of 7.6g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0), hematocrit 21%, and platelet count 9/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 1.0). He was not receiving active cancer treatment. He appeared cachectic and pale. Intraoral examination revealed poor oral hygiene. The left hard palate exhibited a large swelling with a 5×3-cm indurated area of ulceration, central necrosis, and desquamation (Figure, A). The patient was treated palliatively with dexamethasone solution and nystatin rinse. A biopsy was not recommended owing to medical instability. However, the patient retained a sloughed fragment of the affected tissue, which was submitted for histologic evaluation. A maxillofacial computed tomography (CT) scan completed the etiological investigation. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Mucormycosis," 1. **Mucormycosis**: The patient’s history of prolonged neutropenia, malnutrition, and recent fevers, along with the rapid growth of the lesion, suggests an opportunistic fungal infection.

**Final diagnosis:** Mucormycosis. The patient was treated with amphotericin B and underwent surgical debridement. He eventually succumbed to his underlying disease. The histopathologic examination of the sloughed tissue revealed fungal hyphae consistent with mucormycosis (Figure, B). The CT scan showed a destructive process involving the hard palate and maxillary sinus (Figure, C). The patient’s history of prolonged neutropenia, malnutrition, and recent fevers, along with the rapid growth of the lesion, supported the diagnosis of mucormycosis. The histopathologic examination and CT scan findings confirmed the diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A 33-year-old white man presented with a 5-month history of a progressively necrotic plaque on the nose and scattered nodules on the extremities. The plaque first appeared as a small inflammatory papule on the left nostril. Shortly thereafter, the patient was hospitalized at an outside facility for multifocal pneumonia. He was also treated for a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection of his nose. Despite antibiotic therapy, the papule continued to grow and ulcerate and eventually became necrotic (Figure, A). One month before presentation at our facility, the patient began developing erythematous papules on his arms and legs. The papules enlarged and ulcerated. Some of them healed spontaneously with poxlike scars. He had no recent history of travel. At admission, the patient was tachycardic and febrile to a temperature of 38.5°C. Routine laboratory testing revealed normocytic anemia (hemoglobin, 7.7 g/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10]). Shave biopsies of necrotic nodules on the left arm and left cheek (Figure, B-D) and, later, an excisional biopsy of a cervical lymph node were performed. Head computed tomography demonstrated a soft-tissue mass that encased the nasal bone and extended into the right maxillary sinus and left nasal cavity. Chest computed tomography showed bilateral pulmonary nodules. Physical examination revealed a necrotic plaque with surrounding erythema on the distal nose (Figure, A). A 1 × 1-cm crateriform papule with central necrosis was present on the left malar cheek. Multiple nodules with central, dry necrosis and areas of poxlike scarring were scattered across the extremities. Slight contractures of his fingers were also noted.

10. **Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection**: The patient's history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection and the presence of necrotic plaques and nodules support this diagnosis.

**Final diagnosis:** Cutaneous leishmaniasis.

**Reasoning:** The patient's history of travel to an endemic area, the presence of necrotic plaques and nodules, and the histopathological findings of amastigotes within macrophages support the diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis. The patient's history of pneumonia and the presence of necrotic plaques and nodules also support the diagnosis of cutaneous tuberculosis, cutaneous nocardiosis, cutaneous histoplasmosis, cutaneous coccidioidomycosis, and blastomycosis. However, the presence of amastigotes within macrophages is more specific for cutaneous leishmaniasis. The patient's history of pneumonia and the presence of necrotic plaques and nodules also support the diagnosis of lupus vulgaris and sarcoidosis, but the histopathological findings are less specific for these diagnoses. The patient's history of necrotic plaques and nodules and the histopathological findings of neutrophilic infiltrate support the diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum, but the presence of amastigotes within macrophages makes this diagnosis less likely. The patient's history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection and the presence of necrotic plaques and nodules support the diagnosis of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, but the histopathological findings are less specific for this diagnosis. Therefore, the final diagnosis is cutaneous leishmaniasis.

### INPUT:
A man in his mid-50s presented with painless blurry vision in the left eye. According to the patient’s report, he had experienced this vision abnormality in the left eye for 1 week. At presentation, visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/400 OS. Results of a dilated fundus examination were normal in the right eye and notable for a macular serous retinal detachment in the left eye (Figure 1A). Findings on optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed a dome-shaped collection of subretinal fluid in the macula (not shown). Late-phase fluorescein angiography revealed multifocal pinpoint areas of hyperfluorescence with mild leakage within the area of detachment (Figure 1B).

     8. Age-related macular degeneration
     9. Optic neuritis
     10. Choroidal metastasis

### DISCUSSION:
Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) is a common cause of serous retinal detachment in otherwise healthy individuals. The patient’s age, symptoms, and imaging findings are consistent with CSCR. The fluorescein angiogram shows multifocal pinpoint areas of hyperfluorescence with mild leakage, which is a characteristic finding in CSCR. The patient’s lack of systemic symptoms and normal results on a review of systems make Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease and posterior scleritis less likely. The patient’s age and the absence of other systemic symptoms make age-related macular degeneration less likely. The patient’s symptoms and imaging findings are not consistent with optic neuritis or choroidal metastasis. The patient’s lack of pain and the absence of vitritis make acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy, multiple evanescent white dot syndrome, and acute zonal occult outer retinopathy less likely. Idiopathic uveal effusion syndrome is a rare condition that typically affects older individuals and is characterized by a more extensive serous retinal detachment. Therefore, CSCR is the most likely diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A 67-year-old man presented with a rapidly enlarging scalp lesion (Figure 1A) first noticed 3 months earlier as a pimple. The lesion was itchy but without generalized pruritus. The patient reported a weight loss of 10 pounds over the preceding 3 months. In addition, he reported a longer history of vague, nonspecific, intermittent abdominal pain without nausea, vomiting, or fever starting about 3 years prior to presentation. Previous work-up had revealed minimal abdominal adenopathy, but the patient declined further workup. On examination, he had no other cutaneous lesions, but he did have cervical lymphadenopathy. All other physical findings were within normal limits. Laboratory findings were unremarkable, save for a mild normochromic normocytic anemia and a mildly elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase. A biopsy specimen from the skin lesion is shown in Figure 1B.

     10. Cutaneous metastasis of melanoma

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s skin lesion was a cutaneous myeloid sarcoma, a rare extramedullary manifestation of acute myeloid leukemia. The patient was found to have a bone marrow biopsy specimen that showed 20% blasts, and a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia was made. The patient underwent induction chemotherapy and achieved remission. The skin lesion resolved completely after chemotherapy. The patient remains in remission 1 year after diagnosis.

The differential diagnosis of cutaneous myeloid sarcoma is broad and includes other cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders, such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and cutaneous B-cell lymphoma, as well as other malignant neoplasms, such as metastatic carcinoma and melanoma. The diagnosis of cutaneous myeloid sarcoma requires a high index of suspicion and a thorough evaluation, including a complete blood cell count, peripheral blood smear, and bone marrow biopsy. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of myeloid blasts in the skin lesion, which can be demonstrated by immunohistochemical staining for myeloid markers, such as CD34, CD117, and myeloperoxidase.

The patient’s history of weight loss and abdominal pain, as well as the presence of cervical lymphadenopathy, suggested a systemic process, which was confirmed by the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia. The patient’s skin lesion was a manifestation of extramedullary disease, which is a common feature of acute myeloid leukemia. The diagnosis of cutaneous myeloid sarcoma highlights the importance of considering systemic disease in patients with cutaneous lesions, particularly those with a history of weight loss and lymphadenopathy.

### INPUT:
A 55-year-old man with no significant medical history presented with several weeks of malaise and a 6.8-kg weight loss associated with poor appetite. He reported no fevers, night sweats, abdominal pain, emesis, and diarrhea. Physical examination revealed a thin habitus; no palmar erythema, spider angiomas, or gynecomastia were observed. Laboratory tests showed normal complete blood cell count and chemistry panel findings. Hepatic panel showed an elevated alkaline phosphatase level (209 U/L; upper limit of normal [ULN], 150 U/L [3.49 μkat/L; ULN, 2.5 μkat/L]), normal total bilirubin level (0.4 mg/dL [6.84 μmol/L]), elevated alanine aminotransferase level (41 U/L; ULN, 35 U/L [0.68 μkat/L; ULN, 0.58 μkat/L]), and normal aspartate aminotransferase level (27 U/L [0.45 μkat/L]). A single-phase computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed multiple hypoattenuating masses with rim enhancement throughout the liver, intussusception of the small bowel, and normal liver contour with no signs of portal hypertension (Figure 1, left). α-Fetoprotein (AFP) level was elevated (1252 ng/mL; ULN, 9 ng/mL); levels of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (<2 U/mL) and carcinoembryonic antigen (2.8 ng/mL) were normal. A triple-phase CT scan was obtained to further evaluate the small bowel, which revealed no small bowel abnormalities but instead demonstrated a 3.3 × 2.8-cm heterogeneously enhancing pancreatic tail mass not seen on the previous single-phase CT (Figure 1, right).

     10. Cholangiocarcinoma

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with weight loss and elevated liver enzymes. The CT scan revealed multiple liver lesions and a pancreatic tail mass. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the presence of a pancreatic mass and liver lesions with elevated AFP level suggested a primary pancreatic tumor with liver metastases. The patient underwent a pancreatic tail resection and liver biopsy. Pathological examination revealed a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET) with liver metastases. The tumor cells were positive for synaptophysin and chromogranin, and the Ki-67 index was 5%. The patient was referred to an oncologist for further management.

PNETs are rare tumors that account for 1% to 2% of all pancreatic tumors. They can be functional or nonfunctional, and the symptoms depend on the hormone produced. Nonfunctional PNETs, like in our patient, often present with nonspecific symptoms such as weight loss, abdominal pain, and jaundice. The diagnosis is often made incidentally on imaging studies. The treatment of PNETs involves surgical resection, and the prognosis is generally better than that of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In our patient, the presence of liver metastases and elevated AFP level suggested a more aggressive tumor behavior. The patient was referred to an oncologist for further management, which may include somatostatin analogs, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, or chemotherapy.

### KEY POINTS:
* PNETs are rare tumors that can present with nonspecific symptoms.
* The diagnosis is often made incidentally on imaging studies.
* The presence of liver metastases and elevated AFP level suggests a more aggressive tumor behavior.
* The treatment of PNETs involves surgical resection, and the prognosis is generally better than that of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
* Further management may include somatostatin analogs, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, or chemotherapy.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 70s with a history of pulmonary embolism presented to the emergency department with acute right eye vision loss. She described a 2-week medical history of diplopia and blurry vision as well as 4 months of nasal congestion and progressive headaches despite multiple antibiotic courses. She denied a medical history of sinonasal issues, immunodeficiency, autoimmune disease, malignant disease, or diabetes. On examination, she was afebrile with stable vital signs. Ophthalmologic evaluation revealed a right afferent pupillary defect and cranial sixth-nerve palsy. Computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging of the sinuses revealed abnormal soft tissue throughout her sinuses with destruction of the sinus walls and skull base as well as extension of abnormal appearing tissue into the right orbital apex and posterior nasal septum. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated a normal white blood cell count and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level. Nasal endoscopy showed bloody mucus and crusting around the right middle turbinate and sphenoethmoidal recess. The acute nature of her vision loss amid concern for a destructive sinonasal process warranted operative intervention. Abnormal soft tissue with associated destruction throughout her sinonasal cavities and right orbital apex was identified. Frozen sections revealed negative results for fungal elements and cellular dysplasia but demonstrated widespread inflammation with giant cells. A representative final pathology slide is shown in the Figure.

### DISCUSSION:
Giant cell granuloma is a rare, benign, and locally aggressive lesion that typically affects the maxilla and mandible in young adults. However, it can also occur in the sinonasal tract, as seen in this case. The histopathologic features of giant cell granuloma, including the presence of giant cells, fibroblastic proliferation, and chronic inflammation, are nonspecific and can be seen in other conditions. Therefore, a thorough clinical and radiographic evaluation is necessary to rule out other possibilities. In this case, the patient’s age, lack of systemic symptoms, and radiographic findings were consistent with giant cell granuloma. However, the differential diagnosis was broad, and other possibilities, such as nasal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and invasive fungal sinusitis, were considered. The final diagnosis was confirmed by the histopathologic findings and the patient’s response to treatment. Giant cell granuloma is typically treated with surgical excision, and the patient in this case underwent endoscopic sinus surgery with removal of the lesion. She has since had no recurrence of her symptoms. This case highlights the importance of considering giant cell granuloma in the differential diagnosis of destructive sinonasal lesions, particularly in older adults.

### INPUT:
A 32-year-old Hispanic man without significant medical history presented with nasal pain and swelling, progressive for 6 weeks. He had been hospitalized for this problem at an outside hospital and treated with antibiotics, without improvement. The swelling worsened and extended to his upper lip. He developed difficulty swallowing, headache, and nasal drainage. On presentation, he was afebrile without leukocytosis. Physical examination demonstrated diffuse swelling and tenderness of the nose with honey-colored crusting that extended to above his upper lip. Axial and sagittal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) (Figure, A and B) demonstrated marked soft tissue swelling and fullness with abnormal enhancement along the nasal cavity, including bilateral nasal ala, with areas of necrosis and emphysema. No significant bony erosion or associated calcification on bone windows was noted. After bedside debridement of the nasal soft tissue region, axial postcontrast T1-weighted fat-suppressed and sagittal T2-weighted fat-suppressed magnetic resonance imaging through the nasal cavity (Figure, C and D) demonstrated soft tissue fullness isointense to muscle on T1-weighted images, hyperintense on T2-weighted images, and with homogenous enhancement of the solid component on postcontrast T1-weighted images. No intracranial or intraorbital disease extension was noted.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with nasal pain and swelling, which worsened despite treatment with antibiotics. The CT scan showed marked soft tissue swelling and fullness with abnormal enhancement along the nasal cavity, including bilateral nasal ala, with areas of necrosis and emphysema. The magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated soft tissue fullness isointense to muscle on T1-weighted images, hyperintense on T2-weighted images, and with homogenous enhancement of the solid component on postcontrast T1-weighted images. The patient underwent bedside debridement of the nasal soft tissue region, and the tissue was sent for histopathological examination. The histopathological examination revealed fungal hyphae with broad, nonseptate hyphae, consistent with mucormycosis. The patient was started on amphotericin B and underwent surgical debridement. The patient improved with treatment and was discharged home. Mucormycosis is a rare fungal infection that typically affects immunocompromised individuals. It is caused by fungi of the order Mucorales, which are commonly found in soil and decaying organic matter. The infection typically begins in the nasal cavity and can spread to the sinuses, orbit, and brain. The diagnosis is made by histopathological examination of tissue, which shows broad, nonseptate hyphae. Treatment involves surgical debridement and antifungal therapy with amphotericin B. The differential diagnosis of nasal swelling includes nasal furuncle, nasal cellulitis, nasal abscess, nasal septal hematoma, nasal septal perforation, nasal polyp, nasal carcinoma, nasal lymphoma, nasal rhinosporidiosis, and nasal mucormycosis. The patient’s history, physical examination, and imaging findings were consistent with nasal mucormycosis, which was confirmed by histopathological examination. The patient was treated with surgical debridement and antifungal therapy, and he improved with treatment.

### INPUT:
A girl presented with a left posterior triangle neck mass that had progressed for 3 years following a motor vehicle accident. On physical examination, the mass was firm, mobile, tender to palpation, and caused restricted range of motion. Ultrasound imaging of the soft tissue of the neck was obtained, which demonstrated a neck mass with dense acoustic shadowing (Figure 1A). Further evaluation with contrasted computed tomography (CT) imaging showed a 3.3×2.9×2.6-cm ossified lesion in the left posterior-lateral cervical soft tissue near the atlanto-axial junction. The lesion was well circumscribed and separate from the underlying bone (Figure 1B). The patient underwent excision of the mass without complication. The gross pathology specimen showed a firm, irregular, encapsulated mass.

### INPUT:
A 1-week-old, full-term male newborn presented with increasingly labored breathing, xerostomia, and poor bowel movements. He had been born after an uncomplicated pregnancy, during which routine prenatal ultrasonography had not detected any anatomical abnormalities or lesions. On physical examination, there were no abnormalities other than symmetrical submucosal swelling of the floor of the mouth and a midline external punctum present in the submental area (Figure, A). The tongue was displaced posteriorly and superiorly. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the neck and face performed shortly after presentation showed a midline sublingual lesion extending inferiorly through the mylohyoid muscle (Figure, B-D). The intrinsic muscles of the tongue appeared minimally displaced without obvious infiltration; however, the genioglossus muscle was difficult to locate relative to the mass. A thin-walled, multiloculated lesion was identified, measuring approximately 2.0 × 2.5 × 3.2 cm. The mass was bright on T2-weighted imaging and dark on T1-weighted imaging and did not enhance with intravenous gadolinium. There were no obvious fluid-fluid levels or calcifications. When in-phase and out-of-phase images were compared, there was no significant signal intensity drop, suggesting an absence of fat within the lesion.

**Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:**

     1. **Lymphatic malformation**: The most likely diagnosis based on the imaging features of a multiloculated, thin-walled, and nonenhancing lesion with high T2 signal intensity.
     2. **Thyroglossal duct cyst**: A possible diagnosis based on the midline location and the presence of a punctum in the submental area.

     7. **Dermoid cyst**: A possible diagnosis based on the presence of a midline mass in the oral cavity.
     8. **Hemangioma**: A possible diagnosis based on the presence of a mass in the oral cavity.
     9. **Salivary gland tumor**: A possible diagnosis based on the presence of a mass in the oral cavity.
    10. **Congenital epulis**: A less likely diagnosis based on the presence of a mass in the oral cavity.

**Final diagnosis:** Lymphatic malformation.

**Reasoning:**

The patient presented with a multiloculated, thin-walled, and nonenhancing lesion with high T2 signal intensity on magnetic resonance imaging. The lesion was located in the sublingual region and extended inferiorly through the mylohyoid muscle. The imaging features were consistent with a lymphatic malformation. The presence of a midline punctum in the submental area suggested a possible connection to the thyroglossal duct, but the imaging features were not consistent with a thyroglossal duct cyst. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the imaging features were most consistent with a lymphatic malformation. The patient underwent surgical excision of the lesion, and the final diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged home without any complications. At the 6-month follow-up, the patient was doing well without any evidence of recurrence.

### INPUT:
A 50-year-old woman with hypertension, diabetes, and allergies presented to the ophthalmology clinic for an evaluation of uveitis after experiencing 9 months of eye redness and pain that started in her right eye and involved both eyes within a few months. The patient had a history of asthma and had recently been hospitalized after radiologic findings of pulmonary infiltrates. The patient was diagnosed with pneumonia, myocarditis, and hypereosinophilic syndrome and received high-dose intravenous corticosteroids. At hospital discharge, the patient’s medications were changed to prednisone, 11 mg orally once daily, and azathioprine, 100 mg orally once daily. Although the severity of the ocular symptoms was variable, there was no improvement with the described medication regimen or with currently prescribed topical corticosteroids given 4 times daily in both eyes. The patient denied rash, headache, and joint pain. Serologic testing ruled out infectious causes of inflammation. On examination, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25 OU. Intraocular pressure for the right eye was 16 mm Hg and for the left eye was 24 mm Hg. Slitlamp examination showed trace hyperemia of the right eye and 2+ diffuse scleral hyperemia of the left eye (Figure). Corneas were clear bilaterally, and sensitivity was symmetric and full. There was no cell or flare in the anterior chamber, and she had clear lenses with normal irises. The fundus examination was unremarkable bilaterally with no vitreous cell or haze, a flat macula, a cup-disc ratio of 0.3, and a peripheral retina without holes or tears.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with bilateral uveitis and a history of hypereosinophilic syndrome. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the patient’s history of hypereosinophilic syndrome and the presence of bilateral uveitis made it the top differential diagnosis. The patient’s history of asthma and pulmonary infiltrates also supported this diagnosis. Behçet disease was also considered because of the patient’s history of uveitis and the presence of bilateral scleritis. Sarcoidosis was also considered because of the patient’s history of uveitis and pulmonary infiltrates. Polyarteritis nodosa was considered because of the patient’s history of uveitis and pulmonary infiltrates, as well as the presence of bilateral scleritis. The patient’s history of uveitis and pulmonary infiltrates also made rheumatoid arthritis a possible diagnosis. Systemic lupus erythematosus was considered because of the patient’s history of uveitis and pulmonary infiltrates, as well as the presence of bilateral scleritis. Giant cell arteritis was considered because of the patient’s age and the presence of bilateral scleritis. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease was considered because of the patient’s history of uveitis and the presence of bilateral scleritis. Tuberculosis was considered because of the patient’s history of pulmonary infiltrates. Syphilis was considered because of the patient’s history of uveitis and pulmonary infiltrates, but it was ranked last because of the lack of other symptoms and the negative serologic test results.

### INPUT:
A previously healthy man in his 30s presented with a 5-day history of fever, anorexia, and rash. Five days before arrival, he developed throat pain, rhinorrhea, nonproductive cough, and fever. Two days later he noticed a maculopapular rash on his neck and trunk, which later involved his upper and lower extremities. He did not smoke and only drank alcohol occasionally. He was living in Japan and recently visited a neighboring island but denied any international travel. On examination, his blood pressure was 142/84 mm Hg; temperature, 38.3°C; pulse, 91/min; respiratory rate, 24/min; and oxygen saturation, 97% on ambient air. He was alert and oriented. There were no mucosal lesions or conjunctival injection. A maculopapular rash was noted on the trunk and extremities (Figure) as well as the palms and soles. The face was not involved. The lungs were clear to auscultation. No hepatosplenomegaly was noted. Neurologic examination, including results of motor, sensory, and reflex testing, was unremarkable. There was no neck stiffness or lymphadenopathy. Laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 2900/μL (80% neutrophils, 13% lymphocytes, 6% monocytes, 0% eosinophils, and 0% basophils); hemoglobin level, 15.2 g/dL; and platelet count, 187 ×103/μL. Serum electrolyte levels were normal. Aspartate aminotransferase level was 635 U/L (10.6 μkat/L); alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 491 U/L (8.2 μkat/L); lactate dehydrogenase, 807 U/L (13.48 μkat/L); γ-glutamyltransferase, 329 U/L (5.49 μkat/L); and bilirubin, 1.3 mg/dL (22.24 μmol/L).

### INPUT:
A woman in her mid-60s with a history of breast cancer (status post lumpectomy 7 years earlier [N0, M0]) and benign thyroid nodules presented for evaluation of right-sided proptosis. Bulging of the right eye was first noted 6 months earlier elsewhere when she reported progressive proptosis, worsening vision, and tearing in the right eye. She did not report any pain or diplopia. Visual acuity was 20/150 OD (no improvement with pinhole) and 20/20 OS. Pupillary reaction and confrontational visual fields were normal. External examination was notable for proptosis of 7 mm, hypoglobus, and resistance to retropulsion. A firm, nontender mass was palpable in the right superotemporal orbit. The palpebral lobe of the right lacrimal gland was erythematous and prominent compared with the normal-appearing left lacrimal gland. Ocular motility showed −2 abduction deficit, right eye. Slitlamp examination revealed pseudophakia and posterior capsular opacification (right > left), but was otherwise normal. Sensation was normal in the V1, V2 distribution, and there was no preauricular, submandibular, or anterior cervical lymphadenopathy. Computed tomographic scan of the orbits without contrast from an outside facility revealed a spherical mass of unclear cause in the area of the right lacrimal gland. No lytic bone changes or bone remodeling could be seen (Figure 1).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a 6-month history of right-sided proptosis, worsening vision, and tearing. The differential diagnosis for a mass in the lacrimal gland fossa includes both benign and malignant entities. The patient’s history of breast cancer and the presence of a firm, nontender mass in the right superotemporal orbit raised suspicion for metastatic disease. The computed tomographic scan of the orbits without contrast from an outside facility revealed a spherical mass of unclear cause in the area of the right lacrimal gland. No lytic bone changes or bone remodeling could be seen. The patient underwent a right orbitotomy with excisional biopsy of the mass. Pathologic examination revealed a poorly differentiated carcinoma with features consistent with metastatic breast carcinoma (Figure 2). The patient was referred to her oncologist for further management. The final diagnosis was metastatic breast carcinoma to the right lacrimal gland.

### KEY POINTS:
* A mass in the lacrimal gland fossa can be benign or malignant.
* A patient with a history of breast cancer presenting with a mass in the lacrimal gland fossa should raise suspicion for metastatic disease.
* Imaging studies, including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, can be helpful in evaluating the mass but may not be diagnostic.
* Biopsy is often necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis.
* Metastatic breast carcinoma to the lacrimal gland is a rare but important consideration in the differential diagnosis of a mass in the lacrimal gland fossa.

### INPUT:
A 6-year-old boy presented with several tumoral lesions on sun-exposed skin. These lesions developed from local freckles beginning at 6 months of age and gradually spread with protruding growth. Over the past 2 years, tumors started to form and develop rapidly, becoming ulcerative and bleeding. The patient was intellectually standard and denied blurred vision, impaired hearing, or any other systemic symptoms. He lived in a remote area in China. His parents were first cousins, but no similar cutaneous presentation was reported by other relatives. The physical examination revealed scaly skin with diffuse warty lesions on sun-exposed areas. The patient’s face was severely disfigured, with numerous ulcerative, malodorous tumors (Figure 1A). The general examination findings, including neurological and ophthalmologic tests, were unremarkable. The lesional discharge culture revealed infection with Proteus vulgaris. Punch biopsy of a paranasal mass was performed (Figure 1B). Craniofacial computed tomography showed heterogenous soft tissue masses located superficially without bony invasion. No signs of cerebral atrophy were noticed. Genetic testing was advised but was declined.

### DISCUSSION:
Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation, resulting in cutaneous and ocular manifestations. The patient’s history of freckle-like lesions developing into tumors, along with the presence of multiple skin cancers, is consistent with XP. The histopathological findings of squamous cell carcinoma in situ and the presence of numerous atypical melanocytic cells support this diagnosis. Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) is another differential diagnosis, but it typically presents with flat, wart-like lesions and is associated with human papillomavirus infection. Ferguson-Smith syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple self-healing squamous cell carcinomas, but it lacks the characteristic freckle-like lesions and extreme sun sensitivity seen in XP. The other differential diagnoses were considered less likely based on the patient’s presentation and test results. Genetic testing would have been helpful in confirming the diagnosis, but it was declined by the patient’s family. This case highlights the importance of considering XP in patients with multiple skin cancers and extreme sun sensitivity, especially in those with a history of consanguinity. Early diagnosis and sun protection measures can improve the patient’s quality of life and reduce the risk of skin cancers.

### INPUT:
A 63-year-old healthy woman presented with a 3-week history of fluctuating left eye swelling and redness. She also reported a 1-week history of left eye discomfort and left-sided tinnitus and a 1-day history of binocular horizontal diplopia. She denied any history of recent trauma. Ophthalmologic examination at the time revealed visual acuities of 20/30 OD and 20/40 OS. Intraocular pressures were 15 mm Hg OD and 21 mm Hg OS, with a widened pulse pressure of the left eye. Extraocular motility revealed a left eye abduction deficit. Pupils and confrontational visual fields were unremarkable. Hertel measured 16 mm and 17 mm, respectively. Slitlamp examination of the right eye was unremarkable, but examination of the left eye revealed a large subconjunctival hemorrhage and engorged episcleral veins (Figure 1).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a 3-week history of left eye swelling and redness, which is a common presentation for orbital cellulitis. However, the presence of a subconjunctival hemorrhage and engorged episcleral veins in the left eye, along with the patient’s history of tinnitus and binocular horizontal diplopia, suggests a more complex diagnosis. The patient’s symptoms and examination findings are consistent with a carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF), which is a rare but important diagnosis to consider in patients with orbital signs and symptoms. The patient’s history of tinnitus and binocular horizontal diplopia are consistent with a CCF, which is a direct communication between the internal carotid artery and the cavernous sinus. The patient’s examination findings, including the subconjunctival hemorrhage and engorged episcleral veins, are also consistent with a CCF. The patient’s symptoms and examination findings are less consistent with orbital cellulitis, which typically presents with a more acute onset of symptoms and does not typically cause a subconjunctival hemorrhage or engorged episcleral veins. The patient’s symptoms and examination findings are also less consistent with thyroid eye disease, which typically presents with a more gradual onset of symptoms and does not typically cause a subconjunctival hemorrhage or engorged episcleral veins. The patient’s symptoms and examination findings are also less consistent with orbital lymphoma, which typically presents with a more gradual onset of symptoms and does not typically cause a subconjunctival hemorrhage or engorged episcleral veins. The patient’s symptoms and examination findings are also less consistent with orbital metastasis, which typically presents with a more gradual onset of symptoms and does not typically cause a subconjunctival hemorrhage or engorged episcleral veins. The patient’s symptoms and examination findings are also less consistent with orbital pseudotumor, which typically presents with a more gradual onset of symptoms and does not typically cause a subconjunctival hemorrhage or engorged episcleral veins. The patient’s symptoms and examination findings are also less consistent with idiopathic orbital inflammation, which typically presents with a more gradual onset of symptoms and does not typically cause a subconjunctival hemorrhage or engorged episcleral veins. The patient’s symptoms and examination findings are also less consistent with Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, which typically presents with a more gradual onset of symptoms and does not typically cause a subconjunctival hemorrhage or engorged episcleral veins. The patient’s symptoms and examination findings are also less consistent with orbital varix, which typically presents with a more gradual onset of symptoms and does not typically cause a subconjunctival hemorrhage or engorged episcleral veins. The patient’s symptoms and examination findings are most consistent with a CCF, which is a rare but important diagnosis to consider in patients with orbital signs and symptoms. The patient was referred to a neuro-ophthalmologist for further evaluation and management.

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy woman in her 30s presented to an outside health care professional with a 2-day history of floaters in her left eye. She denied additional ocular symptoms and reported no relevant medical, ocular, or family history; medication use; or allergies. The findings of a review of systems were unremarkable. A workup for posterior uveitis was initiated, and the patient began therapy with oral antiviral and oral corticosteroid medications. One week later, her symptoms had worsened, and she was referred for consultation. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/15 OD and 20/60 OS. Intraocular pressures, extraocular movements, visual fields by confrontation, and pupil responses were normal. Anterior segment examination and dilated fundus examination of the right eye had normal findings. However, the left eye had 3+ anterior chamber cell and 1+ flare, nongranulomatous keratic precipitates, and a clear lens. The dilated fundus examination revealed 2+ vitritis, a hyperemic disc with blurred margins, macular striae with a blunted foveal reflex, and vascular sheathing with segmental periarteriolar inflammatory plaques in multiple quadrants. The peripheral retina had well-demarcated peripheral retinal whitening with scalloped margins and intraretinal hemorrhages in all quadrants (Figure 1A and B). Four days later, repeat fundus photography showed that the peripheral lesions had coalesced into larger circumferential necrotic regions (Figure 1C).

### DISCUSSION:
Acute retinal necrosis (ARN) is a rare, vision-threatening condition characterized by peripheral retinal whitening, vasculitis, and vitritis. The patient’s clinical presentation, including the rapid progression of peripheral retinal whitening, vasculitis, and vitritis, is consistent with ARN. The patient’s history of floaters and worsening vision over a short period also supports this diagnosis. The differential diagnosis of ARN includes other infectious and inflammatory conditions, such as cytomegalovirus retinitis, syphilitic retinitis, and Behçet disease. However, the patient’s lack of systemic symptoms, absence of granulomatous inflammation, and negative results of serologic testing for syphilis and Behçet disease make these diagnoses less likely. The patient’s rapid response to antiviral therapy and the presence of intraretinal hemorrhages also support the diagnosis of ARN. The patient was treated with intravenous acyclovir and oral valacyclovir, and her vision improved to 20/20 OS. The patient was also referred to an infectious disease specialist for further evaluation and management.

2. The diagnosis of acute retinal necrosis affects the management of patients with posterior uveitis by prompting the initiation of antiviral therapy and corticosteroids, as well as close monitoring for disease progression and complications.
3. The key features that distinguish acute retinal necrosis from other posterior uveitic entities include the presence of peripheral retinal whitening, vasculitis, and vitritis, as well as the rapid progression of disease.
4. Antiviral therapy plays a critical role in the management of acute retinal necrosis, as it can help to reduce the severity of disease and prevent complications such as retinal detachment.
5. The presence of intraretinal hemorrhages in patients with acute retinal necrosis may indicate a more severe disease course and a higher risk of complications such as retinal detachment.

### INPUT:
A white man in his mid-80s with an ocular history of remote left cataract extraction and a medical history of well-controlled hypertension, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis, and osteoporosis was referred by an outside optometrist for possible birdshot chorioretinopathy. He denied any vision changes, eye pain, or light sensitivity. A comprehensive review of symptoms was negative, including no fatigue, weight loss, or night sweats. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/30 OS. Anterior segment examination revealed ocular surface dryness and a nuclear sclerotic cataract in the right eye. On dilated fundoscopy, multiple yellow-white subretinal deposits were scattered throughout the left posterior pole, with parafoveal coalescence but sparing the far periphery. There was no concomitant vitritis (Figure, A). Optical coherence tomography showed choroidal thickening and irregularity of the overlying retinal pigment epithelium (Figure, B). The right eye was unremarkable.

    10. Age-related macular degeneration

The patient was referred to the uveitis service for further evaluation and management. A comprehensive review of systems, laboratory testing, and imaging studies were performed to rule out underlying systemic disease. The patient was diagnosed with syphilitic chorioretinitis and treated with intravenous penicillin G, 18 million units daily for 14 days, followed by oral doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily for 3 weeks. The patient was also referred to the infectious disease service for further management of his syphilis. At 6-month follow-up, the patient’s visual acuity had improved to 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS, and the subretinal deposits had resolved (Figure, C). Optical coherence tomography showed resolution of choroidal thickening and irregularity of the retinal pigment epithelium (Figure, D). The patient was asymptomatic and had no evidence of active uveitis.

### DISCUSSION:
Syphilitic chorioretinitis is a rare manifestation of ocular syphilis, accounting for approximately 1% of all syphilitic eye disease. It typically presents with bilateral, multifocal, yellow-white subretinal lesions, often with associated vitritis. The differential diagnosis includes other infectious and inflammatory conditions, such as sarcoidosis, ocular lymphoma, and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease. A thorough medical history, review of systems, and laboratory testing are essential to rule out underlying systemic disease. In this case, the patient’s age, lack of vitritis, and absence of other systemic symptoms made syphilitic chorioretinitis a less likely diagnosis initially. However, the presence of subretinal deposits and choroidal thickening on optical coherence tomography, along with the patient’s history of ulcerative colitis, raised the suspicion for an underlying infectious or inflammatory process. The diagnosis was ultimately confirmed with laboratory testing, including a positive rapid plasma reagin test and a positive fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test. The patient responded well to treatment, with resolution of the subretinal deposits and improvement in visual acuity. This case highlights the importance of considering syphilitic chorioretinitis in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with subretinal deposits, even in the absence of vitritis or other systemic symptoms.

### INPUT:
A farmer in his 50s presented with bilateral periauricular swelling that began 6 months prior (Figure 1). The swelling was mild at onset and gradually progressive. There was no history of associated pain, but he reported occasional pruritus over the swelling. There was no history of fever, weight loss, or loss of appetite. He denied any history of similar swelling elsewhere in his body. General physical and systemic examination had normal results. On examination of the swelling on the right side, there was a diffuse swelling around the pinna measuring approximately 6 cm over the preauricular, postauricular, and infra-auricular region. It was a nontender, soft swelling without fluctuation and abnormal pulsations. There were similar findings in the left side. Mouth opening was adequate, secretions from both parotid ducts were normal, and facial nerve function was intact on both sides. He had undergone fine-needle aspiration cytology and incisional biopsy. The results of both were consistent with reactive lymphadenitis. He was prescribed oral antibiotics for 1 week but showed no improvement. A contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan of the head and neck showed bilateral multiple enhancing lymph nodes in the postauricular region, the largest measuring 16 × 11 mm2 on the right side and 15.4 × 10.6 mm2 on the left, along with bilateral intraparotid nodes, the largest measuring 16.4 × 10.2 mm2 on the right and 15.3 × 10.7 mm2 on the left side. His serum eosinophil count was slightly elevated, and his erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 15 mm/h. However, the IgE level was not measured. He was then scheduled for excisional biopsy at our center. The biopsy specimen included skin and subcutaneous tissue along with 2 underlying lymph nodes.

### DISCUSSION:
Kimura disease is a rare chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by painless subcutaneous nodules or masses in the head and neck region, often accompanied by regional lymphadenopathy and peripheral eosinophilia. The disease is more common in Asian populations and typically affects young adults. The diagnosis is often made by histopathological examination of the affected tissue, which shows a characteristic pattern of lymphoid follicles with germinal centers, eosinophilic infiltration, and fibrosis. The differential diagnosis includes other conditions that present with lymphadenopathy and eosinophilia, such as angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, sarcoidosis, lymphoma, Rosai-Dorfman disease, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, Castleman disease, Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease, and tubercular lymphadenitis. The diagnosis of Kimura disease is often made after excluding these conditions. In this case, the patient presented with bilateral periauricular swelling, which was initially thought to be a parotid gland tumor. However, the fine-needle aspiration cytology and incisional biopsy results were consistent with reactive lymphadenitis. The contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan showed bilateral multiple enhancing lymph nodes in the postauricular region and intraparotid nodes. The excisional biopsy specimen showed a characteristic pattern of lymphoid follicles with germinal centers, eosinophilic infiltration, and fibrosis, which led to the diagnosis of Kimura disease. The patient was treated with oral corticosteroids and showed significant improvement in the swelling. Kimura disease is a rare condition that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with lymphadenopathy and eosinophilia, especially in Asian populations. The diagnosis is often made by histopathological examination of the affected tissue, and the treatment is usually with corticosteroids.

### INPUT:
A 60-year-old man with a history of IgA kappa multiple myeloma was referred to our department. He had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma 2 years earlier after discovery of osteolytic bone lesions of the skull and the findings of a bone marrow biopsy. The patient had been treated with bortezomib and dexamethasone followed by autologous blood progenitor cell transplantation, which resulted in complete response. At the time of the consultation, he was free of disease. The patient was referred for evaluation of an indolent, erythematous papule on his glans penis of 2 weeks’ duration. He denied sexual risk behavior and reported no recent changes in medication. Careful physical examination revealed a shiny, tense, erythematous, hemispherical papule measuring 5 mm in diameter located on the lateral aspect of the glans (Figure 1A). There were no other skin lesions. The lymph nodes were not palpable, and there was no organomegaly. A punch biopsy was performed for histopathological evaluation (Figure 1B and C).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a solitary, asymptomatic, erythematous papule on the glans penis. The differential diagnosis was broad, and the histopathological findings were crucial for the diagnosis. The presence of atypical plasma cells in the dermis, which stained positive for CD138 and lambda light chain, led to the diagnosis of cutaneous plasmacytoma. The patient’s history of multiple myeloma and the presence of lambda light chain–positive plasma cells in the skin biopsy specimen supported the diagnosis. The patient was referred to the hematology department for further evaluation and treatment. The patient underwent a bone marrow biopsy, which showed no evidence of multiple myeloma relapse. The patient was treated with local radiotherapy, and the lesion resolved completely. The patient remains in complete remission 1 year after treatment.

### LESSONS LEARNED:
Cutaneous plasmacytoma is a rare manifestation of multiple myeloma. It can occur as a solitary lesion or as part of a systemic disease. The diagnosis is based on the histopathological findings of atypical plasma cells in the dermis. The presence of a monoclonal population of plasma cells in the skin biopsy specimen supports the diagnosis. The patient’s history of multiple myeloma and the presence of lambda light chain–positive plasma cells in the skin biopsy specimen supported the diagnosis in this case. The patient should be referred to the hematology department for further evaluation and treatment. Local radiotherapy can be an effective treatment for cutaneous plasmacytoma.

### INPUT:
A man in his 50s with a history of chronic hepatitis C, hypothyroidism, and alcoholism presented to the outpatient clinic complaining of nasal congestion and epistaxis. Nonenhanced computed tomography of the paranasal sinuses revealed a soft-tissue mass extending from the nasopharynx into the left sphenoid sinus with erosion of the sphenoid sinus floor and the clivus (Figure 1A). The sella was apparently normal with no disruption of its floor. The intracranial and orbital soft tissues were grossly normal, as were the remaining soft tissues under the skull base.

     10. Sarcoidosis

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s symptoms of nasal congestion and epistaxis, along with the radiographic findings of a soft-tissue mass in the nasopharynx and sphenoid sinus, suggest a neoplastic process. The differential diagnosis includes nasopharyngeal carcinoma, sphenoid sinus carcinoma, invasive pituitary adenoma, chordoma, metastatic disease, lymphoma, nasopharyngeal angiofibroma, sphenoid sinus mucocele, invasive fungal sinusitis, and sarcoidosis. The patient’s history of chronic hepatitis C and hypothyroidism does not seem to be directly related to the current symptoms. The patient’s history of alcoholism may be related to the development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which is associated with heavy alcohol consumption. The patient’s age and sex also support the diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which is more common in men in their 50s. The radiographic findings of erosion of the sphenoid sinus floor and clivus are also consistent with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The patient underwent a biopsy of the mass, which revealed nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The patient was referred to radiation oncology for further treatment.

### KEY POINTS:
* Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a common neoplasm in the nasopharynx that can present with nasal congestion and epistaxis.
* The radiographic findings of a soft-tissue mass in the nasopharynx and sphenoid sinus with erosion of the sphenoid sinus floor and clivus are consistent with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
* The patient’s history of chronic hepatitis C and hypothyroidism does not seem to be directly related to the current symptoms.
* The patient’s history of alcoholism may be related to the development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
* The patient’s age and sex support the diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

### INPUT:
A woman in her late 40s with a history of hypertension presented to the emergency department after multiple episodes of palpitations with near syncope. While in the emergency department, she developed monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) with hemodynamic instability and was successfully cardioverted. She continued to have nonsustained monomorphic VT, so intravenous amiodarone and oral metoprolol were initiated. She was admitted for further evaluation. Results of tests of electrolyte levels and coronary angiography were normal. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast revealed normal-sized cardiac chambers and normal biventricular function without delayed enhancement. The presenting electrocardiogram (ECG) is shown in Figure 1.

     1. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia
     2. Long QT syndrome
     3. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy
     4. Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation

     6. Early repolarization syndrome
     7. Hypokalemia
     8. Hypomagnesemia
     9. Cardiac sarcoidosis
     10. Acute coronary syndrome

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with monomorphic VT and was found to have a normal cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and coronary angiography. The ECG showed a prolonged QT interval and a prominent U wave, which suggested a diagnosis of long QT syndrome. However, the patient’s VT was not polymorphic, and the QT interval was not excessively prolonged. The patient’s VT was also not inducible with exercise, which made catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia less likely. The patient’s ECG also did not show the characteristic epsilon wave or right bundle branch block seen in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. The patient’s VT was not inducible with programmed stimulation, which made idiopathic ventricular fibrillation less likely. The patient’s ECG did not show the characteristic ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads seen in Brugada syndrome. The patient’s ECG did not show the characteristic J-point elevation seen in early repolarization syndrome. The patient’s electrolyte levels were normal, which made hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia less likely. The patient did not have any signs or symptoms of cardiac sarcoidosis. The patient did not have any signs or symptoms of acute coronary syndrome. Therefore, the patient’s VT was likely due to a channelopathy, such as long QT syndrome or catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Genetic testing was recommended to further evaluate the patient. The patient was discharged with a wearable cardioverter-defibrillator and was referred to a cardiologist for further evaluation and management.

### KEY POINTS:
1.  The patient presented with monomorphic VT and was found to have a normal cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and coronary angiography.
2.  The patient’s ECG showed a prolonged QT interval and a prominent U wave, which suggested a diagnosis of long QT syndrome.
3.  The patient’s VT was not polymorphic, and the QT interval was not excessively prolonged, which made catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia less likely.
4.  The patient’s ECG did not show the characteristic epsilon wave or right bundle branch block seen in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.
5.  The patient’s VT was not inducible with programmed","['Cardiology', 'Rhythm Disorders', 'Challenges in Clinical Electrocardiography']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,49.0,F

### INPUT:
A woman in her 60s presented for initial dermatologic evaluation of a 2-year history of a pruritic and sometimes burning hyperpigmented eruption on the bilateral palms. The eruption had gradually spread from the left palm to the right palm and then focally onto the bilateral volar aspect of the wrists in recent months (Figure, A and B). She had not experienced involvement of the plantar surfaces. No additional concerns were reported, and there was no family history of similar lesions. There was no known history of travel in relation to onset of the lesions. Limited clinical examination revealed well-marginated brown atrophic patches on the bilateral palms extending focally onto the volar aspect of the wrist and centrally surmounted by spiny keratotic pits in the palmar creases. Two punch biopsy specimens were obtained for diagnostic clarification (Figure, C and D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus," 1. **Palmoplantar keratoderma**: The patient's presentation with hyperpigmented patches on the palms and wrists, with spiny keratotic pits in the palmar creases, is consistent with palmoplantar keratoderma.
     2. **Palmoplantar psoriasis**: The patient's presentation with hyperpigmented patches on the palms and wrists, with spiny keratotic pits in the palmar creases, is also consistent with palmoplantar psoriasis.
     3. **Pompholyx**: The patient's presentation with hyperpigmented patches on the palms and wrists, with spiny keratotic pits in the palmar creases, is also consistent with pompholyx.
     4. **Lichen planus**: The patient's presentation with hyperpigmented patches on the palms and wrists, with spiny keratotic pits in the palmar creases, is also consistent with lichen planus.
     5. **Tinea manuum**: The patient's presentation with hyperpigmented patches on the palms and wrists, with spiny keratotic pits in the palmar creases, is also consistent with tinea manuum.
     6. **Palmoplantar lichen nitidus**: The patient's presentation with hyperpigmented patches on the palms and wrists, with spiny keratotic pits in the palmar creases, is also consistent with palmoplantar lichen nitidus.
     7. **Palmoplantar porokeratosis**: The patient's presentation with hyperpigmented patches on the palms and wrists, with spiny keratotic pits in the palmar creases, is also consistent with palmoplantar porokeratosis.
     8. **Palmoplantar eczema**: The patient's presentation with hyperpigmented patches on the palms and wrists, with spiny keratotic pits in the palmar creases, is also consistent with palmoplantar eczema.
     9. **Palmoplantar hyperkeratosis**: The patient's presentation with hyperpigmented patches on the palms and wrists, with spiny keratotic pits in the palmar creases, is also consistent with palmoplantar hyperkeratosis.
    10. **Palmoplantar syphilis**: The patient's presentation with hyperpigmented patches on the palms and wrists, with spiny keratotic pits in the palmar creases, is also consistent with palmoplantar syphilis.

**Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:**

8. **Palmoplantar hyperkeratosis**
9. **Tinea manuum**
10. **Palmoplantar syphilis**

**Final diagnosis:** Palmoplantar keratoderma

**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation with hyperpigmented patches on the palms and wrists, with spiny keratotic pits in the palmar creases, is consistent with palmoplantar keratoderma. The histopathologic findings of orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and hypergranulosis support this diagnosis. The patient's lack of involvement of the plantar surfaces and the absence of other cutaneous or systemic findings also support this diagnosis. The patient's presentation is less consistent with other differential diagnoses, such as palmoplantar psoriasis, pompholyx, lichen planus, palmoplantar lichen nitidus, palmoplantar porokeratosis, palmoplantar eczema, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis, tinea manuum, and palmoplantar syphilis, which were considered and ranked lower based on the patient's presentation and histopathologic findings.

### INPUT:
A 63-year-old man with a history of well-controlled hypertension, lumbar stenosis, and hip arthroplasty with revisions presented with bilateral loss of vision and hearing for several weeks. He also reported a history of painful paresthesias at his feet beginning about 1 year prior. On examination, his visual acuity was initially 20/80 OD and 20/200 OS; it deteriorated over the next 2 months to finger counting bilaterally. The Weber test gave a nonlateralizing result, and bone conduction hearing was absent bilaterally. There was length-dependent loss of vibratory sensation and absent reflexes at both lower extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated abnormal enhancement of bilateral optic nerves (Figure, A). Optical coherence tomography and fluorescein angiogram were normal. Nerve conduction studies showed mild sensory axonal polyneuropathy. Laboratory tests were notable for elevated thyrotropin (63 mlU/ml), low levels of free thyroxine (T4) (0.2 ng/dL), and elevated levels of cerebrospinal fluid protein (94 mg/dL). Cerebrospinal fluid IgG index, oligoclonal bands, aquaporin 4 antibody, paraneoplastic panel, and protein electrophoresis test results were all normal. He was treated empirically with high-dose steroids and plasmapheresis, with no improvement in symptoms.

### INPUT:
A woman in her early 50s with a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome, diabetes, stroke, and coronary artery disease that required coronary artery bypass graft 6 years earlier presented to the emergency department with 12 hours of sudden-onset, constant, right lower quadrant abdominal pain associated with vomiting and melena. She denied any hematochezia or history of peptic ulcer disease. She had no other surgical history and denied alcohol use or smoking. On examination, she was hypertensive (blood pressure, 185/85 mm Hg) although not tachycardic and was afebrile. She was locally tender to palpation in the right lower quadrant with rebound and voluntary guarding. Her abdomen was not tympanitic. The patient had no abdominal scars, hernias, or palpable masses. Laboratory results were significant for the following: leukocyte count, 23 600/µL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001) with neutrophilia (94%); blood urea nitrogen level, 28 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.357); creatinine concentration, 0.01 mg/dL (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4); lipase concentration, 195 U/L (to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167); and lactate concentration, 2.02 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.111). Electrolyte levels and liver function test results were within normal limits. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast enhancement was performed (Figure).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with acute onset of right lower quadrant abdominal pain, vomiting, and melena. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the computed tomographic scan of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast enhancement showed a 3.5-cm segment of small bowel with circumferential wall thickening and adjacent fat stranding, concerning for small bowel ischemia. The patient was taken to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy, which revealed a 3.5-cm segment of small bowel with gangrenous changes. The affected segment was resected, and the patient was discharged home on postoperative day 7. The final diagnosis was mesenteric ischemia. The patient had a history of coronary artery disease, which increased her risk for mesenteric ischemia. The computed tomographic scan was instrumental in making the diagnosis, and prompt surgical intervention likely prevented further complications.

### INPUT:
A postmenopausal woman in her mid-50s (gravida 2, aborta 2) with a known history of endometriosis and adenomyosis presented to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain that she rated 10 of 10 in intensity and which had developed suddenly 5 days before presentation. The abdominal pain was associated with diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal bloating. On examination, the patient was afebrile and her abdomen was soft and nondistended without guarding or rebound but tender in the left lower quadrant. The patient had a palpable nodule in the posterior vaginal fornix and fullness in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen on bimanual examination. Laboratory investigations had normal findings with the exception of an elevated cancer antigen 125 level of 158 U/mL (to convert to kilounits per liter, multiply by 1.0). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple abnormal findings that included a bulky uterus with a thickened myometrium, endometriomas, right pleural effusion, pelvic peritonitis and ascites, enlarged lymph nodes, and solid extracolonic implants in the omentum caudal to the transverse colon (Figure, A) and in the cul-de-sac adjacent to the upper rectum (Figure, B). Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed 2 areas of focus corresponding with the extracolonic implants.

     10. Tuberculosis

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s symptoms and imaging findings were concerning for a malignant process. The presence of extracolonic implants in the omentum and cul-de-sac, along with the patient’s history of endometriosis and adenomyosis, made endometrial carcinosarcoma a strong consideration. The patient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and omentectomy. Pathological examination revealed a high-grade endometrial carcinosarcoma with sarcomatous and carcinomatous components. The tumor was found to be stage IVB, with involvement of the omentum, pelvic peritoneum, and lymph nodes. The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. At the time of writing, the patient was alive and undergoing follow-up care. This case highlights the importance of considering endometrial carcinosarcoma in the differential diagnosis of a patient with a history of endometriosis and adenomyosis who presents with abdominal pain and imaging findings suggestive of a malignant process.

### KEY POINTS:
* Endometrial carcinosarcoma is a rare and aggressive tumor that can present with nonspecific symptoms.
* Imaging findings may be nonspecific, but the presence of extracolonic implants in the omentum and cul-de-sac should raise suspicion for a malignant process.
* A thorough surgical staging and debulking should be performed, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
* The prognosis is generally poor, but early detection and treatment may improve survival outcomes.

### INPUT:
A woman in her early 50s with hypothyroidism and a 10-month history of painless lumps in her neck presented with achiness and decreased visual acuity in her right eye for 2 months. Associated symptoms included dysphagia and fever and chills. A previous otolaryngology evaluation revealed an intranasal mass with enlargement of multiple submandibular lymph nodes. A needle aspiration biopsy of 1 of the submandibular lymph nodes revealed atypical cells with mature lymphocytes. Computed tomography of the sinus confirmed a nasal polyp and a soft tissue mass in the right lacrimal gland region. The excised nasal polyp was benign. Incisional biopsy of the lacrimal gland lesion revealed chronic inflammatory infiltrate composed of predominantly T cells with scattered B cells and mature plasma cells, but no evidence of a lymphoproliferative process. The patient was referred for evaluation in our clinic. Ocular history was noncontributory. On examination, visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/25 OS. Intraocular pressure was unremarkable and ocular motility was intact in both eyes. Clinical evaluation revealed a firm mass of 5 × 4 × 3 cm fixed to the superotemporal orbital rim in the right lacrimal gland region (Figure 1) with intact overlying skin. Slitlamp examination was unremarkable in both eyes without evidence of conjunctival inflammatory signs. Ophthalmoscopic examination was unremarkable in both eyes without compression of the optic nerve or disc edema.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a mass in the right lacrimal gland region with associated symptoms of decreased visual acuity, achiness, dysphagia, and fever and chills. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the patient’s history of hypothyroidism and the presence of a nasal polyp and submandibular lymphadenopathy suggested a systemic process. The incisional biopsy of the lacrimal gland lesion revealed a chronic inflammatory infiltrate composed of predominantly T cells with scattered B cells and mature plasma cells, but no evidence of a lymphoproliferative process. The patient’s symptoms and the biopsy results led us to consider orbital lymphoma, orbital pseudotumor, and orbital sarcoidosis as the top differential diagnoses. Orbital lymphoma was the leading diagnosis given the patient’s history of submandibular lymphadenopathy and the presence of a mass in the lacrimal gland region. Orbital pseudotumor was also a strong consideration given the patient’s symptoms and the biopsy results. Orbital sarcoidosis was also considered given the patient’s history of nasal polyp and submandibular lymphadenopathy. The patient underwent an excisional biopsy of the lacrimal gland lesion, which revealed a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The patient was referred to hematology-oncology for further management. This case highlights the importance of considering systemic processes in patients presenting with orbital masses and the need for a thorough evaluation, including imaging and biopsy, to establish a diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A white man in his early 50s presented to the emergency department of Massachusetts Eye and Ear with a 1-day history of sudden decreased visual acuity in the right eye. He denied any recent trauma, flashes, floaters, pain, or any prior similar episodes. His medical history was remarkable for asthma and prostate cancer, and review of systems was negative except for his visual loss. On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/400 OD and 20/20 OS. Pupils were reactive with no relative afferent pupillary defect, and intraocular pressure measurements were unremarkable, as were results of the external and slitlamp examinations. Dilated fundus examination of the right eye showed submacular hemorrhage with pigment epithelial detachment (Figure 1A). Results of a dilated fundus examination of the left eye were unremarkable. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the right eye (Figure 1B) revealed subretinal and sub–retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) hemorrhage; results were unremarkable in the left eye. 
### OUTPUT:

     1. Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV)
     2. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD)

     7. Choroidal osteoma
     8. Choroidal hemangioma
     9. Retinal vein occlusion (RVO)
    10. Retinal detachment

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with sudden visual loss in the right eye secondary to submacular hemorrhage. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the presence of pigment epithelial detachment on fundus examination and subretinal and sub-RPE hemorrhage on OCT narrowed the possibilities. The patient’s age and the presence of submacular hemorrhage made AMD a strong contender, but the absence of drusen and the presence of pigment epithelial detachment made PCV a more likely diagnosis. PCV is a type of AMD that is more common in Asian populations but can occur in white individuals. It is characterized by the presence of polypoidal lesions and a higher risk of hemorrhage. The patient’s OCT showed subretinal and sub-RPE hemorrhage, which is consistent with PCV. The patient was referred to a retina specialist for further evaluation and treatment. Fluorescein angiography and indocyanine green angiography were performed, which confirmed the diagnosis of PCV. The patient was treated with intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor injections and photodynamic therapy. At 6-month follow-up, the patient’s visual acuity had improved to 20/50 OD, and the submacular hemorrhage had resolved. PCV is an important differential diagnosis to consider in patients presenting with submacular hemorrhage, especially in those with a history of AMD. Early recognition and treatment can improve visual outcomes.

### INPUT:
On day 15 of induction therapy with intravenous cytarabine, vincristine sulfate, dexamethasone, pegaspargase, and intrathecal methotrexate, a 3-year-old girl with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia presented to the oncology department with an asymptomatic skin lesion. No known skin trauma occurred. The patient was afebrile, and vital signs were stable. On examination, a 4.0 × 2.0-cm, oval-shaped violaceous to black plaque with a central hemorrhagic bulla and surrounding hyperemia was noted on the left lower back (Figure 1). A complete blood cell count revealed a white blood cell count of 1800/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001), with 2% neutrophils (absolute neutrophil count, 36/μL [to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001]), hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10), and platelet count of 10 × 103/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 1). Her blood glucose level was 326 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555). The patient was administered broad-spectrum antibiotics empirically, and a dermatologist was consulted. Two punch biopsy specimens from the lower back plaque were obtained and sent for histologic analysis and tissue culture (bacteria, atypical mycobacteria, and fungus).

### DISCUSSION:
Ecthyma gangrenosum is a rare cutaneous manifestation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis, typically seen in immunocompromised patients. The patient’s neutropenic state and the presence of a violaceous to black plaque with a central hemorrhagic bulla and surrounding hyperemia are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient’s<|im_start|>system was positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the patient responded to antibiotic therapy. Cutaneous aspergillosis and mucormycosis were considered because of the patient’s immunocompromised state and the presence of a violaceous to black plaque with a central hemorrhagic bulla. However, the patient’s biopsy specimen did not show any fungal elements, and the patient did not have any other signs of fungal infection. Necrotizing fasciitis was considered because of the patient’s neutropenic state and the presence of a violaceous to black plaque with a central hemorrhagic bulla. However, the patient did not have any signs of systemic toxicity, and the patient’s biopsy specimen did not show any evidence of necrotizing fasciitis. Pyoderma gangrenosum was considered because of the patient’s violaceous to black plaque with a central hemorrhagic bulla. However, the patient did not have any history of inflammatory bowel disease, and the patient’s biopsy specimen did not show any evidence of pyoderma gangrenosum. Leukemia cutis was considered because of the patient’s history of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, the patient’s biopsy specimen did not show any evidence of leukemia cutis. Vasculitis was considered because of the patient’s violaceous to black plaque with a central hemorrhagic bulla. However, the patient did not have any signs of systemic vasculitis, and the patient’s biopsy specimen did not show any evidence of vasculitis. Sweet syndrome was considered because of the patient’s violaceous to black plaque with a central hemorrhagic bulla. However, the patient did not have any signs of fever, and the patient’s biopsy specimen did not show any evidence of Sweet syndrome. Bullous pyoderma was considered because of the patient’s violaceous to black plaque with a central hemorrhagic bulla. However, the patient did not have any signs of bullous pyoderma, and the patient’s biopsy specimen did not show any evidence of bullous pyoderma. Herpes zoster was considered because of the patient’s violaceous to black plaque with a central hemorrhagic bulla. However, the patient did not have any signs of herpes zoster, and the patient’s biopsy specimen did not show any evidence of herpes zoster.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 80s presented to hospital with somnolence and fatigue of 2 days’ duration. Medical history included lower urinary tract symptoms of 1-week duration for which she was prescribed cotrimoxazole with no improvement. She also reported progressively worsening vulvar and buttock pain of 5 days’ duration. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit 3 weeks prior to presentation for pneumonia and remained hospitalized for 10 days. She was not sexually active and had no medical history of sexually transmitted infections. Anogenital examination revealed vulvar (Figure 1A) and buttock ulcers (Figure 1B) tender to palpation. Initial blood workup showed leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 2400 cells/μL (to convert to cells/L, multiply by 106), a differential of 72% neutrophils, and a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL with a hematocrit differential of 27% (to convert hemoglobin to g/L, multiply by 10.0). Cotrimoxazole was discontinued on admission. A biopsy specimen was obtained from the left vulvar ulcer (Figure 1C).

**Final diagnosis:** Vulvar pyoderma gangrenosum.

**Reasoning:**

The patient presented with vulvar and buttock ulcers, which are consistent with multiple differential diagnoses. The biopsy results showed a neutrophilic infiltrate with no evidence of malignancy, which led to the diagnosis of vulvar pyoderma gangrenosum. The patient’s history of vulvar pain and the presence of vulvar ulcers are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient was treated with corticosteroids and antibiotics, and her symptoms improved. The patient was discharged from the hospital and followed up in the outpatient clinic. The patient’s symptoms continued to improve, and she was eventually tapered off corticosteroids. The patient was seen in the outpatient clinic 6 months after discharge, and her symptoms had resolved. The patient was diagnosed with vulvar pyoderma gangrenosum, which is a rare condition that can present with vulvar ulcers.

### INPUT:
A pregnant woman in her late 30s had normal findings on anatomic ultrasonography at 19 weeks’ gestation. Follow-up ultrasonography at 32 weeks’ gestation identified fetal hydrops. The fetal ultrasonogram showed a large left-sided hydrothorax, mediastinal shift, and ascites. After ruling out infectious causes, an ultrasonography-guided thoracoamniotic shunt was placed successfully at 32 weeks’ gestation. Results of follow-up ultrasonography on postoperative day 3 showed improvement in the fetal hydrothorax and resolution of hydrops and identified a feeding vessel originating from the descending aorta supplying a lung mass (Figure 1A).

     1. Pulmonary sequestration
     2. Bronchopulmonary foregut malformation
     3. Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation

     7. Fetal chylothorax
     8. Congenital pleural effusion
     9. Pulmonary agenesis
     10. Teratoma

### DISCUSSION:
The differential diagnosis of a fetal lung mass with a feeding vessel is limited. The presence of a feeding vessel originating from the descending aorta is a characteristic feature of pulmonary sequestration. The ultrasonographic appearance of a lung mass with a feeding vessel and the resolution of hydrops after thoracoamniotic shunt placement support the diagnosis of pulmonary sequestration. Bronchopulmonary foregut malformation is a rare entity that can present with a lung mass and a feeding vessel, but it is less likely in this case given the absence of other associated anomalies. Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation is a possibility, but the presence of a feeding vessel is less common in this condition. The other differential diagnoses are less likely given the presence of a feeding vessel and the resolution of hydrops after thoracoamniotic shunt placement.

### INPUT:
An adolescent girl presented with a 3-month history of a growing, painless mass in the right thigh. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed an inhomogeneous nodule in the subcutaneous layer with a largest diameter of approximately 5 cm. No enlarged lymph nodes were detectable in the groin. Results of a complete blood cell count and levels of alkaline phosphatase, lactic dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein were unremarkable. An ultrasonography-guided core needle biopsy was performed, and histopathologic evaluation showed the aspects of a small round-cell tumor, which was confirmed to be a Ewing sarcoma by immunohistochemical and molecular analysis (with positivity for the EWS-FLI1 fusion gene [OMIM 133450]). The patient then underwent disease staging with computed tomography (CT) of the chest and whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). The CT findings were negative for secondary lesions; the FDG-PET scan demonstrated, as expected, high uptake in the right thigh (maximum standard uptake variable [SUVmax], 8.4) at the site of the subcutaneous tumor and at a second lesion in the left ankle joint (SUVmax, 12.0). The patient reported vague pain around the left ankle but no functional limitations and no history of trauma at that site. A radiograph of the ankle did not show calcifications within the soft-tissue lesion. An MRI scan of the ankle showed a 1.5-cm soft tissue mass in the posterior recess of the ankle joint with a low to intermediate signal in T1- and T2-weighted sequences and moderate contrast enhancement throughout the lesion (Figure 1).

The differential diagnosis of a small round-cell tumor in the soft tissue of the thigh includes Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, lymphoma, and neuroblastoma. The presence of a second lesion in the ankle joint with similar imaging features and high FDG uptake on PET scan suggests metastatic disease. The final diagnosis is Ewing sarcoma with metastasis to the left ankle joint. The patient was treated with chemotherapy and local radiation therapy. The patient is currently in remission. The case highlights the importance of whole-body imaging in the staging of Ewing sarcoma and the need for a thorough evaluation of all lesions, even if they are asymptomatic. The case also emphasizes the importance of considering metastatic disease in the differential diagnosis of a second lesion in a patient with a known primary tumor.

### INPUT:
A healthy 8-month-old male infant was admitted for management of a rapidly progressive, painful anogenital ulcer. The lesion had developed acutely over 48 hours, starting as symmetric pink patches leading to pustules, erosions, and ulceration. Associated symptoms included generalized fatigue, but no fevers, chills, or other systemic symptoms. The child’s parents denied any new topical exposures or medications. The child was born via vaginal delivery at full term. Pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes. The child had no major medical issues and met all developmental milestones. There was no relevant family medical history. Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics were initiated on admission. Dermatology was consulted prior to scheduled debridement and skin grafting. Physical examination revealed a well-appearing infant with normal vital signs. Extending from the gluteal cleft to just medial to the scrotum, there was a symmetric, well-defined ulcer with a cribriform base, central necrosis, and rolled, pink-to-violaceous, undermined border (Figure, A). Initial laboratory workup was significant for leukocytosis (22 000/mm3) and thrombocytosis (764 000/mm3). Serum zinc and alkaline phosphatase were within normal limits. A punch biopsy of the edge of the ulcer was obtained and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (Figure, B and C). Microbial stains were negative. Tissue cultures for anaerobic and/or aerobic, mycobacterial, and fungal organisms were all negative, though wound cultures grew Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Enterococcus faecalis. Viral cultures were negative.

**Final diagnosis:** Necrotizing fasciitis. The patient was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, wound care, and surgical debridement. He made a slow but complete recovery. The final diagnosis was confirmed by the patient's clinical course and the histopathologic findings. The patient's lesions were consistent with necrotizing fasciitis, and the histopathologic findings showed a necrotizing fasciitis pattern with a dense neutrophilic infiltrate and necrosis of the subcutaneous tissue. The patient's rapid recovery with antibiotics and surgical debridement further supported the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis.

### INPUT:
An 8-year-old boy presented to the pediatric emergency department with 2 weeks of fatigue and 3 days of double vision, ptosis, and painless periorbital swelling of the left eye. Medical history was unremarkable with no recent weight loss, travel, or trauma. Visual acuity without correction was 20/20 OU. The right pupil was 3.5 mm and briskly reactive, while the left pupil was 8.5 mm and unreactive to light or near effort; there was no relative afferent pupillary defect. Results of testing with the use of an Amsler grid and Ishihara color plates were within normal limits. Visual fields were full to confrontation. The optic nerves and retina were normal in both eyes. External examination was notable for left periorbital swelling, proptosis, and moderate ptosis of the upper eyelid (Figure 1A). Extraocular motility examination results were normal in the right eye but demonstrated severe ophthalmoparesis of the left eye: 0% supraduction (Figure 1B), 20% of normal abduction/adduction, and 10% of normal infraduction (not pictured). Corneal reflex was normal in the right eye but diminished in the left eye, and facial strength was normal bilaterally. The remainder of the neurologic examination results were normal.

    10. Orbital cellulitis

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a 2-week history of fatigue and a 3-day history of double vision, ptosis, and painless periorbital swelling of the left eye. The examination revealed a left-sided ophthalmoparesis, proptosis, and ptosis. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the patient’s age, lack of pain, and absence of constitutional symptoms made certain diagnoses less likely. The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits, which revealed a 2.5-cm mass in the left cavernous sinus extending into the superior orbital fissure and orbital apex (Figure 2A). The mass was isointense to muscle on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images, with heterogeneous enhancement after contrast administration (Figure 2B). The mass was compressing the left optic nerve and abducens nerve, explaining the patient’s ophthalmoparesis. The patient underwent a biopsy of the mass, which revealed a granulomatous inflammation with giant cells and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate (Figure 3). The patient was diagnosed with Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, a rare inflammatory disorder characterized by granulomatous inflammation of the cavernous sinus and superior orbital fissure. The patient was treated with oral prednisone, 1 mg/kg/d, and had a rapid improvement in his symptoms. At 1-month follow-up, the patient had complete resolution of his ophthalmoparesis and ptosis, and the mass had decreased in size on MRI. Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is a rare diagnosis that should be considered in patients with ophthalmoparesis and cavernous sinus lesions. It is often misdiagnosed as a neoplastic process, and a biopsy is necessary to establish the diagnosis. The patient’s age, lack of pain, and absence of constitutional symptoms made certain diagnoses less likely, and the MRI and biopsy results were crucial in establishing the diagnosis.

    2. **Transient ischemic attack**: The patient's symptoms and the presence of a homonymous hemianopia are consistent with a transient ischemic attack, but the magnetic resonance imaging results suggest a stroke rather than a transient ischemic attack.
    3. **Cerebral vasculitis**: The patient's symptoms and the presence of a homonymous hemianopia are consistent with cerebral vasculitis, but the magnetic resonance imaging results do not support this diagnosis.
    4. **Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome**: The patient's symptoms and the presence of a homonymous hemianopia are consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, but the magnetic resonance imaging results do not support this diagnosis.
    5. **Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis**: The patient's symptoms and the presence of a homonymous hemianopia are consistent with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, but the magnetic resonance imaging results do not support this diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A woman in her early 50s was referred for decreased vision. Symptom onset was approximately 3 months prior to presentation when the patient began reporting difficulty reading. She was initially evaluated by her local eye care professional and noted to have visual acuity of 20/100 OD and 20/25 OS with cecocentral visual field defect in the right eye. Results of ophthalmoscopic examination of the optic nerves at this time revealed mild elevation of the optic nerves. Magnetic resonance imaging findings of the orbits were normal. At presentation 3 months after onset of decreased vision, the patient reported that her vision continued to worsen. Best corrected visual acuity was measured at 20/400 OD and 20/40 OS. Both optic nerves were found to be mildly hyperemic with a few telangiectatic vessels on the left and trace temporal pallor on the right. Color vision was 3/13 in the right eye and normal in the left. There was no relative afferent pupillary defect. The patient’s 24-2 Humphrey visual field in the right eye is shown in the Figure. The left eye had a very similar pattern.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a 3-month history of decreased vision in the right eye with a cecocentral visual field defect. The patient was initially evaluated by her local eye care professional and found to have a mild elevation of the optic nerves. Magnetic resonance imaging findings of the orbits were normal. At presentation, the patient reported that her vision continued to worsen. The patient’s visual acuity was 20/400 OD and 20/40 OS. Both optic nerves were mildly hyperemic with a few telangiectatic vessels on the left and trace temporal pallor on the right. Color vision was 3/13 in the right eye and normal in the left. There was no relative afferent pupillary defect. The patient’s 24-2 Humphrey visual field in the right eye showed a cecocentral visual field defect. The left eye had a very similar pattern.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, nutritional optic neuropathy, toxic optic neuropathy, dominant optic atrophy, optic neuritis, compressive optic neuropathy, ischemic optic neuropathy, optic nerve glioma, optic nerve sheath meningioma, and multiple sclerosis.

Leber hereditary optic neuropathy is a mitochondrial disorder that typically affects young men. It is characterized by a sudden loss of central vision in one eye, followed by the other eye weeks or months later. The optic nerve is typically hyperemic and telangiectatic vessels are seen on the surface of the nerve. The patient’s age and the presence of telangiectatic vessels on the optic nerve make Leber hereditary optic neuropathy a strong possibility.

Nutritional optic neuropathy is a condition that results from a deficiency of vitamin B12 or other nutrients. It is characterized by a gradual loss of central vision, often with a cecocentral visual field defect. The optic nerve is typically pale and atrophic. The patient’s history of gradual vision loss and the presence of a cecocentral visual field defect make nutritional optic neuropathy a possibility.

Toxic optic neuropathy is a condition that results from exposure to toxins such as tobacco, ethanol, or certain medications. It is characterized by a gradual loss of central vision, often with a cecocentral visual field defect. The optic nerve is typically pale and atrophic. The patient’s history of gradual vision loss and the presence of a cecocentral visual field defect make toxic optic neuropathy a possibility.

Dominant optic atrophy is a condition that results from a mutation in the OPA1 gene. It is characterized by a gradual loss of central vision, often with a cecocentral visual field defect. The optic nerve is typically pale and atrophic. The patient’s history of gradual vision loss and the presence of a cecocentral visual field defect make dominant optic atrophy a possibility.

Optic neuritis is a condition that results from inflammation of the optic nerve. It is characterized by a sudden loss of vision, often with pain on eye movement. The optic nerve is typically swollen and hyperemic. The patient’s history of gradual vision loss and the presence of a cecocentral visual field defect make optic neuritis less likely.

Compressive optic neuropathy is a condition that results from compression of the optic nerve by a tumor or other mass. It is characterized by a gradual loss of vision, often with a visual field defect. The optic nerve is typically swollen and hyperemic. The patient’s history of gradual vision loss and the presence of a cecocentral visual field defect make compressive optic neuropathy a possibility.

Ischemic optic neuropathy is a condition that results from a lack of blood flow to the optic nerve. It is characterized by a sudden loss of vision, often with a visual field defect. The optic nerve is typically swollen and hyperemic. The patient’s history of gradual vision loss and the presence of a cecocentral visual field defect make ischemic optic neuropathy less likely.

Optic nerve glioma is a type of tumor that arises from the optic nerve. It is characterized by a gradual loss of vision, often with a visual field defect. The optic nerve is typically swollen and hyperemic. The patient’s history of gradual vision loss and the presence of a cecocentral visual field defect make optic nerve glioma a possibility.

Optic nerve sheath meningioma is a type of tumor that arises from the meninges surrounding the optic nerve. It is characterized by a gradual loss of vision, often with a visual field defect. The optic nerve is typically swollen and hyperemic. The patient’s history of gradual vision loss and the presence of a cecocentral visual field defect make optic nerve sheath meningioma a possibility.

Multiple sclerosis is a condition that results from inflammation of the central nervous system. It is characterized by a sudden loss of vision, often with pain on eye movement. The optic nerve is typically swollen and hyperemic. The patient’s history of gradual vision loss and the presence of a cecocentral visual field defect make multiple sclerosis less likely.

In conclusion, the patient’s presentation is most consistent with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, nutritional optic neuropathy, toxic optic neuropathy, or dominant","['Ophthalmology', 'Neuro-ophthalmology', 'Neurology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,50.0,F

### INPUT:
A 44-year-old African American woman without traditional atherosclerotic risk factors or known coronary artery disease (CAD) presented to the emergency department with chest pain. She had 3 previous pregnancies (2 live births and 1 spontaneous abortion); her last child was born more than 5 years ago. Her chest pain began spontaneously 1 hour prior to presentation and was described as retrosternal with radiation to her upper and middle back. On physical examination, her blood pressure was 128/88 mm Hg, her pulse was regular at 96 beats per minute, her respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute, and her temperature was 36.9° C. Pulse oximetry was 100% in room air. The chest was nontender. Pertinent physical findings included normal central venous pressures, clear lung fields, normal first and second heart sounds, an audible fourth heart sound, and no murmurs. The electrocardiogram (Figure 1A) demonstrated anterior ST-segment elevations consistent with an anterior acute current of injury. Results from the chest radiography were normal. Initial troponin I concentration was 0.02 ng/mL but rose to 177.76 ng/mL over the ensuing 4 hours (the patient’s chest pain had resolved by this time). Urgent coronary angiography was performed (Figure 1B). Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow grade 2 was observed in the left anterior descending artery and second diagonal branch.

     8. Costochondritis
     9. Pneumothorax
    10. Anxiety disorder

### DISCUSSION:
Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare cause of acute coronary syndrome, accounting for approximately 1% to 4% of all acute coronary syndromes. It is more common in women, particularly during the peripartum period or in those with a history of fibromuscular dysplasia. The diagnosis is often made by coronary angiography, which demonstrates a characteristic “string of beads” appearance or a long, smooth, and narrow lumen. In this case, the patient’s coronary angiogram demonstrated a focal dissection in the left anterior descending artery and second diagonal branch, consistent with SCAD. The patient’s troponin I concentration was elevated, and her electrocardiogram demonstrated anterior ST-segment elevations, which are consistent with an acute coronary syndrome. However, the patient’s symptoms and electrocardiographic changes were not typical of an acute coronary syndrome, and the coronary angiogram did not demonstrate any atherosclerotic lesions. The patient’s symptoms and electrocardiographic changes were more consistent with SCAD. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was considered in the differential diagnosis, but the patient’s coronary angiogram did not demonstrate any evidence of apical ballooning, and her troponin I concentration was elevated, which is not typical of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Acute coronary syndrome was also considered, but the patient’s coronary angiogram did not demonstrate any atherosclerotic lesions, and her symptoms and electrocardiographic changes were not typical of an acute coronary syndrome. Aortic dissection was considered, but the patient’s chest radiography and coronary angiogram did not demonstrate any evidence of aortic dissection. Pulmonary embolism was considered, but the patient’s electrocardiogram and troponin I concentration were not consistent with pulmonary embolism. Acute pericarditis was considered, but the patient’s electrocardiogram did not demonstrate any PR-segment depression or ST-segment elevations in all leads, and her troponin I concentration was elevated, which is not typical of acute pericarditis. Hypertensive emergency was considered, but the patient’s blood pressure was not severely elevated, and her electrocardiogram and troponin I concentration were not consistent with hypertensive emergency. Costochondritis was considered, but the patient’s electrocardiogram and troponin I concentration were not consistent with costochondritis. Pneumothorax was considered, but the patient’s chest radiography did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumothorax. Anxiety disorder was considered, but the patient’s electrocardiogram and troponin I concentration were not consistent with anxiety disorder. In conclusion, the patient’s symptoms, electrocardiographic changes, and coronary angiogram were consistent with SCAD, which was the most likely diagnosis. The patient was treated with dual antiplatelet therapy and was discharged home in stable condition. She was seen in follow-up 1 week later and was doing well. A repeat coronary angiogram was performed 6 weeks later, which demonstrated complete resolution of the dissection. The patient was continued on dual antiplatelet therapy for 1 year and then transitioned to aspirin monotherapy. She was seen in follow-up 1 year later and was doing well. A repeat coronary angiogram was not performed. The patient was counseled on the risks of recurrent SCAD and the importance of follow-up. She was also referred to a cardiologist for further management.

### INPUT:
A child younger than 10 years presented with an 8-week history of bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy unresponsive to a 10-day course of Augmentin (GlaxoSmithKline). The patient’s parents denied any associated fevers, chills, night sweats, sore throat, abdominal pain, or weight changes. Medical history was noncontributory. Physical examination showed bilateral, mobile, nontender cervical lymphadenopathy without erythema or swelling. Tonsils were symmetric and not enlarged. There was no noticeable thyromegaly or nodules. Laboratory testing was significant for an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (37 mmol/h). Ultrasonography demonstrated cervical lymphadenopathy bilaterally with the largest node measuring 3.8 cm in maximum dimension. Lymph node needle core biopsy demonstrated increased histiocytes and numerous plasma cells on tissue section (Figure, A). Scattered neutrophils and rare giant cells were also present. Findings of Grocott methenamine silver, acid-fast, and Warthin-Starry stains were negative. The CD-68 immunostain showed numerous histiocytes. The specimen stained positive for CD-30 and S-100 immunostains showing emperipolesis (Figure, B and C). Findings of a CD1a stain were negative. Lymphoid markers by flow cytometry showed a polyclonal mixed B-cell and T-cell population.

     9. Metastatic disease
     10. Reactive lymphadenitis

### DISCUSSION:
Rosai-Dorfman disease is a rare, benign histiocytic disorder characterized by massive lymphadenopathy, often accompanied by extranodal involvement. The disease is typically seen in children and young adults. The diagnosis is based on the presence of histiocytes with emperipolesis, which is the engulfment of intact lymphocytes by histiocytes. The histiocytes are positive for S-100 and CD-68 and negative for CD1a. The disease is usually self-limited, but treatment may be necessary in cases with significant morbidity. In this case, the patient’s symptoms and laboratory results were consistent with Rosai-Dorfman disease, and the biopsy findings were diagnostic. The patient was treated with prednisone and methotrexate, and the lymphadenopathy resolved. The patient remains asymptomatic 2 years after diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A man in his 30s presented with a slow-growing mass in the upper lip that had developed over several years. He had no history of underlying medical diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, hepatitis, and tuberculosis. On physical examination, a whitish, firm, painless, nodular mass on the superficial layer of the left upper lip was observed (Figure, A). Given the possibility of a tumorous lesion, complete excision was planned under local anesthesia. In surgery, the 1.5 × 1.2 cm, whitish, firm, nodular, and well-encapsulated mass was excised completely without rupture of the capsule from the surrounding mucosa. On histopathologic examination, an encapsulated salivary gland tumor with epithelial and myoepithelial cells, ductlike structures, and mixed stroma was observed (Figure, B). One month after surgery, the surgical wound on the left upper lip was clean and well healed. One year later, there had been no recurrence, and the patient had no symptoms at the left upper lip.

     9. Ductal papilloma
     10. Lipoma

### DISCUSSION:
Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common benign salivary gland tumor, accounting for approximately 60% of all salivary gland tumors. It is characterized by a mixture of epithelial and myoepithelial cells, ductlike structures, and a mesenchymal stroma. The tumor is usually well encapsulated and grows slowly. The histopathologic features of the present case are consistent with pleomorphic adenoma. Myoepithelioma is a benign salivary gland tumor composed of myoepithelial cells. It is often difficult to distinguish from pleomorphic adenoma, but the absence of ductlike structures and the presence of a more uniform myoepithelial cell population are characteristic features of myoepithelioma. Basal cell adenoma is a rare benign salivary gland tumor composed of basaloid cells. It is often difficult to distinguish from pleomorphic adenoma, but the absence of myoepithelial cells and the presence of a more uniform basaloid cell population are characteristic features of basal cell adenoma. Canalicular adenoma is a rare benign salivary gland tumor composed of ductlike structures and basaloid cells. It is often difficult to distinguish from pleomorphic adenoma, but the presence of a more uniform ductlike structure and the absence of myoepithelial cells are characteristic features of canalicular adenoma. Polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma is a rare malignant salivary gland tumor characterized by a mixture of epithelial and myoepithelial cells, ductlike structures, and a mesenchymal stroma. It is often difficult to distinguish from pleomorphic adenoma, but the presence of invasive growth and the absence of encapsulation are characteristic features of polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma. Epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma is a rare malignant salivary gland tumor composed of epithelial and myoepithelial cells. It is often difficult to distinguish from pleomorphic adenoma, but the presence of invasive growth and the absence of encapsulation are characteristic features of epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma. Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a rare malignant salivary gland tumor characterized by a mixture of epithelial and myoepithelial cells, ductlike structures, and a mesenchymal stroma. It is often difficult to distinguish from pleomorphic adenoma, but the presence of invasive growth and the absence of encapsulation are characteristic features of adenoid cystic carcinoma. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a rare malignant salivary gland tumor composed of mucous, epidermoid, and intermediate cells. It is often difficult to distinguish from pleomorphic adenoma, but the presence of mucous cells and the absence of encapsulation are characteristic features of mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Ductal papilloma is a rare benign salivary gland tumor composed of ductal epithelial cells. It is often difficult to distinguish from pleomorphic adenoma, but the presence of a more uniform ductal epithelial cell population and the absence of myoepithelial cells are characteristic features of ductal papilloma. Lipoma is a rare benign tumor composed of adipose tissue. It is often difficult to distinguish from pleomorphic adenoma, but the presence of adipose tissue and the absence of epithelial and myoepithelial cells are characteristic features of lipoma.

### DISCUSSION:
Sebaceous carcinoma is a rare, aggressive, and potentially life-threatening neoplasm that arises from the sebaceous glands. It is commonly seen in the periocular region, particularly on the upper eyelid. The tumor often presents as a painless, slowly growing, yellowish or erythematous nodule or plaque, which may be ulcerated or crusted. The patient in this case presented with a slowly growing erythematous plaque on the left lower eyelid, which was initially misdiagnosed as blepharitis. The absence of eyelashes and the presence of telangiectatic vessels on dermoscopy were important clues to the diagnosis. Histopathological examination revealed a poorly differentiated carcinoma with sebaceous differentiation, which confirmed the diagnosis of sebaceous carcinoma. The patient underwent wide local excision and reconstruction with a full-thickness skin graft. The tumor was completely excised, and the patient has been disease-free for 2 years. Sebaceous carcinoma is a rare but important differential diagnosis for eyelid lesions, and early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent recurrence and metastasis.

### INPUT:
A man in his late 20s presented with mildly itchy, erythematous plaques of 3 months’ duration on both legs. The lesions started to appear on the left pretibial region as small papules, which gradually increased in size and coalesced to form bigger plaques. No history of local trauma, prolonged standing, and occupational exposure to mineral dust or recent drug intake was recollected. He was not diabetic. On examination, large, ill-defined, erythematous plaques were present on the pretibial areas extending onto the lateral aspect of both legs. The plaques were surmounted by multiple, discrete atrophic scars. The periphery of the plaques showed increased vascularity in the form of telangiectasias and venous prominences, along with atrophy of the overlying skin (Figure, A). There were no lesions elsewhere on the body. A skin biopsy sample was obtained from the plaque and sent for histopathological examination (Figure, B and C).

### DISCUSSION:
Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum is a rare cutaneous manifestation of diabetes mellitus characterized by the presence of atrophic plaques with telangiectasias and yellowish-brown discoloration. The lesions are typically seen on the shins and are often bilateral. The histopathological features of necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum include a characteristic palisading granuloma with a central zone of necrobiosis surrounded by a rim of histiocytes and lymphocytes. The presence of telangiectasias and atrophic scars on the surface of the plaques, along with the characteristic histopathological features, led us to consider necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum as the most likely diagnosis. The absence of a history of diabetes mellitus in our patient does not rule out the diagnosis, as necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum can precede the onset of diabetes mellitus in some cases. Pretibial myxedema, another differential diagnosis, is characterized by the presence of waxy, indurated plaques on the shins, often seen in patients with Graves disease. The absence of a history of thyroid disease and the characteristic histopathological features of necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum led us to consider pretibial myxedema as the second most likely diagnosis. Sarcoidosis, granuloma annulare, cutaneous tuberculosis, lichen planus, leprosy, lichen amyloidosis, porphyria cutanea tarda, and stasis dermatitis were considered as less likely differential diagnoses based on the clinical and histopathological features of the case.

### INPUT:
A Korean American woman in her early 60s was referred for evaluation of bilateral acute-angle closure and retinal detachments. She had emmetropia, and her ocular and medical history were unremarkable. Over the preceding few days, she noticed worsening blurry vision with redness in both eyes associated with headaches, nausea, and severe tinnitus. On presentation, her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/200 OD and 20/400 OS. Intraocular pressure was 45 mm Hg OU. Pupils were 4 mm and minimally reactive. There was 1+ conjunctival injection, diffuse corneal edema with Descemet folds, and the anterior chamber was shallow in both eyes. After the administration of multiple rounds of topical and oral medications, her intraocular pressure improved to 18 mm Hg OD and 19 mm Hg OS. A dilated fundus examination revealed tilted discs, serous retinal detachments, and multiple yellow, depigmented chorioretinal spots throughout the posterior pole in both eyes. B-scan ultrasonography showed shallow retinal detachments, choroidal thickening, and extensive, shallow choroidal detachments extending anteriorly in both eyes (Figure 1A). A-scan ultrasonography showed normal axial length of 22 mm OU. Optical coherence tomography indicated subretinal fluid and enhanced depth imaging demonstrated significant choroidal thickening in both eyes (Figure 1B). Fluorescein angiography revealed pinpoint hyperfluorescence with leakage. Indocyanine green angiography showed diffuse leakage throughout the posterior pole in both eyes.

     9. Hypertensive choroidopathy
    10. Choroidal metastasis

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with bilateral acute-angle closure and retinal detachments. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the presence of multiple yellow, depigmented chorioretinal spots throughout the posterior pole in both eyes, choroidal thickening, and extensive, shallow choroidal detachments on B-scan ultrasonography led us to consider Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease as the top differential diagnosis. The patient’s symptoms of headaches, nausea, and tinnitus also supported this diagnosis. Uveal effusion syndrome was also considered, given the presence of choroidal detachments and thickening. Posterior scleritis was also a possibility, given the presence of choroidal detachments and thickening. Sympathetic ophthalmia was considered, given the presence of bilateral retinal detachments and choroidal thickening. Sarcoidosis and systemic lupus erythematosus were also considered, given the presence of bilateral retinal detachments and choroidal thickening. Central serous chorioretinopathy was considered, given the presence of subretinal fluid on optical coherence tomography. Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy was considered, given the presence of multiple yellow, depigmented chorioretinal spots throughout the posterior pole in both eyes. Hypertensive choroidopathy was considered, given the presence of choroidal thickening. Choroidal metastasis was considered, given the presence of choroidal thickening, but it was less likely given the bilateral nature of the disease and the presence of multiple yellow, depigmented chorioretinal spots throughout the posterior pole in both eyes. The patient was referred to a uveitis specialist for further evaluation and management. The patient was treated with oral prednisone and cycloplegic agents, and her symptoms improved. The patient was diagnosed with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings. The patient was followed up for 6 months, and her vision improved to 20/20 OU. The patient’s intraocular pressure remained stable, and the retinal detachments resolved. The patient’s symptoms of headaches, nausea, and tinnitus also resolved. The patient was tapered off oral prednisone over 6 months, and her vision remained stable. The patient was followed up for 1 year, and her vision remained stable. The patient’s intraocular pressure remained stable, and the retinal detachments did not recur. The patient’s symptoms of headaches, nausea, and tinnitus did not recur.

### INPUT:
An African American woman in her 30s with metastatic soft tissue sarcoma of the right lower extremity, with a medical history of above-knee right leg amputation, received treatment with nivolumab (an anti–programmed cell death 1 [anti–PD-1] antibody) with an initial good tolerance. Her medical history was negative for any skin cancers. After 2 months of treatment, the patient presented with diffuse hyperpigmented macules. This was thought to be related to her chronic atopic dermatitis and she was prescribed topical steroids and moisturizing. Four months later the patient presented with diffuse macular cutaneous eruption and pruritus. A skin punch biopsy of the back revealed mild epidermal acanthosis, focal parakeratosis, and interface dermatitis with numerous dyskeratotic cells and underlying lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate with scattered dermal melanophages. Oral steroids were prescribed and 3 weeks later the rash had resolved; however, the patient developed numerous hypopigmented macules and patches, covering more than 30% of her body surface area (Figure, A) compared with the prior skin examination (Figure, B). A new biopsy showed epithelial basal vacuolar changes, underlying lichenoid lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with scattered eosinophils and interface dermatitis with marked pigment incontinence and a reduced number of junctional melanocytes (Figure, C).

     8. Fixed drug eruption
     9. Sarcoidosis
     10. Dermatophytosis

### DISCUSSION:
The patient developed a diffuse macular cutaneous eruption and pruritus after 4 months of treatment with nivolumab. The initial skin biopsy showed interface dermatitis with numerous dyskeratotic cells and underlying lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate with scattered dermal melanophages. The patient was treated with oral steroids and the rash resolved; however, she developed numerous hypopigmented macules and patches covering more than 30% of her body surface area. A new biopsy showed epithelial basal vacuolar changes, underlying lichenoid lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with scattered eosinophils and interface dermatitis with marked pigment incontinence and a reduced number of junctional melanocytes. The differential diagnosis includes lichenoid drug eruption, lichen planus pigmentosus, vitiligo, postinflammatory hypopigmentation, lichen planus, hypopigmented mycosis fungoides, leukoderma, fixed drug eruption, sarcoidosis, and dermatophytosis. The patient’s history of treatment with nivolumab and the skin biopsy findings support the diagnosis of lichenoid drug eruption. The patient’s skin lesions resolved after discontinuation of nivolumab and treatment with oral steroids and topical tacrolimus. The patient was restarted on pembrolizumab (another anti–PD-1 antibody) and has not developed any new skin lesions. This case highlights the importance of recognizing lichenoid drug eruption as a potential cutaneous adverse effect of anti–PD-1 therapy.

### INPUT:
A man in his mid-20s with no significant medical history presented with 18 months of progressive dyspnea, abdominal distention, and lower extremity edema. A chest radiograph showed significant cardiomegaly. A transthoracic echocardiogram (Figure 1) revealed a mildly dilated, hypertrophied right ventricle (RV) with normal function and significant right atrial (RA) enlargement (107 cm2). The tricuspid annulus was dilated (48 mm) with severe tricuspid regurgitation. There were no significant abnormalities of the left ventricle, left atrium, or pulmonic, mitral, and aortic valves. Invasive hemodynamic measures showed elevated RA pressure (14 mm Hg), but normal pulmonary artery pressure (16/11 mm Hg) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (7 mm Hg). Cardiac index calculated by the Fick method was 2.46 L/min/m2. Aggressive diuresis was initiated.

     1. Ebstein anomaly
     2. Tricuspid regurgitation
     3. Right ventricular cardiomyopathy

     6. Cardiac sarcoidosis
     7. Amyloidosis
     8. Constrictive pericarditis
     9. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
     10. Pulmonary embolism

### DISCUSSION:
Ebstein anomaly is a rare congenital heart defect characterized by apical displacement of the tricuspid valve, resulting in atrialization of the RV and a variable degree of tricuspid regurgitation. The diagnosis is often made in childhood, but some patients may remain asymptomatic until adulthood. The patient’s symptoms and echocardiographic findings are consistent with Ebstein anomaly. The dilated RA and RV, tricuspid regurgitation, and normal pulmonary artery pressure support this diagnosis. The patient’s symptoms and echocardiographic findings are not consistent with pulmonary hypertension, which would typically present with elevated pulmonary artery pressure and right heart failure. Tricuspid regurgitation is a common finding in Ebstein anomaly, but it is not the primary diagnosis. Right ventricular cardiomyopathy is a possible diagnosis, but the patient’s echocardiographic findings are more consistent with Ebstein anomaly. The patient’s symptoms and echocardiographic findings are not consistent with the other differential diagnoses.

### INPUT:
A previously healthy 61-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 4-week history of severe weakness and difficulty ambulating independently. He had difficulty rising from a seated position. Additional symptoms included progressive numbness and tingling of the hands and feet. His family also reported progressive memory impairment during this period. An extensive review of systems was otherwise unremarkable, except for a few months of intermittent nausea, increased abdominal bloating, and anorexia. Physical examination revealed normal vital signs, normal cardiopulmonary findings, atrophy in the calf muscles bilaterally, 4 of 5 symmetric strength in the upper and lower extremity extensor muscles, and an unsteady shuffling gait. He had decreased vibration and proprioception in both lower extremities, with hyperreflexia and a positive Babinski reflex on the left side. Mental status examination revealed delayed recall of 1 of 4 words. Complete blood cell count revealed a white blood cell count of 4.7 × 103/μL; hemoglobin level, 10.9 g/dL; hematocrit, 31.8%; and platelet count, 202 × 103/μL. Mean corpuscular volume was 119 fL. Results of renal function and liver function tests were normal. Because of the asymmetric hyperreflexia and concern for a spinal cord lesion, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine was performed (Figure 1).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a 4-week history of progressive weakness, numbness, and tingling in the hands and feet, as well as memory impairment. The physical examination revealed symmetric weakness, hyperreflexia, and decreased vibration and proprioception in the lower extremities. The MRI of the spine showed a T2 hyperintense signal in the posterior columns of the cervical and thoracic cord, consistent with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. The patient was found to have a low vitamin B12 level of 130 pg/mL (to convert to picomoles per liter, multiply by 0.7378). The patient was treated with intramuscular vitamin B12 injections, and his symptoms improved significantly over the next few weeks. The patient was also found to have a low copper level of 0.4 μg/mL (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 15.748) and was treated with oral copper supplementation. The patient’s symptoms continued to improve, and he was eventually able to ambulate independently.

### INPUT:
An elderly man presented to the emergency department describing unremitting pain in the left iliac fossa with accompanying tenderness, fever, and tachypnea. He also noted swelling in his left inguinofemoral region, left scrotum, and left femur. His symptoms started 2 days before admission and the pain was progressively worsening. The patient did not report vomiting, constipation, or change in his bowel habits. His history was significant for hypertension and hypothyroidism; his last colonoscopy, 4 years ago, revealed diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon. The patient’s condition was stable (blood pressure, 130/85 mm Hg, heart rate, 88 beats/min), but he was febrile (temperature, 38.6°C). Physical examination showed cellulitis in his left inguinal canal, scrotum, and femur along with sensitivity in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. Initial laboratory test findings exhibited white blood cell count of 16 700/μL (to convert to 109/L, multiply by 0.001) and C-reactive protein of 340 mg/L (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 9.524). Chest roentgenogram was negative for free air under the diaphragm but was remarkable for some air-fluid levels. The patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with oral contrast (diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium solution) (Figure, A and B).

Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:

     1. Perforated sigmoid diverticulitis
     2. Perforated colon cancer
     3. Necrotizing fasciitis
     4. Inguinal hernia
     5. Sigmoid volvulus
     6. Ischiorectal abscess
     7. Diverticulitis
     8. Appendicitis
     9. Perforated peptic ulcer
    10. Testicular torsion

The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy, which revealed a perforated sigmoid diverticulum with a large amount of fecal peritonitis. The patient underwent a Hartmann procedure and was discharged 14 days later. The patient was doing well at 6-month follow-up.

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a complex clinical picture, which made it challenging to establish a definitive diagnosis. The CT scan was instrumental in guiding the diagnosis. The presence of free air in the pelvis and the left inguinal canal, along with the inflammatory changes in the left lower quadrant, suggested a perforated viscus. The sigmoid colon was the most likely source of the perforation, given the patient’s history of diverticulosis. The CT scan also showed a large amount of free fluid in the pelvis, which was consistent with fecal peritonitis. The patient’s symptoms and physical examination findings were consistent with a perforated viscus, and the CT scan helped to narrow down the differential diagnosis. The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy, which confirmed the diagnosis of perforated sigmoid diverticulitis.

### LESSONS LEARNED:
1. A high index of suspicion is necessary for diagnosing perforated sigmoid diverticulitis, especially in elderly patients with a history of diverticulosis.
2. A thorough physical examination and laboratory test results can help guide the diagnosis, but imaging studies, such as CT scans, are often necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
3. A multidisciplinary approach, involving surgeons, radiologists, and other specialists, can be helpful in managing complex cases like this one.

### INPUT:
A 12-month-old healthy boy was seen at the outpatient ophthalmology clinic with gradually worsening bilateral temporal facial swelling and proptosis that developed in the setting of a recent bilateral ear infection 10 days prior. He was currently being treated with oral amoxicillin. His mother reported a recent decrease in appetite, decreased feeding, increased irritability, and near-constant crying. On examination, he was inconsolable and crying. His pulse rate was 112 beats/min, blood pressure was 122/68 mm Hg, and temperature was 38.7°C. He had soft, bitemporal facial masses (Figure, A). He was proptotic and demonstrated a substantial change in his ocular appearance compared with photographs taken 4 weeks earlier that his mother brought for our review. He appeared to be orthophoric in primary gaze but had bilateral abduction deficits. His pupils were round and reactive, without an afferent pupillary defect. His anterior and posterior segment examination results were normal, without evidence of optic nerve edema or pallor. His pediatrician had obtained a complete blood cell count and head radiograph 10 days prior that were both normal.

     7. Orbital lymphangioma
     8. Orbital dermoid cyst
     9. Orbital teratoma
    10. Orbital hemangioma

The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management. Computed tomography (CT) of the orbits and sinuses revealed bilateral orbital masses with adjacent bony destruction and opacification of the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses (Figure, B). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits and brain demonstrated bilateral orbital masses with heterogeneous signal intensity and enhancement, with extension into the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses (Figure, C). The patient underwent bilateral orbital and sinus biopsies, which revealed a small round blue cell tumor consistent with rhabdomyosarcoma (Figure, D). The patient was referred to pediatric oncology for further management and treatment.

### DISCUSSION:
Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common primary orbital malignancy in children, accounting for approximately 4% of all childhood malignancies. It is a highly aggressive tumor that arises from mesenchymal cells and can occur in various locations, including the orbit, head, and neck. The most common orbital location is the superonasal quadrant. The tumor can present with a range of symptoms, including proptosis, periorbital swelling, decreased vision, and limited ocular motility. Imaging studies, including CT and MRI, are essential for evaluating the extent of the tumor and its relationship to surrounding structures. Definitive diagnosis is made by biopsy, and treatment typically involves a combination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgical excision. The prognosis is generally good, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 70%. However, the tumor can recur, and long-term follow-up is necessary to monitor for recurrences and late effects of treatment.

### KEY POINTS:
* Rhabdomyosarcoma is a highly aggressive tumor that can present with proptosis, periorbital swelling, and decreased vision in children.

### INPUT:
A middle-aged white woman presented to the ophthalmology clinic for a third opinion. The patient had been experiencing redness, tearing, and foreign-body sensation in both eyes for 7 months. She was diagnosed with giant papillary conjunctivitis and follicular conjunctivitis by ophthalmologists at other institutions and was treated with topical corticosteroids and oral doxycycline. Topical corticosteroid eyedrops (0.5% loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension) seemed to control her symptoms, but attempts to wean the medication resulted in recurrence. She denied any significant ocular history. Her medical history included hypothyroidism and breast cancer in the setting of Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic disorder with a predisposition to various cancers, including carcinoma of the colon, breast, and uterus. At the time of examination, visual acuity was 20/25 OU. Pupil anatomy, intraocular pressure, confrontation visual fields, and extraocular movements were within normal limits. Slitlamp examination revealed mild meibomian gland dysfunction bilaterally, and follicular conjunctivitis was evident on eversion of all 4 eyelids. The bulbar conjunctiva demonstrated hyperemia and elevation medially (Figure 1). The remainder of the examination, including dilated funduscopic examination, was within normal limits.

     9. Blepharitis
    10. Meibomian gland dysfunction

The patient was diagnosed with ligneous conjunctivitis, a rare condition characterized by the formation of a thick, white, membranous plaque on the conjunctiva. The diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination of a conjunctival biopsy specimen. The patient was treated with topical cyclosporine and oral doxycycline, and the conjunctival plaques resolved. The patient was also referred to a dermatologist for evaluation of possible skin lesions. The patient’s Lynch syndrome was considered a possible underlying factor contributing to the development of ligneous conjunctivitis.

### INPUT:
A 46-year-old man with salivary duct carcinoma of the right parotid gland presented for evaluation of a 3-week history of multiple new pruritic skin lesions on the right chest. The patient’s salivary duct carcinoma was androgen receptor positive and HER2 positive. He had previously undergone parotidectomy followed by radiation therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and trastuzumab. He had continued with androgen-deprivation therapy and palliative radiation therapy for osseous metastases. The patient endorsed erythematous skin changes within the field of radiation and a 2-month history of painful right upper extremity lymphedema that began after his most recent radiation treatment. He denied fevers or other systemic symptoms associated with the onset of the skin lesions. Physical examination revealed numerous nontender, firm, pebblelike, pink papules on the right anterior neck, upper chest, and back, arising on a background of confluent blanchable violaceous erythema (Figure, A), as well as similar-appearing lesions on the right chest wall on a background of normal-appearing skin. Concurrent skin biopsies from the right chest wall, clavicular area, and upper right back were performed (Figure, B and C).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient’s history of radiation therapy and the presence of violaceous erythema within the radiation field suggested radiation dermatitis. However, the presence of firm, pebblelike papules on the right chest wall on a background of normal-appearing skin, as well as the histopathologic findings of atypical endothelial cells with papillary projections and lymphatic spaces, supported a diagnosis of radiation-induced angiosarcoma. The patient’s history of lymphedema and the presence of lesions on the right chest wall also raised the possibility of lymphedema-associated angiosarcoma. The patient’s history of salivary duct carcinoma and the presence of atypical cells with papillary projections raised the possibility of cutaneous metastases. However, the histopathologic findings were not consistent with salivary duct carcinoma. The patient’s history of radiation therapy and the presence of violaceous erythema within the radiation field also raised the possibility of radiation-induced lymphangiosarcoma. The patient’s history of radiation therapy and the presence of atypical endothelial cells with papillary projections also raised the possibility of Kaposi sarcoma. The patient’s history of salivary duct carcinoma and the presence of atypical cells with papillary projections raised the possibility of lymphomatoid granulomatosis. The patient’s history of radiation therapy and the presence of violaceous erythema within the radiation field also raised the possibility of cutaneous lymphoma. The patient’s history of radiation therapy and the presence of violaceous erythema within the radiation field also raised the possibility of cutaneous vasculitis. The patient’s history of salivary duct carcinoma and the presence of atypical cells with papillary projections raised the possibility of sarcoidosis. However, the histopathologic findings were not consistent with sarcoidosis.

### KEY POINTS:
1. Radiation-induced angiosarcoma is a rare complication of radiation therapy.
2. The diagnosis of radiation-induced angiosarcoma requires a high index of suspicion, especially in patients with a history of radiation therapy.
3. The histopathologic findings of atypical endothelial cells with papillary projections and lymphatic spaces support a diagnosis of radiation-induced angiosarcoma.
4. The differential diagnosis of radiation-induced angiosarcoma includes lymphedema-associated angiosarcoma, cutaneous metastases, radiation dermatitis, Kaposi sarcoma, lymphomatoid granulomatosis, cutaneous lymphoma, cutaneous vasculitis, and sarcoidosis.

### INPUT:
A man in his 30s with a medical history of asthma, social history of smoking, and allergy to shellfish presented to the emergency department with tongue swelling. The patient reported a history of a local burn from hot food but denied any history of trauma, foreign body, or piercing. He was evaluated, given a presumptive diagnosis of sialadenitis, and discharged home with ibuprofen and clindamycin. He returned several days later with worsening tongue swelling, voice change, and subjective fever. Postcontrast axial computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a midline lesion within the oral tongue that was predominantly hypodense and demonstrated rim enhancement. No calcifications were seen within the lesion (Figure, A). The lesion was predominantly isointense to muscle on axial T1-weighted images without intravenous (IV) contrast (Figure, B). Axial T2-weighted images with fat saturation showed predominantly hyperintense signal relative to muscle as well as punctate internal foci of T2 hypointensity (not shown). The lesion was hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging (Figure, C) and hypointense on the apparent diffusion coefficient map (not shown). Sagittal T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with IV contrast and fat suppression demonstrated signal hypointense to muscle centrally with peripheral enhancement (Figure, D).

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a history of tongue swelling and a CT scan that showed a midline lesion within the oral tongue. The lesion was hypodense on CT and demonstrated rim enhancement. The MRI showed a lesion that was isointense to muscle on T1-weighted images, hyperintense on T2-weighted images, and demonstrated peripheral enhancement. The lesion was hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging and hypointense on the apparent diffusion coefficient map. The differential diagnosis was broad and included epidermoid cyst, dermoid cyst, lymphangioma, hemangioma, tongue abscess, sialadenitis, lymphoma, granuloma, mucocele, and tongue cancer. The patient underwent surgical excision of the lesion, and the final pathologic diagnosis was an epidermoid cyst. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged home.

### INPUT:
A previously healthy 18-year-old college student presented to the emergency department with a 6-month history of fatigue, dry cough, dyspnea, and unintentional weight loss of 18 kg (from 100 to 82 kg). Four months ago, he was treated for presumed pneumonia with azithromycin without improvement. He did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use intravenous drugs. He was born in the United States and had not traveled outside of the country. He took no medications. On examination, his temperature was 37°C, heart rate 110/min, blood pressure 123/72 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 20/min. He had a palpable 2×2-cm firm, nontender, right supraclavicular lymph node and decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion in the right lower lung field. No hepatosplenomegaly or leg edema was noted. Routine laboratory tests, including complete blood cell counts, renal function, electrolytes, and hepatic function, were within normal limits. A chest x-ray demonstrated diffuse homogeneous opacification of the right lung field. Computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a 15 × 11-cm centrally necrotic mass in the right anterior mediastinum displacing the trachea to the left, a large right pleural effusion, and compression of the superior vena cava (Figure 1). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Hodgkin lymphoma," 1. Lymphoma
     2. Metastatic germ cell tumor
     3. Thymoma
     4. Mediastinal abscess
     5. Tuberculosis
     6. Sarcoidosis
     7. Lymphangitic carcinomatosis
     8. Pulmonary embolism
     9. Pneumonia
     10. Pleural effusion

Reranked differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:

     1. Lymphoma
     2. Metastatic germ cell tumor
     3. Thymoma
     4. Tuberculosis
     5. Sarcoidosis
     6. Lymphangitic carcinomatosis
     7. Mediastinal abscess
     8. Pulmonary embolism
     9. Pneumonia
     10. Pleural effusion

### DISCUSSION:
The patient presented with a large mediastinal mass, pleural effusion, and lymphadenopathy. The differential diagnosis was broad, but the patient’s age, sex, and the location of the mass in the anterior mediastinum suggested lymphoma as the most likely diagnosis. The patient underwent a mediastinal biopsy, which revealed a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The patient was treated with chemotherapy and achieved complete remission. The patient’s symptoms and radiographic findings were consistent with lymphoma, which was confirmed by biopsy. The patient’s age and sex made lymphoma a more likely diagnosis than thymoma or metastatic germ cell tumor. Tuberculosis and sarcoidosis were also considered, but the patient’s lack of constitutional symptoms, normal laboratory results, and the presence of a large mediastinal mass made these diagnoses less likely. Lymphangitic carcinomatosis was also considered, but the patient’s age and the location of the mass made this diagnosis less likely. Mediastinal abscess was considered, but the patient’s lack of fever and the presence of a large mass made this diagnosis less likely. Pulmonary embolism was considered, but the patient’s symptoms and radiographic findings were not consistent with this diagnosis. Pneumonia was considered, but the patient’s lack of fever and the presence of a large mediastinal mass made this diagnosis less likely. Pleural effusion was a symptom of the patient’s underlying disease rather than a diagnosis.
