She had received her medical care at outside facilities, the records of which were not available. She could not recall being given any precise diagnosis but reported having proteinuria since age 7 years. Her other medical conditions included hyperlipidemia, arterial hypertension, and pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex infection. She was taking tacrolimus, amlodipine, atorvastatin, ethambutol, rifampin, and clarithromycin. Her family history was unremarkable. She had 2 healthy adult children. One year after the first kidney transplant, she noted an inferior visual field defect in the left eye and was diagnosed with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Several years later, she underwent uncomplicated bilateral cataract procedures. Visual acuity with distance correction was 20/25 OD and 20/30 OS. Color vision was 14/14 plates for each eye. There was a left relative afferent pupillary defect. Confrontation visual field was full for the right eye and demonstrated an inferior defect for the left eye. External and slitlamp examinations were notable only for bilateral pseudophakia. Both optic discs were anomalous in appearance, with central excavation in the left eye greater than the right eye (Figure). The remainder of the posterior pole examination, including the retinal vessels, appeared normal in both eyes. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Papillorenal syndrome due to a PAX2 gene variant", "predict": "\n### Step 1:\nFamilial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy\n\n### Step 2:\nMedullary cystic kidney disease\n\n### Step 3:\nAlport syndrome\n\n### Step 4:\nThin basement membrane disease\n\n### Step 5:\nAutosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease\n\n### Step 6:\nDiabetic nephropathy\n\n### Step 7:\nHypertensive nephrosclerosis\n\n### Step 8:\nTacrolimus-induced nephrotoxicity\n\n### Step 9:\nAmyloidosis\n\n### Step 10:\nMyeloma kidney\n\n### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:\n\n1.

The patient was seen and evaluated by a local surgical oncologist with a working diagnosis of possible lymphoma. The growing neck mass was causing solid food dysphagia and difficulty breathing at night. He did not have any neurological deficits. On further questioning, he had a similar mass that was treated with liposuction 10 years prior. His family history was negative for any head and neck benign or malignant disease. His social history was negative for tobacco or alcohol use. This patient was not taking any steroid medications. Physical examination showed an enlarged right more than left-sided neck mass. It was tense but compressible to palpation. Flexible fiber-optic laryngoscopy showed a crowded oropharynx with lingual tonsil hypertrophy and narrow oropharynx and hypopharynx. An outside computed tomography scan showed diffuse symmetric fatty infiltration of the pharynx, larynx, trachea, and esophagus. A magnetic resonance imaging scan with and without contrast (Figure, A) showed extensive areas of fat deposition within the neck that bilaterally extended from the level of C1 in the retropharyngeal space to the level of the sternal notch. Given that the patient was symptomatic, surgical intervention was recommended. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Madelung disease", "predict": "\n### Step 1:\nLipoma\n\n### Step 2:\nLymphangioma\n\n### Step 3:\nLymphoma\n\n### Step 4:\nSarcoidosis\n\n### Step 5:\nAmyloidosis\n\n### Step 6:\nMultiple symmetric lipomatosis (Madelung disease)\n\n### Step 7:\nHypothyroidism\n\n### Step 8:\nCushing's syndrome\n\n### Step 9:\nAngioedema\n\n### Step 10:\nLipomatosis of the larynx and neck\n\n### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:\n\n1.

His medical history was remarkable for mild anemia because of untreated hemorrhoids. Physical examination revealed numerous symmetrically distributed, well-defined, erythematous skin nodules on his back, buttocks, and limb extensors (Figure, A). Prominent lymphadenopathies on bilateral cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes were noted, with the largest lymph node measuring approximately 5 × 2 cm. Laboratory tests were significant for atypical lymphocytes in the peripheral blood (count up to 6%), an elevated CD4+/CD8+ lymphocyte ratio (9.21; normal range, 0.7-3.1), moderate anemia (hemoglobin level, 8.7 g/dL; normal range, 11.5-15.0 g/dL [to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0]), a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (35 mm/h; normal range, 0-25 mm/h), and cryoglobulins composed of mixed polyclonal immunoglobulins.

Five months after surgery, he presented to the otolaryngology clinic with 3 weeks of mild odynophagia and dysphagia. It was noted that the patient had a prominent posterior pharyngeal wall, subtle asymmetry of vocal fold motion, and pooling of secretions in the left pyriform (Video 1). During the next 6 months, he gradually developed shortness of breath and stridor, and eventually presented to the emergency department in respiratory distress requiring intubation for 2 days. Shortly after extubation, laryngeal examination showed fullness of the posterior pharyngeal wall and severely limited vocal fold abduction bilaterally (Figure 1A; Video 1). A modified barium swallow study showed intermittent laryngeal penetration without aspiration (Video 2). Although the patient was unable to tolerate magnetic resonance imaging, a soft tissue computed tomography scan of the neck with contrast revealed a well-positioned plate with no evidence of fluid collection in the setting of a normal leukocyte count.

The mass had been present since birth but had slowly grown larger in the previous 2 years. On physical examination, a 2.5 × 1.5-cm, nontender, blue, soft, cystic mass was observed in the right postauricular area. There were no fistular openings around the auricle or in the external auditory canal (EAC), and there were no additional cysts, sinuses, or fistulas at the right neck from the hyoid bone and chin to the EAC. On temporal bone computed tomography, a 2.5 × 1.5-cm, hypodense, oval-shaped cystic mass was revealed at the subcutaneous fat layer superoposterior to the right auricle. On temporal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an oval cystic mass was revealed at the same location, with high signal intensity on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images and low signal intensity on enhanced T1-weighted fat suppression and T2-weighted short T1 inversion recovery images (Figure, A-D).

Her ocular history was notable for recent cataract surgery 5 weeks prior to presentation that was complicated by endophthalmitis. A normal funduscopic examination was documented prior to cataract surgery. At the time of initial presentation to her local retina specialist 1 week following her cataract surgery, the patient had severe pain and redness. Her visual acuity was light perception. An examination revealed a 2-mm hypopyon and dense vitreous haze with no view of the retina. She was treated for presumed endophthalmitis with a vitreous tap and intravitreal injections of vancomycin (1 mg/0.1 mL), ceftazidime (2.2 mg/0.1 mL), and dexamethasone (0.4 mg/0.1 mL). The vitreous sample obtained at the time of treatment grew Staphylococcus caprae susceptible to vancomycin. At time of examination in our clinic 4 weeks following treatment, the patient was receiving topical steroid and cycloplegic drops. Her best-corrected visual acuity had improved to 20/70. Examination showed a deep and quiet anterior chamber with a well-positioned intraocular lens without any plaques or deposits on the lens capsule. Dilated ophthalmoscopic examination demonstrated improvement in the vitreous debris with 1+ vitritis and numerous superficial, round, white lesions spread throughout the fundus in all 4 quadrants and in the macula (Figure 1A).

The patient fell asleep and his girlfriend tried to wake him, but he started shaking and slumped over on the ground. He denied confusion afterward but did not feel well with nausea, flushing, chest tightness, and a rapid heart rate. About 10 minutes later, he had a second syncopal episode for 2 to 3 minutes with more than 20 muscle jerks. On presentation at the emergency department, he was afebrile, blood pressure was 120/59 mm Hg, heart rate was 85 beats per min, respiratory rate was 16 breaths per min, and oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. His cardiac examination revealed normal heart sounds with no murmurs. The electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed early on arrival in the emergency department (Figure). Transthoracic echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction of 54%, mild right ventricular (RV) dilation (RV diameter, 4.1 cm), and no significant valvular abnormalities. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed no RV abnormalities and qualitatively normal RV function. Neurology consultation was obtained with concern for an epileptic seizure event surrounding the recurrent syncopal episodes. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalogram  were obtained, both of which results were normal. On further questioning, patient reported having a second cousin with sudden cardiac death of uncertain etiology in his early 20s. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Brugada type 1 syndrome with unexplained syncope", "predict": "\n### Step 1:\nSeizure disorder\n\n### Step 2:\nVasovagal syncope\n\n### Step 3:\nArrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy\n\n### Step 4:\nBrugada syndrome\n\n### Step 5:\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy\n\n### Step 6:\nLong QT syndrome\n\n### Step 7:\nWolff-Parkinson-White syndrome\n\n### Step 8:\nPulmonary embolism\n\n### Step 9:\nAortic stenosis\n\n### Step 10:\nNeurocardiogenic syncope\n\n### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:\n\n1.

Her symptoms began after relocation to California and occurred more frequently at her home. However, she could not discern any environmental or dietary triggers. She reported pruritus and swelling, which were usually moderate but occasionally severe, prompting several emergency department visits. During an emergency department visit, she was diagnosed with acute parotitis based on clinical and radiographic findings of diffuse gland edema, without salivary stones or masses. Her symptoms responded to oral prednisone bursts and diphenhydramine, but not to second-generation antihistamines or montelukast. Her workup included immune serology and total immunoglobulin (Ig) E measurements, all of which were within normal limits. A differential blood cell count revealed 10% eosinophils (normal, <6%) and an absolute eosinophil count 500/µL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). Titers for antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, anti-Ro (SS-A), and anti-La (SS-B) were negative. Sialendoscopy of her right parotid and left submandibular glands found no obstructing stones or strictures. Concurrent steroid irrigation did not provide any substantial benefit. An open biopsy of the right parotid tail revealed nonspecific inflammatory changes and otherwise normal parenchyma. Given the frequency and severity of her symptoms along with multiple treatment failures, she opted to undergo a right superficial parotidectomy, which proceeded without complications. Further histologic examination of the surgical specimen revealed substantial periductal inflammatory infiltrate with eosinophils, as seen in the Figure. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Eosinophilic sialodochitis", "predict": "\n### Step 1:\nAllergic rhinitis\n\n### Step 2:\nAngioedema\n\n### Step 3:\nAcute parotitis\n\n### Step 4:\nSarcoidosis\n\n### Step 5:\nSjögren's syndrome\n\n### Step 6:\nEosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis\n\n### Step 7:\nIgG4-related disease\n\n### Step 8:\nHypereosinophilic syndrome\n\n### Step 9:\nOral allergy syndrome\n\n### Step 10:\nEosinophilic sialodochitis\n\n---\n\n### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:\n\n1.

She was found to have narrow angles in both eyes and a laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) was performed in her left eye. Two weeks later she developed flickering photopsias and a temporal scotoma progressing to a “brown tint” of her vision in her left eye. Her vision had decreased in her left eye and macular and optic nerve edema were noted and she was subsequently referred to us. In our clinic, her visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/50 OS, and she had normal intraocular pressure, a shallow anterior chamber but open angle in both eyes, a patent LPI in the left eye, and clear crystalline lenses in both eyes. The rest of her anterior segment was unremarkable. The posterior examination was notable for shifting subretinal fluid with choroidal detachments without retinal breaks, inflammation, or optic nerve edema and leopard spotting, while her right eye was unremarkable (Figure, A). Fluorescein angiography was unrevealing, while optical coherence tomography showed shallow subretinal fluid and an irregular and thickened choroid (Figure, B). Ultrasonography showed an axial length of 20.0 mm, thickened sclera, anteriorly rotated ciliary body, and 360° of ciliochoroidal detachments in both eyes but worse in the left eye. Results of a systemic laboratory evaluation for infectious and noninfectious disorders were unremarkable. Systemic corticosteroids failed to resolve the subretinal fluid and her vision declined. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Uveal effusion syndrome", "predict": "\n### Step 1:\nAcute angle-closure glaucoma\n\n### Step 2:\nOptic neuritis\n\n### Step 3:\nCentral serous chorioretinopathy\n\n### Step 4:\nPosterior scleritis\n\n### Step 5:\nUveal effusion syndrome\n\n### Step 6:\nNanophthalmos\n\n### Step 7:\nChoroidal melanoma\n\n### Step 8:\nVogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease\n\n### Step 9:\nHypertensive choroidopathy\n\n### Step 10:\nChoroidal hemorrhage\n\n### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:\n\n1.

Four weeks following receipt of immunotherapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab, he developed acute abdominal pain in the setting of a rapidly rising lactic acid dehydrogenase levels, prompting hospital admission. Imaging results showed mild disease progression (new ascites and periportal metabolic lymph node). Splenic infarct and portal/splenic vein thrombi were identified as etiologies of his acute pain and were presumed to be secondary to hypercoagulable state of malignancy. Over the next 3 days, he had rising serum creatinine (sCr) levels (baseline, approximately 1 mg/dL [to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4]). The initial workup included ultrasonography and urinalysis. Ultrasonography results showed abnormal intraparenchymal flow to both kidneys without evidence of kidney artery stenosis. Urine studies were consistent with prerenal etiology, while the presence of casts suggested acute tubular necrosis. Nephrotoxic medications (omeprazole/pantoprazole) were discontinued. The top differential diagnoses at this juncture included contrast-induced nephropathy or immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)–induced acute interstitial nephritis, and empirical high dose steroids were prescribed. Despite observation and steroid treatment, his sCr levels continued to increase over the next 5 days, peaking at 5.8 mg/dL, and the patient progressed into anuric kidney failure, requiring hemodialysis. This prompted a kidney biopsy for definitive diagnosis (Figure). One week later, he received encorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor.1 Two weeks later, the patient’s kidney function began to improve, and hemodialysis was discontinued. He continued to show gradual improvement, with a return to near baseline kidney function (sCr level, 1.3 mg/dL) approximately 6 weeks after treatment initiation. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Acute tubular necrosis secondary to kidney melanoma metastasis", "predict": "\n### Step 1:\nPrerenal azotemia\n\n### Step 2:\nAcute tubular necrosis\n\n### Step 3:\nContrast-induced nephropathy\n\n### Step 4:\nImmune checkpoint inhibitor-induced acute interstitial nephritis\n\n### Step 5:\nAcute glomerulonephritis\n\n### Step 6:\nVascular thrombosis\n\n### Step 7:\nObstructive uropathy\n\n### Step 8:\nDrug-induced acute kidney injury (non-ICI)\n\n### Step 9:\nBilateral renal infarction\n\n### Step 10:\nTumor lysis syndrome\n\n**Reranked Differential Diagnoses:**\n\n1.

She denied ocular disease, trauma, or surgery. She had no medical problems aside from chronic back pain due to a herniated disc. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/25 OS. Intraocular pressure, extraocular motility, and pupillary examination results were normal. The right eye was unremarkable. Examination of the left eye showed 2 temporal scleral nodules with surrounding hyperemia and no scleromalacia. She experienced substantial pain with palpation. Posterior examination results were unremarkable. The results of the following laboratory tests were all unremarkable: tuberculosis interferon-γ release assay, rapid plasma reagin, fluorescent treponemal antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and angiotensin-converting enzyme. The rheumatoid factor level (18 IU/mL [normal range, <14 IU/mL]) and C-reactive protein level (26 mg/L [normal range, 0-5 mg/L]) were elevated. In addition, Lyme IgG, IgM, and reflex Western blot assays were positive for antibodies. The patient denied travel to Lyme-endemic regions, tick bites, or rashes. The patient started oral prednisone therapy for possible rheumatoid arthritis (RA)–associated nodular scleritis, doxycycline therapy for positive Lyme studies, and was referred to a rheumatologist for further RA evaluation. Two weeks after presentation and initiation of oral prednisone therapy, the patient noted improvement in pain, but the scleral nodules and hyperemia persisted. Therefore, subconjunctival triamcinolone acetonide (0.5 mL of 40 mg/mL) was administered to the left eye. Further confirmatory RA workup by rheumatology did not reveal other systemic findings thought to be associated with RA on review of symptoms or clinical examination.

Examination results of a right, superficial, temporal artery biopsy specimen showed chronic, nongranulomatous inflammation surrounding adventitial vessels and extensive subintimal fibrosis, without giant cells or segmental loss of the internal elastic lamina, which was interpreted as compatible with temporal arteritis. High-dose corticosteroid therapy was initiated (1 g methylprednisolone intravenously for 3 days followed by 60 mg/d of oral prednisone).

The mass had been slowly enlarging and he had been experiencing mild intermittent pain, but no additional symptoms were reported. His medical history was significant for several episodes of upper respiratory infection during the previous winter season, and he previously had an adenotonsillectomy several years prior and bilateral ear tubes placed 1 year before presentation. Physical examination showed a mildly tender, nonmobile, left parotid mass near the angle of the mandible with no overlying skin changes or drainage around the mass. There was no lymphadenopathy or other lesions noted in the neck area, and cranial nerve VII was fully intact. Ultrasonography results of the neck showed a left 1.5-cm preauricular nodular mass with internal and marginal vascularity. A neck magnetic resonance imaging study without contrast performed at an outside institution revealed the 1.5-cm heterogeneous intraparotid nodule that was predominantly isotense to glandular tissue on T1 images with vague hypointensity of a small irregular central region, as well as vague hyperintensity on T2 images. He subsequently underwent fine needle aspiration biopsy to assess the lesion, which demonstrated benign-appearing salivary gland tissue and clusters of myoepithelial cells. The mass was continuing to enlarge, and the patient’s pain was increasing in that area, so the decision was made to perform left superficial parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve. Intraoperatively, the left parotid mass was noted to be just below the lower branches of the facial nerve. The excised parotid mass was sent to the pathology department for analysis. Gross examination of the specimen demonstrated a 1.6 × 1.5 × 1.1–cm tan-white, well-circumscribed lesion that was partially surrounded by salivary gland parenchyma (Figure, A).

Four years earlier, he started taking lenalidomide, 10 mg/d (28-day cycle), to treat worsening anemia; after 2 cycles of treatment, he became transfusion independent. Since then, he has remained stable with the same dose and schedule of lenalidomide without significant adverse effects. The presenting skin lesions developed 1 month before presentation and began as small pustules that rapidly transformed into painful ulcers. He was treated with valacyclovir for a presumed diagnosis of shingles, but the lesions did not improve. Because of suspected necrotizing fasciitis, he underwent incision and drainage of the lesions. Cultures from the surgical specimen grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus hemolyticus. However, the lesions continued to worsen despite vancomycin and additional debridement. Thus, he was transferred to our facility. Physical examination showed multiple cutaneous ulcers with gray undermined borders and red papules of varying depths involving the chest, back, and upper extremity; lesions were as large as 9 × 15 cm. A complete blood cell count showed a white blood cell count of 16.2 × 103/μL (to convert to 109/L, multiply by 1.0) with an absolute neutrophil count of 12.7 × 103/μL, hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0), and platelet count of 262 × 103/μL with no circulating blasts. Results of additional laboratory studies, including blood culture and tests for herpes zoster virus (via polymerase chain reaction), antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were all negative. Additionally, the patient also had hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for which he was taking lisinopril and simvastatin, respectively. Pathologic sampling from skin lesions demonstrated a dense dermal infiltrate with predominantly neutrophils along with reactive histiocytes, fibroblasts, and angioplasia (Figure, A). Immunohistochemical staining showed myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils (Figure, B), histiocytic markers (CD43, CD63, CD168), and CD117-positive mast cells, but no immature myeloid precursors.

Her symptoms were initially most prominent while playing sports and were suspected to be due to asthma or seasonal allergies. However, medical management with albuterol, intranasal fluticasone, and cetirizine failed to provide relief. More recently, the patient’s parents noted that she developed stridor while sleeping and while at rest, prompting the family to present for medical attention. Previous workup, including pulmonary function testing, was concerning for an upper airway obstructive process, for which she was referred to otolaryngology. In-office flexible videostroboscopy revealed a mass in the distal cervical trachea that appeared nearly obstructive. Chest radiography confirmed the presence of an approximately 1.5-cm, well-circumscribed soft tissue mass within the cervical trachea. Direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy were performed in the operating room under general anesthesia. This demonstrated an exophytic, pedunculated mass that emanated from the anterior wall of the cervical trachea (Figure 1A and B). The patient was intubated via Seldinger technique to bypass the mass, with a 4.0-mm cuffed endotracheal tube loaded over a 0-degree Hopkins endoscope (Figure 1C). With the airway secured, attention was turned to excision of the mass. Lidocaine, 1%, with epinephrine 1:100 000 was injected in a submucosal plane, and laryngeal scissors were used to excise the attachment of the mass from the tracheal wall. The mass was then resected en bloc and removed with laryngeal cupped forceps.

He ultimately required synchronized cardioversion with a biphasic direct current shock of 100 J. On arrival to the emergency department, his vital signs were stable. Serum electrolyte levels were within normal range and C-reactive protein was less than 6 mg/dL (to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10). High-sensitivity troponin peaked at 1078 pg/mL. His initial 12-lead ECG is shown in Figure 1A. He continued in sinus rhythm with episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia observed on telemetry, as shown in Figure 1B. Cardiac catheterization revealed patent coronary arteries. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was remarkable for a dilated right ventricle with moderately reduced systolic function and transmural late gadolinium enhancement with akinesis and dyskinesis involving the right ventricular (RV) free wall and outflow tract extending to the left ventricular (LV) anterior, septal, and apical segments. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cardiac sarcoidosis", "predict": "\n### Step 1:\nAcute ST-elevation myocardial infarction\n\n### Step 2:\nPulmonary embolism\n\n### Step 3:\nArrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy\n\n### Step 4:\nBrugada syndrome\n\n### Step 5:\nIdiopathic ventricular fibrillation\n\n### Step 6:\nMyocarditis\n\n### Step 7:\nElectrolyte abnormality-induced arrhythmia\n\n### Step 8:\nHypertrrophic cardiomyopathy\n\n### Step 9:\nLong QT syndrome\n\n### Step 10:\nTakotsubo cardiomyopathy\n\n### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:\n\n1.

Five years before this otolaryngology evaluation, the patient developed diffuse skin plaques with erythema and was subsequently diagnosed with hypopigmented cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL, mycosis fungoides type). The patient was treated with a regimen of narrowband UV-B phototherapy and triamcinolone cream, which he has continued for 4 years. Owing to significant worsening of his symptoms 4 months before his evaluation, a biopsy of his cutaneous lesions was performed to rule out progression of CTCL (Figure 1). Physical examination demonstrated large annular plaques with peripheral hyperpigmentation of the body. There were also confluent, indurated pink plaques with slightly raised edges along the forehead, malar eminence, and scalp. The nasal septum demonstrated an inverted V deformity with compromise of the keystone junction. Nasal passages were obstructed with thick mucus and synechiae formation, nearly obstructing the entire nasal passage bilaterally. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Lepromatous leprosy", "predict": "\n### Step 1:\nAllergic rhinitis\n\n### Step 2:\nChronic rhinosinusitis\n\n### Step 3:\nNasal septal deviation\n\n### Step 4:\nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis\n\n### Step 5:\nSarcoidosis\n\n### Step 6:\nLupus\n\n### Step 7:\nMycosis fungoides (cutaneous T-cell lymphoma)\n\n### Step 8:\nLeprosy\n\n### Step 9:\nRhinoscleroma\n\n### Step 10:\nNasal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma\n\n---\n\n**Reranked Differential Diagnoses:**\n\n1.

He had a pink macule on his left cheek at birth, which became raised and discolored around age 3 to 4 weeks. He was diagnosed with a capillary hemangioma, and propranolol was started at age 1 month with progression despite dosage increases. Topical timolol was tried without improvement; oral prednisolone decreased the size of the lesion, but was poorly tolerated and discontinued. An ophthalmic evaluation at an outside hospital was concerning for amblyopia because of anisohypermetropia, greater on the left, and a left esotropia and hypertropia. A magnetic resonance image revealed an orbital mass surrounding the left lateral rectus muscle with mass effect on the globe and extension into the eyelid, pterygopalatine fossa, and cheek. Given the risk of amblyopia, the patient underwent 2 embolization and debulking procedures of the orbital and cheek components of the lesion, which were positive for glucose transporter 1 on pathology. However, the esotropia abruptly worsened after the second debulking. At age 3 years, he presented to the clinic with a persistent cheek and orbit lesion, dense amblyopia, large-angle monocular esotropia and hypertropia, and proptosis of the left eye. The left extraocular muscle showed inability to abduct past midline (Figure 1A).

His medical history comprised unexplained sensory hearing loss, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis. At age 23 years, he had bilateral cataract surgery, and over the last 2 years, he developed worsening stiffness and walking difficulties with frequent falls. He reported features of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome (RLS), visual daytime hallucinations, and rapid cognitive decline. He was given levodopa/benserazide (up to 200 mg/50 mg 4 times daily) without improvement on his Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale scores. Therefore, his dopaminergic medication was ceased. Family history was negative for movement or developmental disorders. His neurologic examination showed hypomimia, symmetrical bradykinesia, and rigidity of the extremities without tremors (Video). There was full range of eye movements with large-amplitude saccadic intrusions on smooth pursuit in all directions. Neuropsychological assessment revealed significant abnormalities in cognitive functioning, affecting verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills (ie, speed of information processing, visuospatial skills, verbal and visual memory loss, executive skills). Mini-Mental Status Examination score was 26 of 30 points. Systemic examination was unremarkable.

When playing video games at a distance or when reading, she developed oscillopsia with eyestrain and noted that her right eye turned up and in. She had undergone strabismus surgery for crossed eyes as a young child and more recently had laser in situ keratomileusis performed. She was medically healthy and neurodevelopmentally normal but had been born 4½ weeks premature. There was no family history of strabismus, and she denied diplopia. On examination, corrected visual acuity was 20/30 − 2 OD and 20/15 OS. Both pupils reacted briskly to light with no afferent pupillary defect. She had 1+ apparent overaction of the right inferior oblique and superior rectus muscles. When she was inattentive, her eyes appeared to be straight (Figure 1). Prism and alternate cover testing during near fixation showed a right esotropia and dissociated vertical divergence when fixing with her preferred left eye (Figure 1, left inset) and a larger left esotropia during forced fixation with her right eye (Figure 1, right inset). She had no cycloplegic refractive error, and retinal examination showed no objective torsion.

She was born in 1973 at 38th week of gestation followed by a normal delivery (weight, 3.15 kg and head circumference, 42 cm) to nonconsanguineous parents. The head size was normal at birth, and no other abnormalities were seen during her infancy. At age 2 years, her parents noticed that she had delayed motor and language milestones. She experienced a progressive developmental delay such as reduction of head growth, loss of acquired communication, and loss of motor functions between ages 9 and 12 years. The severity of scoliosis increased with age, and she became a wheelchair user at age 18 years. She was referred to us at age 40 years with the characteristic features of growth deceleration (height, 142 cm; weight, 22 kg; body mass index, 11 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]), apraxia, left-sided hemiplegia, spasticity, sleep apnea, constipation, osteoporosis, hypoalgesia, and repetitive hand tapping (Video).

Multiple prior office visits with referring ophthalmologists during which eyes were dilated showed normal results. Clinical examination revealed 180° of left interior subconjunctival hemorrhage with overlying conjunctival elevation and mild fullness of the left lower eyelid (Figure 1A). Fixation was central, steady, and maintained bilaterally, with full ocular motility and absence of appreciable proptosis. Penlight anterior segment examination demonstrated normally formed anterior segment structures without inflammation or hyphema in either eye, although the left eye exhibited a small intraocular lightly pigmented lesion at the 5-o'clock limbus. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) was deemed appropriate and further demonstrated normal intraocular pressures bilaterally. Handheld slitlamp examination localized the left eye 2-mm limbal lesion on the posterior corneal surface. The surrounding corneal and iris structures were normal appearing without evidence of vascularization. Ultrasound biomicroscopy was used to further evaluate both the intraocular lesion and better characterize the left lower eyelid fullness.

His primary care physician initially obtained an ultrasonographic image, which demonstrated a left, level 2 lymph node measuring 4.0 × 1.5 × 2.8 cm. The patient then underwent several courses of antibiotic treatment, but the mass persisted. After a period of conservative management, he developed a sore throat and fever. He subsequently underwent a computed tomographic scan of the neck and chest with contrast, which demonstrated an isolated, enlarged, homogenously enhancing left-neck level 2B lymph node measuring 3.4 × 2.8 × 2.1 cm (Figure 1A). When he presented to our facility, he was found to have an asymptomatically enlarged left level 2/5A neck mass that was nontender and fixed. The patient had an unremarkable medical, surgical, and social history and no known infectious exposures. A white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level were both elevated, at 11 310 cells/μL (to convert to cells × 109 per liter, multiply by 0.001) and 56.2 mg/L (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 9.524), respectively.

An ultrasonography-guided needle biopsy was performed. Fine-needle aspiration and flow cytometry had negative results for lymphoproliferative disorders or a malignant condition. A tissue culture had negative results. Given the inconclusive diagnosis, the patient underwent a left neck dissection of levels 2A, 2B, and 5A.

Since his diagnosis, he had been adherent to use of nightly continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). However, he had persistent daytime fatigue and morning headaches. Several months before presentation, the patient noticed that his bite changed from an overbite to an underbite (Figure, A), which had been attributed to dental malocclusion from his CPAP machine. Examination findings of the oropharynx showed an oropharynx score of a Mallampati 4, with 3-plus tonsils and macroglossia without scalloping of the tongue (Figure, B). Nasopharyngolaryngoscopic examination findings showed that the tonsils did not approximate at midline, with a narrow anterior-to-posterior dimension of the airway owing to macroglossia and no retrognathia.

The patient had a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome with insulin resistance and a migraine disorder and reported experiencing 1 to 2 migraine episodes per week since early high school. She believed that the neck mass made these episodes worse than normal. The patient was otherwise previously healthy until she developed an upper respiratory infection. Her physician noted visible swelling in the right neck and clinically interpreted the finding as enlarged lymph nodes associated with the infection. After 2 weeks, the neck swelling persisted despite the resolution of other symptoms. She was subsequently treated with a course of antibiotics, which did not result in any improvement. The mass slowly enlarged over the next 6 months. The patient reported new symptoms, including waxing and waning pain that radiated to the back of her neck, headaches, and intermittent dysphagia. She also noted periods during which the mass would fluctuate in size. Otolaryngologic examination findings were within normal limits except for a single, nontender, compressible right neck mass deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and extending into level V.

Let’s think step by step.\n### INPUT:\nA 20-year-old woman was referred by her family physician to a community mental health team in London, United Kingdom. Her mental state had deteriorated progressively over the previous 12 months, following the death of her father. After a period living alone, she had returned to the family home 4 months prior to her presentation and had been noted to be socially withdrawn, preoccupied, and distractible. Her family physician, suspecting a depressive episode, had prescribed citalopram up to a dosage of 40 mg once daily, to no effect. Her family subsequently sought advice from the family physician when the patient was noted to be speaking to herself, expressing concerns about people meaning her harm, and professing the belief that she could hear other peoples’ thoughts. The patient had been born in Sierra Leone after a complicated delivery and had traveled to the United Kingdom as a child with her family, who were fleeing from a civil war. On arrival in the United Kingdom, her family claimed asylum and moved into a small apartment in a high-rise building in central London. Although there was no reported developmental delay, she had struggled academically at school and was bullied for having overweight. She left school without qualifications at age 16 years and worked as a shop assistant. She left this job about a year prior to her referral to psychiatry after a period of sick leave following the death of her father. She was a nonsmoker, did not drink alcohol, and denied illicit drug use. A paternal relative was reported to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia. There was no comorbid physical illness. On review, the patient was kempt and had overweight. Eye contact was fleeting, and she presented as anxious, with a degree of psychomotor agitation. Her speech was normal in rate, volume, and tone, although tangential. There was no other evidence of thought disorder. She denied feeling low in mood or suicidal and was objectively euthymic. There was some sleep disturbance, with the patient reporting being fearful to go to sleep owing to persecutory beliefs regarding her neighbors. She reflected that over the preceding few months, she had experienced a sensation of detachment from her immediate environment, as though it was not real, making her world similar to that of a video game. She reported that in the apartment where she had previously been living, she had realized that something was amiss and had become convinced that the door number of her neighbor’s flat, number 6, signified that they meant her harm. She explained this was because 6 was associated with the number of the devil. She reported hearing her neighbors commenting negatively about her appearance. These distressing experiences prompted her to return to her family home, but she continued to hear her neighbors’ voices making derogatory comments about her appearance and began to hear them commenting on her actions and thoughts in the third person as well. On returning home, her paranoia regarding her previous neighbors worsened, resulting in her rarely leaving the house. The volume and frequency of derogatory auditory hallucinations also worsened, and she reported hearing the thoughts of others as well. There was a degree of insight, and although the patient was convinced of the reality of her experiences, she also saw the stress of losing her father as associated with her experiences and was accepting of input from mental health services. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Schizophrenia", "predict": "\n### Differential Diagnosis Steps:\n\n1.

The patient had been experiencing redness, tearing, and foreign-body sensation in both eyes for 7 months. She was diagnosed with giant papillary conjunctivitis and follicular conjunctivitis by ophthalmologists at other institutions and was treated with topical corticosteroids and oral doxycycline. Topical corticosteroid eyedrops (0.5% loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension) seemed to control her symptoms, but attempts to wean the medication resulted in recurrence. She denied any significant ocular history. Her medical history included hypothyroidism and breast cancer in the setting of Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic disorder with a predisposition to various cancers, including carcinoma of the colon, breast, and uterus. At the time of examination, visual acuity was 20/25 OU. Pupil anatomy, intraocular pressure, confrontation visual fields, and extraocular movements were within normal limits. Slitlamp examination revealed mild meibomian gland dysfunction bilaterally, and follicular conjunctivitis was evident on eversion of all 4 eyelids. The bulbar conjunctiva demonstrated hyperemia and elevation medially (Figure 1). The remainder of the examination, including dilated funduscopic examination, was within normal limits. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Benign lymphoid hyperplasia", "predict": "\n### Step 1:\nAllergic conjunctivitis\n\n### Step 2:\nBlepharitis\n\n### Step 3:\nGiant papillary conjunctivitis\n\n### Step 4:\nChlamydial conjunctivitis\n\n### Step 5:\nMedication-induced conjunctivitis\n\n### Step 6:\nOcular surface squamous neoplasia\n\n### Step 7:\nSeborrheic dermatitis\n\n### Step 8:\nConjunctival lymphoma\n\n### Step 9:\nSarcoidosis\n\n### Step 10:\nOcular cicatricial pemphigoid\n\n### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:\n\n1.

The patient’s salivary duct carcinoma was androgen receptor positive and HER2 positive. He had previously undergone parotidectomy followed by radiation therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and trastuzumab. He had continued with androgen-deprivation therapy and palliative radiation therapy for osseous metastases. The patient endorsed erythematous skin changes within the field of radiation and a 2-month history of painful right upper extremity lymphedema that began after his most recent radiation treatment. He denied fevers or other systemic symptoms associated with the onset of the skin lesions. Physical examination revealed numerous nontender, firm, pebblelike, pink papules on the right anterior neck, upper chest, and back, arising on a background of confluent blanchable violaceous erythema (Figure, A), as well as similar-appearing lesions on the right chest wall on a background of normal-appearing skin.

The patient reported a history of a local burn from hot food but denied any history of trauma, foreign body, or piercing. He was evaluated, given a presumptive diagnosis of sialadenitis, and discharged home with ibuprofen and clindamycin. He returned several days later with worsening tongue swelling, voice change, and subjective fever. Postcontrast axial computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a midline lesion within the oral tongue that was predominantly hypodense and demonstrated rim enhancement. No calcifications were seen within the lesion (Figure, A). The lesion was predominantly isointense to muscle on axial T1-weighted images without intravenous (IV) contrast (Figure, B). Axial T2-weighted images with fat saturation showed predominantly hyperintense signal relative to muscle as well as punctate internal foci of T2 hypointensity (not shown). The lesion was hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging (Figure, C) and hypointense on the apparent diffusion coefficient map (not shown). Sagittal T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with IV contrast and fat suppression demonstrated signal hypointense to muscle centrally with peripheral enhancement (Figure, D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Abscess", "predict": "\n### Step 1:\nAngioedema\n\n### Step 2:\nAllergic reaction\n\n### Step 3:\nSialadenitis\n\n### Step 4:\nAbscess\n\n### Step 5:\nEpidermoid cyst\n\n### Step 6:\nLymphangioma\n\n### Step 7:\nHemangioma\n\n### Step 8:\nSquamous cell carcinoma\n\n### Step 9:\nGranular cell tumor\n\n### Step 10:\nLymphoma\n\n### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:\n\n1.

Four months ago, he was treated for presumed pneumonia with azithromycin without improvement. He did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use intravenous drugs. He was born in the United States and had not traveled outside of the country. He took no medications. On examination, his temperature was 37°C, heart rate 110/min, blood pressure 123/72 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 20/min. He had a palpable 2×2-cm firm, nontender, right supraclavicular lymph node and decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion in the right lower lung field. No hepatosplenomegaly or leg edema was noted. Routine laboratory tests, including complete blood cell counts, renal function, electrolytes, and hepatic function, were within normal limits. A chest x-ray demonstrated diffuse homogeneous opacification of the right lung field.
