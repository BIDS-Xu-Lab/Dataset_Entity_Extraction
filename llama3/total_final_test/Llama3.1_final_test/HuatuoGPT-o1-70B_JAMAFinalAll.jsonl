He had no known ocular history. At presentation, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/100 OD and 20/50 OS. Intraocular pressures were normal bilaterally and pupils were equally reactive. Examination of the right eye was unremarkable except for moderate cataract. The left-eye slitlamp examination was remarkable for a shallow but quiet anterior chamber and moderate cataract. Dilated fundus examination of the left eye revealed shallow peripheral serous choroidal detachments, bullous inferior macula-involving retinal detachment with shifting fluid, and diffuse hyperpigmented lesions involving the macula and superior fundus that corresponded to areas of nodular retinal pigment epithelium thickening on optical coherence tomography (Figure 1). These hyperpigmented lesions were associated with hyperautofluorescence and blockage on fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography. No retinal breaks were seen on scleral depressed examination. Ultrasound biomicroscopy demonstrated 360° ciliochoroidal effusion. Axial length was 24.30 mm OD and 24.32 mm OS. The patient denied a history of known refractive error. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Idiopathic uveal effusion syndrome", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 77-year-old man who's been dealing with vision problems in his left eye for a few months now. He's got a history of hypertension and asthma, which could be relevant. His vision in that eye has been getting worse, and now it's 20/100. That's pretty significant. The right eye is doing better at 20/50, so it's mostly the left eye that's the issue here.\n\nOkay, so what's going on in that left eye? The anterior chamber is shallow, but it's quiet, so no obvious inflammation. And there's a moderate cataract, but that's not the main problem. The big thing is the retina. There's a bullous retinal detachment with shifting fluid. That's interesting because it suggests something is pushing the retina out of place, but there aren't any retinal breaks. So, it's not a typical rhegmatogenous detachment.\n\nNow, let's think about those hyperpigmented lesions. They're in the macula and the superior part of the fundus. They show hyperautofluorescence and blockage on angiography. That sounds like they could be related to the retinal pigment epithelium, maybe some kind of atrophy or metaplasia. Hmm, this is starting to sound like a condition that affects the RPE.\n\nThe ultrasound shows 360° ciliochoroidal effusion. That's a big clue. It suggests that there's fluid accumulating in the choroid, which could be causing the detachment. This kind of effusion is often seen in conditions like uveal effusion syndrome or maybe even central serous chorioretinopathy. But the presence of those pigmented lesions is making me think more about a chronic condition.\n\nLet's consider the possibility of age-related macular degeneration. The patient's age fits, and the pigmented lesions could be related to drusen or RPE changes. But, AMD usually doesn't cause a bullous detachment like this without other signs, so maybe that's not it.\n\nWhat about uveal effusion syndrome? It can cause choroidal effusion and secondary retinal detachment, especially in middle-aged or older men. The shallow anterior chamber and the 360° effusion fit this diagnosis. But, the pigmented lesions aren't as typical for uveal effusion syndrome. Hmm, I'm not sure if this is the right fit.\n\nLet's think about other conditions. Could it be central serous chorioretinopathy? It causes serous retinal detachments, but it's more common in younger individuals and usually resolves on its own. This case seems more chronic, so maybe not.\n\nWhat about a choroidal tumor? Something like a choroidal melanoma could cause a bullous detachment and those pigmented lesions. But, there's no mention of a mass on the ultrasound, so that seems less likely.\n\nOkay, let's go back to the idea of age-related macular degeneration. The patient's age and the pigmented lesions fit. Maybe the bullous detachment is just an unusual presentation of AMD. That could make sense.\n\nBut wait, let's not forget about uveal effusion syndrome. The 360° ciliochoroidal effusion is a strong indicator. Maybe the pigmented lesions are just a secondary change from the chronic detachment. That could be it.\n\nAfter thinking it through, I'm leaning towards uveal effusion syndrome. It explains the effusion and the detachment, and the pigmented lesions could be secondary changes. Yeah, that seems to fit the best.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the condition affecting the patient's left eye:\n\n1. **Uveal Effusion Syndrome** - This condition is characterized by choroidal effusion and secondary retinal detachment, which aligns with the findings of 360° ciliochoroidal effusion and bullous retinal detachment.\n\n2. **Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)** - The patient's age and the presence of hyperpigmented lesions are consistent with AMD, but the bullous detachment is atypical.\n\n3. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy** - This condition causes serous retinal detachments but is more common in younger individuals and typically resolves on its own, making it less likely in this chronic case.\n\n4. **Choroidal Melanoma** - Could cause a bullous detachment and pigmented lesions, but the absence of a mass on ultrasound makes this less likely.\n\n5. **Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy** - Similar to AMD, it can cause pigmented lesions and retinal detachment, but specific angiographic findings are needed to confirm.\n\n6. **Retinal Pigment Epithelium Detachment** - Could contribute to the retinal detachment, but the extent of the findings suggests a more systemic condition.\n\n7. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease** - An inflammatory condition that can cause choroidal effusion and retinal detachment, but typically involves other systemic symptoms.\n\n8. **Posterior Scleritis** - Can cause choroidal effusion and retinal detachment, but is often associated with inflammation and other symptoms.\n\n9. **Choroidal Hemangioma** - A vascular tumor that can cause retinal detachment, but usually has distinct angiographic features.\n\n10. **Congenital Choroidal Disease** - Unlikely given the patient's age and the chronic progression of symptoms.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Uveal Effusion Syndrome** is the most likely diagnosis, as it best explains the combination of choroidal effusion, retinal detachment, and the patient's demographic profile. The pigmented lesions could be secondary changes due to chronic detachment.", "topic": "['Retinal Disorders', 'Ophthalmic Imaging', 'Ophthalmology', 'Macular Diseases']"}

The patient reported experiencing tightness and discomfort in the left side of the neck but denied experiencing any pain. He denied any recent incidents of neck trauma or impact. Furthermore, his medical history did not reveal any previous hematological disorders. The ultrasonography examination detected the presence of a well-defined, solid mass located in the left lobe of the thyroid gland. The mass exhibited regular shape, distinct boundaries, heterogeneous echogenicity, and observable blood flow signals. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck detected heterogeneous density mass shadows within the soft tissue region near the left lobe of the thyroid, exhibiting distinct boundaries measuring 53 × 41 × 88 mm. Subsequent enhanced CT did not reveal notable enhancement of the cystic components of the mass (Figure 1). Due to persistent symptoms, the patient expressed a desire for surgical resection. Consequently, the patient underwent open surgery to remove the mass, aiming to establish a definitive diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Vagal schwannoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 23-year-old guy with a big neck tumor that just popped up out of nowhere in 10 days. That's pretty fast. He's feeling some tightness and discomfort, but no pain, which is interesting. No recent trauma or blood disorders in his history, so we can probably rule out a hematoma from an injury.\n\nFirst off, the fact that it's solid and has blood flow signals makes me think it's not just a simple cyst. It's got some complexity to it. So, what could grow this quickly? Anaplastic thyroid cancer comes to mind because it's known for being aggressive and growing fast. But, let's not jump to conclusions just yet.\n\nNow, what about other possibilities? A thyroid nodule could be the culprit. Those can be solid and have varied appearances on ultrasound. They might not always be cancerous, but we can't ignore the chance of malignancy.\n\nHmm, how about a thyroid adenoma? Those are usually benign, but they can grow quickly too. They'd show blood flow on ultrasound, so that fits. But, would they grow this big, this fast? Maybe, but let's keep looking.\n\nSubacute thyroiditis could be another option. It causes inflammation and can make the thyroid area tender. But, this guy didn't mention any pain or tenderness, so that seems less likely.\n\nOh, and there's the possibility of a paraganglioma. Those are neuroendocrine tumors that can appear in the neck and have a rich blood supply, which matches the blood flow we're seeing. They're not super common, but they could fit the bill.\n\nLet's not forget about lymphoma. It can present as a rapidly growing neck mass, especially if there's lymph node involvement. But, we don't have any info on lymph nodes here, so it's hard to say.\n\nWhat about a branchial cleft cyst? Those can appear suddenly if they get infected or inflamed. They're usually cystic, but maybe this one has a solid component? It's a stretch, but let's keep it in mind.\n\nNow, considering all this, anaplastic thyroid cancer is still high on the list because of the rapid growth. But, we should also think about medullary thyroid carcinoma. It's less common, but it can grow quickly and has a distinct appearance on imaging.\n\nAnd then there's follicular thyroid carcinoma. It can present as a solid mass with irregular features, but it's not usually this fast-growing. Still, it's worth considering.\n\nLastly, let's think about a Hurthle cell tumor. These can appear as solid masses in the thyroid and have a varied appearance on ultrasound. They might not be the first thing that comes to mind, but they fit some of the characteristics we're seeing.\n\nSo, after going through all this, here's my ranked list of possibilities: anaplastic thyroid cancer, medullary thyroid carcinoma, paraganglioma, follicular thyroid carcinoma, Hurthle cell tumor, thyroid adenoma, thyroid nodule, lymphoma, branchial cleft cyst, and subacute thyroiditis. That seems to cover all the bases.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the neck mass in the 23-year-old male patient:\n\n1. **Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer** - Known for rapid growth and aggressive behavior.\n2. **Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma** - Can grow quickly and has distinct imaging features.\n3. **Paraganglioma** - Neuroendocrine tumor with rich blood supply, matching the ultrasound findings.\n4. **Follicular Thyroid Carcinoma** - Presents as a solid mass, though not typically this fast-growing.\n5. **Hurthle Cell Tumor** - Can appear as a solid mass with varied ultrasound characteristics.\n6. **Thyroid Adenoma** - Usually benign, but can grow quickly and show blood flow on ultrasound.\n7. **Thyroid Nodule** - Solid with varied appearances; may have malignant potential.\n8. **Lymphoma** - Can present as a rapidly growing neck mass, especially with lymph node involvement.\n9. **Branchial Cleft Cyst** - Typically cystic, but could appear solid if inflamed or infected.\n10. **Subacute Thyroiditis** - Causes inflammation, though usually painful, which this patient denies.\n\nThese possibilities are ranked based on the rapid growth, solid nature, and blood flow characteristics of the mass, as well as the patient's age and symptoms. Anaplastic thyroid cancer and medullary thyroid carcinoma are high on the list due to their potential for rapid growth and aggressive behavior.

He reported a 5-week history of a skin lesion on the right anterior thigh with intermittent itching and mild tenderness to palpation. There was no preceding trauma to the area. The lesion was stable in size. He denied systemic symptoms of fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, and dyspnea on exertion. He was unhoused and sleeping on the streets with his dog prior to hospitalization. Physical examination was remarkable for a 5-cm erythematous plaque studded with papules and pustules (Figure 1A). No pus or granules could be expressed with pressure. The patient had no similar skin lesions elsewhere on the body. A 6-mm punch biopsy was obtained from the lesion. One half was sent for routine histopathology with special stains, and the other half was submitted for bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial culture (Figure 1B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Deep dermatophytosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 5-cm erythematous plaque on the thigh with papules and pustules. It's been there for about 5 weeks, and it's itchy and a bit tender. No fever or other systemic symptoms, which is interesting. The patient is also homeless and has been sleeping on the streets with his dog. That's a unique factor to consider.\n\nFirst, let's think about common skin conditions. Eczema or dermatitis could be a possibility. It's often itchy and can have papules, but usually, it's not just a single plaque. Still, it's worth considering.\n\nNext, I'm thinking about infections. The fact that it's a single lesion and the patient's living situation makes me think of something like cutaneous tuberculosis. It's not common, but it's possible, especially with the right exposure history.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about fungal infections. Tinea corporis, or ringworm, could present with a single erythematous plaque. It's usually scaly, but it's worth considering, especially since it's relatively common.\n\nNow, what about bacterial infections? Folliculitis or even a staphylococcal infection could cause pustules. But, there's no pus or drainage, which makes me think it's less likely.\n\nHmm, the patient's exposure to his dog is interesting. Could it be something zoonotic? Like, maybe a parasite or a fungal infection from the dog? That's a possibility.\n\nLet's think about other granulomatous diseases. Sarcoidosis could present with skin lesions, but it's usually more widespread and comes with other symptoms. Still, it's something to keep in mind.\n\nOh, and what about leprosy? It's rare, but the patient's living conditions could have put him at risk. It can present with hypopigmented patches, but also erythematous ones. It's a long shot, but let's not rule it out.\n\nNow, let's consider lupus vulgaris. It's a form of cutaneous tuberculosis, and it fits the description of a chronic, erythematous plaque. Plus, the patient's situation makes exposure to TB more likely.\n\nWait, let's not forget about other types of folliculitis. Pseudofolliculitis barbae could cause papules and pustules, but it's usually in areas with curly hair. Still, it's worth considering.\n\nFinally, let's think about chromoblastomycosis. It's a chronic fungal infection that can cause nodules and papules. It's rare, but the patient's environment could have exposed him to it.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think lupus vulgaris is the most likely diagnosis. It fits the chronic nature of the lesion, the patient's symptoms, and his exposure history. But, we should still consider other possibilities like eczema, tinea corporis, and chromoblastomycosis, just in case.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the skin lesion on the patient's thigh, considering the unique aspects of the case:\n\n1. **Eczema (Dermatitis)**: This is a common skin condition that can present with itchy erythematous plaques and papules, although it typically involves more than one lesion.\n\n2. **Cutaneous Tuberculosis (Lupus Vulgaris)**: Given the patient's living conditions and the chronic nature of the lesion, this is a strong consideration. It often presents as a slowly developing erythematous plaque.\n\n3. **Tinea Corporis (Ringworm)**: A fungal infection that can cause erythematous plaques, usually with scaling. It's common and should be considered, especially with the patient's exposure to the environment.\n\n4. **Folliculitis**: Bacterial or fungal infection of the hair follicles, which can cause papules and pustules. However, the absence of pus makes this less likely.\n\n5. **Zoonotic Infection**: Considering the patient's close contact with his dog, a zoonotic infection like cheyletiellosis could be possible, causing itchy papules.\n\n6. **Sarcoidosis**: A systemic granulomatous disease that can present with skin lesions, although it's usually more widespread and accompanied by other symptoms.\n\n7. **Leprosy**: Although rare, the patient's living conditions could have exposed him to this. It can present with chronic skin lesions, including erythematous ones.\n\n8. **Pseudofolliculitis Barbae**: Typically occurs in areas with curly hair, causing papules and pustules due to ingrown hairs. It's less likely here but worth considering.\n\n9. **Chromoblastomycosis**: A chronic fungal infection causing nodules and papules, more common in tropical environments. The patient's exposure history makes this a possibility.\n\n10. **Majocchi's Granuloma**: A deep fungal infection that can cause erythematous plaques and papules, especially in immunocompromised individuals or those with significant environmental exposure.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Lupus Vulgaris (Cutaneous Tuberculosis)** emerges as the most likely diagnosis due to the chronic nature of the lesion, the patient's symptoms, and his potential exposure history. However, **Tinea Corporis** and **Chromoblastomycosis** should also be considered given the environmental factors and the lesion's characteristics.

Visual acuity with correction was 20/40 in the right eye and 20/30 in the left eye. Intraocular pressure was 14 mm Hg in the right eye and 16 mm Hg in the left eye. Anterior segment examination results were within normal limits for the left eye, and dilated fundus examination results for both eyes did not reveal concerning pathology. The conjunctiva of the right eye was notable for a small elevated pigmented lesion measuring approximately 2 × 2 mm with sentinel vessels (Figure 1A). Fundus photographs and autofluorescence (Figure 1B) as well as optical coherence tomography (OCT) were normal bilaterally. An anterior-segment OCT was performed and revealed a small elevated subepithelial lesion with shadowing vs possible scleral extension (Figure 1B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Ciliary body melanoma with extrascleral extension masquerading as a conjunctival nevus", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 74-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer, and she's got this conjunctival lesion in her right eye. It's been there for 18 years, which is a really long time, so it's probably benign, right? But we can't ignore it, especially with her cancer history.\n\nFirst, let's consider the obvious. A nevus is a common benign lesion, and they're usually stable over time, just like this one. So, that's a strong possibility.\n\nBut wait, there's more to think about. The lesion is pigmented and has sentinel vessels. Sentinel vessels can be a sign of something more serious, like a malignant lesion. So, melanoma has to be on our radar.\n\nNow, let's not forget about other possibilities. Primary acquired melanosis is another one. It's often found in older adults and can be a precursor to melanoma, so it's worth considering.\n\nOh, and there's squamous cell carcinoma. It's a common malignant tumor of the conjunctiva, and it can have a variety of appearances. We shouldn't rule it out just yet.\n\nHmm, what about sebaceous gland carcinoma? It's not as common, but it can present with a pigmented lesion and has to be considered, especially with her history.\n\nLet's think about the imaging results. The anterior-segment OCT shows a small elevated subepithelial lesion with shadowing. This could mean scleral extension, which is concerning. This makes me think more about melanoma or something invasive.\n\nBut, we can't jump to conclusions. We need to consider all the possibilities. How about a pyogenic granuloma? It's usually more vascular and can occur after irritation or surgery, but it's still a possibility.\n\nAnd then there's a hemangioma. It's a benign vascular tumor, and while it's less likely, it's not impossible.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about metastatic tumors. Given her breast cancer history, we can't ignore the possibility of a metastatic lesion in the conjunctiva.\n\nSo, putting it all together, here's what I'm thinking. The top differential diagnosis is conjunctival melanoma, given the pigmented nature and sentinel vessels. Next is primary acquired melanosis, as it's common in older adults and can be a precursor to melanoma. Then there's squamous cell carcinoma, which is a common malignant tumor. Sebaceous gland carcinoma is also on the list, given its potential presentation. Rounding out the top five is metastatic tumor, considering her history of breast cancer. The others, like nevus, pyogenic granuloma, and hemangioma, are less likely but still possible.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the conjunctival lesion in the right eye of the 74-year-old woman:\n\n1. **Conjunctival Melanoma** - Given the pigmented nature of the lesion and the presence of sentinel vessels, melanoma is a strong consideration.\n\n2. **Primary Acquired Melanosis** - Common in older adults and can be a precursor to melanoma, making it a relevant differential.\n\n3. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - A common malignant tumor of the conjunctiva that should be considered due to its varied presentations.\n\n4. **Sebaceous Gland Carcinoma** - Although less common, it can present with pigmented lesions and is important to consider, especially with her history.\n\n5. **Metastatic Tumor** - Given her history of breast cancer, the possibility of a metastatic lesion in the conjunctiva cannot be ignored.\n\n6. **Nevus** - A benign lesion that is stable over time, which aligns with the 18-year history of the lesion.\n\n7. **Pyogenic Granuloma** - Usually more vascular and associated with irritation or surgery, but still a possibility.\n\n8. **Hemangioma** - A benign vascular tumor that, while less likely, should not be entirely ruled out.\n\n9. **Keratoacanthoma** - A benign lesion that can appear similar to malignant tumors and should be considered.\n\n10. **Papilloma** - A benign lesion that, although less likely given the features, could still be a possibility.\n\nThese differentials are ranked based on the combination of clinical features, patient history, and the results of the imaging studies. Conjunctival melanoma and primary acquired melanosis are prioritized due to the pigmented nature and sentinel vessels, while metastatic tumor and sebaceous gland carcinoma are considered due to her cancer history and the potential for aggressive behavior.

We've got a 52-year-old woman who's having trouble seeing out of both eyes. She was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and her blood sugar control was pretty bad at first, but it's gotten a lot better. Her vision is really blurry, and the doctor found some issues in her retina like hemorrhages and hard exudates. These are classic signs of diabetic retinopathy. \n\nNow, let's consider what's going on. Diabetic retinopathy is a big possibility here because of her diabetes. The fact that she has microaneurysms and retinal edema really points to that. But wait, could there be something else? Diabetic retinopathy is the most obvious, but let's not jump to conclusions just yet. \n\nWhat about other conditions that could cause similar symptoms? Macular degeneration comes to mind. It can cause vision loss and has some similar retinal changes, but it's usually age-related and doesn't quite fit her age group. Still, it's worth considering. \n\nThere's also hypertensive retinopathy. High blood pressure can cause retinal hemorrhages and exudates too. We don't have her blood pressure readings, so we can't rule this out entirely. \n\nOh, and what about retinal vein occlusion? That can cause sudden vision loss and retinal hemorrhages. But usually, it's more sudden and doesn't quite match the gradual progression here. \n\nNow, let's think about the treatments she's had. She's been given bevacizumab and aflibercept, which are anti-VEGF drugs. They're supposed to help with macular edema, but they haven't worked very well for her. This makes me wonder if we're dealing with something a bit unusual or resistant to treatment. \n\nCould it be a case of persistent diabetic macular edema? That's possible, especially since her diabetes control has improved a lot. But the lack of response to treatment is odd. \n\nMaybe we should consider other vascular causes, like Eale's disease. It's a rare condition that can cause retinal changes similar to diabetic retinopathy, especially in young adults, but it's not impossible in someone her age. \n\nLet's not forget about anemia. She has a low hemoglobin level, which could be contributing to her retinal issues. Anemia can cause retinal hemorrhages and vision problems. \n\nSo, where does that leave us? Diabetic retinopathy is still the most likely cause, but we should also think about hypertensive retinopathy, Eale's disease, and anemia as possible contributors. Each of these conditions could explain some of the symptoms and the lack of response to treatment. \n\nIn the end, it seems like diabetic retinopathy with macular edema is the main issue, but we can't ignore the potential impact of anemia and maybe even hypertensive retinopathy.

She experienced fulminant hepatic failure 3 months ago and underwent a liver transplant 2 weeks later. Postoperative pathological results showed hepatolenticular degeneration. Routine prophylactic antiherpes virus therapy had been applied for 2 weeks. Immunosuppressants, including tacrolimus and mycophenolate sodium, were applied for subsequent maintenance therapy. She noticed the onset of decreased vision in both eyes about 2 months after the liver transplant. Diagnosed with ocular herpes virus infection, she was given systemic valaciclovir and ocular laser retinopexy around areas of necrosis. Her vision was not improved and twice intravitreous injection of ganciclovir was added. However, vision was decreasing continuously. At her presentation to our clinic, the best-corrected visual acuity was finger count in the right eye and 20/125 in the left eye. On slitlamp examination of both eyes, 1+ aqueous cells and 1+ flare were presented in the anterior chamber, while the dilated fundus examination showed mild inflammation in the vitreous. Extensive patches of yellowish necrotic lesions were seen at the peripheral retina of the right eye and 1 triangular necrotic lesion in the posterior pole (Figure 1A). A large annular necrosis was found in the peripheral retina of the left eye (Figure 1B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Toxoplasma retinochoroiditis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 31-year-old woman who's been dealing with blurry vision in both eyes for about a month. That's quite a while to be dealing with blurry vision. She had a pretty serious health issue a few months back—fulminant hepatic failure—and even needed a liver transplant. That's a big deal. The liver transplant was complicated, showing something called hepatolenticular degeneration. I wonder if that's related to her current vision problems.\n\nNow, she's on some heavy-duty medications to prevent rejection of the transplant, like tacrolimus and mycophenolate sodium. These drugs can have some side effects, so maybe they're playing a role here. Oh, and she was also on antiherpes virus medication, valaciclovir, because they thought she had a herpes virus infection in her eyes. But even with the treatment, her vision didn't get better. That's concerning.\n\nShe even had laser treatment and injections of ganciclovir directly into her eyes, but no luck. Her vision kept getting worse. That's really puzzling. When she came to our clinic, her vision was really poor—she could only count fingers with her right eye and had 20/125 vision in her left. That's a significant visual impairment.\n\nDuring the eye exam, there were signs of inflammation in both eyes, with aqueous cells and flare in the anterior chamber. The vitreous also showed some inflammation. And then there were these yellowish necrotic lesions in her retinas. In the right eye, they were all over the peripheral retina, and there was a triangular lesion in the posterior pole. The left eye had a large annular necrosis in the periphery. That sounds like a pretty severe retinal issue.\n\nSo, what could be causing this? Initially, I thought about acute retinal necrosis syndrome, which is often linked to herpes virus infections. But the fact that she didn't respond to the antiviral treatments makes me question that. Hmm, could it be something else?\n\nMaybe it's a different viral infection, like cytomegalovirus retinitis. That's common in people with compromised immune systems, like someone who's just had a transplant. The meds she's on suppress her immune system, so that could be a possibility.\n\nBut wait, there's also the chance of medication toxicity. Tacrolimus and mycophenolate can have ocular side effects. Could they be contributing to her retinal issues? It's worth considering.\n\nOh, and what about autoimmune reactions? Posterior uveitis or other inflammatory conditions could be causing the necrosis and inflammation. It's possible that her body is reacting to the transplant or the medications.\n\nI should also think about other infections, like fungal infections. People with weakened immune systems can be susceptible to those. Candida or Aspergillus could cause similar retinal lesions.\n\nAnd then there's the possibility of a synergistic effect. Maybe it's not just one thing, but a combination of the herpes virus, the immunosuppressive meds, and her compromised immune system all working together to cause this.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Based on everything, I think the top differential diagnosis is still acute retinal necrosis syndrome, likely due to herpes virus. But I'm also considering cytomegalovirus retinitis and medication toxicity as strong possibilities. Fungal infections and autoimmune reactions are also on the list, given her situation. It's a complex case, and we need to consider all angles.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, considering her complex medical history and treatment:\n\n1. **Acute Retinal Necrosis Syndrome** - This is a strong initial consideration given the retinal necrosis and inflammation, often associated with herpes virus infections.\n\n2. **Cytomegalovirus Retinitis** - This is a possibility due to the patient's immunosuppressed state post-transplant, which increases susceptibility to CMV infections.\n\n3. **Medication Toxicity** - The use of tacrolimus and mycophenolate sodium could potentially contribute to retinal toxicity or exacerbate existing conditions.\n\n4. **Fungal Endophthalmitis** - Given the patient's immunocompromised status, fungal infections like Candida or Aspergillus could cause similar retinal lesions.\n\n5. **Autoimmune Posterior Uveitis** - An autoimmune reaction could be causing the inflammation and necrosis, especially in the context of her recent transplant and immunosuppressive therapy.\n\n6. **Progressive Outer Retinal Necrosis (PORN)** - This condition, often related to herpes zoster virus, could explain the rapid progression of retinal necrosis despite antiviral treatment.\n\n7. **Bacterial Endophthalmitis** - Although less likely, a bacterial infection could cause severe inflammation and retinal damage.\n\n8. **Toxoplasmosis** - This parasitic infection can cause retinochoroiditis and should be considered in the differential diagnosis.\n\n9. **Sympathetic Ophthalmia** - An autoimmune condition that could occur after ocular surgery or trauma, leading to bilateral uveitis.\n\n10. **Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Endophthalmitis** - A bacterial infection that could cause rapid and severe ocular damage, especially in an immunocompromised host.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are **Acute Retinal Necrosis Syndrome** and **Cytomegalovirus Retinitis**, with **Medication Toxicity** and **Fungal Endophthalmitis** also being significant possibilities. The lack of response to antiviral treatment and the patient's immunosuppressed state make CMV retinitis a strong contender. However, the initial diagnosis of herpes infection and the retinal findings still support considering acute retinal necrosis syndrome. A comprehensive diagnostic work-up, including PCR testing of ocular fluids for viral and fungal pathogens, would be essential in confirming the diagnosis.", "topic": "['Infectious Diseases', 'Hepatobiliary Disease', 'Choroidal Disorders', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology', 'Ophthalmology']"}

This was his fifth inpatient stay in the past 3 years for similar symptoms. During a recent hospitalization, he had purpuric macules and plaques on his lower extremities bilaterally (Figure, left panel). Laboratory testing revealed a white blood cell count of 2.9 × 103/μL (reference, 4.2-10.8 ×103/μL); mean corpuscular volume, 96.1 fL (reference, 80-96 fL); hemoglobin level, 12.4 mg/dL (reference, 14.0-18.0 mg/dL); and a normal platelet count. C-reactive protein level was 270 mg/L (reference, 0-5 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 98 mm/h (reference, 0-20 mm/h).Results of testing for antinuclear antibody and antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies were negative. Computed tomography of the chest revealed numerous small, bilateral pulmonary nodules (Figure, right panel). Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed bilateral inferior rectus muscle enlargement with mild inflammatory changes along the extraocular muscles and optic nerves. A skin biopsy showed a perivascular neutrophilic infiltrate consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis. During his most recent hospitalization, he was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone (40 mg twice daily) for 5 days and discharged taking oral prednisone (40 mg daily) for 4 weeks. Previously, he had pericardial and pleural effusions and pulmonary infiltrates. Pericardial biopsy showed organizing pericarditis and lung biopsy revealed cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, with negative IgG4 stains. Results of bone marrow biopsy, including flow cytometry and cytogenetic testing, performed 18 months prior to the current presentation were normal. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "VEXAS (vacuoles, E1-ubiquitin-activating enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic) syndrome", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 69-year-old man who's been in and out of the hospital with some pretty concerning symptoms. Fever, fatigue, a rash, and swelling around his right eye. That's a lot going on. And he's had multiple hospital stays for similar issues over the past few years. That's definitely something to dig into.\n\nNow, he's got these purpuric macules and plaques on his lower legs. That sounds like some kind of vasculitis, right? And his lab results show a high white blood cell count, but it's not super high. His hemoglobin is a bit low, which could mean anemia. And wow, his CRP and ESR are through the roof. That's a big inflammatory response.\n\nThe negative ANA and ANCA tests are interesting. Those are usually present in some autoimmune diseases, so we can probably rule those out for now. But the skin biopsy showing leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a big clue. That's a type of small vessel vasculitis.\n\nThe CT scan shows numerous small pulmonary nodules. Hmm, that could mean a lot of things, but combined with the vasculitis, I'm thinking something systemic. And the MRI finding of enlarged inferior rectus muscles with inflammation is unusual. That's not something you see every day.\n\nHe's been treated with steroids before, and it seems to help, but the symptoms keep coming back. That suggests this is a chronic condition that's not fully resolved by steroids alone.\n\nSo, what could this be? IgA vasculitis is possible, but it's more common in children. And the lack of IgA deposition on biopsy makes it less likely. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis could fit, but we'd usually see c-ANCA positivity, and that's not the case here.\n\nLet's consider polyarteritis nodosa. It's a medium-vessel vasculitis that can cause systemic symptoms like fever and fatigue, and it can involve multiple organs. The absence of ANCA doesn't completely rule it out, as it can be negative in some cases.\n\nOh, and there's also cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. That can cause purpuric rashes and systemic symptoms too. But we didn't see any cryoglobulins on the biopsy, so maybe that's less likely.\n\nThe recurrent nature of his symptoms and the lack of response to steroids alone make me think of something more complex, like a systemic vasculitis. Polyarteritis nodosa is still on the table, but I'm not completely convinced.\n\nWait, what about relapsing polychondritis? It can cause inflammation in cartilaginous structures, like the ears and nose, but also other tissues. The eye muscle involvement could fit, and it might explain the systemic symptoms and vasculitis.\n\nRelapsing polychondritis often responds to steroids, but it can be challenging to manage long-term. That fits with his history of recurrent symptoms despite treatment.\n\nSo, after thinking it through, relapsing polychondritis seems like a strong contender. It ties together the systemic inflammation, muscle involvement, and vasculitis. Yeah, that feels like the right direction.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **IgA Vasculitis** - Although more common in children, it can present with purpuric rashes and systemic symptoms.\n2. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis** - Typically associated with c-ANCA positivity, which is not present here, but it can't be entirely ruled out.\n3. **Polyarteritis Nodosa** - A medium-vessel vasculitis that can cause systemic symptoms and organ involvement, with ANCA negativity in some cases.\n4. **Cryoglobulinemic Vasculitis** - Can cause purpuric rashes and systemic symptoms, but cryoglobulins were not detected.\n5. **Relapsing Polychondritis** - Involves cartilaginous structures and can cause systemic inflammation, which might explain the eye muscle involvement and vasculitis.\n6. **Microscopic Polyangiitis** - A small-vessel vasculitis that can present similarly, though p-ANCA is often positive.\n7. **Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis** - Typically involves asthma and eosinophilia, which are not present here.\n8. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus** - Often presents with positive ANA, which is negative in this case, but can have varied manifestations.\n9. **Rheumatoid Vasculitis** - Associated with rheumatoid arthritis, which is not indicated here, but can cause similar systemic and vascular symptoms.\n10. **Behçet's Disease** - Characterized by oral and genital ulcers and uveitis, which are not mentioned, but can involve systemic inflammation and vasculitis.\n\nAfter considering all the patient's symptoms, test results, and the chronic nature of the condition, **Relapsing Polychondritis** emerges as a strong contender. It accounts for the systemic inflammation, muscle involvement, and vasculitis, and aligns with the patient's history of recurrent symptoms despite steroid treatment. However, given the complexity of the case, a thorough re-evaluation and possibly a multidisciplinary approach might be necessary for a definitive diagnosis.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'External Eye Disease', 'Genetics and Genomics', 'Hematology', 'Ophthalmology']"}

The lesion had been present for 3 years with slow, gradual enlargement. The patient denied any associated symptoms. He was a former smoker and had no history of skin cancer or immunosuppression. The remainder of his medical history was noncontributory. Inspection of the right lower eyelid revealed a cystic-appearing nodule that transilluminated and had a few overlying telangiectasias. The cystic portion was continuous with a deeper, smooth subcutaneous component that was well defined, firm, and nonmobile, with a total lesion length of 1 cm (Figure 1A). There was no madarosis, eyelid margin effacement or preauricular lymphadenopathy. Although no overt features of malignancy were present, the deeper component was atypical for a hidrocystoma and an excisional biopsy was performed. Histopathologic evaluation showed a neoplasm composed of low-grade round nuclei growing in a micropapillary pattern within pools of extracellular mucin (Figure 1B). There was tumor present at the margin. Immunostains were positive for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor. Variable staining for INSM1, a sensitive nuclear stain for neuroendocrine differentiation, and focal staining for synaptophysin, another neuroendocrine marker, were also seen. This immunophenotype is consistent with a primary tumor derived from endocrine mucin-producing sweat gland carcinoma or a metastatic mucinous carcinoma of breast origin. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Mucinous carcinoma of the eyelid", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 62-year-old guy with a weird bump on his lower eyelid. It's been there for three years and hasn't really caused him any trouble, just slowly getting a bit bigger. He's a former smoker, but he doesn't have any history of skin cancer, which is good. Now, when we take a closer look at this thing, it's like a little cyst that lights up when you shine light through it, and it's got some tiny blood vessels on the surface. It's also got this deeper part that's smooth and firm, but it doesn't move around. That's interesting.\n\nSo, what could this be? My first thought is a hidrocystoma, which is basically a harmless sweat gland cyst. They can light up like that and have a cystic feel. But, there's something odd about this deeper part that doesn't quite fit with a simple hidrocystoma.\n\nLet's dig deeper. The biopsy results show something more complex. There's this pattern of growth with little round nuclei in a micropapillary arrangement, and they're sitting in pools of mucin. That's not what you'd expect with a regular hidrocystoma. Plus, the margins are not clear, which is a bit concerning.\n\nNow, the immunostains are really telling. We've got positivity for estrogen and progesterone receptors. That's unusual for a skin lesion, right? And there's also some staining for neuroendocrine markers like INSM1 and synaptophysin. This is starting to sound like something more than a benign cyst.\n\nSo, what's the deal with these receptors? Estrogen and progesterone receptor positivity could point towards a breast origin. Could this be a metastatic breast carcinoma? That's a possibility. But wait, let's not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nThe histology and the immunophenotype together are key. The micropapillary pattern and mucin pools, along with the neuroendocrine markers, suggest something like an endocrine mucin-producing sweat gland carcinoma. It's a rare tumor, but it fits the profile.\n\nBut, we can't ignore the breast cancer possibility. The receptor positivity is a strong hint. Could this be a metastasis from a breast primary? It's rare for men, but not impossible.\n\nLet's think about other options. Could it be a sebaceous carcinoma? They can have a varied presentation, but the immunostains don't really match. What about a mucinous carcinoma of the eyelid? That's another contender, but the neuroendocrine staining is atypical for that.\n\nAfter considering all this, I'm leaning towards this being a primary endocrine mucin-producing sweat gland carcinoma. It's rare, but the histology and immunophenotype fit well. The breast cancer possibility is still there, but it seems less likely given the context.\n\nSo, to wrap it up, I think we're looking at a primary sweat gland tumor with these unique features. It's a complex case, but everything points to that conclusion.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the lesion on the patient's eyelid, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Hidrocystoma** - A benign cystic lesion that can transilluminate, often originating from sweat glands.\n2. **Sebaceous Cyst** - A common cystic lesion of the eyelid, but typically not transilluminant.\n3. **Pilomatrixoma** - A benign tumor that can have a cystic appearance, often in younger patients.\n4. **Keratoacanthoma** - A rapidly growing lesion that can have a central crater, but usually more aggressive.\n5. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** - A common skin cancer that can present with pearly, telangiectatic lesions.\n6. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - A skin cancer that can present with more aggressive features.\n7. **Mucinous Carcinoma of the Eyelid** - A rare tumor that can present with mucin pools histologically.\n8. **Endocrine Mucin-Producing Sweat Gland Carcinoma** - A rare tumor with neuroendocrine differentiation and hormone receptor positivity.\n9. **Metastatic Breast Carcinoma** - A possibility given the estrogen and progesterone receptor positivity, though rare in men.\n10. **Apocrine Gland Carcinoma** - A rare sweat gland malignancy that can have similar histological features.\n\nAfter considering all the clinical, histological, and immunohistochemical findings, the most likely diagnosis is **Endocrine Mucin-Producing Sweat Gland Carcinoma**. This diagnosis aligns with the unique combination of histological patterns, neuroendocrine marker positivity, and hormone receptor status. While **Metastatic Breast Carcinoma** is a close consideration due to the hormone receptor profile, the primary sweat gland origin is more consistent with the overall presentation.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'External Eye Disease', 'Facial Plastic Surgery', 'Oculoplastic Surgery', 'Oncology']"}

There was no inguinal adenopathy, and results of routine blood work, including blood biochemistry, syphilis serologies, and HIV testing, were normal or negative. We took 2 specimens from the scrotum and buttock, respectively, for histopathological examination (Figure 1B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Genital porokeratosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a man in his 40s with itchy spots on his scrotum and buttock for 10 years. That's a long time to be dealing with this. He's been told it's eczema, but it's not really getting better with the usual treatments. Hmm, that makes me think eczema might not be the right diagnosis here.\n\nOkay, let's look at what we're seeing on the skin. There are these well-defined, gray, hyperkeratotic plaques. They're annular, which means ring-shaped, and they have an atrophic center with a slightly raised edge. That's pretty specific. I don't usually see that with eczema. Eczema tends to be more red and oozy, not really with this kind of gray, scaly appearance.\n\nSo, what else could this be? Psoriasis comes to mind. It can have those well-defined plaques, but they're usually more salmon-colored and scaly, not gray. Plus, psoriasis often shows up on extensor surfaces, not so much on the scrotum and buttock. Hmm, maybe not psoriasis.\n\nLet's think about lichen planus. It can have these gray, flat-topped papules, and it can definitely be itchy. But, lichen planus usually shows up in different areas, like the wrists or ankles, and it's not typically on the scrotum. Still, it's worth considering.\n\nWhat about tinea cruris? That's a fungal infection that can show up in the groin and buttock area. But, it usually has a red, scaly appearance and often responds to antifungal treatments. This doesn't quite fit the bill.\n\nInverse psoriasis could be another option. It shows up in the skin folds and can be smooth and red, but it doesn't usually have this gray, hyperkeratotic appearance. So, maybe not inverse psoriasis either.\n\nNow, let's think about histopathology. The biopsy could give us more clues. If we see certain features like acanthosis, papillary elongation, or a band-like infiltrate, that could point us towards something like psoriasis or lichen planus.\n\nOh, and we should consider granuloma annulare. It can have these annular plaques, but they're usually more flesh-colored and not itchy. This doesn't seem to match perfectly either.\n\nLet's not forget about mycosis fungoides, a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. It can have these persistent, scaly patches, especially in unusual areas. It's rare, but it's worth considering given the chronic nature of the lesions.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Based on the appearance of the lesions and the lack of response to eczema treatments, I'm leaning towards mycosis fungoides. It's not common, but it fits the description and the chronic history. Let's keep that as our top differential for now.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the man's skin condition, with a focus on one potential diagnosis per step, without repetition:\n\n1. **Psoriasis** - Characterized by well-defined, scaly plaques, but typically salmon-colored rather than gray.\n2. **Lichen Planus** - Known for gray, flat-topped papules, but usually appears in different areas like the wrists or ankles.\n3. **Tinea Cruris** - A fungal infection that affects the groin and buttock, but usually appears red and scaly.\n4. **Inverse Psoriasis** - Appears in skin folds and is smooth and red, but lacks the gray, hyperkeratotic appearance.\n5. **Granuloma Annulare** - Presents with annular plaques, but they are usually flesh-colored and non-pruritic.\n6. **Mycosis Fungoides** - A cutaneous T-cell lymphoma with persistent, scaly patches, especially in unusual areas.\n7. **Erythrasma** - A superficial fungal infection that can cause brownish, scaly patches in the groin.\n8. **Seborrheic Dermatitis** - Typically affects oily areas with yellow, greasy scales, not gray hyperkeratotic plaques.\n9. **Lichen Simplex Chronicus** - Results from chronic scratching, leading to lichenified plaques, but usually in response to an underlying condition.\n10. **Discoid Eczema** - Characterized by coin-shaped, dry, scaly patches, but not typically gray.\n\nAfter considering all the information and test results, the top differential diagnosis is **Mycosis Fungoides**, given the chronic nature of the lesions and their atypical appearance for common conditions like eczema or psoriasis. This diagnosis aligns with the persistent, scaly patches in unusual areas and the lack of response to standard eczema treatments.

Broad serologic workup results were negative, except for a positive syphilis total antibody with a nonreactive rapid plasma reagin test. Lumbar puncture with flow cytometry and cerebrospinal fluid venereal disease research laboratory test (CSF VDRL) result was also negative. The patient reported a history of syphilis treated with intramuscular penicillin 9 years prior. He was treated with systemic corticosteroids and discharged home on a steroid taper. On our examination, his visual acuity was count fingers in the right eye and 20/20 in the left. He had a right afferent pupillary defect and intraocular pressures were 12 in the right eye and 11 in the left. Anterior segment examination was normal. Posterior examination of the right eye revealed 3+ vitreous cell, 2+ vitreous haze, and a large optic nerve head mass with optic disc hyperemia, scattered dot hemorrhages, and a subtle placoid lesion in the posterior pole (Figure 1A). Optical coherence tomography of the optic nerve demonstrated a large spherical mass protruding out of the optic nerve head (Figure 1B) and granular disruption of the ellipsoid zone in adjacent peripapillary retina. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Syphilitic gumma of optic nerve head and presumed neurosyphilis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 47-year-old guy who's suddenly having trouble seeing out of his right eye. That's pretty concerning. And just a month ago, he was dealing with double vision and some nerve issues that pointed to a problem in the brainstem. They found a mass there too. That's a lot going on.\n\nNow, he's got a positive test for syphilis, but it's the kind that suggests past infection, not current. And the tests they did on his spinal fluid didn't show anything active there either. So, it doesn't seem like his current issues are from syphilis. But hey, it's still something to keep in mind.\n\nWhen I look at his eye exam, there's a lot happening. His right eye can barely see, and there's this issue with the pupil not reacting normally. That's a big clue. Plus, there's a lot of inflammation in the vitreous, which makes me think of something like uveitis. And then there's this mass on his optic nerve. That's definitely not something you see every day.\n\nSo, what could this be? Let's start with the obvious. A tumor like a meningioma could explain the mass and his vision problems. Those can press on things and cause all sorts of issues. But wait, there's also the possibility of an inflammatory condition like optic neuritis. That can cause sudden vision loss and pain, but usually not a mass.\n\nHmm, what about a demyelinating disease like multiple sclerosis? That could explain the brainstem issues and the optic nerve problems. But again, the mass is a puzzle. MS doesn't usually cause a mass like that.\n\nOh, and there's sarcoidosis. That can cause uveitis and optic nerve problems too. It's known for causing all sorts of granulomatous inflammation. But would it cause a mass? Maybe, but it's not the first thing that comes to mind.\n\nLet's not forget about infections. Syphilis was positive, but it seems like it's not active. But what about something like toxoplasmosis? That can cause retinochoroiditis and maybe even a mass. But it's usually more about the retina than the optic nerve.\n\nOkay, let's think about lymphoma. That can cause a mass and uveitis. And it can be sneaky, showing up in different parts of the body. This could fit, especially with the brain involvement.\n\nNow, what about glioma? Those are tumors that can affect the optic nerve and cause vision problems. They can definitely cause a mass. This seems like a strong possibility.\n\nAnd then there's this idea of a granuloma. Sarcoidosis can cause granulomas, and they can appear as masses. This could explain the optic nerve and brain findings.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? I think glioma is a strong contender. It explains the mass and the vision issues. But I'm also keeping lymphoma in mind because it fits with the uveitis and brain involvement. Sarcoidosis is still on the list too, because it can cause granulomatous inflammation that might look like a mass. It's a tough call, but those are my top suspects.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Meningioma** - This could explain the mass on the optic nerve and the patient's vision problems.\n2. **Optic Neuritis** - Sudden vision loss and pain are characteristic, but it typically doesn't present with a mass.\n3. **Multiple Sclerosis** - Could explain the brainstem issues and optic nerve involvement, but not typically a mass.\n4. **Sarcoidosis** - Known for causing uveitis and optic nerve problems, but a mass is less common.\n5. **Toxoplasmosis** - Can cause retinochoroiditis, but it's more retinal than optic nerve-focused.\n6. **Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma** - Can cause a mass, uveitis, and brain involvement, fitting several symptoms.\n7. **Optic Nerve Glioma** - A tumor that can cause a mass and vision issues, aligning well with findings.\n8. **Granuloma** - Could result from sarcoidosis, appearing as a mass and explaining optic nerve and brain findings.\n9. **Metastatic Carcinoma** - Could present with a mass and neurological symptoms, though less likely without known primary cancer.\n10. **Tuberculosis** - Can cause granulomatous inflammation leading to a mass, though less common in this context.\n\nReranking these based on all provided information, the top three considerations would be:\n\n1. **Optic Nerve Glioma** - Explains the mass and vision issues effectively.\n2. **Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma** - Fits with uveitis, mass, and brain involvement.\n3. **Sarcoidosis** - Could cause granulomatous inflammation leading to mass-like appearances on the optic nerve.\n\nThese three options best encompass the range of symptoms and findings in this complex case.", "topic": "['Infectious Diseases', 'Neuro-ophthalmology', 'Neurology', 'Sexually Transmitted Infections', 'LGBTQIA Medicine']"}

Let’s think step by step.\n### INPUT:\nA woman in her 80s presented with mildly pruritic skin lesions on her upper and lower extremities that had progressively appeared during the previous month. The patient had no systemic symptoms or unexplained weight loss. Physical examination revealed erythematous, nondesquamative, annular plaques, some of which had overlying vesicles in a cluster of jewels arrangement on the flexor aspect of both wrists and lower limbs (Figure 1). There was no mucosal involvement, and the Nikolsky sign test result was negative. Chest radiography results were normal and laboratory studies—complete blood cell count, kidney, and hepatic function; urinalysis; and indirect immunofluorescence—were unremarkable except for positive circulating IgG against desmoglein-1 antigen. A skin biopsy specimen was collected from a lesion on the anterior aspect of the left wrist for histopathologic and immunofluorescent analyses, and treatment with oral prednisone (30 mg/d) tapering for 1 month was initiated. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Pemphigus herpetiformis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an elderly woman with these itchy skin lesions. They're on her arms and legs, and they've been showing up over the past month. Hmm, that's interesting. They're red, ring-shaped, and don't seem to be scaling. Plus, there are some blisters in a 'cluster of jewels' pattern. That's a pretty specific clue.\n\nOkay, so she doesn't have any systemic symptoms or weight loss, which is good. That makes me think it's probably not something super serious like a systemic disease. The physical exam shows these erythematous plaques, and the blisters are key here. No mucosal involvement, and the Nikolsky sign is negative. That's helpful because it rules out some conditions.\n\nNow, let's think about the lab results. Everything's normal except for one thing: she's got positive IgG against desmoglein-1. That's a big deal. Desmoglein-1 is usually associated with pemphigus foliaceus, which fits with the skin findings. But wait, let's not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nSo, what else could this be? Bullous pemphigoid comes to mind. It's common in older adults and can have similar features, but it usually involves different antibodies. Then there's dermatitis herpetiformis, which is linked to celiac disease, but that's usually more itchy and has a different distribution. And what about linear IgA bullous dermatosis? That's another one to consider.\n\nLet's think about the biopsy. We've got a specimen from her wrist, and we're looking at histopathology and immunofluorescence. If it shows a certain pattern, like intercellular IgG in the epidermis, that would point to pemphigus foliaceus. But if it's linear deposits of IgG or C3 along the basement membrane, that would suggest bullous pemphigoid.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Initially, pemphigus foliaceus seems likely because of the desmoglein-1 antibodies. But, bullous pemphigoid is still a contender, especially given her age and the clinical presentation. Dermatitis herpetiformis and linear IgA are less likely, but they can't be completely ruled out yet.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. Pemphigus foliaceus is still top of the list because of the antibodies. But, bullous pemphigoid is a close second. The lack of mucosal involvement and negative Nikolsky sign fit bullous pemphigoid too. Dermatitis herpetiformis and linear IgA bullous dermatosis are still possibilities, but they seem less likely given the evidence.\n\nOkay, let's finalize this. Based on everything, pemphigus foliaceus is the most likely diagnosis. But, bullous pemphigoid is a strong contender. Dermatitis herpetiformis and linear IgA bullous dermatosis are less likely, but they can't be completely ruled out without further testing.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Pemphigus Foliaceus** - This is the most likely diagnosis given the presence of IgG antibodies against desmoglein-1 and the clinical presentation of erythematous, annular plaques with vesicles.\n\n2. **Bullous Pemphigoid** - Although typically involving different antibodies, it's a strong contender due to the patient's age and the presentation of skin lesions.\n\n3. **Dermatitis Herpetiformis** - Associated with celiac disease, this condition is characterized by intensely itchy papulovesicular eruptions, usually with a different distribution.\n\n4. **Linear IgA Bullous Dermatosis** - This condition involves linear deposits of IgA at the basement membrane and can present with similar blistering features.\n\n5. **Erythema Multiforme** - Characterized by target-like lesions, often related to infections or medications, but less likely here due to the specific antibody findings.\n\n6. **Subacute Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus** - Presents with photosensitive, annular polycyclic lesions, but usually accompanied by other systemic symptoms.\n\n7. **Tinea Corporis** - A fungal infection that can cause annular plaques, but typically with scaling and positive fungal cultures.\n\n8. **Granuloma Annulare** - Presents with annular plaques, but usually without vesicles and more commonly in younger individuals.\n\n9. **Nummular Eczema** - Characterized by coin-shaped, pruritic plaques, often in response to dry skin or allergies.\n\n10. **Annular Lichen Planus** - Presents with flat-topped, violaceous papules in an annular configuration, but usually without vesicles.\n\nAfter considering all the clinical and laboratory findings, the top two differential diagnoses are **Pemphigus Foliaceus** and **Bullous Pemphigoid**, with pemphigus foliaceus being the most likely due to the specific antibody profile.

Recently, the motion of his right limb joint was slightly limited. He was born to healthy parents and did not have any medical disease. On physical examination, there was an ill-defined, stony-hard plaque involving his right thigh above the patella extending to his right buttocks with loss of skin elasticity. The affected skin was associated with mild hypertrichosis and hyperpigmentation (Figure 1A). Laboratory tests revealed normal results for routine blood tests, autoantibodies, immunoglobulins, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Magnetic resonance imaging of the right thigh demonstrated slight thickening of subcutaneous tissue and T2 signal abnormality (Figure 1B). A skin biopsy was taken from the affected thigh for histopathological examination and alcian blue staining. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Segmental stiff skin syndrome", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an 11-year-old boy with this strange skin hardening on his right thigh and buttock. It's been going on for 7 years, so it's not something that just popped up overnight. That's a long time for something like this to develop, so it's probably not an acute condition. \n\nFirst off, scleroderma comes to mind. It's known for causing skin hardening, and it can be quite serious. But wait, scleroderma usually has other symptoms too, like more widespread skin changes or internal organ issues. This kid doesn't seem to have any of that, so maybe it's not scleroderma after all. \n\nNext, let's consider lipodermatosclerosis. It's a condition where the skin and subcutaneous fat get thick and hard, often on the lower legs. But this boy's symptoms are on his thigh and buttock, which isn't the usual spot for lipodermatosclerosis. Plus, it's often related to chronic swelling, and there's no mention of that here. \n\nHow about chronic erythema nodosum? It causes painful nodules under the skin, usually on the shins. But this case doesn't mention pain or nodules, and it's not on the shins. So, that doesn't quite fit either. \n\nNow, let's think about post-inflammatory changes. Sometimes, after inflammation, the skin can become thick and hardened. But there's no history of inflammation or injury here, so that seems unlikely. \n\nWhat about lichen sclerosus et atrophicus? It causes thinning and hardening of the skin, usually in the genital area, but it can appear elsewhere. This boy's symptoms don't match the typical presentation, and it usually affects older individuals. \n\nCould it be a connective tissue disorder like lupus? But lupus usually has a bunch of other symptoms like systemic involvement or a butterfly rash, and this kid's tests are all normal. So, lupus seems unlikely. \n\nLet's not forget about dermatomyositis. It causes skin changes and muscle weakness, but this boy doesn't have muscle issues, just skin hardening. So, that's probably not it. \n\nNow, what about a vascular issue like chronic venous insufficiency? It can cause skin changes, but it's usually on the legs and associated with swelling or ulcers, which this boy doesn't have. \n\nCould it be something like a benign fibrous tumor? Those can cause localized skin hardening, but they're usually more defined and don't have the hypertrichosis and hyperpigmentation this boy has. \n\nLastly, let's think about a rare condition like Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome. It causes skin hardening and can have associated bone lesions, but there's no mention of bone issues here. \n\nSo, after going through all these possibilities, I'm leaning towards scleroderma or maybe a localized form of it, like morphea. It fits the description of progressive skin hardening without the systemic symptoms. Yeah, that seems to make the most sense given what we know.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 11-year-old boy with progressive unilateral skin hardening:\n\n1. **Scleroderma** - Known for causing skin hardening, but usually accompanied by other symptoms.\n2. **Lipodermatosclerosis** - Typically occurs on the lower legs and is associated with chronic swelling.\n3. **Chronic Erythema Nodosum** - Characterized by painful nodules, usually on the shins, which doesn't match this case.\n4. **Post-inflammatory Changes** - Requires a history of inflammation or injury, which is absent here.\n5. **Lichen Sclerosus et Atrophicus** - Usually affects the genital area and older individuals.\n6. **Lupus** - Typically involves systemic symptoms and a butterfly rash, with abnormal lab tests.\n7. **Dermatomyositis** - Involves skin changes and muscle weakness, which this boy doesn't exhibit.\n8. **Chronic Venous Insufficiency** - Usually involves swelling or ulcers on the legs.\n9. **Benign Fibrous Tumor** - Typically more defined and without hypertrichosis or hyperpigmentation.\n10. **Buschke-Ollendorff Syndrome** - Rare, with skin and bone involvement, but no bone issues mentioned here.\n\nAfter considering all possibilities, the most likely diagnosis is a localized form of **scleroderma, such as morphea**, which fits the progressive skin hardening without systemic involvement.

She had excision of a thymoma 10 years before, which was classified as type B2 according to the World Health Organization histologic classification system. She reported severe pruritus in the affected area. She had no history of skin diseases, allergies, or cardiovascular disease. Medications for the patient’s myasthenia gravis included prednisone tablets (20 mg daily), tacrolimus (1.5 mg twice per day), pyridostigmine bromide (30 mg daily), and losartan potassium (50 mg daily) for hypertension. On presentation, the patient’s temperature was 37.8 °C; heart rate, 120 beats/min, blood pressure, 120/65 mm Hg; and oxygen saturation levels, 97% on room air. On physical examination, the confluent erythema with scales involved more than 95% of body surface area, including the patient’s head, trunk (Figure 1A), and extremities, but results on mucosal examination were unremarkable.

We've got a woman in her 30s with a history of myasthenia gravis and a thymoma that was removed a decade ago. She's come in with this severe erythroderma that's been bothering her for a couple of months. That's a lot of redness and scaling over most of her body. She's also dealing with some serious itching. Hmm, she's on a few medications for her myasthenia gravis, including prednisone, tacrolimus, pyridostigmine, and losartan. Could any of these be causing the skin issue? Drug reactions can definitely cause erythroderma, so that's something to consider.\n\nNow, let's think about other possibilities. She's got a history of thymoma, which makes me think about associated conditions like paraneoplastic syndromes. Could this be a sign of something like a lymphoma? Lymphomas, especially cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, can present with erythroderma. It's worth considering, especially with her history.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about infections. Severe erythroderma could be a response to an infection, maybe even something like psoriasis or pityriasis rubra pilaris, although those usually have more specific skin features. But we should keep an open mind.\n\nLooking at her lab results, there's a slight increase in her white blood cell count and CRP, which could indicate some inflammation or infection. Her liver enzymes are a bit elevated too, which is interesting. Could this be related to her medications or something else?\n\nThe skin biopsy is going to be really important here. If it shows specific features like atypical lymphocytes, that could point us towards a lymphoma. But if it's more nonspecific, maybe we're looking at a severe drug reaction or an autoimmune process.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? We've got a few possibilities. Drug-induced erythroderma is high on the list, especially with her medication history. But we can't ignore the possibility of a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma given her thymoma history and the biopsy results. Infections and autoimmune issues are still in the mix too.\n\nLet's rank these. I'd say drug-induced erythroderma is our top suspect, followed closely by cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Then there's psoriasis, pityriasis rubra pilaris, and maybe an infection like staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis and graft-versus-host disease are less likely but still possible. And finally, there's acute eczema, which seems less likely given the severity and her history.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, considering her history and test results:\n\n1. **Drug-induced erythroderma** - Given her medication history, especially with tacrolimus and prednisone, a drug reaction is a strong possibility.\n\n2. **Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma** - Her history of thymoma and the presentation of erythroderma raise the suspicion of a lymphoma, particularly a cutaneous T-cell type like mycosis fungoides or Sézary syndrome.\n\n3. **Psoriasis** - Although psoriasis typically has more specific skin features, erythrodermic psoriasis could present similarly and should be considered.\n\n4. **Pityriasis rubra pilaris** - This condition can cause widespread erythema and scaling, although it often has distinct clinical features.\n\n5. **Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome** - An infection could trigger such a widespread skin reaction, especially if there's an underlying susceptibility.\n\n6. **Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis** - Although less likely, hormonal influences could contribute to her skin condition.\n\n7. **Graft-versus-host disease** - Despite the lack of a transplant history, this is a possibility to consider given her immunosuppressed state.\n\n8. **Acute eczema** - While less likely due to the severity and chronic nature, an acute eczematous reaction could still be a factor.\n\n9. **Paraneoplastic syndrome** - Her thymoma history raises the possibility of a paraneoplastic phenomenon contributing to her skin changes.\n\n10. **Seborrheic dermatitis** - This is less likely given the extent and severity but could be considered if other causes are ruled out.\n\nThese possibilities are ranked based on the likelihood considering her medical history, medication use, and clinical presentation. Drug-induced erythroderma and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma are the top considerations, followed by other potential causes.

While no genetic abnormality associated with polycystic kidney was identified (whole-exome sequencing Invitae), an incidental finding of a heterozygous c.501-2 A<G sequence variant (SV) in the RB1 gene was noted. This specific RB1 SV had not been previously reported in any genetic databases, but was deemed pathogenic by Invitae, the commercial laboratory, in line with the American College of Medical Genetics and their guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants.1 No intraocular tumors were found on fetal sonography. There was no discernable family history of retinoblastoma or ocular disorders, and complete ophthalmic evaluation of both parents was normal with no suspected retinomas. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "RB1 pathogenic sequence variant in a 29-week-old fetus with no family history or sonographic features suggestive of retinoblastoma.", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 37-year-old pregnant woman, and during a routine ultrasound, they found something that looked like polycystic kidneys in the fetus. So, they did an amniocentesis to check things out genetically. But here's the twist, they didn't find any genetic issues linked to polycystic kidneys. Instead, they stumbled upon a variant in the RB1 gene. This gene is a big deal because it's associated with retinoblastoma, an eye cancer that usually affects kids. \n\nNow, this particular variant hasn't been seen before, but the lab says it's likely pathogenic. That's a fancy way of saying it could cause problems. But, there's no family history of retinoblastoma, and both parents had their eyes checked and are fine. So, that's a bit reassuring. \n\nOkay, so what could this mean for the baby? Well, retinoblastoma is the big concern here. Even though we didn't see any eye tumors in the fetus, that doesn't mean it won't develop later. This type of cancer can show up later in childhood. \n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. There are other possibilities. Maybe this variant isn't as harmful as they think. Genetic predictions aren't always 100% accurate, right? So, there's a chance the baby might not develop retinoblastoma at all. \n\nAlso, let's not forget about the polycystic kidneys. That was the initial concern, and even though we didn't find a genetic cause, it could still be something to watch. Sometimes these things develop without a clear genetic link. \n\nHmm, what about other potential issues? The RB1 gene is important, but could this variant affect other things? There's something called osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer, that's linked to the same gene. It's rare, but worth considering. \n\nAnd then there's the possibility of this being a benign finding. Maybe this variant doesn't do anything. It's like finding something that sounds scary but ends up being harmless. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the top concern is definitely retinoblastoma. But we should also keep an eye on the kidneys and even think about the remote chance of osteosarcoma. And of course, there's always the hope that it's just a harmless finding. \n\nIn the end, retinoblastoma is the most likely issue, but we can't ignore other possibilities.

We've got a 51-year-old woman who's been dealing with memory loss and numbness on her left side for a couple of years. That's quite a while, and it's getting worse. She was treated for a cerebral infarction, but that didn't seem to help. Hmm, that's interesting. Her medical history doesn't really show anything major, and she's been pretty healthy otherwise. She's a high school graduate and works as a driver, so she's been fairly active. No smoking or alcohol issues either. One of her parents had cognitive decline later in life, which might be relevant.\n\nNow, let's look at her cognitive test scores. A Mini-Mental State Examination score of 22 and a Montreal Cognitive Assessment score of 11 suggest some cognitive impairment. Not severe, but definitely something to consider. On her physical exam, she's got left-sided central facial palsy and lingual palsy. That's a bit unusual. And decreased pinprick sensation in her left arm? That's definitely pointing to something neurological.\n\nOkay, let's see what the tests show. Everything from her blood work to her cerebrospinal fluid analysis is normal. No signs of infection, autoimmune issues, or demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis. No atrial fibrillation or right-to-left shunts, so we can probably rule out embolic causes. Hmm, what about the MRI? It shows diffuse subcortical white matter hyperintensities and corpus callosum atrophy. That's pretty specific. And there are multifocal restricted diffusion areas in the corpus callosum. That sounds like something unusual, maybe a glioma or a type of dementia.\n\nSo, what could this be? Initially, I thought about cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). It fits the white matter changes and family history. But wait, there's no sign of strokes or typical migraines, so maybe not.\n\nWhat about multiple sclerosis? The corpus callosum involvement makes me think of it, but there are no oligoclonal bands, and the MRI findings aren't quite right. So, probably not MS.\n\nCould it be a glioma? The corpus callosum atrophy and diffusion patterns could suggest a butterfly glioma. That's a possibility. But there's no mass effect, which is odd for a glioma.\n\nMaybe it's a type of dementia, like frontotemporal dementia? The cognitive decline and corpus callosum atrophy could fit. But the sensory and motor symptoms don't quite match.\n\nLet's think about other possibilities. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease could explain the rapid cognitive decline and corpus callosum changes. But wouldn't we see more widespread symptoms by now?\n\nHow about Susac's syndrome? It involves the corpus callosum and could explain the neurological symptoms. But there's no mention of hearing loss or retinal issues, which are usually present.\n\nMarchiafava-Bignami disease could be another option. It involves the corpus callosum and could explain the cognitive and neurological symptoms. But it's rare and usually linked to alcohol use, which she doesn't have.\n\nLet's not forget about normal pressure hydrocephalus. It can cause cognitive issues and gait problems, but not really the sensory and motor symptoms she has.\n\nOkay, so what's the most likely diagnosis? Considering everything, I think Marchiafava-Bignami disease fits best. The corpus callosum degeneration and cognitive decline match, even if it's rare and she doesn't have the typical alcohol history. It seems to be the most plausible explanation given the evidence.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the 51-year-old woman is Marchiafava-Bignami disease. This condition is characterized by degeneration of the corpus callosum, which aligns with the MRI findings of corpus callosum atrophy and multifocal restricted diffusion. The progressive cognitive decline and neurological symptoms, such as left-sided central facial palsy and lingual palsy, also support this diagnosis. Although Marchiafava-Bignami disease is rare and typically associated with chronic alcoholism, the presented symptoms and imaging findings make it the most plausible explanation in this case.\n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Marchiafava-Bignami Disease** - Corpus callosum degeneration, cognitive decline, and neurological symptoms align with this rare condition.\n2. **Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease** - Rapid cognitive decline and corpus callosum changes are consistent, but the lack of widespread symptoms makes it less likely.\n3. **Glioma (Butterfly Glioma)** - Corpus callosum involvement and diffusion patterns could suggest a glioma, but the absence of a mass effect is atypical.\n4. **Susac's Syndrome** - Involves the corpus callosum, but the absence of hearing loss and retinal issues makes it less probable.\n5. **Frontotemporal Dementia** - Cognitive decline and corpus callosum atrophy fit, but sensory and motor symptoms are not typical.\n6. **Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus** - Could cause cognitive issues, but not the sensory and motor symptoms presented.\n7. **Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL)** - Family history and white matter changes are consistent, but lack of strokes or migraines makes it less likely.\n8. **Multiple Sclerosis** - Corpus callosum involvement is typical, but the absence of oligoclonal bands and atypical MRI findings make it unlikely.\n9. **Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy** - Could cause cognitive decline, but the specific corpus callosum findings do not align.\n10. **Alzheimer's Disease** - Cognitive decline is consistent, but the specific neurological symptoms and corpus callosum findings are not typical.", "topic": "['Genetics and Genomics', 'Neurogenetics', 'Neurology', 'Radiology', 'Neuroimaging']"}

The initial best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 4/20 (approximately 20/100), and an irregular superficial corneal ulcer with an epithelial defect size of 3 mm × 5 mm was found in the center of edematous cornea. She received penetrating keratoplasty 4 months later, as the ulcer did not heal with intensive medication. Then, topical tobramycin dexamethasone, topical tacrolimus, and daily oral prednisone, 40 mg, were prescribed, with a gradual taper of prednisone to a maintenance dose of 10 mg. At 5-month postoperative follow-up, some thin snowflakelike matter was found deposited on the iris and in the angle, with rare cell and mild flare in the anterior chamber. She was then diagnosed with uveitis and subsequently prescribed topical prednisone, subconjunctival triamcinolone acetonide, oral prednisone, 40 mg, and daily intravenous ganciclovir, 5 mg/kg. An aqueous sample was obtained for diagnostic polymerase chain reaction, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was detected with a DNA load of 3.12 × 107 cells. Nine months after the keratoplasty, when she presented to the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, her BCVA was 2/100 OD (approximately 20/1000 OD), and her intraocular pressure was 19 mm Hg. Diffuse tiny nodules were observed all over the iris, along with more snowflake and severe cataract (Figure 1A). The fundus could not be seen. B-ultrasonography showed a dense opacity in the anterior vitreous body (Figure 1B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Ocular polymorphic posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders in the left eye", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 62-year-old woman who's been dealing with some eye issues. She's had painless vision loss and redness in her right eye for about a week. That's interesting because painless vision loss can point to a few things. The fact that there's an irregular corneal ulcer is a big clue. It's not healing with medication, which is concerning. Could it be something like a fungal keratitis or maybe a bacterial ulcer that's not responding to treatment? \n\nNow, she had a corneal transplant, a penetrating keratoplasty, because the ulcer just wouldn't heal. After the surgery, she was on some pretty strong medications to prevent rejection and inflammation, including topical tobramycin dexamethasone, tacrolimus, and oral prednisone. These are heavy-duty drugs, so we need to consider what complications they might bring. \n\nFast forward to five months after the surgery, and she's showing signs of uveitis. There's this snowflakelike material on her iris and in the angle of the eye. That's unusual. Plus, there's a rare cell and mild flare in the anterior chamber. This could be a sign of an infection or inflammation. We should think about what could cause this kind of presentation. \n\nOh, and they found Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in her aqueous humor with a pretty high DNA load. That's a big deal. EBV isn't something you'd typically expect in the eye, so we need to consider what this means. Could it be related to her uveitis or something else? \n\nNow, nine months after her transplant, her vision has gotten worse, and she's got these tiny nodules all over her iris. There's more of that snowflake stuff, and a severe cataract has developed. The B-ultrasonography shows something dense in the anterior vitreous. This is sounding more and more like a complex issue, maybe even a form of vitritis or a masquerade syndrome. \n\nSo, let's put this all together. We've got a history of corneal issues, uveitis, EBV detection, and these nodules. Could this be EBV-associated uveitis? That's possible, but we should also think about other possibilities like CMV retinitis or even a lymphoma. The EBV could be a clue toward a lymphoproliferative disorder. \n\nAlright, let's rank our differential diagnoses. First, we should consider EBV-associated uveitis. It's a strong contender given the positive PCR result. Next, CMV retinitis is a possibility, especially with those snowflake opacities. We can't forget about the possibility of a lymphoma, like primary effusion lymphoma, given the EBV association. \n\nThen there's the idea of fungal endophthalmitis. The history of a non-healing ulcer and the dense vitreous opacity make this worth considering. Bacterial endophthalmitis is another option, though it seems less likely given the lack of a typical acute presentation. \n\nWe should also think about drug-induced uveitis. The patient's on some powerful medications, and they can sometimes cause these kinds of reactions. And finally, there's the possibility of a masquerade syndrome, where a systemic condition is presenting with ocular symptoms. \n\nSo, after going through everything, I think the top differential diagnosis is EBV-associated uveitis, followed closely by CMV retinitis. The possibility of a lymphoma is also up there. Fungal endophthalmitis and drug-induced uveitis are also on the list, but a bit further down. Bacterial endophthalmitis seems the least likely given the circumstances.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnoses for the patient's condition can be ranked as follows:\n\n1. **EBV-associated uveitis**: The detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the aqueous humor with a high DNA load is a significant finding. EBV is not typically associated with ocular infections, but it can be linked to uveitis, especially in the context of immunosuppression.\n\n2. **CMV retinitis**: The presence of snowflakelike opacities in the vitreous and the patient's history of immunosuppressive therapy suggest the possibility of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, which is known for such presentations.\n\n3. **Lymphoma (e.g., primary effusion lymphoma)**: The association of EBV with lymphoproliferative disorders raises the suspicion of a lymphoma, particularly one that could manifest with ocular involvement.\n\n4. **Fungal endophthalmitis**: The history of a non-healing corneal ulcer and the dense opacity in the vitreous body could suggest fungal endophthalmitis, especially in the context of previous corneal surgery.\n\n5. **Drug-induced uveitis**: The patient's regimen includes potent immunosuppressive drugs, which can occasionally lead to drug-induced uveitis.\n\n6. **Masquerade syndrome**: The possibility of a systemic condition presenting with ocular symptoms, such as a masquerade syndrome, should be considered given the complex presentation.\n\n7. **Bacterial endophthalmitis**: Although less likely due to the lack of an acute inflammatory response, bacterial endophthalmitis remains a differential diagnosis that should not be entirely ruled out.\n\nThese rankings are based on the combination of clinical findings, laboratory results, and the patient's treatment history. Each condition's likelihood is considered in the context of the others to provide a comprehensive differential diagnosis list.", "topic": "['Cornea', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Intraocular Tumors', 'Oncology', 'Ophthalmology']"}

Her vital signs, including temperature, respiration, and heart rate, were within normal ranges. One month later, she returned due to skin eruptions that continued to wax and wane. Physical examination revealed multiple round or irregularly shaped erythematous macules and slightly scaly plaques of various sizes on the face, trunk, and extremities. Bullous and vesicular lesions were observed on the thighs, with scattered facial erosions. Mucous membranes were not found to be affected. She was born to healthy, nonconsanguineous parents. Growth and development were normal for her age and sex. The patient’s family medical history was unremarkable. A skin-punch biopsy and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) assays taken from 1 of the erythematous scaly plaques were performed for further analysis. At the 3-year follow-up, it was found that the vesicles and bullae began to decrease in number when she was 6 months old but intermittently returned after 1 year of age. The number of annular hyperkeratotic plaques had increased (Figure 1A). Thickened, brown, corrugated plaques developed over the neck, armpits, wrists, and ankles, along with palmoplantar hyperkeratosis. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Annular epidermolytic ichthyosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a newborn girl with these skin issues—erythema, vesicles, and bullae all over. That's quite a lot right from birth. So, what could cause blisters and redness right away? Epidermolysis bullosa comes to mind. It's known for causing blisters, especially in newborns. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet.\n\nNow, a month later, the skin issues are still there and even changing a bit. We've got round, irregular red macules and some scaly plaques. Vesicles and bullae are still hanging around, but the mucous membranes are fine. That's interesting because it rules out some conditions that usually involve the mucous membranes, like some forms of epidermolysis bullosa. So, what else could it be? Maybe something like incontinentia pigmenti? It's known for having different stages, including vesicular ones.\n\nBut wait, let's not forget about the biopsy and direct immunofluorescence results. They might give us more clues. If it shows specific findings like IgA deposits, that could point towards linear IgA bullous dermatosis. That's something to consider.\n\nAs she grows, the skin issues evolve. By 6 months, the blisters start to fade, but then they come back after she's a year old. And now we've got these annular hyperkeratotic plaques and thick, brown, corrugated plaques in the skin folds. Plus, there's palmoplantar hyperkeratosis. This is starting to sound like a specific pattern. Could it be a type of ichthyosis or maybe a genetic condition like Darier's disease?\n\nBut let's think about Darier's disease a bit more. It usually starts a bit later, and the skin changes don't quite match up perfectly. So, maybe that's not it. What about other genetic conditions like Conradi-Hunermann syndrome? It has skin and systemic features, but it doesn't quite fit the bill here either.\n\nOkay, let's take a step back and look at the whole picture. We've got these evolving skin lesions, and the biopsy results could be a big clue. If we're thinking about linear IgA bullous dermatosis, it matches the chronic nature of the blisters and the age of onset. But we can't ignore the hyperkeratotic plaques and skin thickening. Maybe it's a complex condition that involves both blistering and keratotic features.\n\nSo, what's the best fit here? Considering everything—the timing, the types of lesions, and the biopsy results—linear IgA bullous dermatosis seems like a strong contender. But we should also think about conditions that combine blistering and hyperkeratosis, like a type of epidermolytic ichthyosis. It's a bit of a puzzle, but that might be the best explanation for what's going on.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the condition described:\n\n1. **Epidermolysis Bullosa** - Given the presence of blisters and skin fragility from birth.\n2. **Incontinentia Pigmenti** - Considering the evolution of skin lesions and the absence of mucosal involvement.\n3. **Linear IgA Bullous Dermatosis** - Suggested by the chronic blistering and potential biopsy findings.\n4. **Darier's Disease** - Due to the development of hyperkeratotic plaques, although the age of onset is slightly atypical.\n5. **Conradi-Hunermann Syndrome** - A possibility due to the skin changes and potential systemic involvement.\n6. **Epidermolytic Ichthyosis** - Given the combination of blistering and hyperkeratotic features.\n7. **Bullous Pemphigoid** - Although less common in infants, it could be considered due to blistering characteristics.\n8. **Acrodermatitis Enteropathica** - Considering the possibility of a zinc deficiency causing skin lesions.\n9. **Pachyonychia Congenita** - Due to the nail and skin changes, although not all features perfectly align.\n10. **Erythrokeratoderma Variabilis** - Given the transient nature of some skin lesions and hyperkeratosis.\n\nAfter re-evaluating all the information, **Linear IgA Bullous Dermatosis** and **Epidermolytic Ichthyosis** emerge as the most likely diagnoses, considering the chronic blistering, evolution of skin lesions, and biopsy results.

He had a history of hypertension and was taking oral medication (amlodipine [5 mg]/valsartan [80 mg] and indapamide [1.5 mg] once daily) but had poorly controlled systolic blood pressure ranging from 130 to 160 mm Hg. No associated trauma or surgical history was reported. Physical examination revealed a large tumor originating from the olfactory groove in the left nasal cavity, with feeding vessels pushing the middle turbinate outward. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a well-defined and strongly enhancing mass in the left nasal cavity, with obstructive rhinosinusitis in the frontal and ethmoid sinuses (Figure 1A). During surgical exploration, the tumor abutted the superior end of the nasal septum near the cribriform plate. Tumor excision was completed with a surgical margin of at least 5 mm, with the perichondrium of the nasal septum as the deep margin. The feeding vessels of the tumors were cauterized during the resection. Gross examination revealed a 4.8 × 3.0 × 1.8-cm whitish to pink-tan mass lesion (Figure 1B). Histopathological examination revealed sheetlike proliferation of monomorphic ovoid to spindle tumor cells containing ectatic vascular spaces. In addition, immunohistochemical staining showed positive staining for smooth-muscle actin, cyclin D1, and nuclear expression of β-catenin and negative staining for epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin, and CD34. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Glomangiopericytoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 65-year-old man who's been dealing with left nasal obstruction for a couple of years. That's quite a while to have that kind of issue. He's also got hypertension, but it's not really well controlled. He's on some meds for it, like amlodipine, valsartan, and indapamide. But his blood pressure still hovers between 130 and 160 mm Hg. No history of trauma or surgery, which is good to know.\n\nNow, when we check him out physically, there's this large tumor in his left nasal cavity. It's coming from the olfactory groove, and it's pushing the middle turbinate out of the way. That sounds like it could be causing the obstruction. The MRI shows a well-defined mass that's really enhancing, and it's causing some blockage in the frontal and ethmoid sinuses. That's probably why he's having nasal issues.\n\nDuring surgery, they find that the tumor is right up against the superior part of the nasal septum, near the cribriform plate. They manage to remove it with a decent margin, about 5 mm, and they make sure to cauterize the feeding vessels. The tumor itself is about 4.8 by 3.0 by 1.8 cm and looks whitish to pink-tan. \n\nWhen they look at it under the microscope, they see these monomorphic ovoid to spindle cells. There are also these ectatic vascular spaces, which is interesting. The immunohistochemistry comes back positive for smooth-muscle actin, cyclin D1, and β-catenin, but negative for epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin, and CD34. That's a pretty specific profile.\n\nSo, what could this be? Initially, I'm thinking about something like a hemangioma because of the vascular nature. But wait, the immunohistochemistry doesn't really match that. Hemangiomas are usually positive for CD34, which this isn't. \n\nThen, I consider a schwannoma. They can appear in the nasal cavity and have a certain spindle cell morphology. But, they typically show S100 positivity, which isn't mentioned here. So, that's probably not it.\n\nNext, I think about an olfactory neuroblastoma. They arise from the olfactory groove, just like this mass. But, they usually show positivity for neuroendocrine markers like synaptophysin or chromogranin, which aren't highlighted here. So, that's not a perfect match either.\n\nI also ponder a fibrosarcoma. It's a spindle cell tumor, and it could fit the location. But, the specific immunohistochemical profile here doesn't quite align with a fibrosarcoma. \n\nThen, there's the possibility of a solitary fibrous tumor. They can occur in the nasal cavity and have a similar spindle cell appearance. They're usually CD34 positive, but this one isn't. Still, the morphology and some of the immunohistochemical features could fit.\n\nNow, let's think about an angiofibroma. They're more common in younger males, but they can show a similar vascular nature. The immunohistochemistry doesn't perfectly match, but it's worth considering.\n\nI also consider a glomangiopericytoma, also known as a sinonasal hemangiopericytoma. They're known for their vascular nature and can occur in the nasal cavity. The immunohistochemical profile, especially the smooth-muscle actin positivity, fits well with this.\n\nFinally, I think about a desmoid-type fibromatosis. They can show β-catenin positivity, which this tumor does. But, they're not typically in the nasal cavity, and the vascular features don't quite match.\n\nAfter going through all of this, I'm leaning towards glomangiopericytoma, or sinonasal hemangiopericytoma, as the most likely diagnosis. It fits the location, the vascular nature, and the immunohistochemical profile. Yeah, that seems to make the most sense.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the nasal mass is a glomangiopericytoma, also known as a sinonasal hemangiopericytoma. This diagnosis aligns with the tumor's location in the nasal cavity, its vascular nature, and the immunohistochemical profile, which includes positivity for smooth-muscle actin. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Glomangiopericytoma (Sinonasal Hemangiopericytoma)**: This is the most likely diagnosis given the tumor's location, vascular features, and immunohistochemical profile.\n2. **Solitary Fibrous Tumor**: Although typically CD34 positive, the spindle cell morphology and some immunohistochemical features could fit, making it a plausible consideration.\n3. **Angiofibroma**: While more common in younger males, the vascular nature and some immunohistochemical features align, making it a possible diagnosis.\n4. **Hemangioma**: The vascular nature fits, but the lack of CD34 positivity makes it less likely.\n5. **Schwannoma**: Could appear in the nasal cavity with spindle cell morphology, but the absence of S100 positivity reduces its likelihood.\n6. **Olfactory Neuroblastoma**: Arises from the olfactory groove, but the lack of neuroendocrine marker positivity makes it less likely.\n7. **Fibrosarcoma**: A spindle cell tumor, but the immunohistochemical profile doesn't align well.\n8. **Desmoid-type Fibromatosis**: Shows β-catenin positivity, but the location and vascular features don't match well.\n9. **Leiomyoma**: Smooth-muscle actin positivity could fit, but the location and other features are less typical.\n10. **Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma**: Least likely due to the lack of specific immunohistochemical markers and atypical location.", "topic": "['Otolaryngology', 'Rhinology and Sinus Disease']"}

He was hospitalized for sepsis from pneumonia complicated by acute transplant rejection, without any cardiac symptoms. Coronary angiography prior to BOLT showed no evidence of coronary artery disease. His only cardiac history was tricuspid valve repair at the time of BOLT. His baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) is shown in Figure 1A. He progressed to having severe acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring intubation. As he continued to worsen, the decision was made to paralyze him a few hours later. Changes on telemetry were noted. Shortly thereafter, 12-lead ECG showed the changes in Figure 1B. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Apical pulsation caused by paralysis of the intercostal muscles", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a patient who's had a lung transplant not too long ago, about six months back. He's in his mid-60s and has a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. Now, he's dealing with sepsis from pneumonia and has had a bout of acute transplant rejection. That's a lot on his plate already. \n\nOkay, so he didn't have any coronary artery disease before the transplant, which is good. But he did have tricuspid valve repair during the transplant surgery. That's something to keep in mind. \n\nNow, he's developed severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and needed to be intubated. Things are getting serious. After intubation, they decided to paralyze him, and soon after, there were changes on his telemetry. That's when they did a 12-lead ECG and found some changes. \n\nLet's think about what could be going on here. Given his recent lung transplant and the fact that he's just been through sepsis and rejection, he's at high risk for infections. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is pretty common in transplant patients, so that's a strong possibility. \n\nBut wait, there's more. With the tricuspid valve repair, we should consider the risk of endocarditis, especially since he's been hospitalized and had procedures. That's a setup for bacterial infections. \n\nAnd then there's the acute rejection episode. That could have weakened his heart, making it more vulnerable to problems. Could this be cardiac allograft vasculopathy? It's a chronic rejection issue, but it can show up earlier in some cases. \n\nOh, and let's not forget about medication toxicity. He's on immunosuppressants, and those can have cardiac side effects. Tacrolimus or cyclosporine could be causing some issues. \n\nNow, considering the telemetry changes after paralysis, could it be a neurological issue like a cerebral vascular accident? That would affect the heart indirectly. \n\nAlso, with all this going on, could he have developed stress-induced cardiomyopathy? That's a possibility with all the stress his body is under. \n\nWait, let's not overlook arrhythmias. They're common post-transplant and can be triggered by electrolyte imbalances or the medications he's on. \n\nAnd finally, there's the chance of a pulmonary embolism. It's less likely, but with his history and current condition, it can't be completely ruled out. \n\nSo, putting it all together, here's the list of possibilities: CMV infection, endocarditis, cardiac allograft vasculopathy, medication toxicity, cerebral vascular accident, stress-induced cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, and pulmonary embolism. Each of these fits with some part of his history or current symptoms. \n\nReranking these based on everything we know, CMV infection seems like a top contender given his transplant status and current illness. But cardiac allograft vasculopathy is also high on the list because of the chronic rejection risk. Endocarditis is up there too, considering the valve repair and hospital exposure. Medication toxicity and arrhythmias are also significant, given his treatment and current condition. \n\nSo, after thinking it through, the top differentials are CMV infection, cardiac allograft vasculopathy, endocarditis, medication toxicity, and arrhythmias. These seem to fit best with what's going on.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection** - Given the patient's recent lung transplant, CMV is a common and significant risk.\n\n2. **Endocarditis** - The history of tricuspid valve repair and recent hospitalization increases the risk of bacterial infection.\n\n3. **Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy** - A potential chronic rejection issue that could present earlier due to recent acute rejection.\n\n4. **Medication Toxicity** - Immunisuppressants like tacrolimus or cyclosporine can have cardiac side effects.\n\n5. **Cerebral Vascular Accident** - A neurological event that could indirectly affect the heart, especially after paralysis.\n\n6. **Stress-Induced Cardiomyopathy** - The body's response to intense stress from multiple medical issues.\n\n7. **Arrhythmias** - Common post-transplant and potentially caused by electrolyte imbalances or medications.\n\n8. **Pulmonary Embolism** - Although less likely, it remains a possibility given the patient's history and condition.\n\n9. **Acute Coronary Syndrome** - Despite previous clear coronary angiography, new cardiac stressors could provoke an event.\n\n10. **Sepsis-Induced Cardiac Dysfunction** - Ongoing sepsis could impair cardiac function, contributing to the patient's condition.\n\nReranking these differentials based on the patient's overall clinical picture, the top contenders are:\n\n1. **CMV Infection** - Highly likely due to the transplant and current illness.\n2. **Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy** - Significant due to chronic rejection risk post-transplant.\n3. **Endocarditis** - Possible due to valve repair and hospital-acquired infection risk.\n4. **Medication Toxicity** - Plausible given the immunosuppressants' side effects.\n5. **Arrhythmias** - Common post-transplant and potentially medication-induced.\n\nThese differentials align closely with the patient's complex medical history and current symptoms.", "topic": "['Cardiology', 'Pulmonary Medicine', 'Surgery', 'Transplantation', 'Critical Care Medicine']"}

We've got a 52-year-old who's been dealing with fingertip pain and duskiness for three weeks. That's quite specific. No respiratory issues or weight loss, which is good to note. No history of rheumatologic or Raynaud's disease either. And she doesn't smoke or take medications. That's helpful to keep in mind.\n\nNow, looking at her vital signs, everything seems pretty normal there. But her fingertips are cold and cyanotic with small ulcerations. That's a big clue. And wow, her white blood cell count is really high, with 74.5% eosinophils. That's a lot of eosinophils!

The imaging and nasopharyngoscopy didn't show anything unusual either.\n\nSo, what could this be? Let's start with some possibilities. Churg-Strauss syndrome comes to mind because of the eosinophilia, but there's no respiratory involvement, so maybe not. How about polyarteritis nodosa? It can cause skin issues like this, but usually, there are other symptoms too.\n\nEosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis is another thought, but again, no respiratory symptoms. Could it be a hypercoagulable state? But then, the D-dimer isn't that high. What about a vasculitis like Buerger's disease? But she doesn't smoke, so that's unlikely.\n\nMaybe it's an infection like endocarditis? But there are no signs of that on the imaging. Could it be an unusual case of sarcoidosis? But usually, that doesn't present like this. And what about eosinophilia related to a parasite or a neoplasm? But there's no history or findings to support that.\n\nAlright, let's think about this again. The high eosinophil count and skin findings are key. Could it be an eosinophilic disorder like acute eosinophilic pneumonia? But there's no respiratory involvement. How about eosinophilic fasciitis? But that usually involves more than just the fingertips.\n\nLet's consider vasculitis again. Polyarteritis nodosa or microscopic polyangiitis could fit, but they usually have more systemic symptoms. Could it be a drug reaction? But she's not taking any medications. Hmm, what about an unusual presentation of lupus? But the antibody tests were negative.\n\nOkay, let's think outside the box. Could it be a rare condition like Degos disease? That can cause skin lesions and has a weird presentation. Or maybe it's a case of eosinophilic vasculitis? That could explain the eosinophilia and skin findings.\n\nSo, after going through all of this, I think the top possibilities are eosinophilic vasculitis, Degos disease, or maybe a very unusual presentation of polyarteritis nodosa. These seem to fit the symptoms and test results best.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Churg-Strauss Syndrome** - Although there's no respiratory involvement, the high eosinophil count is a key feature.\n2. **Polyarteritis Nodosa** - This vasculitis can cause skin manifestations like the ones described, though typically more systemic symptoms are present.\n3. **Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis** - Similar to Churg-Strauss, but usually includes respiratory symptoms.\n4. **Hypercoagulable State** - The slightly elevated D-dimer could suggest a clotting disorder, but it's not very high.\n5. **Buerger's Disease** - Unlikely due to the absence of smoking history.\n6. **Infective Endocarditis** - No signs on imaging, but could be an atypical presentation.\n7. **Sarcoidosis** - Uncommon presentation without respiratory or other systemic involvement.\n8. **Parasitic Infection** - Could cause eosinophilia, but no history or findings to support this.\n9. **Degos Disease** - A rare condition that can cause skin lesions and might fit the unusual presentation.\n10. **Eosinophilic Vasculitis** - Could explain the high eosinophil count and skin findings.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are **Eosinophilic Vasculitis**, **Degos Disease**, and an **unusual presentation of Polyarteritis Nodosa**.

Ultrasonography performed in B mode with a high-frequency (6-18 MHz) linear transducer revealed a hypoechoic lesion with well-defined borders in the hypodermis. After 2 months, the nodule had increased and seemed to be adhered to deep layers. A computed tomography scan was performed, which showed a 0.8 × 1.5 × 1.5-cm ovoid subcutaneous lesion with well-defined borders located in the glabella. The lesion was not affecting the epidermis and reached the muscular layer in depth without eroding bone structures. Given these findings, the lesion was excised. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Nodular fasciitis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a young woman with a painful, fast-growing lump in the glabella area. That's the spot right between the eyebrows. It's firm, mobile, and painful. Hmm, that sounds like it could be a few things. Let's start with the basics. A lipoma comes to mind first. They're pretty common and usually feel soft and moveable, but they're not typically painful or fast-growing. So, maybe not a lipoma.\n\nNext, let's consider an epidermoid cyst. These can be firm and sometimes painful, especially if they get inflamed. But they don't usually grow quickly, so that's something to think about. \n\nNow, what about a sebaceous cyst? Similar to epidermoid cysts, they're usually not painful or fast-growing. They tend to be more of a slow burner unless they get infected. So, probably not that either.\n\nOkay, let's think about something a bit more serious, like a soft tissue sarcoma. These can be aggressive and fast-growing, which fits the bill. But they're not usually painful, and you'd expect them to be more fixed in place rather than mobile. So, maybe not a sarcoma.\n\nHmm, how about a neurofibroma? These can be painful and grow quickly, and they're definitely mobile. That seems to fit pretty well. Let's keep that in mind.\n\nNow, let's not forget about a dermatofibroma. They can be firm and sometimes painful, but they're usually slow-growing. So, probably not that.\n\nOh, and there's the possibility of a pilomatrixoma. These can be firm and sometimes painful, and they do occur in the head and neck area. They can grow relatively fast, so that's a possibility.\n\nLet's also think about a hemangioma. These are vascular lesions and can be painful if they're thrombosed or have bleeding. They can grow quickly too, so that's another one to consider.\n\nNow, what about an angiofibroma? These can occur in the facial area and might be firm and painful. They're not typically fast-growing, but let's not rule it out completely.\n\nAnd finally, let's consider a desmoid tumor. These are firm and can be painful, and they do grow quickly. They're usually more aggressive and infiltrative, but it's worth considering.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top possibilities are neurofibroma, pilomatrixoma, and hemangioma. They all fit the description pretty well. But if I had to pick one, I'd say neurofibroma is the most likely. It just seems to tick all the boxes.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the subcutaneous nodule in the glabella area:\n\n1. **Lipoma** - Common, but usually not painful or fast-growing.\n2. **Epidermoid Cyst** - Can be firm and painful, but typically not fast-growing.\n3. **Sebaceous Cyst** - Similar to epidermoid cysts, usually not painful or fast-growing.\n4. **Soft Tissue Sarcoma** - Aggressive and fast-growing, but not usually painful or mobile.\n5. **Neurofibroma** - Painful, fast-growing, and mobile, fitting the description well.\n6. **Dermatofibroma** - Firm and sometimes painful, but usually slow-growing.\n7. **Pilomatrixoma** - Firm, painful, and can grow relatively fast, especially in the head and neck area.\n8. **Hemangioma** - Vascular lesion that can be painful and grow quickly.\n9. **Angiofibroma** - Firm and painful, but not typically fast-growing.\n10. **Desmoid Tumor** - Firm, painful, and fast-growing, but usually more aggressive and infiltrative.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are **Neurofibroma**, **Pilomatrixoma**, and **Hemangioma**, with **Neurofibroma** being the most likely due to its alignment with the symptoms and characteristics described.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Facial Plastic Surgery']"}

Born by cesarean delivery to nonconsanguineous parents, she developed difficulties with head control, standing, and feeding at age 10 months. Subsequently, she faced progressive motor challenges (walking, speech, and swallow); contractures in her fingers, toes, wrists, and knees; and scoliosis. In adolescence, she experienced progressive stiffness, episodes of painful spasms and oculomotor crisis, and galactorrhea unrelated to childbirth in adulthood. Her symptoms worsened with age and progressed to her using a wheelchair, having difficulty in speech, and not having access to education. She had a younger brother with similar symptoms who passed away at age 20 years of unknown causes. Upon presentation at age 31 years, she was admitted to our center for further evaluation. She had thin limbs and was of standard height. The neurological and psychological examinations revealed scoliosis, contractures in her fingers and toes, carpal inversion, dysarthria, dysphagia, hypertonia, decreased tendon reflexes, absence of Babinski sign (Figure, A and B), and no psychiatric problems. Blood test results indicated hyperprolactinemia (prolactin level of 47.40 ng/mL; to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1). An electroencephalogram revealed atypical spike-slow wave synchronization in specific brain regions during sleep. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed significant global atrophy particularly in her anterior temporal, lateral, and frontal regions (Figure, C). Levodopa treatment was initiated but quickly resulted in drug-induced hyperkinesia (Video). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 31-year-old woman with a pretty complex set of symptoms. She's dealing with generalized dystonia, dysarthria, dysphagia, and severe scoliosis. These issues started when she was just a kid, around 10 months old. That's quite early for these kinds of problems to begin.\n\nFirst off, the early onset of motor difficulties makes me think of some kind of neurological or genetic disorder. Cerebral palsy comes to mind initially, but let's not jump to conclusions just yet. It's important to consider all the symptoms.\n\nNow, she's also experiencing episodes of painful spasms and something called an oculomotor crisis. That's a bit unusual and suggests there might be more going on here. Plus, there's the galactorrhea, which is unexpected since she hasn't had children. Hyperprolactinemia can be caused by a variety of things, including certain medications or underlying neurological issues.\n\nThe family history is also a big clue. Her younger brother had similar symptoms and sadly passed away at 20. This makes me think there's a strong genetic component at play. Maybe something autosomal recessive?\n\nThe brain MRI shows significant global atrophy, especially in the anterior temporal, lateral, and frontal regions. That's pretty specific and points towards a degenerative condition. It's not just random atrophy; it's localized, which is important.\n\nThe EEG results are interesting too. Atypical spike-slow wave patterns during sleep can be seen in certain neurological disorders. This, combined with the atrophy, makes me think of conditions like neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis or possibly a mitochondrial disorder.\n\nLet's not forget the response to treatment. She developed drug-induced hyperkinesia with levodopa. That's a bit unusual and suggests her condition might involve abnormal dopamine handling or sensitivity.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I'm thinking this could be a case of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. It fits with the early onset, the specific MRI findings, the EEG results, and the family history. Plus, the response to levodopa aligns with what we might expect in such a condition.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure we're not missing anything. We should consider other possibilities like mitochondrial disorders or even some kind of metabolic disorder. These can present similarly and might match some of the symptoms.\n\nAfter going through everything again, I'm still leaning towards neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. It just seems to fit best with the whole picture. But it's always good to keep an open mind and consider other options like juvenile Huntington's disease or even some rare forms of dystonia.\n\nIn the end, I think neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis is the most likely diagnosis, but we should definitely keep other possibilities in mind as we move forward.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the 31-year-old woman is neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). This condition aligns with the early onset of motor difficulties, the specific findings on brain MRI showing global atrophy, the atypical spike-slow wave patterns on EEG, and the family history of a similarly affected sibling. The response to levodopa treatment, which resulted in drug-induced hyperkinesia, further supports this diagnosis. However, it's important to consider other possibilities such as mitochondrial disorders or metabolic disorders, as they can present with similar symptoms. Here is a ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (NCL)**\n2. Mitochondrial Disorder\n3. Juvenile Huntington's Disease\n4. Dystonia Musculorum Deformans\n5. Rett Syndrome\n6. Ataxia-Telangiectasia\n7. Metabolic Disorder (e.g., Leigh Syndrome)\n8. Hallervorden-Spatz Disease\n9. Wilson's Disease\n10.

The patient had no fevers, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, or leg pain or swelling, and no recent history of trauma. Nine months prior to presentation, he had been diagnosed with bullous pemphigoid, which was initially treated with oral prednisolone (40 mg daily for 1 week).

Laboratory testing revealed a normal complete blood cell count and normal creatinine and liver function test results; results of HIV antibody testing were negative. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Iatrogenic Kaposi sarcoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an 84-year-old man with dementia who's come in with these dark, purplish nodules on his right leg and foot. That's quite something. He's been on prednisolone for a while because of bullous pemphigoid. Hmm, steroids can do all sorts of things to the immune system, so that's something to keep in mind.\n\nFirst off, these nodules are pretty distinctive. They're firm and violaceous, which makes me think of something vascular or maybe even a type of skin cancer. Could it be Kaposi's sarcoma? That's known for those kinds of lesions, especially in someone who's immunosuppressed. But wait, he's HIV negative, so that's a bit of a twist.\n\nOkay, let's not jump to conclusions. What else could it be? Maybe a hematological issue like leukemia cutis. That can cause nodules too, right? But then again, his blood work is normal, so that's not really adding up.\n\nOh, and there's the fact that he's on steroids. They can cause all sorts of skin changes. Could this be steroid-induced something? Like, maybe steroid-induced acne or something similar? But these nodules seem too dark and firm for that.\n\nLet's think about infections. He doesn't have any systemic symptoms like fever or weight loss, but could it still be something infectious? Like, what about chromoblastomycosis? That's a fungal infection that can cause nodular lesions. But it's pretty rare and usually related to trauma, which he doesn't have a history of.\n\nHmm, what about other types of skin cancers? Merkel cell carcinoma can present with firm nodules, and it's more common in older adults. Plus, it can be aggressive, which fits the rapid onset. But it's usually more flesh-colored or red, not violaceous.\n\nOh, and there's angiosarcoma. That's a pretty aggressive skin cancer that can present with bruise-like lesions. It's rare, but it fits the violaceous color and firmness. Plus, it's more common in older adults too.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? We've got a few possibilities. Kaposi's sarcoma is still on the list, even without HIV, because of the immunosuppression from steroids. Merkel cell carcinoma is a strong contender because of the patient's age and the nodule characteristics. And angiosarcoma is definitely in the running because of the violaceous, firm nature of the nodules.\n\nIn the end, I think angiosarcoma might be the best fit. It matches the clinical presentation really well, and it's a plausible explanation given the patient's age and the appearance of the lesions. Yeah, that seems like the most likely diagnosis.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 84-year-old man with violaceous nodules on his right leg and foot:\n\n1. **Kaposi's Sarcoma** - Known for violaceous lesions, often associated with immunosuppression, which could be relevant due to the patient's long-term prednisolone use.\n\n2. **Angiosarcoma** - A rare, aggressive skin cancer that can present with bruise-like, violaceous lesions, more common in older adults.\n\n3. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma** - A skin cancer that presents with firm nodules, more common in older adults, although typically flesh-colored or red.\n\n4. **Leukemia Cutis** - Nodular skin lesions associated with hematological malignancies, but the patient's normal blood work makes this less likely.\n\n5. **Chromoblastomycosis** - A chronic fungal infection causing nodular lesions, usually related to trauma, which the patient does not have.\n\n6. **Bacillary Angiomatosis** - Associated with immunosuppression, presents with vascular lesions, but typically in the context of HIV, which the patient is negative for.\n\n7. **Lymphoma Cutis** - Skin involvement by lymphoma, which can cause nodular lesions, but usually with other systemic symptoms.\n\n8. **Hemangioma** - Benign vascular tumors, but these are usually not violaceous or rapidly appearing.\n\n9. **Pyogenic Granuloma** - Benign vascular proliferations, often related to trauma, which the patient does not have.\n\n10. **Steroid-Induced Skin Changes** - Long-term steroid use can cause various skin changes, but these nodules seem too specific for a non-infectious, non-neoplastic cause.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Angiosarcoma** emerges as the most likely diagnosis due to the violaceous, firm nature of the nodules and the patient's age. However, given the patient's immunosuppressed state from prednisolone, **Kaposi's Sarcoma** remains a strong contender despite the negative HIV status. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma** is also a plausible consideration due to the patient's age and the characteristics of the lesions.

He had no history of cardiac disease, and there was no family history of heart disease or sudden death. Physical examination revealed an irregular pulse and a systolic murmur at the heart apex. Holter monitoring and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings documented irregular narrow-QRS tachycardia in an incessant, repetitive fashion with heart rates up to 180 beats per minute and occasional short runs of wide-QRS tachycardia. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a dilated and diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle (ejection fraction, 30%) associated with moderate to severe functional mitral regurgitation. Blood test results were within normal limits, including thyroid function, C-reactive protein, and myocardial enzymes. The patient was hospitalized, and medical therapy was initiated, including ACE inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, β-blockers, and diuretics. Coronary angiography revealed no significant coronary stenoses. A representative 12-lead ECG of the arrhythmia is shown in Figure 1. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Dual atrioventricular nodal nonreentrant tachycardia", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a man in his 50s who's been dealing with palpitations, fatigue, and shortness of breath for a few months now. That's quite a while to be feeling unwell. Palpitations and irregular heartbeats can be really concerning, especially when they come with fatigue and trouble breathing. These symptoms make me think of something going on with the heart, maybe an arrhythmia or some kind of structural problem.\n\nNow, the physical exam shows an irregular pulse and a systolic murmur. An irregular pulse could mean an arrhythmia like atrial fibrillation, which is pretty common and can cause these symptoms. The murmur might be due to a valve issue, like mitral regurgitation, especially if the heart's not pumping well.\n\nThe echocardiogram is really telling. It shows a dilated left ventricle that's not contracting well, with an ejection fraction of just 30%. That's pretty low and suggests dilated cardiomyopathy. This could be why he's feeling so fatigued and short of breath. The mitral regurgitation could be secondary to the ventricular dilation.\n\nThe ECG shows irregular narrow-QRS tachycardia, which could be atrial fibrillation, and some wide-QRS tachycardia. Atrial fibrillation would fit with the irregular pulse and could be worsening his heart failure symptoms.\n\nBlood tests are normal, which rules out thyroid issues or a myocardial infarction. And since there's no coronary artery disease, we can cross off ischemic cardiomyopathy.\n\nSo, what's causing the dilated cardiomyopathy? It could be alcohol use, but there's no mention of that. It might be idiopathic, or maybe viral. Non-ischemic cardiomyopathies can be tricky because they often have multiple potential causes.\n\nWait, let's not forget about the arrhythmias. Atrial fibrillation is a big contender here, given the irregular tachycardia. But there are also those short runs of wide-QRS tachycardia. Could this be ventricular tachycardia? That would fit with the structural changes in the heart.\n\nOkay, so we've got dilated cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation. But we shouldn't ignore the possibility of ventricular tachycardia, especially with that wide-QRS complex.\n\nNow, let's think about other possibilities. Could it be hypertrophic cardiomyopathy? Probably not, because the echocardiogram shows a dilated, not thickened, ventricle.\n\nWhat about valvular heart disease? The mitral regurgitation is likely secondary to the dilated cardiomyopathy, not the primary issue.\n\nLet's not forget about conduction disorders. The irregular pulse and arrhythmias could suggest a problem with the heart's electrical system, like sick sinus syndrome.\n\nOh, and we can't completely rule out coronary artery disease, even if the angiography didn't show significant blockages. There might be minor issues or a spasm that wasn't caught.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the top differential diagnoses are dilated cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, and ventricular tachycardia. But we should also consider sick sinus syndrome and coronary artery disease as possibilities. It's a complex case, and we need to think about all the angles.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, considering all symptoms, test results, and potential underlying causes:\n\n1. **Dilated Cardiomyopathy** - The echocardiogram shows a dilated left ventricle with poor contractility, which aligns with this diagnosis.\n2. **Atrial Fibrillation** - The irregular narrow-QRS tachycardia on the ECG suggests atrial fibrillation, a common arrhythmia that can cause palpitations and worsen heart failure symptoms.\n3. **Ventricular Tachycardia** - The short runs of wide-QRS tachycardia could indicate ventricular tachycardia, which is concerning given the structural heart changes.\n4. **Non-Ischemic Cardiomyopathy** - The absence of coronary artery disease suggests a non-ischemic cause for the cardiomyopathy, potentially idiopathic or viral in origin.\n5. **Alcoholic Cardiomyopathy** - Although not mentioned, alcohol use could be a contributing factor to dilated cardiomyopathy.\n6. **Sick Sinus Syndrome** - The irregular pulse and arrhythmias might also suggest a conduction disorder like sick sinus syndrome.\n7. **Coronary Artery Disease** - Despite no significant blockages, minor or intermittent coronary issues could still be a factor.\n8. **Valvular Heart Disease** - While the mitral regurgitation is likely secondary to ventricular dilation, primary valvular disease could be considered.\n9. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy** - Although the echocardiogram shows dilation, a variant of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy could potentially cause similar symptoms.\n10. **Electrolyte Imbalance** - An undetected electrolyte disturbance could contribute to the arrhythmias and cardiac dysfunction.\n\nThese differential diagnoses provide a comprehensive view of potential causes and contributing factors to the patient's condition, emphasizing the complexity of the case.", "topic": "['Cardiology', 'Rhythm Disorders', 'Heart Failure']"}

His home medications included sevelamer and hydrocodone-acetaminophen (10 mg/325 mg) every 8 hours as needed, which was increased to every 4 hours as needed in the hospital. Hydromorphone (0.5 mg intravenously as needed) was added for breakthrough pain. He was prescribed chewable lanthanum tablets (500 mg 3 times daily) for treatment of a blood phosphate level of 8.1 mg/dL (reference, 2.5-4.5 mg/dL). On hospital day 7, the patient developed intermittent apneic episodes, during which his oxygen saturation was 80% on room air; heart rate, 86/min; and blood pressure, 106/45 mm Hg. Physical examination revealed bilateral rhonchi and responsiveness to verbal commands only with deep painful stimulus. A chest radiograph showed 4 radio-opaque coin-shaped opacities in the stomach (Figure). After administration of oxygen at 2 L/min by nasal cannula and a naloxone infusion, his oxygen saturation increased to 98% and his mental status improved. The patient reported no foreign body ingestion. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Accidental ingestion of whole lanthanum tablets", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 50-year-old man with end-stage kidney disease. He's on hemodialysis, and he's dealing with calciphylaxis and foot cellulitis. That's a lot already. He's been taking sevelamer and hydrocodone-acetaminophen, and now they've upped his pain meds to every 4 hours in the hospital. Plus, they added hydromorphone for breakthrough pain. That's quite a cocktail of opioids. \n\nNow, on day 7 in the hospital, he starts having these apneic episodes. His oxygen saturation drops to 80% on room air, which is pretty low. His heart rate and blood pressure are okay-ish, but he's only responsive to deep painful stimuli. That's concerning. \n\nThey did a chest X-ray, and it shows four radio-opaque coin-shaped opacities in his stomach. That's interesting. Could it be something he ingested? But he says he didn't ingest anything foreign. Hmm, that's odd. \n\nThey gave him oxygen and a naloxone infusion, and his oxygen saturation goes back up to 98%. His mental status improves too. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist, so this suggests that opioids are playing a big role here. \n\nLet's think about those radio-opaque opacities. They could be pills, right? Lanthanum is a heavy metal, and it's radio-opaque. He's been taking chewable lanthanum tablets for his high phosphate levels. Could these be the culprit? \n\nSo, we've got opioid-induced respiratory depression. The lanthanum tablets might be causing these radio-opaque opacities, but they're not directly causing the respiratory issues. It's the opioids. \n\nLet's rank the possible causes. First, opioid-induced respiratory depression is a big one. Then, there's lanthanum toxicity, but that's more about the opacities, not the breathing. We should also consider other things like infection or metabolic issues, but they don't seem as likely right now. \n\nOh, and what about mucus plugging? That could cause respiratory issues too, especially with his rhonchi. But it doesn't explain the opacities. \n\nLet's not forget about the possibility of an acute neurological event. It could affect his breathing and responsiveness, but again, it doesn't explain the opacities. \n\nWe should also think about electrolyte imbalances. With his kidney disease, that's a possibility. But it's not as directly linked to the opacities or the immediate respiratory improvement with naloxone. \n\nNow, could it be a drug interaction? He's on a lot of medications. Maybe they're interacting in a way that's worsening his condition. That's possible, but it's not as clear-cut as the opioid issue. \n\nLet's consider if there's a psychological component. Stress or anxiety could exacerbate his symptoms, but it doesn't explain the physical findings. \n\nFinally, what about systemic inflammation? It could be related to his calciphylaxis and affect his overall condition, but it's not as directly linked to the acute respiratory issues. \n\nSo, when we put it all together, opioid-induced respiratory depression is the most likely cause of his apneic episodes. The lanthanum tablets explain the radio-opacities. Mucus plugging and neurological events are less likely but can't be completely ruled out. The rest, like electrolyte imbalances and drug interactions, are possible but not as prominent right now.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with a focus on the most likely causes:\n\n1. **Opioid-induced respiratory depression** - The patient's apneic episodes and improvement with naloxone strongly suggest opioid involvement.\n2. **Lanthanum toxicity** - The radio-opaque opacities in the stomach are likely due to the lanthanum tablets he has been taking.\n3. **Mucus plugging** - This could contribute to respiratory issues, especially with the presence of rhonchi, but doesn't explain the opacities.\n4. **Acute neurological event** - Could affect breathing and responsiveness, but doesn't account for the radio-opacities.\n5. **Electrolyte imbalance** - Possible due to kidney disease, but less directly linked to the immediate respiratory improvement with naloxone.\n6. **Drug interaction** - Potential interactions between his medications could worsen his condition, but the opioid effect is more clear-cut.\n7. **Psychological component** - Stress or anxiety could exacerbate symptoms, but doesn't explain the physical findings.\n8. **Systemic inflammation** - Related to calciphylaxis, but not directly linked to the acute respiratory issues.\n9. **Gastrointestinal motility disorder** - Could affect the movement of lanthanum tablets, but not a primary cause of respiratory depression.\n10. **Infection** - Although he has cellulitis, it's less likely to be the primary cause of his acute respiratory episodes.\n\nThese differential diagnoses are ranked based on the likelihood of causing the patient's symptoms, with opioid-induced respiratory depression being the most probable cause.

Laboratory investigations demonstrated an elevated leukocyte count (22 500/µL; to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). Lateral soft tissue radiography showed a radio-opaque foreign body at the level of C6. Computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed a 2-cm radio-opaque osseous foreign body at the level of the cricopharyngeus muscle with signs of esophageal perforation, including air leak tracking toward the left lobe of the thyroid gland (Figure, A and B). The patient was brought to the operating room, and the esophageal foreign body was successfully removed. Postoperatively, the patient continued to become febrile despite intravenous antibiotic therapy. A repeated CT scan of the neck and chest was done (Figure, C). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Emphysematous thyroiditis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a teenager who came in with a high fever, neck pain, and a weird sensation in their throat. They mentioned eating chicken a few days ago. That's interesting because chicken can sometimes have little bones that might cause trouble. \n\nSo, first things first, I'm thinking about a foreign body, maybe a bone stuck somewhere. The timing fits, and the symptoms do too. \n\nBut wait, there's more. The tests show a really high white blood cell count. That's a big clue pointing towards some kind of infection or inflammation. \n\nNow, the X-ray and CT scan show a foreign body at the level of C6, and it's radio-opaque. That's likely a bone. But there's also air leaking, which suggests something more serious, like an esophageal perforation. \n\nOh, and the air is tracking towards the thyroid gland. That's not good. Air where it shouldn't be often means something's torn or punctured. \n\nSo, with this info, I'm thinking esophageal perforation is a strong possibility. It fits with the foreign body and the air leak. \n\nBut the patient had surgery to remove the foreign body, and they're still getting fevers. That's odd. You'd think they'd start feeling better. \n\nHmm, could there be an abscess? That would make sense. If there was a perforation, bacteria could cause an infection, leading to an abscess. \n\nLet's not forget about the thyroid gland. The air was tracking towards it, so maybe it's involved too. A thyroid abscess is possible. \n\nBut wait, there's also the possibility of a deep neck infection. Those can be pretty serious and might explain the persistent fever. \n\nOh, and what about mediastinitis? That's an infection in the central chest area, and an esophageal perforation could definitely lead to that. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I think we're looking at a few possibilities. Esophageal perforation with a resulting abscess or infection, maybe involving the thyroid or the deep neck spaces, and potentially mediastinitis. \n\nYeah, that seems to cover it. The symptoms, the test results, and the persistent fever all fit with these possibilities.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, ensuring each step presents a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Esophageal Foreign Body** - Given the history of eating chicken and the presence of a radio-opaque foreign body on imaging.\n2. **Esophageal Perforation** - Suggested by the air leak seen on CT scan tracking towards the thyroid gland.\n3. **Deep Neck Infection** - Possible due to the high fever and elevated white blood cell count post-surgery.\n4. **Thyroid Abscess** - Considering the air tracking towards the thyroid gland, which could indicate involvement.\n5. **Retropharyngeal Abscess** - A potential complication from the esophageal perforation leading to infection in the retropharyngeal space.\n6. **Mediastinitis** - An infection in the mediastinum could result from the esophageal perforation and explain persistent fever.\n7. **Lemierre's Syndrome** - Although less common, it involves neck infection and sepsis, often from oropharyngeal sources.\n8. **Epiglottitis** - Could be considered due to neck pain and foreign body sensation, though less likely given the findings.\n9. **Parapharyngeal Abscess** - Another potential space for abscess formation given the proximity to the esophagus.\n10. **Descending Necrotizing Mediastinitis** - A severe complication of esophageal perforation where the infection spreads down the neck and into the mediastinum.\n\nReranking these based on the clinical presentation and test results, the top three most likely diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Esophageal Perforation with Mediastinitis** - The air leak and persistent fever strongly suggest this complication.\n2. **Deep Neck Infection** - The elevated white blood cell count and ongoing fever point towards a significant infection.\n3. **Thyroid Abscess** - The air tracking towards the thyroid gland makes this a plausible secondary complication.\n\nThese diagnoses align with the symptoms, imaging findings, and the clinical course of persistent fever despite antibiotic therapy.", "topic": "['Surgery', 'Pain Medicine', 'Pediatrics', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Endocrinology']"}

His symptoms began 5 years earlier with right temple numbness, which expanded to include the entire right face and mouth. He then developed progressive right facial weakness with a droop, slurred speech, and eyelid ptosis. Finally, binocular vertical and horizontal diplopia and periorbital headaches began. Trials of gabapentin and steroids provided no relief. His history was significant for a left cheek melanoma completely excised years prior, numerous cutaneous squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the bilateral head and neck removed without issue, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. His medications included metformin and simvastatin; he had no history of smoking or drinking. On examination, he had right-sided ptosis and severe right facial weakness in a lower motor neuron pattern with temporal wasting. The right pupil was fixed and dilated. There was no afferent pupillary defect. The left pupil was appropriately sized and reactive. His right-sided vision was impaired (20/250) with blurriness. Vertical and horizontal binocular diplopia was present. Right extraocular movements were significantly limited in all directions and painful, and right-sided facial sensation was diminished to pinprick in all cranial nerve (CN) V distributions. His speech was slightly slurred. Left-sided extraocular movements were intact. His left facial sensation was intact to pinprick, and his strength was without deficit. There were no other neurological abnormalities. Initial magnetic resonance images (MRIs) were unremarkable. A biopsy of CN VII was nondiagnostic. Hemoglobin A1c was 6.8%. Tests for infection and autoimmune disease had negative results. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies showed mildly elevated protein values. Figure 1 shows the MRI at presentation. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Perineural spread of cutaneous malignancy", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 68-year-old man who's been dealing with some pretty concerning symptoms. He's got right-sided facial numbness and weakness, and it's been getting worse over the past five years. That's a long time to be dealing with something like this. He's also having vision changes and headaches. Hmm, that's a lot going on.\n\nOkay, so he's got this numbness that started around the right temple and then spread to his whole face and even his mouth. That's interesting. It sounds like it's following the paths of the trigeminal nerve, which makes me think about something affecting that nerve.\n\nThen there's the right facial weakness. It's not just a little droop; it's a full-on lower motor neuron pattern with wasting. That's pretty significant. And he's got ptosis and a fixed, dilated pupil on the same side. That's pointing towards Horner's syndrome, which usually means something is going on with the sympathetic nerves.\n\nHe's also got double vision and trouble moving his right eye. The fact that it's painful too makes me think about something affecting the nerves that control eye movement. And his vision is blurry on that side as well. All of this is really making me think about a problem in the cavernous sinus or superior orbital fissure, where a lot of these nerves come together.\n\nNow, let's not forget his history. He's had melanoma and a bunch of other skin cancers. That's definitely something to keep in mind, especially since melanoma can be pretty aggressive and spread to other areas.\n\nThe initial MRI didn't show anything, which is frustrating. But sometimes these things can be sneaky and hard to see. And the biopsy of the facial nerve didn't give us any answers either. Hmm, that's a dead end.\n\nHis blood work is pretty normal, and he doesn't have any signs of an infection or autoimmune disease. That's good, but it also means we can't blame it on something like diabetes or an immune disorder.\n\nThe CSF shows a bit of elevated protein. That's a clue. It could mean there's something chronic going on, like an infection or inflammation, but it's not definitive.\n\nSo, what could this be? Let's think about the possibilities. A meningioma could explain a lot of these symptoms, especially if it's in the cavernous sinus. Those tumors can press on a bunch of nerves at once.\n\nA schwannoma is another possibility. Those are nerve sheath tumors and could definitely cause the kind of nerve problems he's having.\n\nMetastatic cancer is on the list too, given his history. Melanoma could spread to the brain or the nerves, causing these symptoms.\n\nWe should also consider Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, which is inflammation in the cavernous sinus. It can cause pain and nerve problems, but usually responds to steroids, and he didn't get better with those.\n\nThere's also the possibility of idiopathic cranial neuropathy. Sometimes these things just happen without a clear cause.\n\nAnd let's not forget about chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. It's a mouthful, but it could explain some of the nerve issues.\n\nOh, and there's cavernous sinus thrombosis, although that usually comes with more dramatic symptoms like fever or a really sick appearance.\n\nNow, if I had to rank these, I'd say a meningioma is at the top. It just fits so well with the slow progression and multiple nerve involvement.\n\nNext would be a schwannoma. It's similar in how it presents, and it's definitely something to consider.\n\nMetastatic melanoma is up there too. His history makes it a strong contender, and it could definitely explain the symptoms.\n\nTolosa-Hunt syndrome is lower on the list because of the lack of response to steroids, but it's still a possibility.\n\nIdiopathic cranial neuropathy and CIDP are further down. They could explain some symptoms, but not the whole picture.\n\nAnd cavernous sinus thrombosis is last. It just doesn't fit with how he's presenting.\n\nSo, after going through everything, I think a meningioma is the most likely cause of his symptoms. It's the best fit for what's going on.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's symptoms, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Meningioma** - This is a strong contender given the slow progression of symptoms and multiple nerve involvement.\n2. **Schwannoma** - A nerve sheath tumor that could explain the nerve problems and symptoms.\n3. **Metastatic Melanoma** - Considering the patient's history of melanoma, this is a plausible option.\n4. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome** - Inflammation in the cavernous sinus, though less likely due to lack of response to steroids.\n5. **Idiopathic Cranial Neuropathy** - A possibility when no clear cause is found, but it doesn't explain all symptoms.\n6. **Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)** - Could explain some nerve issues, but not the entire clinical picture.\n7. **Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis** - Less likely due to the absence of fever or severe illness.\n8. **Pituitary Adenoma** - Could affect the optic pathways and nearby structures.\n9. **Craniopharyngioma** - A possibility if it extends to affect the cavernous sinus.\n10. **Skull Base Osteomyelitis** - An infection that could affect cranial nerves, though less likely without systemic signs.\n\nAfter considering all the information, a **meningioma** is the most likely diagnosis, given the slow progression and multiple cranial nerve involvement.

He reported intermittent itching and night sweats for 2 years. He denied fever, weight loss, shortness of breath, rashes, diarrhea, and neurological symptoms. On a preemployment evaluation, the patient was told he had a high white blood cell count 2 years ago. On examination, there was left cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy and no other organomegaly. Complete blood cell count and peripheral blood smear showed marked leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 22 340/μL, an absolute neutrophil count of 5360/μL, and 55% eosinophils with an absolute eosinophil count of 12 290/μL (to convert all to cells ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). Vitamin B12 was markedly elevated at more than 4000 pg/mL (to convert to pmol/L, multiply by 0.7378). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 5 mm/h. Lactate dehydrogenase was 180 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase was 81 U/L (to convert both to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167). Evaluations for HIV and hepatitis B and C were all negative. Serum creatinine was 0.76 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4); alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were 11 U/L and 9.9 U/L, respectively (to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167); and total bilirubin was 0.35 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 17.104). Bone marrow biopsy showed hypercellular marrow (cellularity of 100%), myeloid hyperplasia, increased eosinophils with some dysplasia, and a blast count of 2%. Positron emission tomographic–computed tomographic scan showed a left upper cervical lymph node of 2.6 cm and a left inguinal lymph node of 3.1 × 2.3 cm with an standardized uptake value max of 5.7 (Figure, A). Left inguinal lymph node biopsy showed partial involvement by atypical cells with high proliferation index (Ki-67 >95%) that were positive for CD3, CD4, CD8, BCL2, and TDT, suggestive of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (Figure, B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 31-year-old guy with some pretty noticeable symptoms. He's got these lumps in his neck and groin, and he's been dealing with itching and night sweats for a couple of years. That's a long time to be feeling unwell. He doesn't have any fever or weight loss, which is interesting. \n\nNow, when we look at his blood work, there's a really high white blood cell count, and most of those are eosinophils. That's unusual. Eosinophils being that high makes me think of something related to a myeloproliferative disorder. And, oh, his vitamin B12 levels are through the roof. That's a big clue because it can be linked to eosinophilic disorders. \n\nThe bone marrow biopsy is hypercellular with a lot of eosinophils and some dysplasia. There are also 2% blasts, which isn't a lot, but it's something to note. This could point towards a chronic myeloid condition, maybe chronic eosinophilic leukemia or a similar myeloproliferative disorder. \n\nBut then there's the lymph node biopsy. It shows these atypical cells that are positive for CD3, CD4, CD8, BCL2, and TDT. That sounds like T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia. This is a bit of a curveball because it's a lymphoid neoplasm, which is different from the myeloid picture we're seeing in the blood and bone marrow. \n\nSo, what's going on here? We've got evidence of both a myeloid and a lymphoid process. Could this be a mixed phenotype acute leukemia? That would combine both myeloid and lymphoid features. Or maybe it's two separate things happening at the same time, like a coincidence of chronic eosinophilic leukemia and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. \n\nLet's think about other possibilities. With the eosinophilia and high vitamin B12, we could be looking at a myeloproliferative neoplasm, maybe chronic eosinophilic leukemia. But the lymph node findings throw a wrench in that. \n\nWhat about a T-cell lymphoma? That would explain the lymph node results, but it doesn't really account for the eosinophilia and blood findings. \n\nCould it be acute myeloid leukemia with eosinophilia? That might fit the blood and bone marrow, but not the lymph node biopsy. \n\nMaybe it's a non-Hodgkin lymphoma. That could explain the lymphadenopathy, but again, not the eosinophilia. \n\nLet's not forget about allergic reactions or parasitic infections, but they usually don't cause this level of systemic involvement. \n\nAnd what about a myelodysplastic syndrome? That could cause some of these blood abnormalities, but it doesn't explain the lymph node findings. \n\nOh, and there's always the possibility of a mast cell disorder, but that's not really fitting here either. \n\nSo, after thinking it all through, the top possibilities are a mixed phenotype acute leukemia or the coincidence of chronic eosinophilic leukemia and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. These options seem to best explain the combination of myeloid and lymphoid findings. It's a complex case, but these diagnoses fit the evidence we have.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, ensuring each step presents a distinct hypothesis without repetition:\n\n1. **Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia** - This is suggested by the high eosinophil count and elevated vitamin B12 levels, which are often associated with eosinophilic disorders.\n\n2. **T-cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma/Leukemia** - The lymph node biopsy showing atypical cells positive for CD3, CD4, CD8, BCL2, and TDT points towards this lymphoid neoplasm.\n\n3. **Mixed Phenotype Acute Leukemia** - This could explain the combination of both myeloid and lymphoid features observed in the patient.\n\n4. **Acute Myeloid Leukemia with Eosinophilia** - The blood and bone marrow findings, including eosinophilia and blasts, could align with this diagnosis.\n\n5. **Myeloproliferative Neoplasm** - The hypercellular bone marrow with myeloid hyperplasia and eosinophilia suggests a myeloproliferative disorder.\n\n6. **Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma** - The lymphadenopathy and lymph node biopsy results could be explained by a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\n7. **Hypereosinophilic Syndrome** - This condition involves prolonged eosinophilia and could account for some of the patient's symptoms.\n\n8. **Allergic Reaction or Parasitic Infection** - Although less likely, these could cause eosinophilia, but they typically don't involve lymphadenopathy or abnormal lymph node biopsies.\n\n9. **Myelodysplastic Syndrome** - This could explain some blood abnormalities, but it doesn't account for the lymph node findings.\n\n10. **Mast Cell Disorder** - While less likely, mast cell disorders can involve systemic symptoms, but they don't typically present with these specific findings.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are **Mixed Phenotype Acute Leukemia** and the **Coincidence of Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia and T-cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma**, as these options best explain the combination of myeloid and lymphoid findings in the patient.", "topic": "['Allergy and Clinical Immunology', 'Dermatology', 'Oncology']"}

We've got an 80-year-old man who's been dealing with stage II bladder cancer and also has atrial fibrillation. He's been on apixaban for that. Now, he's come to the ER because he's been feeling really tired for a week and has had trouble breathing when he's active for the past two days. That's not good.\n\nHe just had his fourth round of chemotherapy for the bladder cancer, and they gave him some G-CSF to help with his white blood cells. That's interesting because it can affect blood cell production.\n\nOkay, so his blood tests are showing some weird things. His white blood cell count is really high, and there are a lot of immature cells like bands, metamyelocytes, myelocytes, promyelocytes, and even some blasts. That's a big mix of immature cells, which isn't normal.\n\nHis hemoglobin is super low, which explains the fatigue, and his platelets are also down. That's concerning because it suggests his bone marrow isn't working right.\n\nFerritin is high, which could mean inflammation or something else going on in the bone marrow. The rest of his blood clotting tests are normal, which rules out some bleeding disorders.\n\nThe direct antiglobulin test is negative, so it's not an autoimmune issue destroying his red blood cells. And the CT scan didn't show anything unusual, so no bleeding source there.\n\nNow, let's think about what's going on. With all these immature white cells and low blood counts, it could be something like a myeloid neoplasm, maybe even acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The presence of blasts is a big hint towards that.\n\nBut wait, he just got G-CSF, which can cause maturation arrest. That might explain the immature cells. But does it explain the anemia and thrombocytopenia? Not really, so we need to keep looking.\n\nWhat about myelodysplastic syndromes? They can cause immature cells and low blood counts. But usually, you don't see this many blasts, so it's less likely.\n\nCould it be aplastic anemia? That would cause low blood counts, but you wouldn't see all these immature cells. So that's probably not it.\n\nHow about a myeloproliferative neoplasm like chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)? It can cause a high white cell count, but the blasts and other immature cells aren't typical for CML.\n\nOh, and there's the flow cytometry result showing CD34+/CD117+ cells. Those are stem/progenitor cells, which can be increased in AML or other bone marrow disorders.\n\nSo, putting it all together, AML seems like the most likely diagnosis. The high blast count and immature cells fit, and the flow cytometry results support it.\n\nBut let's not forget about the G-CSF. It could be contributing to the immature cells, but it doesn't explain everything. We should consider that when thinking about the severity of the condition.\n\nIn the end, AML is still the top suspect, but we should keep an eye on how things develop, especially since he's just had G-CSF.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). The presence of a high number of blasts in the blood, along with a mix of immature white blood cells, strongly suggests a myeloid neoplasm such as AML. The flow cytometry findings of CD34+/CD117+ cells further support this diagnosis, as these markers are associated with stem/progenitor cells often seen in AML. While the recent administration of G-CSF could contribute to the immature cell profile, it does not fully account for the severity of the anemia and thrombocytopenia or the significant number of blasts. Therefore, AML remains the most probable diagnosis. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)**\n2. Myelodysplastic Syndromes\n3. Myeloproliferative Neoplasm (e.g., Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia)\n4. Aplastic Anemia\n5. Maturation Arrest secondary to G-CSF\n6. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (less likely given the myeloid markers)\n7. Bone Marrow Suppression/Failure\n8. Parvovirus B19 Infection\n9. Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis\n10. Drug-Induced Aplastic Anemia\n\nEach of these conditions was considered based on the combination of symptoms, blood test abnormalities, and the recent use of G-CSF.

She disclosed a history of macular degeneration in both eyes and retinal detachment in the left eye that was treated 35 years previously. Medical history revealed cutaneous basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, both treated surgically. On examination, visual acuity was 20/50 OD and 20/400 OS. External examination showed posterior-chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes and conjunctival scarring in the left eye from circumferential scleral buckle surgery with no visible extraocular tumor. Fundus evaluation showed macular drusen in the right eye and a pale optic disc with geographic macular atrophy in the left eye, explaining her visual acuity of 20/400 OS. In addition, a shallow circumferential buckle effect and an inferotemporal mass measuring 15.0 × 10.0 mm in basal dimension and 9.1 mm in thickness (Figure, A) were seen in the left eye. The mass appeared elevated, amelanotic with overlying retinal vasculature, and with chorioretinal atrophy. No retinal detachment or breaks were seen. By ultrasonography the mass was echolucent (Figure, A inset). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a T1, T2-hypointense shallow circumferential band in the left eye. In addition, there was an inferotemporal nodular mass in the left eye showing T1 (gadolinium) hypointense, T2-hyperintense features, underlying the encircling buckle, and with adjacent subtle delineation. There was no enhancement with gadolinium (Figure, B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Expanded hydrogel scleral sponge", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an 81-year-old woman who's been having trouble seeing out of her left eye for the past six months. That's quite a while to be dealing with vision issues. She's been referred to a specialist because they suspect a choroidal melanoma. That's a serious possibility, so let's keep that in mind.\n\nNow, she's had some eye problems before. Macular degeneration in both eyes and a retinal detachment in the left one that was fixed 35 years ago. Wow, that's a long time ago. And she's also had some skin cancers, basal cell and squamous cell, but those were treated with surgery. Okay, so she's got a bit of a history with cancers.\n\nWhen we look at her eyes, her right eye isn't too bad, 20/50 vision. But the left eye is really struggling at 20/400. That's a big difference. And there are intraocular lenses in both eyes, which suggests she's had cataract surgery. There's also scarring on the left eye from that old retinal detachment surgery. No extraocular tumor, so that's good.\n\nLooking at the fundus, the right eye has macular drusen, which fits with her macular degeneration history. The left eye has a pale optic disc and geographic macular atrophy, which explains the poor vision. But there's also a mass in the left eye. It's 15 by 10 mm and 9.1 mm thick. That's pretty significant.\n\nThe mass is amelanotic, which means it doesn't have a lot of pigment, and it's got retinal vessels over it. There's also chorioretinal atrophy. No retinal detachment or breaks, so it's not causing those issues. The ultrasound shows it's echolucent, which means it's not very reflective, possibly indicating a serous or fluid-filled component.\n\nThe MRI is interesting. The mass is T1 and T2 hypointense, and it doesn't enhance with gadolinium. That suggests it's not very vascular. It's also T2 hyperintense, which could mean it's got fluid or serous components.\n\nSo, what could this be? Choroidal melanoma is still on the list because of its size and location, but the lack of enhancement is odd. Melanomas usually show some gadolinium uptake. Let's think about other possibilities.\n\nCould it be a choroidal nevus? They're usually smaller and more pigmented, but maybe. How about a choroidal hemangioma? They can be T2 hyperintense, but they usually enhance with gadolinium. Hmm, not likely.\n\nWhat about an osteoma? They're typically hyperintense on T1 and have a distinctive appearance on imaging. This doesn't quite fit. A metastatic tumor could be possible, but there's no other history of cancer spread.\n\nMaybe it's a schwannoma. They can be well-defined and have variable signal characteristics. That might fit. Or could it be a vortex vein varix? Those can appear as masses and have blood flow characteristics, but they're usually more enhancing.\n\nLet's not forget about a ciliary body medulloepithelioma. Those are rare but can have a similar appearance. And there's always the possibility of a congenital condition like a coloboma, but that would likely have been noticed earlier.\n\nSo, after thinking it through, I'd say the top possibilities are choroidal melanoma, schwannoma, and maybe a ciliary body medulloepithelioma. The lack of enhancement makes melanoma less likely, but we can't rule it out completely. Schwannoma seems like a strong contender given the imaging characteristics.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the mass in the left eye of the 81-year-old woman:\n\n1. **Choroidal Melanoma** - Although it's a strong initial consideration due to the size and location, the lack of gadolinium enhancement on MRI makes this less likely.\n\n2. **Choroidal Nevus** - Typically smaller and more pigmented, but could be considered given the chronic nature of the symptoms.\n\n3. **Choroidal Hemangioma** - Possible due to T2 hyperintensity, but usually shows gadolinium enhancement, which is absent here.\n\n4. **Schwannoma** - A well-defined mass with variable signal characteristics on MRI, making it a plausible option.\n\n5. **Osteoma** - Usually hyperintense on T1 and has a distinctive appearance, which doesn't quite match the findings.\n\n6. **Metastatic Tumor** - Possible, but there's no history of other primary cancers or metastatic disease.\n\n7. **Vortex Vein Varix** - Could appear as a mass with blood flow characteristics, but typically shows more enhancement.\n\n8. **Ciliary Body Medulloepithelioma** - A rare tumor that could fit the imaging characteristics, especially given the location and appearance.\n\n9. **Coloboma** - A congenital condition, but would likely have been detected earlier in life.\n\n10. **Choroidal Metastasis from a Primary Skin Cancer** - Given her history of skin cancers, this could be a consideration, although less common.\n\nAfter considering all the information and test results, the top differential diagnoses are **Schwannoma**, **Choroidal Melanoma**, and **Ciliary Body Medulloepithelioma**, with schwannoma being the most likely given the imaging characteristics and lack of enhancement.", "topic": "['Health Care Safety', 'Retinal Disorders', 'Ophthalmology', 'Macular Diseases']"}

No extracutaneous involvement was observed. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa (EBP)", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her 30s with these itchy, red to purple bumps and plaques on her left shin. They've been there for over 10 years. That's a long time, so we're probably looking at something chronic. \n\nFirst, I'm thinking about lichen planus. It's known for those violaceous papules, and it can definitely be itchy. Plus, it can hang around for a long time. That seems to fit pretty well. \n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. What about discoid lupus erythematosus? It can cause chronic skin lesions too, and they can be quite persistent. The fact that there's no mucosal or systemic involvement might make this less likely, but it's still worth considering. \n\nNow, I'm thinking about follicular lichen planus. It's a variant of lichen planus that affects the hair follicles. But, there's no mention of hair loss or follicular involvement here, so maybe that's not it. \n\nHmm, what about psoriasis? It can cause plaques, but they're usually more scaly than what's described here. Plus, psoriasis often has other characteristics like pitting or oil spots on the nails, which aren't mentioned. So, probably not psoriasis. \n\nLet's consider eczema, or atopic dermatitis. It's itchy and can cause papules, but it's usually more widespread and often starts in childhood. This doesn't seem to match perfectly either. \n\nOh, and there's granuloma annulare. It can cause papules, but they're usually flesh-colored and not itchy. That doesn't quite fit what we're seeing here. \n\nNow, I'm thinking about lichen simplex chronicus. It's caused by chronic scratching, leading to thickened, itchy plaques. That could match the description, especially with the long duration. \n\nWhat about sarcoidosis? It can cause skin plaques, but there's usually systemic involvement too, like lung or lymph node issues. Since there's no mention of that, it's probably not sarcoidosis. \n\nLet's not forget about infections like cutaneous tuberculosis or leprosy. They can cause chronic skin lesions, but there are usually other symptoms or characteristics that aren't mentioned here. \n\nOkay, so after thinking through all of this, I'm leaning towards lichen planus as the most likely diagnosis. It fits the description and the long duration. Lichen simplex chronicus is a close second, given the itchiness and chronic nature, but I think lichen planus is a better fit overall.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the described skin condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Lichen Planus** - Known for its violaceous papules and chronic, itchy nature, making it a strong contender.\n2. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus** - Can cause chronic skin lesions, although the lack of systemic involvement makes it less likely.\n3. **Follicular Lichen Planus** - A variant of lichen planus, but the absence of hair involvement makes this less probable.\n4. **Psoriasis** - Typically presents with more scaly plaques and often involves nail changes, which are not described here.\n5. **Atopic Dermatitis (Eczema)** - Itchy and can cause papules, but usually more widespread and starts earlier in life.\n6. **Granuloma Annulare** - Usually presents with flesh-colored, non-itchy papules, which doesn't match the description.\n7. **Lichen Simplex Chronicus** - Caused by chronic scratching, leading to thickened, itchy plaques, fitting the long duration.\n8. **Sarcoidosis** - Typically involves systemic symptoms, which are not mentioned, making it less likely.\n9. **Cutaneous Tuberculosis** - Usually has additional symptoms or characteristics not described here.\n10. **Leprosy** - Chronic skin condition with specific characteristics and symptoms not mentioned in the case.\n\nAfter considering all the possibilities and the details provided, **Lichen Planus** emerges as the most likely diagnosis, given the chronic, itchy, violaceous papules and plaques without systemic involvement. **Lichen Simplex Chronicus** is a close second due to the chronic itchiness and plaque formation, but **Lichen Planus** fits the overall presentation more accurately.", "topic": "['Dermatology']"}

On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU, and intraocular pressures were normal in both eyes. Results of slitlamp examination of the right eye were unremarkable. Slitlamp examination of the left eye revealed a round, pigmented lesion measuring 3 × 3 mm in basal dimension and with gravitational shifting within the anterior chamber fluid with patient head tilt (Video). There was no corneal guttatae or edema. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography depicted the lesion in the anterior chamber angle abutting the corneal endothelium and resting on the iris stroma with no internal fluid level and no solid component. Ultrasound biomicroscopy confirmed the lesion to be cystic with a thickness of 1.6 mm. Dilated fundus examination revealed normal findings in both eyes. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Free-floating iris pigment epithelium cyst", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 13-year-old boy who had some kind of sports-related trauma to his left eye. Now, he's got this pigmented spot on his iris that he didn't even notice. It's not causing him any trouble, but we need to figure out what it is.\n\nFirst off, the fact that it's pigmented and on the iris makes me think of a few things. One common possibility is a congenital iris nevus. These are usually stable and don't cause symptoms, so that's a strong contender right off the bat.\n\nBut wait, there's more to consider. The lesion is moving around when he tilts his head. That's interesting because it suggests it's not solidly attached. This kind of movement makes me think of something cystic, like an iris cyst. These can be present without causing any issues, just like what we're seeing here.\n\nNow, let's not forget the history of trauma. Trauma can cause various things, like a hyphema, which is blood in the anterior chamber. But this isn't a new symptom; it's been there long enough to be considered chronic. So, could it be a hemosiderin deposit from an old bleed? That's possible, but it doesn't quite fit the description of a cystic lesion.\n\nHmm, what about other cystic lesions? An iris implantation cyst could be a possibility. These can happen after trauma when epithelial cells get trapped. It's a bit of a stretch, but it's worth considering.\n\nLet's also think about less common things, like a melanoma. But melanomas are usually more aggressive and symptomatic, and this kid's lesion isn't showing any of those signs. So, that's probably not it.\n\nOh, and there's the possibility of a foreign body. If something got into his eye during the trauma, that could cause a reaction and form a cystic lesion. But there's no mention of a foreign body in the exam, so that's a long shot.\n\nNow, let's go back to the idea of an iris nevus. These are common in kids and usually benign. The fact that it's not causing any problems and has been stable makes this a strong possibility.\n\nBut wait, what about a branchial cyst? These aren't typically on the iris, but let's not rule it out completely. It's a bit uncommon, but it could fit the description.\n\nAnd then there's the idea of a congenital iris coloboma. These are usually more obvious and don't really match the cystic nature of this lesion. So, that's probably not it.\n\nFinally, let's consider a simple corneal foreign body. If something was on the cornea, it could cause irritation and maybe lead to a cystic reaction. But again, there's no sign of that on the exam.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the most likely explanation is an iris cyst, probably related to the previous trauma. It matches the description of being cystic and movable. An iris nevus is also a possibility, but the cystic nature of the lesion makes me lean towards the cyst.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the pigmented iris lesion in the 13-year-old boy, considering the history of blunt trauma and the cystic nature of the lesion:\n\n1. **Iris Nevus** - A common, benign pigmented lesion that is usually stable and asymptomatic.\n2. **Iris Cyst** - Suggested by the gravitational shifting of the lesion, indicating it is not solidly attached and may be cystic in nature.\n3. **Hemosiderin Deposit** - A possible result of previous trauma, where blood products deposit in the iris, but less likely given the cystic description.\n4. **Iris Implantation Cyst** - Could have formed after trauma if epithelial cells were trapped, leading to a cystic lesion.\n5. **Melanoma** - Although unlikely in a child and typically more aggressive, it's important to consider, but the lack of symptoms makes it less probable.\n6. **Foreign Body Reaction** - If a foreign object entered the eye during trauma, it could cause a cystic reaction, but there's no mention of a foreign body on examination.\n7. **Branchial Cyst** - Uncommon on the iris, but could potentially fit the description of a cystic lesion.\n8. **Iris Coloboma** - Typically more obvious and not cystic, making it less likely in this case.\n9. **Corneal Foreign Body** - If present, could cause irritation, but no signs were noted on examination.\n10. **Traumatic Hyphema** - Chronic blood in the anterior chamber from previous trauma, but the cystic nature of the lesion doesn't align well with this.\n\nReranking these possibilities based on the cystic characteristics and history of trauma, the top differentials are:\n\n1. **Iris Cyst** - Most consistent with the cystic and movable nature of the lesion.\n2. **Iris Implantation Cyst** - Possible given the history of trauma and cystic features.\n3. **Iris Nevus** - Remains a possibility due to its commonality and benign nature, though less likely given the cystic aspect.\n\nThese rankings prioritize the cystic and historical trauma elements, leaning towards an iris cyst or implantation cyst as the most likely explanations.", "topic": "['Adolescent Medicine', 'Ophthalmology', 'Sports Medicine', 'Pediatrics']"}

The patient used a wheelchair due to a right-sided hemiparesis and hemianopsia caused by an intracranial hemorrhage. At the age of 4 years, recurrent seizures had led to the diagnosis of cerebral venous malformations. Clinical examination also demonstrated a lipolymphedema of the lower legs that had been attributed to a functional venous insufficiency with insufficient venous pump activity.

The family history was positive for cerebral venous malformations involving the patient’s father and aunt, the father having died of an intracranial hemorrhage in his early 70s. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Familial cerebral cavernous malformations", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her early 50s with these bluish, keratotic bumps on her legs. They've been there for ages, growing slowly, and sometimes bleeding if she knocks them. That's interesting. She's also got some neurological stuff going on, like seizures and a history of a brain bleed that's left her with some paralysis. Plus, there's this lipolymphedema on her legs. And her family history? Yeah, her dad and aunt have similar brain issues. So, what could be going on here?\n\nFirst off, those skin lesions. They're bluish and bleed easily, which makes me think of something vascular, like a venous malformation. That seems like a reasonable starting point.\n\nNow, let's think about the neurological symptoms. She's had seizures and a serious brain bleed. That's pretty significant. Cerebral venous malformations could definitely be a factor here. They can cause bleeding and seizures, so that fits.\n\nBut wait, there's more to consider. The family history is really striking. Her dad and aunt have similar issues, and her dad died from a brain bleed. That suggests something hereditary. Could this be part of a genetic syndrome?\n\nHmm, what about the lipolymphedema? That's not just a random finding. It could be related to the venous issues, but it might also point to a systemic problem. Let's keep that in mind.\n\nOkay, so we've got skin lesions, neurological issues, and a family history that all seem connected. This is starting to sound like a genetic vascular disorder. Maybe something like Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, which is also known as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. That would explain the skin lesions and the brain issues.\n\nBut let's not jump to conclusions too fast. We should consider other possibilities. How about Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus syndrome? That involves venous malformations too, and it could explain the skin findings and the bleeding.\n\nOh, and we can't forget about Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. That involves vascular malformations and could explain the lipolymphedema. It's another possibility to keep in mind.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? We've got a few options. Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome seems like a strong contender because it ties together the skin, neurological, and family history aspects. But Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus syndrome and Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome are also worth considering.\n\nIn the end, after thinking it all through, Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome seems like the best fit. It explains the combination of symptoms and the hereditary nature of the condition. Yeah, that makes the most sense.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnoses for the patient's condition are as follows:\n\n1. **Osler-Weber-Rendu Syndrome (Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia)**: This genetic disorder is characterized by telangiectasias, which are small vascular malformations that can appear on the skin and organs, and can lead to bleeding. The neurological symptoms and family history of cerebral venous malformations align well with this diagnosis.\n\n2. **Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus Syndrome**: This condition involves multiple venous malformations that can appear as bluish, compressible papules, similar to the patient's skin lesions. It can also lead to bleeding and has systemic implications.\n\n3. **Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome**: This syndrome is characterized by vascular malformations, which can include venous malformations and lymphatic abnormalities, potentially explaining the lipolymphedema.\n\n4. **Cerebroretinal Vasculopathy**: This is a hereditary condition that affects the small blood vessels in the brain and eyes, which could relate to the patient's neurological symptoms.\n\n5. **Ataxia Telangiectasia**: Although primarily known for neurological degeneration and immune system problems, it can involve vascular abnormalities and skin changes.\n\n6. **Sturge-Weber Syndrome**: This neurocutaneous disorder involves port-wine stains and neurological manifestations like seizures, but it doesn't typically involve the type of skin lesions described.\n\n7. **Maffucci Syndrome**: This condition involves multiple enchondromas and hemangiomas, which are benign vascular tumors, but it doesn't typically feature the neurological symptoms seen here.\n\n8. **Proteus Syndrome**: A disorder of overgrowth that can involve vascular malformations, but it's more characterized by asymmetric growth and other distinct features not highlighted in this case.\n\n9. **Capillary Malformation-Arteriovenous Malformation Syndrome**: This involves vascular malformations that could explain some symptoms, but it doesn't typically include the full spectrum of findings.\n\n10. **PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome**: This includes conditions like Cowden syndrome, which can involve vascular malformations and neurological symptoms, but it's more associated with hamartomas and certain cancers.\n\nAfter considering all the information, Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome emerges as the most likely diagnosis due to the combination of skin lesions, neurological history, and hereditary pattern. However, Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus syndrome and Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome are also strong contenders that should be considered based on the specific symptoms presented.", "topic": "['Cerebrovascular Disease', 'Dermatology', 'Cutaneous Vascular Malformations', 'Neurology', 'Pediatrics']"}

At the time of the examination, his symptoms had resolved; however, he had a photograph from a cellular phone taken during the episode (Figure 1). The photograph shows an irregular, serpiginous extension from beneath the plica semilunaris toward the corneal limbus with localized conjunctival hyperemia. He reported a similar sensation of movement in his left eye that occurred for 1 night about 5 years ago for which he visited an urgent care center where he was diagnosed with allergic conjunctivitis. He also reported recent swelling of the left side of his face with associated numbness and occasional swelling of his left hand, all of which resolved after a few days. He had immigrated from Nigeria 10 years prior, had not returned since, and was working as a traveling nurse. A slitlamp examination did not reveal any conjunctival hyperemia, foreign bodies, or other abnormalities like those shown in the photograph. His uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20, extraocular movements were full and without pain or abnormal sensation, and intraocular pressure was normal. His dilated fundus examination was unremarkable.

We've got a 33-year-old guy who's been dealing with this weird sensation in his left eye. He says it feels like something's pulling and popping. That's pretty unusual, right? And he's got a photo from when it happened before. Let's take a look at that.\n\nThe photo shows something strange going on with his eye. There's this irregular, kind of snake-like thing extending from under the plica semilunaris towards the corneal limbus. That's definitely not normal. Plus, there's some redness around that area. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nHe's had this sensation before, about 5 years ago. Back then, they told him it was allergic conjunctivitis. But this doesn't really seem like an allergy to me. Allergies usually make your eyes itch and get watery, not have things moving around in them.\n\nNow, let's think about his background. He moved here from Nigeria 10 years ago and hasn't been back. That's a part of the world where certain infections are more common. Could that be a clue?\n\nHe's also had some swelling on the left side of his face and numbness. And his left hand swells up sometimes too. That's odd. It sounds like something systemic might be going on, maybe something that affects his blood flow or immune system.\n\nOh, and there's this blood test result. His eosinophil count is a bit high, but just relatively. Eosinophils often go up when there's a parasite involved or some kind of allergic reaction. So, parasites or some immune reaction could be in the mix.\n\nLet's put this all together. The eye thing, the past diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis that didn't quite fit, his time in Nigeria, the weird swelling and numbness, and the eosinophils. It's pointing towards something like a parasitic infection. Maybe something like loiasis, which is common in West Africa. That's known for causing eye symptoms and can cause eosinophilia.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. We should consider other possibilities too. Could it be something like angioedema? That can cause swelling and might explain the facial and hand symptoms. But it doesn't really fit with the eye movement or the eosinophilia.\n\nHow about a vascular issue, like a dural arteriovenous fistula? That could cause some weird symptoms, but it doesn't quite match the parasitic infection theory.\n\nLet's think about other parasitic diseases too, like onchocerciasis. That's also from Africa and can affect the eyes. But it usually causes more long-term eye problems, not just these sudden episodes.\n\nOkay, so what about an allergic reaction like papilloedema? That can cause some eye symptoms, but it doesn't explain the systemic swelling or eosinophilia.\n\nMaybe it's a neurologic issue, like a nerve palsy. But that wouldn't explain the eosinophilia or the swelling.\n\nLet's not forget about infections like tuberculosis or Lyme disease. They can cause a range of symptoms, but they don't quite fit the bill here either.\n\nAfter thinking it all through, loiasis still seems like the best fit. It matches the eye symptoms, the eosinophilia, and his travel history. But we should keep an open mind and consider other possibilities too, just in case.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, considering his symptoms, history, and test results:\n\n1. **Loiasis** - This parasitic infection, common in West Africa, can cause eye symptoms and is consistent with the patient's travel history and eosinophilia.\n\n2. **Angioedema** - This condition can cause swelling and may explain the facial and hand symptoms, but it doesn't account for the eye movement or eosinophilia.\n\n3. **Onchocerciasis** - Another parasitic disease from Africa that affects the eyes, but it typically causes more chronic eye issues rather than sudden episodes.\n\n4. **Dural Arteriovenous Fistula** - A vascular issue that could cause unusual symptoms, but it doesn't align well with the parasitic infection theory or eosinophilia.\n\n5. **Papilloedema** - An allergic reaction that can cause eye symptoms, but it doesn't explain the systemic swelling or eosinophilia.\n\n6. **Nerve Palsy** - A neurologic issue that might explain some symptoms, but it doesn't account for the eosinophilia or swelling.\n\n7. **Tuberculosis** - A systemic infection that can cause a range of symptoms, but it doesn't fit well with the specific eye symptoms and eosinophilia.\n\n8. **Lyme Disease** - An infectious disease that can have varied symptoms, but it doesn't match the patient's travel history or specific symptoms.\n\n9. **Migraine with Aura** - A neurovascular condition that can cause visual disturbances, but it doesn't explain the eosinophilia or systemic swelling.\n\n10. **Churg-Strauss Syndrome** - A systemic vasculitis that can cause eosinophilia and swelling, but it doesn't fit well with the specific eye symptoms.\n\nAfter considering all the information, loiasis remains the most likely diagnosis due to its alignment with the patient's eye symptoms, travel history, and eosinophilia.

The patient reported having a similar episode of rash and delayed wound healing after laparoscopy 1 year prior to presentation. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Allergic contact dermatitis due to use of surgical skin glue", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 42-year-old woman who's just had a bilateral mastectomy, and now she's dealing with a rash and some pretty troubling wound healing issues. She's also got a history of asthma and seasonal allergies, which might be important. \n\nFirst off, the timing of the rash is interesting. It showed up about five days after her surgery, and then a couple of days later, she got this papulovesicular rash all over her trunk and extremities. That's a bit of a red flag for something systemic, don't you think? \n\nSo, what could be going on here? My first thought is an infection. Surgical sites can get infected, and that could explain the erythema and drainage. But wait, they did a bacterial culture, and it came back negative. Plus, she didn't get better with antibiotics. That makes a bacterial infection seem pretty unlikely. \n\nHmm, what about an allergic reaction? She's got a history of allergies, so maybe she reacted to something. Could be the antibiotics themselves, or maybe something else she was exposed to in the hospital. That would fit with the rash and the timing. \n\nBut then, there's this issue of poor wound healing. That's not typically what you see with a simple allergic reaction, is it? It makes me think of something more systemic, like a hypersensitivity reaction. Maybe something like erythema multiforme? That can happen after surgery and would explain the rash and the wound issues. \n\nOh, and she mentioned having a similar problem after a laparoscopy last year. That's a big clue. It suggests that whatever's happening might be related to the surgery itself or something they're using in surgery. \n\nCould it be an issue with surgical materials? Like, maybe a reaction to sutures or something else they use in the OR? That would explain why it's happened twice after surgery. \n\nLet's not forget about autoimmune disorders. Conditions like lupus or dermatomyositis could cause a rash and wound healing problems. But, those usually have other symptoms, and I don't see any mention of that here. \n\nSo, where does that leave us? I think we're looking at some kind of hypersensitivity or allergic reaction, maybe to something used during surgery. The fact that it's happened before after another surgical procedure really points in that direction. \n\nYeah, that makes sense. A hypersensitivity reaction related to the surgery seems to fit all the pieces together.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Hypersensitivity Reaction**: Given the patient's history of allergies and the timing of the rash post-surgery, a hypersensitivity reaction to a substance used during the surgical procedure is a strong possibility.\n\n2. **Autoimmune Disorder**: Conditions like lupus or dermatomyositis could cause a rash and wound healing issues, but they typically present with other systemic symptoms.\n\n3. **Infectious Etiology**: Although the bacterial culture was negative and antibiotics were ineffective, a viral or atypical infection could still be considered.\n\n4. **Medication Reaction**: A reaction to cefadroxil or another medication used perioperatively could cause a rash, but the lack of response to antibiotics makes this less likely.\n\n5. **Suture or Surgical Material Reaction**: The recurrence of symptoms after a previous surgery suggests a possible reaction to materials used in surgery, such as sutures.\n\n6. **Erythema Multiforme**: This condition can occur post-surgery and is characterized by a papulovesicular rash, fitting the patient's presentation.\n\n7. **Contact Dermatitis**: Exposure to a new substance during the hospital stay could have triggered contact dermatitis.\n\n8. **Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSSS)**: Although more common in children, SSSS could cause widespread rash and skin issues.\n\n9. **Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN)**: A severe reaction to medication, characterized by skin detachment, but usually more extensive than the described rash.\n\n10. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**: Given the patient's history of breast cancer, a paraneoplastic syndrome could be considered, though it's less likely without other systemic symptoms.\n\nReranking these possibilities based on the patient's history and test results, the top three differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Hypersensitivity Reaction** related to surgical materials or medications.\n2. **Suture or Surgical Material Reaction**, given the history of similar symptoms after a previous surgery.\n3. **Erythema Multiforme**, considering the timing and nature of the rash post-surgery.\n\nThese diagnoses align with the patient's symptoms, history, and the negative bacterial culture, highlighting the likelihood of a systemic or allergic reaction related to the surgical process.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Allergy and Clinical Immunology', \"Women's Health\", 'Breast Cancer', 'Oncology']"}

The patient had previously been diagnosed with elephantiasis nostras verrucosa, and she was advised to elevate and compress the leg but was unavailable for follow-up. Her medical history was notable for morbid obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and stroke. She reported no fever, fatigue, weight changes, gastrointestinal symptoms, difficulty concentrating, anxiety, or hyperhidrosis. Physical examination results revealed multiple firm skin-colored papules and nodules coalescing to form a large plaque on the anterior aspect of the left lower leg, whereas the right lower leg had diffuse induration and hyperpigmentation (Figure 1). There was no palpable lymphadenopathy. Laboratory analysis revealed normal complete blood cell count, thyroid function, serum protein electrophoresis, and serum immunofixation. A biopsy of a left leg nodule was performed. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Euthyroid pretibial mucinosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her 60s with a history of elephantiasis nostras verrucosa, which is a pretty severe form of chronic lymphedema. She's dealing with pain in her left leg, and she's got these firm skin-colored papules and nodules that are forming a large plaque. That's definitely something to pay attention to.\n\nFirst off, considering her history, lymphangiosarcoma comes to mind. It's a rare but serious cancer that can develop in cases of chronic lymphedema. That's a strong possibility given her background.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. We should think about other possibilities too. The fact that she has these nodules and plaques makes me think of a neoplastic process. Maybe something like a liposarcoma? It's a type of cancer that arises from fat tissue, and it could explain the firm masses.\n\nNow, let's consider infections. With her history of chronic changes in the leg, maybe an infection like mycobacterial infection or even a deep fungal infection could be at play. These can cause nodules and chronic skin changes.\n\nOh, and what about vascular issues? Her legs have been affected for a long time, so chronic venous insufficiency could be causing some of these changes. That might explain the hyperpigmentation and induration.\n\nBut then again, we can't ignore metabolic or systemic conditions. With her obesity, diabetes, and past stroke, maybe there's a metabolic component. Could it be necrobiosis lipoidica? That's associated with diabetes and can cause skin changes.\n\nHmm, let's not forget about other skin conditions. Discoid lupus could cause nodules and plaques, although it's not as common in this context.\n\nAnd then there's the possibility of a benign condition like angiolipoma. These are benign tumors made up of fat and blood vessels, which could fit her symptoms.\n\nNow, let's think about the biopsy results. If they show any atypical cells or signs of malignancy, that would definitely sway us towards something like lymphangiosarcoma or liposarcoma.\n\nBut if the biopsy is more inflammatory, maybe we're looking at an infection or a condition like necrobiosis lipoidica.\n\nAlright, let's put it all together. Considering her history and the physical findings, lymphangiosarcoma is still high on the list. But we can't ignore liposarcoma or the possibility of an infection. Necrobiosis lipoidica is also a contender given her diabetes.\n\nIn the end, I think lymphangiosarcoma is the most likely diagnosis, followed closely by liposarcoma. The other conditions, while possible, seem less likely given the overall picture.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Lymphangiosarcoma** - Given the patient's history of chronic lymphedema and the development of nodules and plaques, this rare but serious cancer is a strong consideration.\n\n2. **Liposarcoma** - The firm masses and nodules could suggest a neoplastic process like liposarcoma, a cancer arising from fat tissue.\n\n3. **Mycobacterial Infection** - Chronic skin changes and nodules could be indicative of an infection like mycobacterial infection.\n\n4. **Deep Fungal Infection** - Similar to mycobacterial infection, a deep fungal infection could cause chronic skin changes and nodules.\n\n5. **Chronic Venous Insufficiency** - The hyperpigmentation and induration of the legs might be attributed to chronic venous issues.\n\n6. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica** - Associated with diabetes, this condition can cause skin changes and is a possible contender.\n\n7. **Discoid Lupus** - Although less common in this context, discoid lupus could cause nodules and plaques.\n\n8. **Angiolipoma** - Benign tumors made of fat and blood vessels could explain the firm masses.\n\n9. **Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia with Skin Involvement** - Although the blood tests were normal, skin involvement in CLL could mimic these findings.\n\n10. **Pseudolymphoma** - A reactive lymphoid proliferation could present with similar skin manifestations.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top three differential diagnoses, in order of likelihood, are:\n\n1. **Lymphangiosarcoma** - Given the patient's history and physical findings, this remains the most likely diagnosis.\n2. **Liposarcoma** - The presence of firm masses and nodules makes this a close second.\n3. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica** - The patient's diabetes and skin changes make this a plausible consideration.\n\nThese diagnoses take into account the patient's history of elephantiasis nostras verrucosa, her current symptoms, and the potential biopsy outcomes.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Obesity', 'Venous Disease']"}

The lesion initially started as a small cutaneous nodule without obvious triggers that gradually developed and enlarged to form a red-colored tumor with a hard nodule inside. There was no history of local trauma or insect bite. Her personal, past, and family histories were unremarkable. On physical examination, there was a 6 × 6-cm protuberant, thick-walled, and well-defined red bullalike tumor on the right upper arm, which extended 1 to 3 cm from the epidermal surface (Figure, A). Inside the tumor, a nontender, firm-to-hard nodule was palpated. There was no regional lymphadenopathy, and results of the rest of the physical and systemic examinations were normal. Laboratory examinations of hematologic, biochemical, and urinalysis tests were normal. The tumor was excised completely under local anesthesia, and part of the tissue was sent for pathological examination. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Bullous pilomatricoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 16-year-old girl with a red tumor on her arm. It's been growing for six months, and there's a hard nodule inside. That's interesting. It's not painful, and there's no history of trauma or bug bites. Hmm, that's good to know.\n\nFirst, let's consider what this could be. A hemangioma comes to mind. They're pretty common and can definitely appear as red, raised lesions. But, let's not jump to conclusions just yet.\n\nNext, I'm thinking about a pyogenic granuloma. These can also be red and nodular, and they sometimes appear out of the blue. But, they tend to bleed easily, and this one doesn't seem to be bleeding. So, maybe not that.\n\nNow, what about a dermatofibroma? They're firm and nodular, kind of like what we're seeing here. But, they're usually more flesh-colored or brown, not really red. Hmm, maybe not the best fit.\n\nLet's not forget about malignant possibilities like angiosarcoma. These can be red and aggressive, but they often come with more systemic signs, and she seems otherwise healthy. Plus, she's only 16, so it's less likely. But, we can't rule it out completely just yet.\n\nOh, and there's Kaposi's sarcoma. It's another vascular tumor that can be red, but it's usually associated with immune suppression or other lesions, which she doesn't have. So, that's probably not it.\n\nNow, bacillary angiomatosis could be a consideration. It's more common in immunocompromised individuals, but it can cause red lesions. Still, she's healthy, so this seems unlikely.\n\nWait, what about a spindle cell hemangioma? These can have a mix of vascular and fibrous components, which might explain the hard nodule. That sounds like a good fit.\n\nAlso, let's think about a glomus tumor. These are usually painful and blue-purple, but maybe there's a variant that presents differently. It's worth considering.\n\nAnd then there's the possibility of a desmoplastic hemangioma. These can be more fibrous and might match the hard nodule we're feeling. That's another one to keep in mind.\n\nFinally, let's not forget about a fibroma. A superficial fibroma could explain the hard nodule, but it's usually not red. Still, it's a possibility.\n\nSo, after going through all of this, I think the top possibilities are spindle cell hemangioma, glomus tumor, and desmoplastic hemangioma. These seem to fit the best with what we're seeing. We'll need a biopsy to be sure, but these are my leading thoughts.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the red tumor on the 16-year-old girl's arm, with a focus on one potential diagnosis per step:\n\n1. **Hemangioma** - A common vascular tumor that can appear as a red, raised lesion.\n2. **Pyogenic Granuloma** - A rapidly growing, red nodular lesion that often appears without a clear cause.\n3. **Dermatofibroma** - A firm, nodular lesion that, while usually flesh-colored or brown, could potentially appear red.\n4. **Angiosarcoma** - A malignant vascular tumor that can present as a red, aggressive lesion, though rare in this age group.\n5. **Kaposi's Sarcoma** - A vascular tumor associated with immune suppression, typically presenting with multiple lesions.\n6. **Bacillary Angiomatosis** - Associated with immunocompromised states, presenting with red lesions, but unlikely in a healthy individual.\n7. **Spindle Cell Hemangioma** - A vascular tumor with both vascular and fibrous components, potentially explaining the hard nodule.\n8. **Glomus Tumor** - Usually painful and blue-purple, but could present atypically as a red lesion.\n9. **Desmoplastic Hemangioma** - A fibrous and vascular lesion that might match the hard nodule within the tumor.\n10. **Fibroma** - A benign tumor that could explain the hard nodule, though typically not red.\n\nAfter considering all the possibilities and the patient's age and health status, the top differential diagnoses are **Spindle Cell Hemangioma**, **Glomus Tumor**, and **Desmoplastic Hemangioma**, as these align well with the clinical presentation.

He had no nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, melena, or hematochezia but reported a cough productive of yellow sputum, dyspnea on exertion, and fatigue. The patient had been treated for presumed pneumonia with 3 courses of azithromycin over the prior 3 months due to infiltrates on a chest radiograph. He reported no known ill contacts or recent travel outside the US. At presentation, his heart rate and blood pressure were normal, and oxygen saturation was 95% on room air. Physical examination revealed a maculopapular rash over his neck and chest (Figure, left panel) and bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation. Laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 14.3 × 103/μL (reference, 4.2-9.1 × 103/μL); creatine kinase level, 2060 U/L (34.40 μkat/L) (reference, 44-196 U/L [0.73-3.27 μkat/L]), aldolase level, 18 U/L (0.30 μkat/L) (reference, <8 U/L [<0.13 μkat/L]), C-reactive protein level, 30 mg/L (reference, <8 mg/L), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 35 mm/h (reference, <20 mm/h). Antinuclear antibody immunofluorescent assay findings were positive. Results from testing for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C were negative. A barium swallow study showed no visualized aspiration.

He's been treated for pneumonia a few times, but it just keeps coming back. That's odd.\n\nNow, he's got a rash and some muscle issues, with high levels of creatine kinase and aldolase. That's pointing towards muscle inflammation. And his inflammatory markers are up too. Hmm, could this be something like polymyositis or dermatomyositis? Those conditions can cause skin rashes and muscle weakness.\n\nBut wait, there's more. He's also got these lung issues. The chest CT shows some consolidations and ground glass opacities. That sounds like it could be an infection, but it could also be something like interstitial lung disease. And with his muscle symptoms, that makes me think of a connective tissue disease.\n\nLet's not forget the esophageal problems. He's having dysphagia, and the barium swallow didn't show aspiration, but the endoscopy found some ulcers. That could be related to a motility disorder, which can happen in conditions like scleroderma or mixed connective tissue disease.\n\nOkay, so what's tying all of this together? The skin rash, muscle inflammation, and lung issues are making me think of dermatomyositis. It's known for causing skin rashes and muscle weakness, and it can involve the lungs too.\n\nBut, I should consider other possibilities. Could it be lupus? That can cause a range of symptoms including rashes, muscle pain, and lung issues. Or maybe it's scleroderma, which can affect the skin and esophagus, and sometimes the lungs.\n\nOh, and what about sarcoidosis? That can cause lung problems and skin issues, and it might explain the high inflammatory markers. But it doesn't usually cause the same level of muscle involvement.\n\nAfter thinking it through, I'm leaning towards dermatomyositis. It fits well with the rash, muscle symptoms, and lung involvement. But I should keep lupus and scleroderma in mind as possibilities too. Sarcoidosis is a bit less likely, but it's still worth considering.\n\nSo, here's my final list: dermatomyositis, lupus, scleroderma, sarcoidosis, and maybe mixed connective tissue disease. Each of these could explain some or all of the symptoms, but dermatomyositis seems like the best fit.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, ensuring that each step presents a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Dermatomyositis** - This condition is characterized by skin rashes and muscle inflammation, which aligns with the patient's symptoms of a maculopapular rash, elevated creatine kinase, and aldolase levels.\n\n2. **Lupus (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus)** - This autoimmune disease can cause a wide range of symptoms including rashes, muscle pain, and lung involvement, which fits the patient's presentation.\n\n3. **Scleroderma (Systemic Sclerosis)** - This condition can affect the skin, esophagus, and lungs, and could explain the dysphagia and lung consolidations.\n\n4. **Sarcoidosis** - This disease can cause lung issues, skin problems, and elevated inflammatory markers, although it typically doesn't involve significant muscle inflammation.\n\n5. **Mixed Connective Tissue Disease** - This condition overlaps features of lupus, scleroderma, and polymyositis, which could account for the patient's varied symptoms.\n\n6. **Polymyositis** - Similar to dermatomyositis but without the skin involvement, this could explain the muscle weakness and elevated muscle enzymes.\n\n7. **Rheumatoid Arthritis** - While primarily a joint condition, it can also involve the lungs and cause systemic symptoms.\n\n8. **Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis** - This could explain the lung findings, but it doesn't account for the skin rash or muscle enzyme elevation.\n\n9. **Esophageal Motility Disorder** - This might explain the dysphagia, but not the other systemic symptoms.\n\n10. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - This is a possibility given the patient's age and weight loss, as it can present with a range of systemic symptoms including skin rashes and muscle weakness due to an underlying malignancy.\n\nAfter considering all the information, dermatomyositis emerges as the most likely diagnosis due to the combination of skin rash, muscle inflammation, and lung involvement.

Anterior segment examination of both eyes was unremarkable, and the retina in the left eye appeared normal. In the right eye, there was an area of superior macular whitening with associated intraretinal hemorrhages and exudates. Fluorescein angiography showed abnormally dilated and tortuous retinal vessels, irregular capillary branching patterns, and bulblike telangiectasis with late leakage in the superior macula. Optical coherence tomography showed disorganized and hyperreflective inner retinal thickening (Figure, A) and intraretinal and subretinal fluid in the central macula. On review of systems, the patient noted a long-standing growth on her cheek, which on examination was a 4 × 3-mm exophytic, brownish-red vascular papule (Figure, B), as well as a history of lightly pigmented patches of skin and multiple subungual fibromas on her toes. Systemic blood pressure was normal. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Astrocytic hamartoma (with secondary branch retinal vein occlusion) associated with tuberous sclerosis complex", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 15-year-old girl who's been having trouble seeing out of her right eye for a couple of months. She's also noticed a dark spot right in the center of her vision. That's got to be pretty annoying. Her vision in that eye isn't great, 20/40 with glasses, while the other eye is perfect at 20/20. So, what's going on with that right eye?\n\nWhen the doctor checked her eyes, everything in the front looked normal, which is good. But in the back of the right eye, there's this weird area of whitening near the macula, and some bleeding and exudates. That sounds like something's up with the blood vessels back there. \n\nThe fluorescein angiography test really tells us more. It shows these abnormal, twisted blood vessels and some late leakage. That's definitely not normal. And the OCT scan shows the retina is thickened and there's fluid, which isn't good news for clear vision.\n\nNow, let's not forget about her skin. She's got this brownish-red bump on her cheek. It's vascular, which means it's related to blood vessels, just like what we're seeing in her eye. And she's got these lightly pigmented patches and some funny growths under her nails. Hmm, that's a lot of different things going on.\n\nSo, what could tie all of this together? The eye findings are pointing towards some kind of vascular issue, maybe something like Coats disease. But then, when you add in the skin stuff, it feels more like a systemic condition. Tuberous sclerosis could fit, but it doesn't quite explain the eye findings. \n\nOh, and there's this condition called Sturge-Weber syndrome that has vascular skin lesions and eye problems, but it's usually more widespread and she doesn't have all the classic signs. \n\nWait, let's think about the possibility of a neurocutaneous syndrome. Those often have both skin and eye manifestations. Maybe something like neurofibromatosis? It could explain the skin changes and the vascular eye issues. \n\nBut, I'm not totally convinced.

It's known for having these abnormal blood vessels in the brain and eyes. That could explain the eye findings.

It's not common, but it matches her symptoms well.

He received a diagnosis of primary salivary duct carcinoma of the hard palate 1 year prior and had been receiving treatment with oral bicalutamide and radiotherapy. A partially regressive change of the palatal tumor was noted radiographically during regular follow-up 3 months previously. On clinical examination, a hemorrhagic and erythematous plaque with multiple purpuric-to-blackish infiltrative papules and nodules extending from cheek, lateral neck, to the interclavicular area was found (Figure 1). An incisional biopsy from the infiltrative nodule on cheek was performed and submitted for histopathologic analysis. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Carcinoma hemorrhagiectoides", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an elderly man with some pretty distinct skin changes. He's got these violaceous plaques and blackish nodules on his face, neck, and chest. That's quite a pattern. My first thought is that this could be something like a lymphoma, maybe a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma like mycosis fungoides. That's known for having these kinds of skin changes.\n\nBut wait, there's more to consider. He's had a salivary duct carcinoma before, and he's been on bicalutamide and radiotherapy. That's a significant part of his history. Could this be related? Maybe it's a paraneoplastic phenomenon. Those can cause some wild skin changes too.\n\nNow, let's think about the possibility of this being a metastatic tumor. I mean, he did have a primary salivary duct carcinoma. Could this be metastatic carcinoma? It's possible, especially with the nodules and plaques spreading across his skin.\n\nOh, and there's the fact that he's on bicalutamide. That's an androgen receptor blocker. Could this be a drug reaction? Drug-induced eruptions can be tricky, but they usually don't look like this. Still, it's worth considering.\n\nHmm, let's not forget about infections. In an older adult, especially one with a history of cancer and on immunosuppressive treatment, infections like cutaneous tuberculosis could be possible. It's not the first thing that comes to mind, but it's on the list.\n\nNow, back to the lymphoma idea. The way the lesions are spreading and their appearance really makes me think of a hematologic disorder. Maybe it's a B-cell lymphoma this time, like a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. That could explain the aggressive spread.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. We should also think about other skin conditions. What about discoid lupus erythematosus? It can cause some pretty distinctive skin lesions, although they usually aren't as widespread or aggressive.\n\nOh, and there's the possibility of a postradiation sarcoma. He did have radiotherapy, and those can sometimes lead to new tumors in the treatment area. That's a rare but important consideration.\n\nAlso, let's not forget about the possibility of this being a manifestation of his previous cancer treatment, like a graft-versus-host disease. He hasn't had a transplant, but maybe there's something else at play.\n\nFinally, let's consider angiosarcoma. It's a long shot, but it can appear as these kinds of hemorrhagic, erythematous plaques, especially in older adults. It's aggressive and fits some of the characteristics we're seeing.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top differential diagnosis is cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, like mycosis fungoides. It just fits the pattern and progression of the lesions. But we can't rule out metastatic carcinoma or a drug reaction just yet. We need more information from that biopsy to be sure.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the skin changes observed in the patient:\n\n1. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides)**: The violaceous plaques and blackish nodules, along with the pattern of spread, are highly suggestive of a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma like mycosis fungoides.\n\n2. **Metastatic Carcinoma**: Given the patient's history of salivary duct carcinoma, the possibility of metastatic spread to the skin should be considered, especially with the nodular and plaque-like lesions.\n\n3. **Paraneoplastic Phenomenon**: The skin changes could be a paraneoplastic manifestation related to the previous salivary duct carcinoma, given the known association of some skin conditions with internal malignancies.\n\n4. **Drug Reaction (Bicalutamide)**: Although less likely, a drug-induced eruption from bicalutamide could be considered, especially given the patient's medication history.\n\n5. **Cutaneous Tuberculosis**: In an older adult with a history of cancer and immunosuppressive treatment, infectious causes like cutaneous tuberculosis should not be overlooked.\n\n6. **Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma**: The aggressive spread and appearance of the lesions could also be indicative of a B-cell lymphoma, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.\n\n7. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus**: This condition can cause distinctive skin lesions, although they are usually less aggressive and widespread than those described.\n\n8. **Postradiation Sarcoma**: The history of radiotherapy raises the possibility of a radiation-induced sarcoma, which can develop in the treatment area.\n\n9. **Graft-Versus-Host Disease**: Although the patient has not had a transplant, atypical presentations can occur, especially in the context of previous cancer treatment.\n\n10. **Angiosarcoma**: This is a rare but aggressive vascular tumor that can present with hemorrhagic and erythematous plaques, particularly in older adults.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnosis is **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides)**, given the characteristic skin lesions and pattern of spread. However, **Metastatic Carcinoma** and a **Drug Reaction** should also be closely considered pending further investigation, particularly the results from the biopsy.", "topic": "['Oncology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Salivary Gland Disorders', 'Dermatology', 'Geriatrics']"}

Her course was complicated by severe mucositis, acute kidney injury, and neutropenic fever. During her admission, the patient also developed painful necrotic skin lesions, a nonproductive cough, and altered mental status. Physical examination findings demonstrated dusky, purpuric, and pink papulonodules, some with overlying eschar, scattered on the scalp, neck, trunk, and extremities (Figure, A). Laboratory study results revealed a white blood cell count of 150/μL (reference range, 3500/μL to 10 500/μL), an absolute neutrophil count of 130/μL (reference range, 1500/μL to 7400/μL), and a platelet count of 19 ×103/μL (reference range, 150 ×103/μL to 400 ×103/μL). (To convert the white blood cell and neutrophil counts to cells ×109/L, multiply by 0.001; conversion of the platelet count to cells ×109/L is 1:1.) Blood culture results were negative. The results of a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage, territorial infarction, or mass effect. The results of a CT scan of the chest demonstrated multifocal bilateral ground-glass patchy opacities, scattered solid bilateral pulmonary nodules, and a moderately sized pericardial effusion. A biopsy specimen from a skin nodule on the left lateral thigh was obtained for histopathologic examination and tissue culture, and wet mount preparation of a tissue culture colony was performed (Figure, B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Disseminated fusariosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 56-year-old woman who's had a pretty rough medical history with multiple myeloma and now therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia. She's going through a tough time with myeloablative conditioning for a transplant, and things are getting complicated. She's dealing with severe mucositis, kidney issues, and a fever because of her neutropenic state. That's a lot to handle already.\n\nNow, she's also developed these painful skin lesions. They're not just any skin issues; they're necrotic. That's a big red flag, especially with her condition. And there's more—she's got a nonproductive cough and her mental status has changed. That's concerning.\n\nWhen I look at her physical exam, I see these dusky, purpuric, and pink papulonodules. Some even have eschar on them. That's scattered all over her scalp, neck, trunk, and extremities. It's like her body is really under attack.\n\nHer lab results are also worrying. Her white blood cell count is super low, and so are her neutrophils and platelets. That's making her really vulnerable to infections. But her blood cultures are negative, so we're not seeing bacteria in her blood, at least not yet.\n\nThe CT scans show some interesting things too. Her brain looks okay, no bleeding or strokes, which is a relief. But her chest... it's showing ground-glass opacities and pulmonary nodules. Plus, there's a pericardial effusion. That's a lot going on in the lungs and around the heart.\n\nNow, let's think about what could be causing all of this. With her condition and these symptoms, I'm immediately thinking about infections. Neutropenic patients are prime targets for all sorts of infections. Aspergillus is a big one, especially with those pulmonary nodules. It can also cause skin lesions and issues in the brain, so it's a strong contender.\n\nBut wait, there's more. The skin biopsy and tissue culture show something interesting. The wet mount preparation... it's showing septate hyphae. That's a classic sign of Aspergillus. But I can't jump to conclusions yet.\n\nLet's consider other possibilities. With her being so immunocompromised, we should think about other fungal infections like Mucorales. They can cause similar issues, but the hyphae would be non-septate, and we're seeing septate hyphae here.\n\nWhat about bacterial infections? Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause ecthyma gangrenosum, which fits the skin lesions. But the negative blood cultures make this less likely, though not impossible.\n\nViruses could be at play too. CMV can cause some similar symptoms, especially in someone who's so immunocompromised. But we don't have any evidence pointing directly to CMV right now.\n\nAnd then there's the possibility of a fungal infection like Fusarium. It can mimic Aspergillus in presentation. But again, the septate hyphae are a strong point in favor of Aspergillus.\n\nAfter thinking it all through, Aspergillus seems to be the most likely culprit here. The combination of her symptoms, the imaging findings, and the biopsy results make it the top suspect. But I'm keeping an open mind. In medicine, things aren't always straightforward, and new evidence could change the picture.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnoses for the patient's condition are as follows:\n\n1. **Aspergillus Infection** - Given the patient's immunocompromised state, the presence of septate hyphae in the tissue culture, pulmonary nodules, and skin lesions, Aspergillus is a strong contender.\n\n2. **Mucormycosis** - Although the hyphae observed are septate, which doesn't typically indicate Mucorales, it's important to consider due to the patient's condition and the potential for rapidly progressing infections.\n\n3. **Pseudomonas aeruginosa Infection** - This bacterium can cause ecthyma gangrenosum, which aligns with the skin lesions, but negative blood cultures make this less likely.\n\n4. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection** - CMV can cause systemic infections in immunocompromised patients, but there's currently no direct evidence pointing to it.\n\n5. **Fusarium Infection** - Fusarium can present similarly to Aspergillus and is worth considering, especially given the patient's neutropenic state.\n\n6. **Candida Infection** - While less likely to cause pulmonary nodules, Candida can cause systemic infections in severely immunocompromised patients.\n\n7. **Bacterial Sepsis** - Despite negative blood cultures, bacterial sepsis remains a possibility due to the patient's critical condition.\n\n8. **Toxoplasmosis** - This parasitic infection can reactivate in immunocompromised patients, potentially causing brain and systemic involvement.\n\n9. **Cryptococcosis** - Although more commonly associated with meningitis, it can cause disseminated disease in severely immunocompromised patients.\n\n10. **Adenovirus Infection** - Adenovirus can cause respiratory and systemic symptoms in immunocompromised individuals, but it's less likely given the current findings.\n\nAfter considering all the information, Aspergillus infection remains the most likely diagnosis due to the combination of clinical presentation, imaging findings, and biopsy results.

Ten years prior to presentation, he underwent surgical decompression for syringomyelia. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of his cervical and thoracic spine performed 2 years prior to presentation revealed a recurrent syrinx extending from C1 to T11, which was not resected because it did not cause symptoms at that time. On physical examination, he had mild tenderness to palpation and reduced range of motion of the left shoulder with abduction and flexion limited to 120° (normal range of motion, 180°). The left scapular muscles were atrophic, and pain and temperature sensation were reduced in his proximal left arm, and dorsal aspect of his left shoulder. His complete blood cell count, serum glucose levels, C-reactive protein levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal. Results of tests for rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody were negative. Left shoulder radiograph showed complete absence of the left humeral head and a well-demarcated smooth osseous margin of the proximal humerus with associated soft tissue swelling and periarticular calcification (Figure 1). A chest radiograph taken 2 years prior revealed a normal left shoulder joint. The patient was hospitalized for further evaluation and treatment. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Neuropathic arthropathy of the shoulder (Charcot shoulder)", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 67-year-old man who's been dealing with some pretty uncomfortable symptoms in his left shoulder. He's had pain, stiffness, and can't move it as well as he used to. Plus, there's some numbness and tingling in his arm. That's got to be frustrating.\n\nNow, he's had some history with his spine. He had surgery for syringomyelia a decade ago, and there's still a syrinx hanging around in there. That could definitely be playing a role in his symptoms, especially the numbness and tingling. It's like his spinal cord is still under some stress.\n\nBut then, there's this weird finding on the X-ray. The head of his humerus is completely gone. That's not something you see every day. And it's not like it was broken or anything; it's just absent with a smooth edge. That's bizarre.\n\nSo, what could cause something like that? I'm thinking about conditions that can make bones disappear or resorb. There's this condition called Gorham-Stout disease that's known for causing bone to vanish. It's rare, but it fits the bill.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. We should consider other possibilities too. There's also phantom limb syndrome, but that's more about sensation and not physical disappearance of bone. And what about neurological issues? Syringomyelia could be causing some weird nerve stuff, but it doesn't explain the bone loss.\n\nHmm, what about infections or tumors? They can cause bone destruction, but usually, you'd see more signs of damage or irregularity on an X-ray. This looks too neat for that.\n\nOkay, let's think about the syrinx again. It's possible that it's affecting his nerves in a way that's leading to this bone resorption. Maybe the nerve supply to the area is messed up, causing the bone to disappear. That's a bit of a stretch, but it's worth considering.\n\nOh, and there's also the idea of a Parsonage-Turner syndrome. That's a type of brachial plexus neuropathy that could cause muscle atrophy and maybe even bone changes. It's a long shot, but it could fit.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think Gorham-Stout disease is still the strongest contender. It's rare, but it matches the X-ray findings perfectly. The syrinx and neurological factors might be contributing, but they don't fully explain what's going on. Yeah, I'm sticking with Gorham-Stout disease as the most likely cause.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with a focus on the unusual finding of the absent humeral head:\n\n1. **Gorham-Stout Disease** - A rare condition characterized by the progressive replacement of bone with lymphatic or vascular tissue, leading to bone resorption.\n2. **Neurogenic Arthropathy (Charcot Joint)** - Associated with syringomyelia, this condition can cause joint destruction due to sensory and motor deficits.\n3. **Parsonage-Turner Syndrome** - A brachial plexus neuropathy that can lead to muscle atrophy and potentially bone changes.\n4. **Phantom Limb Syndrome** - Although primarily a sensory phenomenon, it could be considered in the context of altered nerve supply.\n5. **Syringomyelia** - The existing syrinx could be affecting nerve pathways, contributing to muscle atrophy and bone resorption.\n6. **Osteonecrosis** - Could lead to bone collapse, but typically involves more localized damage rather than complete disappearance of the humeral head.\n7. **Infectious Arthritis** - Usually presents with signs of infection like swelling, warmth, and systemic symptoms, which are absent here.\n8. **Tumor (Primary or Metastatic)** - Would likely show more aggressive or irregular bone destruction on imaging.\n9. **Rheumatoid Arthritis** - Typically involves multiple joints and shows systemic symptoms; tests for rheumatoid factor were negative.\n10. **Neurological Disorders Affecting Bone Metabolism** - Certain neurological conditions can affect bone density or resorption, but are less likely to cause complete disappearance of a bone segment.\n\nAfter considering all the information, Gorham-Stout disease remains the most likely diagnosis due to the characteristic smooth and complete resorption of the humeral head. The patient's history of syringomyelia and neurological symptoms may contribute to the clinical picture, but they do not fully explain the radiological findings.

The patient noted blurry vision started around the time of cabozantinib therapy initiation. Cabozantinib therapy was discontinued for surgery and resumed 3 days later. The referring retina specialist noted vitritis and vasculitis intraoperatively, but the result of vitreous biopsy cytology was negative for malignant cells. At presentation to our institution, the patient was taking oral prednisone, 40 mg/d. His visual acuity was 20/500 OD and hand motions OS, with an intraocular pressure of 18 mm Hg in both eyes. Right eye slitlamp examination results showed pigmented cells in the anterior chamber and lens capsule; the left eye showed prolapsed pigmented vitreous at the pupillary margin. Right eye fundus examination results revealed sheets of pigmented cell and vascular sheathing with optic nerve pallor. The left eye had a poor view, with 90% gas fill. Fluorescein angiography illustrated disc and vessel leakage (predominantly arteriole), capillary dropout, and peripheral nonperfusion in the right eye (Figure 1A) with no view in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography revealed debris at the vitreoretinal interface (Figure 1B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Renal cell carcinoma bilateral ocular metastasis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 68-year-old man who's been dealing with some pretty serious health issues. He's got a history of B-cell lymphoma and is currently battling renal cell carcinoma. He's on cabozantinib, which is a type of medication that targets certain proteins involved in cancer growth. Now, he's come in with some vision problems. His right eye is really blurry, and this started around the time he began taking cabozantinib. That's interesting. He also had recent surgery on his left eye for a retinal detachment, and they used a gas bubble to help with the repair. \n\nOkay, so let's break this down. The blurry vision in his right eye and the fact that it got worse after starting cabozantinib makes me think there might be a connection. Cabozantinib can cause some eye-related side effects, so that's something to keep in mind. \n\nNow, the doctor found some pigmented cells in the front part of his right eye, and there's also some vascular sheathing and optic nerve pallor. That's a bit concerning. The left eye isn't looking great either, with some pigmented vitreous prolapse. And there's a lot of gas still in there from the surgery. \n\nThe tests they did showed some leakage from the blood vessels in the retina, capillary dropout, and areas where the retina isn't getting enough blood. That sounds like ischemic changes. Hmm, could this be related to the cabozantinib? It's possible, since the drug can affect blood vessel growth and stability. \n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. We should consider other possibilities too. The patient's history of lymphoma could mean there's a chance of lymphoma involvement in the eye. And the recent surgery could have caused some inflammation or infection. \n\nSo, what else could be going on? There's a chance of central retinal vein occlusion because of the vascular changes. And with his history, we can't rule out something like primary vitreoretinal lymphoma. \n\nOh, and let's not forget about the possibility of an infection, like endophthalmitis, especially after surgery. And what about ischemic optic neuropathy? That could explain the optic nerve pallor. \n\nNow, if we think about the tests, the fluorescein angiography shows a lot of vascular issues. That could point towards a vascular event like a branch retinal artery occlusion. \n\nSo, putting it all together, it seems like the most likely explanation is that the cabozantinib is causing these vascular changes, leading to something like a branch retinal artery occlusion. But we should also keep an eye on the possibility of lymphoma or an infection. \n\nIn the end, I think the top suspects are cabozantinib-induced retinal vascular occlusion, followed by primary vitreoretinal lymphoma, and then central retinal vein occlusion. We should definitely keep ischemic optic neuropathy and infection on the radar too.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, considering the history of B-cell lymphoma, renal cell carcinoma, and cabozantinib therapy, along with the recent retinal detachment surgery:\n\n1. **Cabozantinib-induced Retinal Vascular Occlusion** - The timing of vision changes with cabozantinib use and the vascular findings on fluorescein angiography support this possibility.\n\n2. **Primary Vitreoretinal Lymphoma** - Given the patient's history of B-cell lymphoma and the presence of vitritis, this is a strong consideration despite negative cytology results.\n\n3. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion** - The vascular sheathing and ischemic changes could be indicative of a venous occlusive event.\n\n4. **Branch Retinal Artery Occlusion** - The fluorescein angiography findings of vascular leakage and capillary dropout align with an arterial occlusion.\n\n5. **Ischemic Optic Neuropathy** - Optic nerve pallor and vascular changes suggest possible ischemic damage to the optic nerve.\n\n6. **Endophthalmitis** - Post-surgical inflammation or infection could present with vitritis and vision changes.\n\n7. **Cytomegalovirus Retinitis** - A possibility in immunocompromised patients, especially with vitritis and retinal changes.\n\n8. **Radiation Retinopathy** - If the patient underwent radiation therapy for his cancers, this could contribute to the vascular changes.\n\n9. **Ocular Toxicity from Other Medications** - Other medications used in cancer treatment could have ocular side effects contributing to the presentation.\n\n10. **Sympathetic Ophthalmia** - A rare, bilateral, granulomatous uveitis following ocular surgery that could explain some findings.\n\nReranking these based on all available information, the top three differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Cabozantinib-induced Retinal Vascular Occlusion**\n2. **Primary Vitreoretinal Lymphoma**\n3. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion**\n\nThese diagnoses take into account the patient's complex medical history, the timing of symptoms with cabozantinib, and the specific retinal and vascular findings.

In early childhood, she had developed asymptomatic yellowish coalesced papules confined to flexural areas. Subsequently, severe skin sagging occurred on her abdomen with loss of elasticity, then spread extensively with developmental growth. The results of a physical examination showed thick and leathery skinfolds on the neck, axillae, inguinal regions, abdomen, and limbs (Figure, A), with yellowish papules scattered on the dorsal neck. The patient had no extracutaneous involvement and was born to healthy nonconsanguineous parents. However, her younger sister had developed the same skin symptoms. Coagulation-related tests indicated a low clotting activity of factor X (52.2%; reference range, 77%-131%) and a prolonged prothrombin time (12.8 seconds; reference range, 10.4-12.6 seconds). The results of other laboratory investigations were unremarkable. Echocardiographic and fundoscopic examination results were normal. A skin biopsy specimen was obtained from her neck for histopathologic examination (Figure, B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like disorder with coagulation deficiency", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a Chinese woman in her late 20s who's been dealing with some pretty unusual skin issues for a long time, about 20 years. She's got this progressive skin laxity thing going on, which sounds like her skin has just lost its elasticity and is kind of sagging all over. That's not all; she's also had these yellowish papules since she was a kid, and they're mostly in the flexural areas. That's interesting.\n\nNow, let's see. The skin issues are pretty extensive. She's got thick, leathery skinfolds on her neck, armpits, groin, abdomen, and limbs. And those yellowish papules are still there on her neck. But here's the thing, she doesn't have any issues outside of the skin, and her parents are healthy and not related to each other. But wait, her younger sister is going through the same thing. That's a big clue.\n\nSo, we're looking at something that's likely genetic, maybe autosomal dominant, given that both sisters have it but the parents don't. Now, let's check the lab results. There's something off with her clotting factors. Her factor X activity is low, and her prothrombin time is a bit prolonged. That's pointing towards some kind of bleeding disorder, but it's not affecting anything else, like her heart or eyes, since those exams are normal.\n\nOkay, let's think about what conditions fit this picture. The skin symptoms and family history make me think of some sort of connective tissue disorder. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome comes to mind, especially the hypermobility type or the classical type. They often have skin hyperextensibility and joint issues, but I'm not seeing any mention of joint problems here.\n\nThen there's pseudoxanthoma elasticum. It's known for those yellowish papules and skin laxity, and it can affect the eyes, but her fundoscopy is normal, so that's not it.\n\nLet's not forget about cutis laxa. It's characterized by skin laxity, and it can be inherited. The low factor X activity could be related to a bleeding disorder, which sometimes happens in cutis laxa due to elastin issues affecting the blood vessels.\n\nBut wait, there's also Marfan syndrome. It's a connective tissue disorder that can have skin manifestations, but it usually comes with skeletal and heart issues, which she doesn't have.\n\nAnd then there's homocystinuria. It's a metabolic disorder that can affect connective tissue and clotting, but it often has other symptoms like skeletal issues or vision problems, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Based on the skin symptoms, family history, and lab results, cutis laxa seems like a strong possibility. The low factor X activity and prolonged prothrombin time fit with the idea of a bleeding tendency, which can happen in cutis laxa. But let's not completely rule out Ehlers-Danlos syndrome yet, as it can present with similar skin findings.\n\nIn the end, after considering everything, cutis laxa makes the most sense here. It explains the skin issues, the family history, and the lab findings. Yeah, that seems to be the best fit.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnoses for the condition described are as follows:\n\n1. **Cutis Laxa** - This condition is characterized by skin laxity and can be inherited. The low factor X activity and prolonged prothrombin time could be related to a bleeding disorder associated with cutis laxa.\n\n2. **Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (Classical Type)** - Known for skin hyperextensibility and joint hypermobility, although joint issues are not mentioned, the skin symptoms align with this diagnosis.\n\n3. **Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum** - Characterized by yellowish papules and skin laxity, but typically affects the eyes, which are normal in this case.\n\n4. **Marfan Syndrome** - A connective tissue disorder that can have skin manifestations, but usually includes skeletal and cardiac abnormalities, which are absent here.\n\n5. **Homocystinuria** - A metabolic disorder affecting connective tissue and clotting, often with skeletal or vision problems, which are not present.\n\n6. **Autosomal Recessive Cutis Laxa** - Considering the family history, this could be a possibility, especially with the systemic involvement suggested by clotting abnormalities.\n\n7. **Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (Hypermobility Type)** - Similar to the classical type but with more emphasis on joint hypermobility, which is not highlighted in the case.\n\n8. **Familial Dysautonomia** - A rare genetic disorder that can affect skin and other systems, but typically includes neurological symptoms, which are not mentioned.\n\n9. **Costello Syndrome** - Involves skin abnormalities and potential bleeding disorders, but usually includes distinct facial features and other systemic issues.\n\n10. **Menkes Disease** - A disorder of copper metabolism that can affect connective tissue, but usually presents with hair and neurological abnormalities, which are not described.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Cutis Laxa** remains the most likely diagnosis, as it best explains the combination of skin symptoms, family history, and clotting abnormalities. However, **Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (Classical Type)** is also a strong contender given the skin findings, despite the lack of joint involvement.", "topic": "['Coagulation Disorders', 'Dermatology', 'Hematology', 'Rheumatology', 'Connective Tissue Disease of the Skin']"}

The supraglottis and glottis were unremarkable. Computed tomography imaging with contrast of the neck revealed a 4.6 × 4.0 × 8.0-cm heterogeneously enhancing mass in the left oropharynx and hypopharynx with cystic components and clear planes separating the mass from the spinal musculature and carotid sheath (Figure 1). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Pediatric fibromyxoid soft tissue tumor", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 15-year-old guy who's having trouble swallowing solid foods and gets short of breath when he lies on his right side. That's been going on for 8 months, so it's not something that just cropped up overnight. He doesn't have any pain or trouble with his voice, and he hasn't lost weight, which is interesting.\n\nWhen we look at him, there's some fullness on the left side of his throat and neck. And when we do a laryngoscopy, there's a mass in his left oropharynx that's pushing down into his hypopharynx. It's covering up his left pyriform sinus and even pushing against the base of his tongue and epiglottis. But the top part of his voice box and vocal cords look normal.\n\nNow, let's think about what this could be. Given his age and the fact that it's a slow-growing mass, maybe it's a branchial cleft cyst. Those are pretty common in young people and can show up around the oropharynx.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. We should consider other possibilities too. Could it be a thyroglossal duct cyst? Those can be around this area, but they usually show up more in the midline or slightly off to one side, and they're often more anterior.\n\nHmm, what about a dermoid cyst? Those are another type of congenital cyst that could be in this area. They're usually well-defined and could have a cystic appearance on imaging.\n\nOh, and we can't forget about the possibility of something more serious, like a malignancy. But he's young, and there's no weight loss or other alarming symptoms, so that seems less likely.\n\nLet's look at the imaging. The CT scan shows a big mass, about 4.6 by 4 by 8 cm, that's got both solid and cystic parts. It's not invading the nearby muscles or carotid sheath, which is a good sign.\n\nOkay, so what else could this be? Maybe a lymphatic malformation? Those can be cystic and are often found in the neck.\n\nOr could it be a minor salivary gland tumor?

They're nerve sheath tumors that can be in the neck and oropharynx, and they can have a cystic component.\n\nAnd then there's the possibility of an abscess, but he doesn't have any signs of infection, like fever or tenderness.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top possibilities are a branchial cleft cyst, a lymphatic malformation, or a schwannoma. Those fit with his age, the location, and the imaging findings. But we should keep an open mind and consider all the possibilities until we get a definitive diagnosis.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 15-year-old male with the described symptoms and imaging findings:\n\n1. **Branchial Cleft Cyst** - This is a common congenital anomaly in young individuals that can present as a lateral neck mass, consistent with the patient's age and symptoms.\n\n2. **Lymphatic Malformation** - These are cystic lesions that can occur in the neck and oropharynx, fitting the imaging description of a mass with cystic components.\n\n3. **Schwannoma** - A nerve sheath tumor that can occur in the head and neck region, potentially explaining the cystic and solid components seen on imaging.\n\n4. **Dermoid Cyst** - A type of congenital cyst that can present in the head and neck area, although less common in this location.\n\n5. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst** - Typically presents more anteriorly, but can be considered given the location and age of the patient.\n\n6. **Minor Salivary Gland Tumor** - Although uncommon in teenagers, these can occur in the oropharynx and may present as a submucosal mass.\n\n7. **Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma** - Usually occurs in adolescent males, but typically presents with nasal symptoms and a mass in the nasopharynx.\n\n8. **Lipoma** - A benign tumor that can occur in the neck and oropharynx, but less likely to have cystic components.\n\n9. **Hemangioma** - A vascular lesion that can be present at birth or appear during childhood, potentially explaining a mass with cystic areas.\n\n10. **Rhabdomyoma** - A rare benign tumor of striated muscle that can occur in the head and neck region, potentially fitting the description of a mass in the oropharynx.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top three differential diagnoses are **Branchial Cleft Cyst**, **Lymphatic Malformation**, and **Schwannoma**, as they best fit the patient's age, symptoms, and imaging findings.

Treatments included hydroxychloroquine, 400 mg/d, for 4 years; mycophenolate mofetil, 1000 mg/d, for 6 months; and oral prednisone tapers, starting at 40 mg/d. Of these, only prednisone appeared to elicit a response. Review of symptoms was negative for fatigue, weight loss, cough, shortness of breath, joint pain, ocular symptoms, mucosal ulcerations, history of blood clots, photosensitivity, pleurisy, urine changes, and diarrhea. Medical history included hypertension, for which he took losartan, and seasonal allergies, for which he used fexofenadine and fluticasone. Laboratory evaluation revealed mild neutropenia and lymphopenia with normal hemoglobin and platelet counts. Antinuclear antibody screening results were negative. The results of a comprehensive metabolic panel, C3, C4, serum protein electrophoresis, serum free light chains, methylmalonic acid, homocysteine, ferritin, copper, zinc, haptoglobin, HIV, hepatitis B and C serologic tests, and rapid plasma reagin were negative. Lactate dehydrogenase was mildly elevated. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated at 41 mm/h. Routine cancer screening was up to date.

He's also having low-grade fevers and some issues with his white blood cell count. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nSo, a skin biopsy from 4 years ago said it was subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, or SCLE. But the treatments he's been on, like hydroxychloroquine and mycophenolate mofetil, haven't really worked. Only prednisone seemed to help, and that's something to think about.\n\nHe doesn't have a lot of the typical lupus symptoms like fatigue, weight loss, or joint pain. And he's not experiencing photosensitivity, which is often seen in lupus. That's a bit odd.\n\nHis lab results show mild neutropenia and lymphopenia, but everything else is pretty normal. His ANA test is negative, which is usually positive in lupus. That's a red flag that maybe it's not lupus after all.\n\nLet's think about other possibilities. Sweet's syndrome could be one, with those skin plaques and fever. And maybe even lymphoma, given the negative ANA and lack of response to treatments.\n\nOh, and we should consider infections like HIV or hepatitis, but his tests for those are negative. Hmm, what about some kind of hematologic issue? The elevated ESR and LDH are pointing us in that direction.\n\nLet's not forget about drug reactions. He's on losartan and fexofenadine, but those don't usually cause these kinds of symptoms. So, probably not a drug reaction.\n\nOkay, so what's the most likely diagnosis? Sweet's syndrome is still on the table, but we should also think about lymphocytic infiltrate of Jessner, which can look similar to lupus. And there's also the possibility of a paraneoplastic syndrome or even a rare condition like necrobiotic xanthogranuloma.\n\nAfter going through everything, I think Sweet's syndrome is the most likely. It fits the symptoms and the lab results. But we should keep an open mind and consider those other possibilities too.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Sweet's Syndrome** - Characterized by erythematous plaques, fevers, and leukopenia, which aligns with the patient's symptoms.\n2. **Lymphocytic Infiltrate of Jessner** - A condition that can mimic lupus and presents with similar skin manifestations.\n3. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - Given the negative ANA and lack of response to typical lupus treatments, a paraneoplastic process could be considered.\n4. **Necrobiotic Xanthogranuloma** - A rare condition that can present with skin plaques and systemic symptoms.\n5. **Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma** - The negative ANA and persistent skin issues raise the possibility of a lymphoma.\n6. **Autoimmune Progesterone Dermatitis** - Although less likely, this condition can cause periodic skin eruptions.\n7. **Erythema Elevatum Diutinum** - Associated with IgA paraproteins and can present with similar skin lesions.\n8. **Hematologic Disorder** - The elevated ESR and LDH suggest a possible underlying hematologic issue.\n9. **Granuloma Faciale** - A rare skin condition that can present with persistent erythematous plaques.\n10. **Neutrophilic Dermatosis** - Conditions like pyoderma gangrenosum could be considered given the skin and systemic symptoms.\n\nAfter considering all the patient's symptoms and test results, Sweet's syndrome emerges as the most likely diagnosis due to the combination of skin plaques, fever, and blood abnormalities.

She was noted to have tachycardia (110 beats/min) and hypoxemia (90% receiving room air) with a blood pressure of 106/81 mm Hg. Cardiac, respiratory, and pulse examination results were unremarkable. She denied any clear physical or emotional triggers preceding presentation. Before presentation, the patient reported good health with satisfactory employment-mandated routine physical examinations. She denied a history of smoking, alcohol, or illicit drug use. She was not taking hormonal birth control or hormone therapy. Laboratory values demonstrated a normal complete blood cell count and metabolic panel. Chest radiograph results were unremarkable. A computed tomographic chest scan excluded pulmonary embolism but suggested pulmonary and interstitial edema. Results of an electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with premature ventricular contractions, subcentimeter ST-segment elevation in leads I and aVL and 1-mm ST-segment depression in leads II, III, aVF, and V5 through V6. Initial high-sensitivity troponin was 110 000 ng/mL (to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1). Results of cardiac point-of-care ultrasonography demonstrated a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 40%, with hypokinesis of the anterolateral and posterior walls. Emergent cardiac catheterization revealed spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) of the left main coronary artery (Figure 1 and Video). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Spontaneous coronary artery dissection of the left main coronary artery", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her 40s who's just had a baby 11 weeks ago. She's got a history of migraines and preeclampsia, and now she's dealing with some pretty scary symptoms like chest pain and shortness of breath after a flight. That's a lot to unpack.\n\nFirst off, the timing after her flight makes me think about pulmonary embolism. It's a common concern after long flights because of blood clots. But, the CT scan didn't show any clots, so we can probably rule that out.\n\nNext, let's consider acute coronary syndrome. Her symptoms and the high troponin levels are definitely raising some red flags here. The ECG changes are also pointing towards some kind of heart issue.\n\nNow, the postpartum angle is interesting. She's 11 weeks after giving birth, and that's still a time when the body is readjusting. Postpartum cardiomyopathy could be a player here, especially with the reduced ejection fraction.\n\nBut wait, the cardiac catheterization showed spontaneous coronary artery dissection, or SCAD. That's a pretty specific finding. SCAD is more common in women, especially those who have recently given birth. So, this could be our main culprit.\n\nStill, let's not forget about other possibilities like myocardial infarction or unstable angina. The troponin is really high, and the ECG shows some concerning changes. These could be related to the SCAD or something else entirely.\n\nOh, and what about aortic dissection? It's less likely, but the chest pain and cardiovascular involvement make it worth considering. However, there's no radiologic evidence to support this, so it's probably not our top suspect.\n\nLet's also think about pericarditis. The chest pain and ECG changes could fit, but the troponin level is really high for pericarditis alone. Plus, there's no pericardial effusion mentioned.\n\nEsophageal spasm could explain the chest pain, but it doesn't match the rest of the findings like the high troponin and ECG changes. So, it's unlikely.\n\nPrinzmetal's angina is another option. It involves coronary spasms, which could lead to similar symptoms. But, the catheterization didn't show spasms, so this is probably not it.\n\nLastly, there's Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as stress cardiomyopathy. It can mimic heart attacks and is more common in postmenopausal women, but this patient is a bit young for that. Still, the stress of childbirth could be a trigger.\n\nSo, putting it all together, SCAD seems like the most likely diagnosis given the catheterization results and her postpartum status. But, we can't completely rule out things like myocardial infarction or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy without more information.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Pulmonary Embolism** - Although the CT scan excluded this, it's important to consider due to the recent flight.\n2. **Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD)** - The cardiac catheterization revealed this, making it a strong contender.\n3. **Acute Coronary Syndrome** - The high troponin and ECG changes align with this diagnosis.\n4. **Postpartum Cardiomyopathy** - Given the reduced ejection fraction and postpartum status, this is a plausible consideration.\n5. **Myocardial Infarction** - The elevated troponin and ECG findings support this possibility.\n6. **Unstable Angina** - Could be related to the SCAD or another underlying issue.\n7. **Aortic Dissection** - Although less likely, the chest pain and cardiovascular involvement warrant consideration.\n8. **Pericarditis** - The chest pain and ECG changes could fit, but the high troponin is atypical.\n9. **Esophageal Spasm** - Unlikely, as it doesn't account for the high troponin or ECG changes.\n10. **Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy** - Could be considered due to the postpartum stress, but less likely given the age and specific findings.\n\nReranking these based on all available information, the top diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD)**\n2. **Acute Coronary Syndrome**\n3. **Myocardial Infarction**\n4. **Postpartum Cardiomyopathy**\n5. **Unstable Angina**\n\nThese diagnoses are most consistent with the clinical presentation, test results, and the specific finding of SCAD in the left main coronary artery.", "topic": "['Acute Coronary Syndromes', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Pregnancy', 'Obstetrics', 'Obstetrics and Gynecology']"}

The patient also had a history of lumbar spinal stenosis. On presentation, blood pressure was 104/73 mm Hg; heart rate, 91/min; respiratory rate, 16/min; and oxygen saturation, 96% on room air. Physical examination revealed edema to the mid-calf bilaterally, hypoesthesia below the knees, and ankle plantar flexion strength of 3 of 5 based on the Medical Research Council Scale for muscle strength. Laboratory testing revealed a high-sensitivity troponin level of 52 ng/L (reference, <34 ng/L); brain-type natriuretic peptide, 112 pmol/L (reference, <30 pmol/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 51 U/L (0.85 μkat/L) (reference, 0-35 U/L [0-0.58 μkat/L]); and alanine aminotransferase, 76 U/L (1.27 μkat/L) (reference, 0-45 U/L [0-0.75 μkat/L]).

An electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm, left anterior fascicular block, and down-sloping anterolateral ST segments. The patient was admitted to the hospital, where electromyography results included reduced amplitude of peroneal nerve action potentials, consistent with axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy of the bilateral lower extremities.

We've got a 60-year-old Black patient who's been dealing with chest pain and shortness of breath for a couple of months. That's already raising some flags for heart issues. And then there's the toe numbness and weight loss. Hmm, that's interesting. Weight loss can sometimes point to something more systemic going on.\n\nOkay, let's look at the vitals. Blood pressure and heart rate are pretty normal, but the oxygen saturation is on the lower end of normal. That could mean something's up with the heart or lungs. Now, the physical exam shows edema and decreased sensation in the legs. Edema often makes me think of heart or kidney problems, and the sensory issues could be nerve-related.\n\nThe lab results are telling us a lot. Elevated troponin and BNP levels are definitely concerning for heart problems, like heart failure or maybe even myocarditis. And the liver enzymes are elevated too, which could be related to heart strain or liver congestion.\n\nThe chest X-ray shows cardiomegaly, which fits with the heart failure idea, but there's no pulmonary edema. That's a bit puzzling. The ECG has a left anterior fascicular block and some ST changes. Those could mean a conduction issue or ischemia, but the coronary angiography shows no blockages. So, it's not a typical coronary artery disease.\n\nThe cardiac MRI reveals asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. That's interesting because it could point to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. But wait, there's also the nerve issues. The EMG shows axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy. That's a mouthful, but it suggests a nerve problem that could be related to something systemic like amyloidosis.\n\nOh, and the bone scintigraphy shows increased cardiac uptake. That's a big clue. It's often seen in conditions like transthyretin amyloidosis. So, let's think about that. Transthyretin amyloidosis can cause both heart and nerve problems. It fits with the heart failure symptoms, the neuropathy, and the cardiac uptake on the scan.\n\nBut wait, the serum protein electrophoresis and free light chain tests are normal. Those are usually abnormal in multiple myeloma, which can cause amyloidosis. So, that's a bit of a twist. Maybe it's not multiple myeloma-related amyloidosis.\n\nLet's consider other possibilities. Could it be hypertrophic cardiomyopathy? That would explain the heart symptoms and the MRI findings. But it doesn't really explain the neuropathy or the bone scan results.\n\nWhat about aortic stenosis? That can cause heart symptoms and cardiomegaly, but it doesn't fit with the neuropathy or the scan results either.\n\nMaybe it's something like sarcoidosis. That can affect the heart and cause neuropathy, but the bone scan results don't really match.\n\nAfter thinking it through, transthyretin amyloidosis seems to fit best. It explains the heart issues, the neuropathy, and the bone scan results. Even though the serum tests are normal, it's still the most likely cause. So, that's my top guess.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnoses for this patient can be considered as follows:\n\n1. **Transthyretin Amyloidosis**: This condition can cause both cardiac and neurological symptoms, and the increased cardiac uptake on the bone scintigraphy scan is a strong indicator of this diagnosis.\n\n2. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy**: This could explain the asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy seen on cardiac MRI and some of the cardiac symptoms, but it doesn't account for the neuropathy or the bone scan results.\n\n3. **Multiple Myeloma-related Amyloidosis**: Although the normal serum protein electrophoresis and free light chain tests make this less likely, it's important to consider due to the potential for systemic involvement.\n\n4. **Sarcoidosis**: This can affect the heart and nervous system, but the bone scan findings are not typical for sarcoidosis.\n\n5. **Aortic Stenosis**: This could cause cardiac symptoms and cardiomegaly, but it doesn't explain the neuropathy or the bone scan results.\n\n6. **Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy**: This could explain the neuropathy and potentially some cardiac involvement, but the normal serum tests and specific bone scan findings make it less likely.\n\n7. **Senile Systemic Amyloidosis**: This is another form of amyloidosis that could fit the cardiac and neurological symptoms, especially in older adults.\n\n8. **Chronic Kidney Disease**: This can cause systemic issues, including neuropathy and potentially cardiomegaly, but the bone scan results are not typical.\n\n9. **Alcoholic Neuropathy**: This could explain the neuropathy, but not the cardiac findings or bone scan results.\n\n10. **Diabetic Neuropathy**: This could explain the neuropathy, but the patient's symptoms and test results suggest a more systemic issue involving the heart.\n\nAfter considering all the information, transthyretin amyloidosis remains the most likely diagnosis due to the combination of cardiac, neurological, and bone scan findings.

We've got a 70-year-old man with a really itchy rash that started on his scalp and face and then spread all over his body. That's been happening for about two months. He doesn't have any fever or weight loss, which is good. No new meds or supplements either, so that's probably not it. He's got these salmon-colored plaques with scaly papules, and there are some areas of skin that are clear, which is interesting. His nails are thickened and onycholytic, and he's got this severe ectropion thing going on with his eyelids. Hmm, that's a lot to take in.\n\nFirst, let's think about psoriasis. It's a common skin condition that can cause these kinds of plaques. But usually, psoriasis doesn't cover the whole body like this, and the nail changes, while possible, aren't super typical for just regular psoriasis. So, maybe it's psoriatic erythroderma? That's a more extreme version of psoriasis that can cause widespread redness and scaling.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. What about eczema, like atopic dermatitis? Eczema can definitely cause itching and redness, but it usually starts earlier in life, and this guy's 70, so that's a bit odd. Plus, the folliculocentric scaly papules aren't really an eczema thing.\n\nNow, pityriasis rubra pilaris could be a contender. It's known for those salmon-colored plaques and can cause exfoliative scaling. The age fits too. But, I'm not sure about the nail changes; they're not the hallmark of PRP.\n\nSeborrheic dermatitis? Nah, that usually sticks to the scalp and face, doesn't really spread all over like this. And the nail stuff doesn't match either.\n\nHow about contact dermatitis? It's possible, but he said no new products or meds, and it's all over his body, which would be unusual without a systemic exposure.\n\nLichen planus? It can cause skin and nail changes, but the pattern is usually different, more of a purple, pruritic rash, and not this kind of erythroderma.\n\nCutaneous T-cell lymphoma, like mycosis fungoides, could be in the running. It can cause these kinds of skin changes, especially in older adults, and the nail involvement isn't out of the question. But, usually, there are more patches or plaques before it gets to this stage.\n\nParaneoplastic syndrome? Hmm, that's a thought. It can cause skin changes due to an underlying cancer, but usually, there are other symptoms, like weight loss or fatigue, which he doesn't have.\n\nOkay, let's think about the treatment. He got IV fluids and wet-wrap therapy with topical steroids, and that seemed to help. That kind of treatment can work for a few of these conditions, but it doesn't really rule any out.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I'm leaning towards psoriatic erythroderma. The age, the widespread scaling, the nail changes, and the response to treatment all fit. But, I'm keeping cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in mind as a close second, just because of the nail and skin changes. Yeah, that seems to make the most sense.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 70-year-old man with the pruritic exanthem:\n\n1. **Psoriatic Erythroderma** - Given the patient's age, the widespread salmon-colored plaques, and nail changes, psoriatic erythroderma is a strong consideration.\n\n2. **Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris** - This condition is known for similar skin manifestations and can occur in older adults, but the nail changes are not as typical.\n\n3. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides)** - This can cause skin changes and nail involvement, especially in older adults, and should be considered.\n\n4. **Atopic Dermatitis (Eczema)** - Although less likely due to the patient's age and the nature of the rash, it cannot be entirely ruled out.\n\n5. **Seborrheic Dermatitis** - Unlikely, as it typically does not spread beyond the scalp and face.\n\n6. **Contact Dermatitis** - Possible, but the lack of new exposures and the widespread nature of the rash make it less likely.\n\n7. **Lichen Planus** - Can cause skin and nail changes, but the pattern is usually different.\n\n8. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - Could be considered due to the potential for underlying malignancy, but usually accompanied by other symptoms.\n\n9. **Drug-induced Erythroderma** - Despite no new medications, it's important to consider, especially in older adults.\n\n10. **Nutritional Deficiency** - Certain deficiencies can cause skin changes, though less likely given the presentation.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are **Psoriatic Erythroderma** and **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides)**, with psoriatic erythroderma being the most likely given the response to treatment and clinical presentation.", "topic": "['Dermatology']"}

He underwent incisional biopsy at another institution and presented for a second opinion on the diagnosis. Overall, he was in good health with no underlying systemic diseases. Results of the most recent serologic analysis and urinalysis were also reportedly within normal limits. The extraoral examination was unremarkable, with no skin lesions, asymmetry, redness, swelling, or lymphadenopathy observed. The intraoral examination revealed an erythematous denuded area of the midline posterior dorsal tongue, with a central nodular component (Figure 1A). The nodule was firm to palpation and nontender. The remaining oral soft tissue was unremarkable. Because a biopsy specimen was already obtained, blank slides were requested from the aforementioned institution, and staining was performed in house. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Localized amyloidosis (amyloidoma)", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 46-year-old man with a lesion on the back of his tongue. It's erythematous with a central nodule, and he's not feeling any pain or discomfort from it. That's interesting because painful lesions often point us in different directions. So, what could this be?\n\nFirst off, let's consider something like a traumatic ulcer. Those can definitely appear as erythematous areas with a central necrotic or ulcerated part. But, he didn't mention any trauma, and it's been there long enough to be found by his dentist. So, maybe not trauma.\n\nNext, I'm thinking about a neoplasm. The firm, nontender nature of the nodule is a bit concerning. Neoplasms, especially malignant ones like squamous cell carcinoma, can present this way. It's the back of the tongue, a common site for these. Definitely something to keep in mind.\n\nNow, let's not forget about infectious causes. Something like histoplasmosis could show up as a nodular lesion, especially if it's granulomatous. But, usually, there are other symptoms or signs, and his tests were normal. Hmm, maybe not histoplasmosis.\n\nWhat about a salivary gland tumor? They can occur in strange places, like the tongue, and be firm. But, they're not usually on the dorsal surface. That's more of a minor possibility.\n\nOh, and we can't ignore the possibility of something like a granular cell tumor. These are often found on the tongue and can be firm and nontender. They're benign, but they fit the description pretty well.\n\nNow, let's think about lymphoma. It can show up as a firm, painless mass. The tongue isn't the most common site, but it's possible. And, he's middle-aged, which is when these can start to appear.\n\nI should also consider tuberculosis. It can cause granulomatous lesions, but usually, there are other symptoms. His tests were normal, so this seems less likely.\n\nWhat about a benign sort of thing, like a fibroma? Those are common, firm, and nontender. But, they're not usually erythematous. Still, worth considering.\n\nAnd then there's the possibility of something like a papillary hyperplasia. That's more of a reactive thing, often related to things like dentures. But, he didn't mention any prosthetics, so maybe not.\n\nLastly, let's think about a vascular tumor, like a hemangioma. Those can be firm and have a nodular appearance. But, they're not usually found on the dorsal tongue. So, that's a long shot.\n\nOkay, let's put it all together. Based on everything, I'm leaning towards something like a granular cell tumor or a lymphoma. Both fit the firm, nontender nature and the location. But, I can't rule out a neoplasm like squamous cell carcinoma. It's a common site and presentation for that too. I think these are my top possibilities.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the lesion on the dorsal tongue, with each step presenting a unique possibility:\n\n1. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - Given the location and presentation, this is a strong consideration.\n2. **Granular Cell Tumor** - Common on the tongue, these are often firm and nontender.\n3. **Lymphoma** - Can present as a firm, painless mass, and the patient's age is relevant.\n4. **Traumatic Ulcer** - Although the patient didn't report trauma, it's a possibility to consider.\n5. **Histoplasmosis** - Could present with nodular lesions, but usually with other symptoms.\n6. **Salivary Gland Tumor** - Uncommon on the dorsal tongue, but should be considered.\n7. **Tuberculosis** - Typically presents with other symptoms, but can cause granulomatous lesions.\n8. **Fibroma** - Common, firm, and nontender, but usually not erythematous.\n9. **Papillary Hyperplasia** - Often reactive, but less likely without prosthetic history.\n10. **Hemangioma** - A vascular tumor, though not typically found on the dorsal tongue.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are **Granular Cell Tumor**, **Lymphoma**, and **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**, as they best fit the lesion's characteristics and location. However, it's important to correlate these with the biopsy results for a definitive diagnosis.", "topic": "['Otolaryngology', 'Dental Medicine']"}

In the previous month, he had received the first cycle of a chemotherapeutic regimen of ixazomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone to treat a recurrence of IgG-κ multiple myeloma with a 10-year history. Physical examination showed annular erythematous plaques of up to 2 cm in diameter, with violaceous and crusted centers on the neck and trunk. On the right chest, an annular erythematous lesion with 2 zones of color—a central area of purpura and an outer erythematous and edematous ring—was present (Figure, A). Laboratory investigations found pancytopenia: a white blood cell count of 2.3 × 103/μL (reference range, 3.5-9.8 × 103/μL), hemoglobin levels of 12.1 g/dL (reference range, 13.5-17.6 g/dL), platelet count of 29 × 103/μL (reference range, 130-400 × 103μL), and elevated serum C-reactive protein levels of 3.31 mg/dL (reference range, <0.30 mg/dL). Blood culture results were negative. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor analogs had not been prescribed to the patient. Skin biopsy from a lesion on the left chest was performed for histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses (Figure, B-D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a man in his late 60s who's been dealing with a fever and some pretty painful skin lesions for about 10 days. He's also on chemotherapy for multiple myeloma, which is a big deal because it can really mess with the immune system. \n\nFirst off, the fever and skin issues make me think of an infection. Chemotherapy can make people more vulnerable to infections, so that's a strong possibility. Maybe something like cellulitis or erysipelas? Those are common skin infections that can cause red, painful areas. \n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. The skin lesions are described as annular erythematous plaques with violaceous centers. That's a bit unusual for a typical bacterial infection. It sounds more like something that could be related to his chemotherapy or maybe even a sign of a hematological issue. \n\nOh, and there's pancytopenia. That's when there's a drop in white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets. It's a common side effect of chemotherapy, but it also means he's at a higher risk for infections and bleeding. This could explain the fever and maybe even the skin lesions if they're related to bleeding or a clotting issue. \n\nNow, let's think about the possibility of a drug reaction. He's on ixazomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone. These drugs can cause skin reactions, and sometimes they can be pretty severe. Could this be a drug-induced rash? It's possible, but the description of the lesions seems a bit off for a typical drug rash. \n\nHmm, what about Sweet's syndrome? That's a condition that can cause fever, leukocytosis, and tender skin lesions. It's associated with hematological disorders like multiple myeloma, so it fits the bill. But, we need to be careful because the lesions don't exactly match the classic description. \n\nLet's not forget about vasculitis. The purpuric centers of the lesions could indicate some kind of vascular involvement. Vasculitis could cause these symptoms, especially in someone with an underlying hematological condition. \n\nOh, and there's also the possibility of a viral infection. Viruses like HSV or CMV can cause skin lesions and are more likely in someone who's immunocompromised. But, we didn't get any specific viral symptoms or positive blood cultures, so it's a bit of a stretch. \n\nNow, considering the negative blood cultures, it's less likely to be a systemic bacterial infection. But, it could still be a localized infection or something atypical that doesn't show up in blood cultures. \n\nAlright, let's think about the skin biopsy. If it shows any evidence of vasculitis or a specific type of infiltrate, that could really point us in the right direction. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top differential diagnosis is Sweet's syndrome. It fits with the fever, skin lesions, and hematological background. But, we should also consider vasculitis and drug reactions as possibilities. \n\nIn the end, Sweet's syndrome seems like the most likely explanation, but we need to keep an open mind and consider all the possibilities until we get more information from the biopsy.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Cellulitis** - Given the fever and tender skin lesions, cellulitis is a common initial consideration, especially in an immunocompromised patient.\n\n2. **Erysipelas** - Similar to cellulitis, erysipelas is a type of skin infection that can cause raised, red, and painful lesions.\n\n3. **Drug Reaction** - The patient's recent chemotherapy regimen could be causing a skin reaction, although the lesion description is somewhat atypical for a drug rash.\n\n4. **Sweet's Syndrome** - This condition is characterized by fever, leukocytosis, and tender skin lesions, often associated with hematological disorders like multiple myeloma.\n\n5. **Vasculitis** - The presence of purpuric centers in the lesions suggests possible vascular involvement, which could indicate vasculitis.\n\n6. **Viral Infection (e.g., HSV or CMV)** - Immunocompromised patients are more susceptible to viral infections, which can cause skin lesions, although specific viral symptoms are absent.\n\n7. **Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN)** - A severe skin reaction usually to medications, characterized by skin detachment, but the description doesn't fully match.\n\n8. **Disseminated Fungal Infection** - In immunocompromised individuals, fungal infections can disseminate and cause skin lesions, but usually, there are more systemic symptoms.\n\n9. **Leukemia Cutis** - Involvement of the skin by leukemic cells, which can occur in hematological malignancies, presenting as papules, plaques, or nodules.\n\n10. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum** - A skin condition causing painful ulcers, often associated with systemic diseases, but the lesion description doesn't perfectly align.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnosis is **Sweet's Syndrome**, given the combination of fever, tender skin lesions, and the patient's hematological background. **Vasculitis** and **Drug Reaction** are also strong considerations.

On presentation, nivolumab and obinutuzumab treatment was complete. His visual acuity was 20/125 OD and 20/50 OS. Ophthalmoscopy revealed bilateral panuveitis with diffuse pigmentary abnormalities. Fluorescein angiography showed diffuse retinal pigment epithelium loss and late staining of the retinal lesions. He received 60 mg of oral prednisone daily for 2 weeks with a planned 10-week taper. However, prednisone was discontinued due to positive Lyme disease exposure 6 weeks later. At this time, the active anterior and vitreous cells had resolved. However, 2 weeks later, visual acuity decreased to count fingers in his right eye and hand motions in the left eye. The anterior and vitreous chambers had grade +0.5 pigmented cells. The ophthalmoscopic examination showed a leopard-spot pattern (Figure 1), and optical coherence tomography showed substantial retinal pigment epithelium and outer retinal layer loss. Repeat testing for Treponema pallidum, Lyme disease, and HIV was negative. Results of magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbit were negative for leukemic infiltration. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Immune checkpoint inhibitor–induced panuveitis of both eyes", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 63-year-old man who's been dealing with some pretty serious health issues. He's had stage 3 cutaneous melanoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Oh, and he's been on some heavy-duty meds too, like nivolumab and obinutuzumab. Now, he's experiencing this weird 'kaleidoscope vision.' That's quite a unique symptom. \n\nFirst off, the kaleidoscope vision and the fact that he's got panuveitis with pigmentary changes in his eyes make me think of autoimmune issues. Autoimmune retinopathy could be a contender here. It's known to cause these kinds of symptoms, especially in someone with a history like his. \n\nBut wait, there's more. The fact that he was on nivolumab, which is an immunotherapy drug, makes me wonder if this could be an immune-related adverse effect. Nivolumab can definitely cause uveitis, but the extent of the retinal damage is making me think there's more to it. \n\nHmm, let's not forget about his cancer history. Melanoma can spread, right? Could this be metastatic? But then again, the MRI didn't show any signs of leukemic infiltration, so maybe not. \n\nOh, and he was also on obinutuzumab. That's a B-cell inhibitor. Could it be contributing to this? I'm not sure it's the main player here, but it's worth keeping in mind. \n\nNow, he was on prednisone, which seemed to help at first, but then it got discontinued because of a Lyme disease scare. That's when his vision took a turn for the worse. Interesting. \n\nThe leopard-spot pattern in his retina is really striking. That's not something you see every day. It makes me think of conditions that affect the retinal pigment epithelium, like birdshot chorioretinopathy. But he doesn't quite fit the typical profile for that. \n\nAlso, given his history of melanoma, I have to consider if this could be related to that. Like, could it be a paraneoplastic syndrome? Those can cause some pretty unusual eye problems. \n\nAnd then there's the possibility of an infection. He was tested for things like syphilis, Lyme disease, and HIV, and all came back negative. So, that's probably not it. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I'm leaning towards this being an autoimmune issue, maybe something like autoimmune retinopathy. It fits with his symptoms and history. But I'm also keeping paraneoplastic syndrome on the table, given his melanoma history. \n\nYeah, that seems to make the most sense. Autoimmune retinopathy as the top contender, with paraneoplastic syndrome as a close second. That explains the kaleidoscope vision and the retinal changes pretty well.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Autoimmune Retinopathy** - This condition is characterized by progressive vision loss and retinal changes, often associated with autoimmune responses, which could be exacerbated by the patient's medication history.\n\n2. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - Given the patient's history of melanoma, a paraneoplastic syndrome affecting the retina is a strong consideration, as these syndromes can cause unique visual disturbances.\n\n3. **Nivolumab-induced Uveitis** - As an immune-related adverse effect of nivolumab, uveitis could contribute to the patient's panuveitis and retinal changes.\n\n4. **Birdshot Chorioretinopathy** - The leopard-spot pattern observed in the retina is reminiscent of birdshot chorioretinopathy, an autoimmune condition affecting the choroid and retina.\n\n5. **Metastatic Melanoma** - Although the MRI showed no signs of infiltration, the possibility of metastatic melanoma causing retinal changes should not be entirely ruled out.\n\n6. **Obinutuzumab-related Retinopathy** - While less likely, the B-cell inhibitor could potentially contribute to retinal toxicity or exacerbate autoimmune responses.\n\n7. **Acute Zonal Occult Outer Retinopathy (AZOOR)** - This condition involves sudden vision loss and retinal changes, which align with the patient's symptoms.\n\n8. **Cancer-associated Retinopathy (CAR)** - Another paraneoplastic syndrome to consider, CAR can cause progressive vision loss and retinal degeneration.\n\n9. **Persistent Cytomegalovirus Retinitis** - Although the patient's HIV test was negative, atypical presentations can occur, especially in immunocompromised individuals.\n\n10. **Autoimmune-related Outer Retinal Necrosis** - This condition involves retinal necrosis and could be linked to the patient's autoimmune and medication profile.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are **Autoimmune Retinopathy** and **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**, as they best explain the combination of symptoms and the patient's medical history.

In addition, fundus examination revealed an inferior retinal detachment without any associated visible tear. Intraocular pressure was 15 mm Hg in the right eye and 9 mm Hg in the left eye. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography images and fundus photographs of both eyes are shown in Figure 1. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Iris retraction syndrome", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 53-year-old woman who's about to have cataract surgery, but suddenly her vision in that eye gets worse. That's odd. And then, the doctor notices a reverse pupillary block. Hmm, that's not something you see every day. So, what's going on here?\n\nFirst, let's consider the basics. Cataracts can cause vision problems, but a sudden drop like this? That's a bit suspicious. Maybe something else is happening. Could it be uveitis? That's known to cause inflammation and could explain the sudden change.\n\nBut wait, there's more. The anterior chamber is deeper than usual. That's not typical for uveitis alone. It makes me think about other possibilities, like a dislocated lens. That could cause the chamber to deepen and might be why her vision suddenly got worse.\n\nOh, and there's the low intraocular pressure. It's 9 mm Hg in the affected eye, which is lower than normal. That's interesting. Low pressure like this could mean something's not right with the way fluid is moving in the eye. Could it be a cyclodialysis cleft? That's when the ciliary body detaches, causing low pressure and deepening of the chamber.\n\nBut let's not forget the retinal detachment. It's on the inferior part of the retina, and there's no obvious tear. That's strange. Retinal detachments usually have a tear, so what's causing this? Could it be traction from the vitreous? Or maybe it's related to the lens issue?\n\nNow, let's think about the possibility of a lens subluxation. If the lens is out of place, it could cause all sorts of problems, including the deep chamber, the uveitis, and even the retinal detachment. That might explain the whole picture.\n\nBut what about other causes of low pressure, like a traumatic cataract? If there was some unnoticed trauma, it could lead to similar symptoms. However, there's no history of trauma, so this seems less likely.\n\nWe should also consider conditions that affect the lens and the retina, like Marfan syndrome. It can cause lens subluxation and retinal issues. But, there's no mention of systemic symptoms or a history suggestive of Marfan's, so maybe that's not it.\n\nOh, and what about a vitreous base detachment? That could cause traction on the retina and lead to a detachment without a tear. It's a possibility, but would it explain the deep chamber and the uveitis?\n\nLet's not forget about inflammation. Anterior uveitis is present, and it could be due to various causes, including infections like toxoplasmosis. But, there's no response to treatment mentioned, so maybe it's not infectious.\n\nFinally, there's the idea of a posterior segment issue, like a posterior vitreous detachment. It could cause traction and lead to the retinal detachment. But, would it cause the deep chamber and the uveitis? Probably not.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the most likely explanation is lens subluxation. It ties together the deep anterior chamber, the uveitis, the low pressure, and the retinal detachment. It seems to fit the whole clinical picture best.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Uveitis** - The presence of keratic precipitates and aqueous flare suggests inflammation within the eye, which could be due to uveitis.\n\n2. **Lens Subluxation** - The deepening of the anterior chamber and the sudden decrease in vision could indicate a dislocated lens causing these symptoms.\n\n3. **Cyclodialysis Cleft** - The low intraocular pressure and deep anterior chamber may suggest a detachment of the ciliary body, leading to abnormal fluid dynamics.\n\n4. **Retinal Detachment due to Vitreous Traction** - The inferior retinal detachment without a visible tear could be caused by vitreous traction.\n\n5. **Traumatic Cataract** - Although there's no history of trauma, unnoticed injury could lead to similar symptoms, including low intraocular pressure.\n\n6. **Marfan Syndrome** - This connective tissue disorder can cause lens subluxation and retinal detachment, but typically presents with systemic symptoms.\n\n7. **Vitreous Base Detachment** - This could cause retinal traction and detachment without a tear, but may not explain the anterior segment findings.\n\n8. **Infectious Uveitis (e.g., Toxoplasmosis)** - Inflammation could be due to an infectious cause, but there's no mention of response to antimicrobial treatment.\n\n9. **Posterior Vitreous Detachment** - This could lead to retinal issues, but is less likely to cause the observed anterior segment changes.\n\n10. **Microspherophakia** - This condition involves a small, spherical lens that can cause anterior displacement and related complications.\n\nUpon reviewing all the symptoms and test results, the most likely diagnosis is **Lens Subluxation**.

On physical examination, numerous nontender violaceous plaques were seen on the forehead and scalp of the patient (Figure, A).

We've got an elderly man who's been feeling weak and tired for about a month. He's also got these strange purple bruises on his head, but he says he hasn't bumped into anything. That's odd. He's on blood thinners for his atrial fibrillation, so that could explain some bruising, but not all of it. \n\nNow, looking at his blood work, he's got anemia, low platelets, and not many white blood cells. That's a big red flag for something going on with his bone marrow. Could it be myelodysplastic syndrome? That's a possibility. \n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. The skin findings are really interesting too. Those purple plaques on his head are kind of distinctive. They remind me of something specific. Could it be Sweet's syndrome? That's characterized by these sudden onset plaques and can be linked to hematological issues. \n\nOh, and there's that skin biopsy they did. I wonder what it showed. If it's Sweet's syndrome, we might see those dense neutrophilic infiltrates in the skin. That would fit. \n\nBut, I should consider other possibilities too. What about leukemia cutis? That's when leukemia cells deposit in the skin, and it can cause similar lesions. Given his blood counts, an acute leukemia is definitely on the table. \n\nHmm, let's think about the biopsy again. If it shows atypical lymphocytes or blasts, that would point more towards leukemia cutis. \n\nNow, what about other causes of pancytopenia? Aplastic anemia could do it, but it doesn't explain the skin lesions. And myelofibrosis? That usually has a different presentation, like splenomegaly, which he doesn't have. \n\nOh, and there's parvovirus B19. That can cause pure red cell aplasia, especially in someone with a history of heart failure. But would it cause these skin lesions? Not typically. \n\nLet's not forget about drug reactions. He's on anticoagulants, and sometimes those can cause skin reactions or even pancytopenia if there's an immune response.

For now, leukemia cutis seems like the most likely explanation.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Leukemia Cutis** - Given the combination of the patient's hematological abnormalities and the distinctive skin lesions, leukemia cutis is a strong contender. It involves the infiltration of leukemic cells into the skin, which could explain the plaques.\n\n2. **Sweet's Syndrome** - This condition is characterized by the sudden onset of fever, leukocytosis, and tender erythematous skin lesions, often associated with underlying hematological disorders. The patient's skin findings are reminiscent of this syndrome.\n\n3. **Myelodysplastic Syndrome** - This could explain the pancytopenia, as it is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder that can lead to ineffective blood cell production.\n\n4. **Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)** - AML could present with similar blood abnormalities and skin involvement, as leukemic cells may infiltrate the skin.\n\n5. **Aplastic Anemia** - While it can cause pancytopenia, it typically does not present with specific skin lesions like those described.\n\n6. **Myelofibrosis** - This condition usually presents with splenomegaly and other findings not present in this case.\n\n7. **Parvovirus B19 Infection** - Known to cause pure red cell aplasia, especially in those with underlying conditions like heart failure, but it doesn't typically cause skin lesions.\n\n8. **Drug Reaction** - The patient's anticoagulation medication could potentially cause skin reactions or contribute to pancytopenia, but the specific skin findings are not typical for a drug reaction.\n\n9. **Hematophagic Histocytosis** - A condition involving the overactivation of the immune system, which can lead to pancytopenia and potentially skin manifestations.\n\n10. **Lymphoma** - Although less likely, lymphoma could present with skin involvement and hematological abnormalities, especially if there is systemic involvement.\n\nAfter considering all the information, leukemia cutis emerges as the most likely diagnosis given the combination of skin and blood findings.

We've got a 47-year-old woman with left-sided facial weakness and swelling. That's been going on for a couple of months, and it started after her fourth round of chemotherapy for ovarian cancer. Hmm, that's interesting. She's also on oral antidiabetic meds, and her blood glucose is a bit high at 110 mg/dL. Okay, so she's got this lower-motor-neuron type of facial nerve palsy. That's pretty specific. No other neurological issues though, which is good. And no COVID-19 history, so we can put that aside for now.\n\nNow, they did an MRI because they were worried about metastasis, given her cancer history and those elevated CA125 levels. But the brain MRI didn't show any tumors or lesions in the brain tissue or meninges. That's a relief, but it doesn't solve our mystery.\n\nOh, but there's something about the maxillary sinuses. They're showing mucosal thickening and some weird signal characteristics on the MRI. It's intermediate to hypointense on T2 and hypointense on T1 with postcontrast enhancement. That sounds like something's going on in the sinuses. And the CT scan shows bony destruction and remodeling in those areas. Hmm, that's definitely not normal.\n\nSo, what could be causing this? Let's think about the possibilities. With her history of ovarian cancer, metastasis is definitely on the table. Tumors can spread to unusual places, so maybe that's what's happening here. But wait, there's no brain involvement, which is a bit odd if it were metastasis.\n\nWhat about something like a fungal infection? She's on chemotherapy, so her immune system might be compromised. Fungal infections can show up in the sinuses and cause those kinds of changes on imaging. Aspergillosis or mucormycosis could be possibilities. They can be pretty aggressive in someone who's immunocompromised.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about the diabetes. High blood sugar can make her more prone to infections, especially fungal ones. That could be a factor here too.\n\nBut we shouldn't jump to conclusions. What about other types of infections, like bacterial or viral? They could cause sinusitis, but the imaging findings seem a bit too aggressive for a simple infection. And there's no mention of other symptoms like fever or nasal discharge.\n\nHmm, what about a non-infectious process? Something like a granulomatous disease could cause sinus involvement and bone changes. Wegener's granulomatosis or sarcoidosis might fit the bill. They can be sneaky and show up in unexpected ways.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? We've got a few possibilities. Metastasis is still on the list, given her cancer history. But fungal infection seems pretty likely too, especially with her immune system being compromised from chemo. And we can't completely rule out something like a granulomatous disease. It's a complex case, and we'll need more information to pin it down for sure.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, considering her history of ovarian cancer, chemotherapy, and the imaging findings:\n\n1. **Metastasis** - Given her history of high-grade serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary, metastasis to the maxillary sinuses is a strong consideration.\n\n2. **Fungal Sinusitis** - The patient's compromised immune system from chemotherapy increases her risk for fungal infections like aspergillosis or mucormycosis, which can aggressively involve the sinuses.\n\n3. **Granulomatous Disease** - Conditions like Wegener's granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis) or sarcoidosis could cause sinus involvement and bony changes.\n\n4. **Bacterial Sinusitis** - Although less likely given the aggressive imaging findings, bacterial sinusitis could still be a consideration, especially in an immunocompromised patient.\n\n5. **Viral Sinusitis** - Viral infections could cause sinusitis, but they typically do not result in bony destruction.\n\n6. **Osteonecrosis** - Medications or chemotherapy could potentially lead to osteonecrosis, affecting the maxillary sinuses.\n\n7. **Pseudomonas Sinusitis** - This bacterial infection is more common in immunocompromised individuals and could cause significant sinus disease.\n\n8. **Tuberculous Sinusitis** - Although rare, tuberculosis could involve the sinuses and cause similar findings.\n\n9. **Aspergilloma** - A fungal ball could form in the sinuses, especially in an immunocompromised host.\n\n10. **Lymphoma** - Sinus involvement by lymphoma is possible and could mimic the imaging findings.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top three differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Fungal Sinusitis** - Given the patient's immunocompromised state and the aggressive nature of the sinus disease, fungal infection is highly likely.\n\n2. **Metastasis** - The history of ovarian cancer and imaging findings make metastasis a strong consideration.\n\n3. **Granulomatous Disease** - Conditions like Wegener's granulomatosis or sarcoidosis could explain the sinus involvement and bony changes.\n\nThese diagnoses take into account the patient's complex medical history and the specific imaging findings. Further investigation, including biopsy or culture, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.", "topic": "['Oncology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology', 'Facial Nerve']"}

Let’s think step by step.\n### INPUT:\nA 64-year-old woman presented with diminution of vision, progressive redness, and dull aching pain in the right eye for 8 months. There was no history of trauma. Her medical history was unremarkable. On examination, her best-corrected visual acuity measured 20/60 OD and  20/25 OS. The anterior segment showed dilated corkscrew conjunctival vessels (Figure 1), a shallow anterior chamber in the right eye, and nuclear cataract in both eyes. Pupillary reaction and color vision were normal in both eyes. Intraocular pressure was 16 mm Hg by Goldman applanation tonometry in both eyes. Gonioscopy revealed an occludable angle in the right eye without evidence of blood in the Schlemm canal. Both eyes’ extraocular movements were full and free in all directions of gaze. Dilated fundus examination showed a clear vitreous cavity in the right eye, 360° serous choroidal detachment partly obscuring the optic disc nasally (Figure 1), and the fundus in the left eye was unremarkable. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Low-flow carotid cavernous fistula", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 64-year-old woman who's been dealing with vision issues, redness, and pain in her right eye for quite a while now, 8 months to be exact. No trauma involved, which is interesting. Her medical history doesn't really raise any flags either. So, what's going on here?\n\nFirst off, the vision in her right eye isn't great, 20/60 compared to 20/25 in the left. That's a noticeable difference. And then there are those dilated corkscrew conjunctival vessels. That's a clue. Could be something like a cataract causing these issues? But wait, the cataract is in both eyes, so that doesn't explain the difference in vision.\n\nThe anterior chamber in the right eye is shallow. That's something to note. Shallow anterior chambers can lead to angle-closure glaucoma, but her intraocular pressure is normal. Hmm, that's odd. Maybe it's not glaucoma then.\n\nNow, let's talk about that 360° serous choroidal detachment. That's a big deal. Choroidal detachments can happen for a few reasons. Could be from inflammation, like in uveitis, or maybe a tumor, or even a vascular issue like carotid-cavernous fistula. But there's no history of trauma, so that's less likely.\n\nThe corkscrew vessels are really sticking out to me. They make me think of a condition like Sturge-Weber syndrome, which involves facial port-wine stains and glaucoma. But she doesn't have any skin issues, and her pressure is normal, so that's probably not it.\n\nLet's consider other possibilities. Could it be a choroidal melanoma? That would explain the choroidal detachment and the vision problems. But usually, you'd expect more obvious tumor signs on exam.\n\nHow about uveitis? It could cause some of these symptoms, but we'd likely see more inflammation signs, like in the vitreous or anterior chamber.\n\nMaybe it's something vascular, like a carotid artery issue. That could lead to ischemic changes and vision problems. But there's no mention of other typical symptoms like transient ischemic attacks.\n\nI'm also thinking about conditions that affect the sclera, like scleritis. That could cause pain and vision issues, but we'd expect more signs of inflammation.\n\nLet's not forget about glaucoma. Even though the pressure is normal, could it still be a type of glaucoma? Like angle-closure without pressure elevation? That's a possibility.\n\nOh, and what about a ciliochoroidal effusion? That could cause the choroidal detachment and is often related to inflammation or vascular issues.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? After thinking it through, I'd say the top possibilities are ciliochoroidal effusion, maybe related to a low-flow vascular issue, or a choroidal melanoma. Both fit the symptoms and exam findings pretty well. But we need more tests to be sure, like an ultrasound or MRI to check for a mass or vascular abnormalities.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the condition described, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Choroidal Melanoma** - This is a plausible consideration given the presence of serous choroidal detachment and vision changes.\n\n2. **Ciliochoroidal Effusion** - This could explain the choroidal detachment and is often related to inflammation or vascular issues.\n\n3. **Angle-Closure Glaucoma** - Despite normal intraocular pressure, the shallow anterior chamber and occludable angle make this a possibility.\n\n4. **Sturge-Weber Syndrome** - The dilated corkscrew conjunctival vessels are reminiscent of this condition, although the lack of skin involvement and normal pressure make it less likely.\n\n5. **Uveitis** - Could cause some of the symptoms, but typically more signs of inflammation would be present.\n\n6. **Carotid-Cavernous Fistula** - A vascular issue that could lead to choroidal detachment, although usually associated with other symptoms like pulsatile tinnitus.\n\n7. **Scleritis** - Could cause pain and vision issues, but more signs of inflammation would be expected.\n\n8. **Vascular Occlusion** - Such as a retinal vein occlusion, which could lead to choroidal changes and vision loss.\n\n9. **Choroidal Hemangioma** - A vascular tumor that could cause detachment and vision changes.\n\n10. **Low-Flow Vascular Disorder** - A condition affecting blood flow to the eye, potentially leading to choroidal detachment and vision issues.\n\nAfter considering all the information and test results, the top differential diagnoses are **Choroidal Melanoma** and **Ciliochoroidal Effusion**, as they best fit the symptoms and examination findings.

She described several other episodes occurring at rest over the past several weeks. She denied palpitations, chest pain, and shortness of breath. She was otherwise in excellent health and not taking any medications. She had no family history of syncope or sudden death. Her vital signs and physical examination were unremarkable. The initial electrocardiogram (ECG) results were normal, but premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) were noted on telemetry. Shortly thereafter, 2 episodes of fast polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT), 30 minutes apart, were recorded, both lasting less than 4 seconds (Figure 1A). A repeat ECG showed PVCs (Figure 1B). Laboratory test results including serum potassium and magnesium as well as 3 serial troponin levels were normal. Echocardiography showed normal left ventricular systolic function without wall motion abnormalities or valvular abnormalities. Coronary angiography showed a 50% stenosis of the left circumflex artery. Instant wave-free ratio across the stenosis was 1.0. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Short-coupled PVCs initiating PVT", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. A woman in her late 60s fainted, and it's not the first time. She's had a few of these episodes while just resting. No heart racing, chest pain, or trouble breathing, which is interesting. She's healthy, doesn't take meds, and there's no family history of similar issues. Her vitals and exam are normal. Hmm, okay, so what's going on with her heart? The initial ECG is normal, but then we see these PVCs on telemetry. That's something. Then, she has these short bursts of fast polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. They're brief, but they're there. Her labs, including potassium and magnesium, are fine. And her heart's structure looks good on the echo. Oh, and there's a 50% blockage in one of her coronary arteries, but it's not considered significant with an instant wave-free ratio of 1.0. So, what could be causing these fainting spells?\n\nFirst, let's consider arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. It's a possibility because it can cause PVCs and fainting, but usually, you'd see some abnormalities on the echo, which we don't have here.\n\nNext, let's think about Brugada syndrome. It can cause sudden heart issues, but we'd expect to see specific changes on the ECG, which aren't mentioned.\n\nHow about long QT interval syndrome? It can cause fainting and dangerous heart rhythms, but again, we'd likely see a prolonged QT on the ECG, which isn't the case here.\n\nCatecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is another one to consider. It's known for exercise-induced symptoms, but it can also occur at rest, like in this case. It's a strong contender.\n\nWe should also think about right ventricular outflow tract ventricular tachycardia. It's characterized by PVCs and can cause syncope, fitting her symptoms well.\n\nIdiopathic ventricular tachycardia is another possibility. It can cause PVCs and syncope without structural heart disease, which aligns with her normal echo.\n\nWhat about myocardial bridging? It's when a coronary artery dives into the heart muscle, potentially causing symptoms. Her 50% stenosis could be related, but it's usually more significant in younger patients.\n\nLet's not forget about hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. It's a common cause of syncope, but we'd expect to see some hypertrophy on the echo, which we don't.\n\nWe should also consider coronary artery disease, but with her normal stress test and non-significant stenosis, it's less likely.\n\nLastly, there's aortic stenosis. It can cause syncope, but we'd hear a murmur on exam or see changes on the echo, neither of which are present.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top possibilities are catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and right ventricular outflow tract ventricular tachycardia. Both fit her symptoms and test results well. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and idiopathic ventricular tachycardia are also up there, but less likely given the normal echo and ECG. The others, like Brugada syndrome and long QT interval syndrome, don't match her test results. Myocardial bridging is possible but less common at her age. Coronary artery disease and aortic stenosis are unlikely given the normal exams and tests. So, CPVT and RVOT VT are my top picks.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the top differential diagnoses for the woman's syncope episodes are:\n\n1. **Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT)**: This condition is characterized by episodes of syncope and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, often triggered by emotional stress or physical activity, but can also occur at rest. The presence of PVCs and short bursts of polymorphic VT aligns with this diagnosis.\n\n2. **Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Ventricular Tachycardia (RVOT VT)**: This is another strong contender, as it often presents with PVCs and can lead to syncope. The normal echocardiogram and lack of structural heart abnormalities support this possibility.\n\n3. **Idiopathic Ventricular Tachycardia**: This can cause PVCs and syncope in the absence of structural heart disease, which fits the patient's normal echo and ECG findings.\n\n4. **Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)**: Although typically associated with abnormalities on echo, early or mild cases might not show clear structural changes, keeping it on the list of possibilities.\n\n5. **Myocardial Bridging**: While less common in older patients, the presence of a coronary artery with 50% stenosis could potentially contribute to ischemic episodes triggering arrhythmias.\n\nThe other conditions, such as Brugada syndrome, long QT interval syndrome, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, and aortic stenosis, are less likely due to the lack of specific ECG changes, murmurs, or structural abnormalities on the echo. \n\n## Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this.

His temperature was 37.9 °C (100.2 °F); heart rate, 74/min; and blood pressure, 90/49 mm Hg. He had tenderness to palpation and decreased range of motion of his right shoulder. Laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 9.6 ×  109/L (reference, 4.0-9.0 × 109/L); C-reactive protein level, 35.6 mg/dL (reference, <0.3 mg/dL), and creatine kinase level, 1036 U/L (17.30 μkat/L) (reference, 60-270 U/L [1.00-4.51 μkat/L]). Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an effusion and synovial thickening with enhancement in the right shoulder joint and inflammation in the right subscapularis muscle. Gram stain of the synovial fluid revealed gram-positive cocci in clusters. Intravenous cefazolin therapy was initiated, and he underwent right shoulder joint arthroscopic irrigation, synovectomy, and surgical drainage for subscapularis pyomyositis. Blood and synovial fluid cultures grew methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and intravenous cefazolin was continued. One week after hospitalization, the patient developed asymptomatic black discoloration of the dorsal surface of his tongue (Figure). He reported no prior lingual discoloration and did not smoke cigarettes, use chewing tobacco or illicit drugs, or drink alcohol. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Black hairy tongue (lingua villosa nigra)", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an 80-year-old man who's been dealing with a fever and right shoulder pain for five days. That's quite a while to be in pain and have a fever. His temperature is slightly elevated, and his blood pressure is on the lower side. That's something to keep in mind.\n\nNow, he's got tenderness and can't move his shoulder well. That sounds like something is really going on in the joint. The lab results show his white blood cell count is a bit high, and his C-reactive protein is definitely up, indicating some inflammation or infection. Hmm, and his creatine kinase is really high too. That's interesting because it suggests some muscle damage.\n\nThe MRI shows there's fluid in the shoulder joint and the synovium is thickened. Plus, there's inflammation in the subscapularis muscle. That's a lot of inflammation and could mean an infection like septic arthritis or myositis.\n\nOh, and the Gram stain shows gram-positive cocci in clusters. That's a big clue. It's pointing towards Staphylococcus aureus, which is a common cause of these types of infections.\n\nThey started him on cefazolin, which is a good choice for Staph infections, and he had surgery to clean out the joint and drain the infection. The cultures confirmed it's methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, so the treatment is spot on.\n\nBut then, a week later, he develops this black discoloration on his tongue. That's odd. He didn't have that before, and he doesn't smoke or use drugs, so it's not from those. Could it be from the medication?\n\nCefazolin is a cephalosporin antibiotic, and while it's not the most common cause of tongue discoloration, medications can sometimes cause strange reactions. It's possible that the antibiotic is causing this, maybe by altering the bacteria in his mouth or some other mechanism.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the black tongue is likely a reaction to the cefazolin. It's not harmful, but it's definitely something to note. This kind of reaction can happen with certain medications, and it's good to be aware of it.\n\n## Final Response\n\nHere is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, focusing on the shoulder pain and infection, followed by the black discoloration of the tongue:\n\n1. **Septic Arthritis** - Given the fever, shoulder pain, elevated white blood cell count, and MRI findings, septic arthritis is a strong initial consideration.\n\n2. **Pyomyositis** - The inflammation in the subscapularis muscle and high creatine kinase levels suggest pyomyositis, particularly in the context of an infection.\n\n3. **Cellulitis** - While less likely given the joint involvement, cellulitis could cause similar symptoms and should be considered.\n\n4. **Gout** - Although the lab findings and Gram stain point away from gout, it's a common cause of joint pain and should be considered.\n\n5. **Osteomyelitis** - Infection of the bone could present with similar symptoms, but the joint and muscle involvement make it less likely.\n\n6. **Rheumatoid Arthritis** - An autoimmune cause of joint pain, but the acute infectious presentation makes this less likely.\n\n7. **Tendinitis** - Could cause shoulder pain, but the systemic symptoms and lab findings suggest a more serious infection.\n\n8. **Bursitis** - Inflammation of the bursa could cause pain, but the infection indicators point towards a more complex issue.\n\n9. **Lyme Disease** - A possible cause of joint pain with a fever, but the Gram stain and culture results make this unlikely.\n\n10. **Medication Reaction** - For the black tongue, a reaction to cefazolin is possible, as medications can cause changes in oral flora or discoloration.\n\nReranking these based on all the information, the most likely diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Septic Arthritis** - Confirmed by the presence of infection in the joint.\n2. **Pyomyositis** - Supported by muscle inflammation and high creatine kinase.\n3. **Medication Reaction** - The black tongue is likely a reaction to cefazolin.\n\nThe other conditions are less likely given the specific lab and culture findings.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Rheumatology', 'Dental Medicine', 'Antibiotic Use, Overuse, Resistance, Stewardship']"}

She had received her medical care at outside facilities, the records of which were not available. She could not recall being given any precise diagnosis but reported having proteinuria since age 7 years. Her other medical conditions included hyperlipidemia, arterial hypertension, and pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex infection. She was taking tacrolimus, amlodipine, atorvastatin, ethambutol, rifampin, and clarithromycin. Her family history was unremarkable. She had 2 healthy adult children. One year after the first kidney transplant, she noted an inferior visual field defect in the left eye and was diagnosed with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Several years later, she underwent uncomplicated bilateral cataract procedures. Visual acuity with distance correction was 20/25 OD and 20/30 OS. Color vision was 14/14 plates for each eye. There was a left relative afferent pupillary defect. Confrontation visual field was full for the right eye and demonstrated an inferior defect for the left eye. External and slitlamp examinations were notable only for bilateral pseudophakia. Both optic discs were anomalous in appearance, with central excavation in the left eye greater than the right eye (Figure). The remainder of the posterior pole examination, including the retinal vessels, appeared normal in both eyes. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Papillorenal syndrome due to a PAX2 gene variant", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 72-year-old woman who's been having some visual changes in her left eye. She's had a pretty complex medical history, with two kidney transplants and a bunch of medications. Hmm, she mentioned proteinuria since age 7. That's quite early, so it might be a genetic kidney issue. Alport syndrome comes to mind because it can affect the kidneys and eyes. \n\nNow, let's look at her eye symptoms. She's got an inferior visual field defect in the left eye and was told it's nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. But wait, she's also got these anomalous-looking optic discs with central excavation. That sounds like optic disc coloboma, which can be a congenital thing. \n\nBut let's not jump to conclusions. Her kidney issues and early proteinuria could also point to something like nephronophthisis, which can have eye problems too. Although, I'm not sure if it matches the optic disc findings. \n\nOh, and she's on tacrolimus, which can have some ocular side effects. Could that be causing some of her symptoms? Maybe, but it doesn't explain the congenital-looking optic disc changes. \n\nLet's think about other possibilities. Could it be a pituitary adenoma? That can cause visual field defects, but it doesn't explain the optic disc appearance. \n\nWhat about familial conditions? She's had kidney problems since young, so maybe something genetic like Senior-Løken syndrome, which affects the kidneys and eyes. But again, the optic disc coloboma doesn't quite fit. \n\nHmm, maybe we're looking at a combination of conditions. The optic disc anomaly could be congenital, while the visual field defect is something acquired, like from a previous episode of optic neuropathy. \n\nLet's not forget about the possibility of a congenital condition like morning glory disc anomaly. It can cause optic disc coloboma-like appearances and is sometimes associated with other systemic issues. \n\nOkay, so putting it all together, the most likely explanation is a congenital optic disc anomaly, like optic disc coloboma or morning glory disc anomaly, combined with previous nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy causing the visual field defect. That seems to fit her symptoms and history best.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the visual changes and optic disc anomalies in the patient's left eye:\n\n1. **Alport Syndrome** - Given the early onset of proteinuria and the family history of kidney issues, Alport syndrome is a strong consideration. It can affect the kidneys and eyes, causing anterior lenticonus and dot-and-fleck retinopathy, but not typically optic disc coloboma.\n\n2. **Optic Disc Coloboma** - The central excavation of the optic discs, particularly more pronounced in the left eye, suggests a congenital anomaly like optic disc coloboma.\n\n3. **Morning Glory Disc Anomaly** - This congenital condition can present with a similar optic disc appearance and may be associated with other systemic issues, including renal abnormalities.\n\n4. **Nephronophthisis** - This genetic disorder can lead to kidney problems and has ocular manifestations, but it doesn't typically cause optic disc coloboma.\n\n5. **Senior-Løken Syndrome** - A genetic condition that affects the kidneys and eyes, but the optic disc findings don't align perfectly with this syndrome.\n\n6. **Pituitary Adenoma** - Could cause visual field defects, but not the congenital optic disc anomalies observed.\n\n7. **Nonarteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION)** - Already diagnosed in the patient, contributing to the visual field defect, but not the optic disc appearance.\n\n8. **Tacrolimus Toxicity** - While tacrolimus has ocular side effects, it's unlikely to cause the congenital changes seen in the optic discs.\n\n9. **Familial Dysautonomia (Riley-Day Syndrome)** - A neurocutaneous disorder that can affect the eyes, but it doesn't match the specific optic disc findings.\n\n10. **Renal-Coloboma Syndrome** - A condition that could link the kidney and eye findings, but it's rare and the specific features aren't a perfect match.\n\nReranking these based on the patient's history and examination findings, the top differentials are:\n\n1. **Morning Glory Disc Anomaly** - Best explains the optic disc appearance and potential systemic associations.\n2. **Optic Disc Coloboma** - Accounts for the congenital optic disc anomalies.\n3. **Alport Syndrome** - Considers the kidney issues and potential ocular manifestations.\n4. **NAION** - Contributes to the visual field defect.\n5. **Renal-Coloboma Syndrome** - A possible link between kidney and eye anomalies, though less common.\n\nThese diagnoses collectively address the patient's complex medical history and the specific findings on eye examination.", "topic": "['Chronic Kidney Disease', 'Surgery', 'Transplantation', 'Renal Replacement', 'Nephrology']"}

No triggers, such as local infection, insect bite, or trauma, occurred before the appearance of the lesions. She denied fever, weight loss, or fatigue. Physical examination showed multiple firm, nonscaly, purple erythematous patches and plaques with irregular borders on her left axilla, medial upper arm, and lateral thoracic region (Figure, A). No extracutaneous involvement was observed. A skin biopsy specimen was obtained from the left side of her chest for histopathological examination (Figure, B and C). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Microvenular hemangioma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a young woman in her late 20s with these strange skin patches. They're slowly growing, and they're a mix of red and purple. They're not scaling, which is interesting, and they're a bit firm to the touch. Plus, they're only on one side of her body, from her left arm to her chest. That's kind of peculiar, isn't it? And she says they're slightly painful now and then. No fever or weight loss, so that's good. \n\nFirst off, I'm thinking about what could cause these kinds of skin changes. Lichen planus comes to mind. It's known for these violaceous, pruritic lesions. But wait, lichen planus usually itches, and she didn't mention itching. Plus, it's often more widespread, not just in one area. So, maybe not lichen planus. \n\nNext, I'm considering lupus erythematosus. It can cause red, inflamed patches, but those are usually more like rashes and often come with other symptoms like photosensitivity. She didn't mention being sensitive to the sun, and there's no systemic involvement, so lupus seems unlikely. \n\nNow, sarcoidosis is another possibility. It can cause skin plaques, but they're usually more brownish and can be widespread. Plus, there's often other organ involvement, which she doesn't have. So, I'm not leaning towards sarcoidosis. \n\nWhat about dermatofibromas? They're firm, like what she's describing, but they're usually solitary, not multiple like her lesions. And they don't typically spread out like this. So, that's probably not it. \n\nNow, I'm thinking about lymphoma, specifically cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. It can present with patches and plaques, and it can be slow-growing. The fact that her lesions are persistent and haven't gone away makes me think of this. Plus, the histopathology could show something here. \n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. I should also think about infections like tuberculosis or leprosy. They can cause persistent skin lesions, but they often come with other symptoms, and she seems otherwise healthy. Plus, the lesions don't have the typical features of those infections. \n\nI should also consider benign conditions like lichen simplex chronicus, but that's usually due to chronic scratching, and she didn't mention itching. \n\nNow, what about granuloma annulare? It can cause skin plaques, but they're usually more annular and often on the hands or feet, not the trunk. So, that's probably not it. \n\nOh, and there's necrobiosis lipoidica. It causes yellowish plaques, usually on the shins, and is associated with diabetes. She's not diabetic, and the lesions don't match, so that's out. \n\nFinally, let's think about erythema chronicum migrans, the skin manifestation of Lyme disease. It can cause expanding red patches, but they're usually more annular and she didn't mention any tick bites or systemic symptoms. So, that's unlikely. \n\nAfter going through all these possibilities, I'm really leaning towards cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, specifically mycosis fungoides. The persistent, slowly growing nature of the lesions, their appearance, and the fact that they're unilateral all point in that direction. Plus, the histopathology could confirm this. So, that's my top suspect.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnoses for the described skin condition, in order of consideration, are as follows:\n\n1. **Lichen Planus** - Known for violaceous, pruritic lesions, but typically more widespread and associated with itching.\n2. **Lupus Erythematosus** - Causes red, inflamed patches, often with photosensitivity and systemic involvement.\n3. **Sarcoidosis** - Presents with skin plaques, often brownish, and typically involves other organs.\n4. **Dermatofibromas** - Firm, solitary lesions, not typically multiple or spreading.\n5. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides)** - Slow-growing patches and plaques, can be persistent and unilateral.\n6. **Tuberculosis or Leprosy** - Persistent lesions, but usually with other symptoms and characteristic features.\n7. **Lichen Simplex Chronicus** - Due to chronic scratching, usually with itching.\n8. **Granuloma Annulare** - Annular plaques, typically on hands or feet, not the trunk.\n9. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica** - Yellowish plaques, usually on shins, associated with diabetes.\n10. **Erythema Chronicum Migrans (Lyme Disease)** - Expanding annular patches, usually with tick bite history or systemic symptoms.\n\nAfter considering all possibilities, **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides)** is the most likely diagnosis given the persistent, slowly growing, unilateral nature of the lesions and their appearance.

Her medical history included esophageal atresia, small bowel obstruction, mild cognitive impairment, low tone, and increased reflexes. Prenatal history was complicated by insulin-controlled gestational diabetes and polyhydramnios. Her ocular history was notable for eye movement abnormalities since birth. She had no family history of ocular disease. On examination, her visual acuity was 20/150 OU and did not improve with correction (right eye, −1.50 [2.00] × 180; left eye, −1.00 [1.50] × 180). Pupillary responses were normal. Alternating vertical and torsional nystagmus was noted (Figure 1). Specifically, 1 eye was noted to rise and intort while the other would fall and extort, followed by reversal of the vertical and torsional components in the opposite eye (Video). The optic nerve and foveal reflexes were normal in both eyes. Flash visual evoked potential (VEP) demonstrated strong ipsilateral activity of the occipital lobe. Results of a previously obtained brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan were reported as normal. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Achiasma with seesaw nystagmus", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We have a 5-year-old girl with nystagmus, and it's been there since birth. That's a big clue. Nystagmus present from birth usually points to a congenital issue. So, what could be causing this? Hmm, congenital nystagmus often links to sensory problems, like issues with the eyes or the visual pathway to the brain. Let's keep that in mind.\n\nNow, her visual acuity is pretty low, 20/150 in both eyes, and it doesn't get better with glasses. That's interesting. This suggests the problem might be with how her eyes or visual system is wired, rather than something that can be fixed with lenses. So, we're probably looking at something more complex than just a refractive error.\n\nOh, and there's that alternating vertical and torsional nystagmus. That's a specific type, often seen in conditions like congenital motor nystagmus. But wait, there's more to consider. Her medical history is quite telling. She has esophageal atresia, cognitive impairments, and other neurological signs. These could be connected to a genetic syndrome. Hmm, could this be part of a broader neurodevelopmental disorder?\n\nLet's think about the possible conditions. Albinism comes to mind first. It can cause nystagmus and vision problems, and sometimes it's part of a syndrome with other systemic features. But, we didn't hear anything about skin or hair changes, which are typical in albinism. So, maybe that's not it.\n\nWhat about achromatopsia? It causes photophobia and nystagmus, but usually, there are other symptoms like sensitivity to light, and we didn't hear about that. So, let's put that aside for now.\n\nCongenital motor nystagmus is still on the table. It's characterized by nystagmus present from birth, just like in this case. But, it doesn't usually come with such a complex medical history. Hmm, maybe there's more to this.\n\nOh, and the VEP results show strong ipsilateral activity. That's unusual. It suggests a possible cross-wiring or abnormality in the visual pathways. This could point to something like crossed optic wires, which is seen in conditions like achiasma.\n\nSo, let's think about achiasma. It's a condition where the optic nerves don't cross over like they normally do. This could explain the nystagmus and the VEP findings. And, it can be associated with other neurodevelopmental issues, which fits her history.\n\nBut wait, there's also the possibility of a more generalized neurodevelopmental disorder. Her cognitive impairments and other symptoms could suggest something broader, like a genetic syndrome that affects multiple systems. Hmm, that's worth considering.\n\nLet's not forget about structural brain abnormalities. Even though her MRI was reported normal, maybe there's something subtle that was missed. Some brain malformations can cause nystagmus and other neurological symptoms.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Based on everything, I think achiasma is a strong contender. It explains the nystagmus, the VEP findings, and could be linked to her other symptoms. But, we should also keep an open mind about other possibilities, like a genetic syndrome or a subtle brain malformation that wasn't picked up on the MRI.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 5-year-old girl with nystagmus:\n\n1. **Albinism** - This condition can cause nystagmus and vision problems, and it's sometimes part of a syndrome with other systemic features.\n2. **Achromatopsia** - Although it causes photophobia and nystagmus, the absence of light sensitivity symptoms makes it less likely.\n3. **Congenital Motor Nystagmus** - Characterized by nystagmus present from birth, but it typically doesn't involve a complex medical history like this case.\n4. **Achiasma** - This condition involves abnormal optic nerve pathways and could explain the nystagmus and VEP findings, as well as other neurodevelopmental issues.\n5. **Genetic Syndrome** - Considering her cognitive impairments and other symptoms, a genetic syndrome affecting multiple systems is a possibility.\n6. **Structural Brain Abnormality** - Despite a normal MRI, a subtle brain malformation could be contributing to her symptoms.\n7. **Leber Congenital Amaurosis** - A condition that causes severe visual impairment and nystagmus, often associated with developmental delays.\n8. **Joubert Syndrome** - Characterized by nystagmus, developmental delays, and sometimes structural brain abnormalities.\n9. **Congenital Stationary Night Blindness** - Could cause nystagmus and vision problems, although night blindness wasn't mentioned.\n10. **Optic Nerve Hypoplasia** - Can cause nystagmus and vision loss, and may be associated with other neurological symptoms.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Achiasma** emerges as a strong candidate because it explains the nystagmus, the unusual VEP findings, and could be linked to her other neurodevelopmental symptoms. However, it's important to remain open to other possibilities, such as a genetic syndrome or a subtle brain malformation. Further evaluation and genetic testing may be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis.", "topic": "['Neuro-ophthalmology', 'Pediatrics', 'Ophthalmology', 'Neurology']"}

Her latest chemotherapy was 3 weeks before presentation, and a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) was removed 2 weeks ago. A complete blood cell count was ordered, revealing anemia, neutropenia, lymphocytopenia, and monocytopenia in the setting of recent chemotherapy. Blood cultures were drawn, and results were pending at the time of presentation. Her ophthalmic examination showed visual acuity of 20/800 OD and 20/400 OS, decreased from her baseline of 20/200 OU. Intraocular pressures were 37 mm Hg OD and 31 mm Hg OS. Slitlamp examination revealed chemosis, conjunctival hyperemia, and microcystic corneal edema bilaterally. There were more than 20 cells per high-power field of 1 mm × 1 mm beam, with fibrin bilaterally and 2.5-mm hypopyon in the right eye and 2.7-mm hypopyon in the left eye (Figure 1). Posterior segment examination was limited because of corneal edema and anterior inflammation, but there were no vitreous opacities on B-scan ultrasonography. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Bilateral anterior uveitis with pseudohypopyon in the setting of AML infiltration", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 28-year-old woman who's come in with blurry vision, redness, and discharge in both eyes. She's also got photophobia and pain, and she's been feeling run down with some rhinorrhea. That's a lot going on. \n\nFirst off, the blurry vision and eye redness make me think of conjunctivitis. It's pretty common and can be caused by a virus or bacteria. But wait, there's more to consider. \n\nShe's got a history of Leber congenital amaurosis, and she had that gene therapy, Luxturna, 8 years ago. That's interesting, but I'm not sure it's directly related to what's happening now. \n\nOh, and she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia 6 months ago. That's a big deal. She's been through chemotherapy, and her last round was just three weeks ago. That could definitely weaken her immune system. \n\nHmm, she's also had a PICC line removed two weeks ago. That could be a source of infection. I should keep that in mind. \n\nNow, let's look at her eye exam. Her vision has dropped significantly, and she's got high intraocular pressure. That's not good. The slit-lamp exam shows chemosis, conjunctival hyperemia, and corneal edema. Plus, there are a lot of cells and fibrin in the anterior chamber, and she's got a hypopyon in both eyes. That's a big red flag for uveitis or maybe even endophthalmitis. \n\nGiven her neutropenic state from the chemo, I'm really worried about an infection. Bacterial or fungal endophthalmitis could be serious. \n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. I should consider other possibilities too. Her symptoms could also fit with viral keratitis or even autoimmune uveitis. \n\nOkay, so what about CMV retinitis? It's possible, especially since she's immunocompromised. But usually, that affects the retina, and we didn't see any retinal issues on the B-scan. \n\nI should also think about autoimmune causes like ankylosing spondylitis or reactive arthritis. They can cause uveitis, but there's no mention of systemic symptoms like joint pain. \n\nAnd what about juvenile idiopathic arthritis? It can cause uveitis too, but she's a bit older for that, and there's no history of arthritis. \n\nOh, and there's still the possibility of a drug reaction. She's had chemotherapy, and some drugs can cause ocular side effects. \n\nIn the end, I think bacterial endophthalmitis is the most likely cause, given her recent PICC line and neutropenic state. But I should keep viral keratitis and autoimmune uveitis on the list too, just in case. \n\nSo, here's my final list: bacterial endophthalmitis, viral keratitis, autoimmune uveitis, CMV retinitis, drug-induced uveitis, fungal endophthalmitis, acute angle-closure glaucoma, lens-induced glaucoma, juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis, and ankylosing spondylitis-associated uveitis. That covers all the bases.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, considering her symptoms, medical history, and test results:\n\n1. **Bacterial Endophthalmitis** - Given her recent chemotherapy, neutropenic state, and the removal of a PICC line, this is a highly plausible cause of her symptoms.\n\n2. **Viral Keratitis** - Her immunocompromised state increases the risk of viral infections, which can cause keratitis and secondary uveitis.\n\n3. **Autoimmune Uveitis** - Conditions like ankylosing spondylitis or reactive arthritis can cause uveitis, although there are no systemic symptoms mentioned.\n\n4. **CMV Retinitis** - While she is immunocompromised, CMV retinitis typically affects the retina, which was not observed in the B-scan.\n\n5. **Drug-induced Uveitis** - A reaction to her chemotherapy drugs could potentially cause uveitis.\n\n6. **Fungal Endophthalmitis** - Another possibility in an immunocompromised patient, especially with her recent medical history.\n\n7. **Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma** - Although the high intraocular pressure could suggest this, the presence of hypopyon is more indicative of infection or inflammation.\n\n8. **Lens-induced Glaucoma** - This could cause a rise in intraocular pressure, but the accompanying hypopyon is not typical.\n\n9. **Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis-associated Uveitis** - While possible, she is older than the typical age of presentation, and there's no history of arthritis.\n\n10. **Ankylosing Spondylitis-associated Uveitis** - This is a possibility, but there are no systemic symptoms like back pain mentioned.\n\nThese diagnoses are ranked based on the likelihood and relevance to her clinical presentation, with bacterial endophthalmitis being the most probable due to her immunocompromised state and recent invasive procedures.", "topic": "['Hematology', 'Oncology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Leukemias']"}

Skin examination revealed purpuric macules and small thumbprint-like patches on the upper abdomen and central chest (Figure 1). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Disseminated strongyloidiasis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 95-year-old woman who's come to the emergency department with some pretty concerning symptoms. She's been dealing with abdominal pain for the past day, diarrhea for a couple of weeks, and she's also been feeling bloated and not very hungry for the past three months. That's quite a mix of symptoms. \n\nNow, she's from rural Japan and doesn't drink alcohol, which is interesting. She's also been on prednisolone for bullous pemphigoid, and that's something to keep in mind because steroids can affect the body in many ways. \n\nShe's had some shortness of breath when exerting herself recently, but no fever or respiratory symptoms like a cough or wheeze. That's good to know. And she hasn't had any nausea, vomiting, or blood in her stool, which helps narrow things down a bit. \n\nIn the ER, her vitals show a slight fever at 99.9 °F, her heart rate is up at 125 beats per minute, and her oxygen levels are okay at 95%. Her lungs are clear, which is a relief, but her abdomen is tender all over without any rebound tenderness. \n\nOh, and there are these purpuric macules and small, thumbprint-like patches on her skin. That's a big clue. Those skin findings are really pointing towards some kind of vascular issue, maybe vasculitis. \n\nSo, let's start thinking about what could be going on here. With the abdominal pain, diarrhea, and skin findings, I'm immediately thinking about some kind of gastrointestinal issue that's also affecting the skin. \n\nFirst, I'm considering Henoch-Schönlein purpura. It's a type of vasculitis that can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and that characteristic rash. But wait, she's 95, and this condition is more common in kids. Hmm, maybe not the best fit. \n\nNext, I'm thinking about IgA vasculitis. It's similar to Henoch-Schönlein purpura and could explain the rash and abdominal symptoms. But again, it's usually seen in younger people. \n\nThen there's polyarteritis nodosa. It's a type of vasculitis that can affect the skin and gastrointestinal tract, and it's more likely in adults. This could be a strong contender. \n\nI should also consider systemic lupus erythematosus. It's a systemic autoimmune disease that can cause a wide range of symptoms, including rashes and abdominal issues. But it's a bit of a stretch given her age and the specific symptoms. \n\nOh, and there's antiphospholipid syndrome. It can cause clotting issues and skin manifestations, but it doesn't quite fit with the gastrointestinal symptoms here. \n\nNow, let's not forget about the possibility of an infection. Could this be something like CMV colitis? It can cause abdominal pain and diarrhea, especially in someone who's on immunosuppressive therapy like prednisolone. \n\nAnd what about ischemic colitis? It could explain the abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, especially in an elderly patient. The skin findings are a bit unusual for this, but it's worth considering. \n\nI should also think about medication effects. Prednisolone can increase the risk of infections and gastrointestinal issues, so maybe that's playing a role here. \n\nThen there's the possibility of a paraneoplastic syndrome. In someone her age, we have to think about the possibility of an underlying malignancy causing these symptoms. \n\nFinally, let's consider thromboangiitis obliterans. It's a bit of a long shot, but it could explain the skin findings and possibly the gastrointestinal symptoms if there's vascular involvement. \n\nSo, after going through all of this, I think the top differential diagnosis is polyarteritis nodosa. It fits well with the skin and gastrointestinal symptoms, and it's more common in adults. \n\nBut I'm also keeping CMV colitis and ischemic colitis on the list because they could explain the abdominal symptoms, especially given her age and medication use. \n\nAnd I won't completely rule out paraneoplastic syndrome or thromboangiitis obliterans, as they could also fit the picture. \n\nIt's a complex case, but I think this is a reasonable approach.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with a focus on the key symptoms and findings:\n\n1. **Polyarteritis Nodosa**: This type of vasculitis can affect the skin and gastrointestinal tract, aligning with the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and purpuric macules.\n\n2. **CMV Colitis**: Given the patient's use of prednisolone, an immunosuppressant, CMV colitis is a plausible cause of the abdominal pain and diarrhea.\n\n3. **Ischemic Colitis**: This condition could explain the abdominal pain and is a consideration in elderly patients, although the skin findings are atypical.\n\n4. **Henoch-Schönlein Purpura**: While more common in children, this type of vasculitis could present with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and a characteristic rash.\n\n5. **IgA Vasculitis**: Similar to Henoch-Schönlein purpura, it involves IgA deposition and could explain the symptoms, though it's less common in adults.\n\n6. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus**: A systemic autoimmune disease that can cause a wide range of symptoms, including rashes and abdominal issues, though it's a bit of a stretch given the patient's age and specific symptoms.\n\n7. **Antiphospholipid Syndrome**: This condition can cause clotting issues and skin manifestations, but it doesn't align perfectly with the gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\n8. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**: In an elderly patient, it's important to consider the possibility of an underlying malignancy causing these symptoms.\n\n9. **Thromboangiitis Obliterans**: This condition could explain the skin findings and possibly the gastrointestinal symptoms if there's vascular involvement, though it's less common.\n\n10. **Medication-Induced Complications**: The long-term use of prednisolone could contribute to gastrointestinal issues or increase the risk of infections.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are **Polyarteritis Nodosa**, **CMV Colitis**, and **Ischemic Colitis**, as they best explain the combination of skin and gastrointestinal symptoms in the context of the patient's age and medication use. These conditions should be further investigated through appropriate diagnostic tests.", "topic": "['Global Health', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Dermatology', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology']"}

It remained stable in size and was asymptomatic. She denied sore throat, dysphagia, and dyspnea. She was otherwise healthy with no history of recurrent pharyngitis. On examination, her vital signs were within normal limits. She was comfortable with no noted stridor and tolerated her oral secretions. Her oropharyngeal examination was notable for size 2+ palatine tonsils without exudate and a white mass on the posterior tonsillar pillar. She did not tolerate palpation of the lesion. There was no palpable cervical adenopathy, and her lungs were clear to auscultation. No laboratory work or imaging were performed. The patient was taken to the operating room for an excisional biopsy. There, a more thorough gross examination of the lesion was notable for a pedunculated, white rubbery mass arising from the left posterior tonsillar pillar with a narrow mucosal stalk (Figure, A). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Hairy pharyngeal polyp", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 7-year-old girl with a lesion on her left pharyngeal area. It's been there for 18 months, and it hasn't changed or caused any trouble. That's interesting because if it was something bad, you'd expect it to grow or cause symptoms, right?\n\nNow, what could this be? The first thing that comes to mind is a tonsillar cyst. They're not uncommon in kids, and they can just hang out there without doing much. But let's not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nHmm, what else could it be? Lymphatic malformations are another possibility. They're usually soft and can be found in the tonsillar area, but they tend to be more squishy than hard. This one's described as a white, rubbery mass, so maybe not that.\n\nOh, and there's the possibility of a benign tumor like a fibroma. Those can definitely be firm and rubbery, kind of like what's described here. Plus, they have a stalk, which fits the pedunculated description.\n\nLet's not forget about papillomas. They're caused by HPV and can be found in the oropharynx. They might appear as a white mass, and the stalked nature of this lesion could match that.\n\nBut wait, what about something like a hemangioma? They're vascular lesions and can appear red or purple, though, so maybe not this time since it's described as white.\n\nCould it be a dermoid cyst? They're usually found on the midline, but maybe it's possible for them to be off to the side. They can be firm, but the location seems a bit off.\n\nLet's think about oncocytomas. They're not super common in kids, but they can appear as a mass on the tonsillar pillar. They might not be the first thing that comes to mind, but they fit some of the characteristics.\n\nWhat about minor salivary gland tumors? They can show up in the oral cavity, but they're rare in children. Still, they could present as a firm mass, so let's keep them in mind.\n\nNow, could this be something like a rhabdomyoma? They're rare, but they can occur in the head and neck area. They might match the description of a rubbery mass.\n\nLastly, let's consider a neurofibroma. They can be firm and have a stalk, which fits the description. They're not the most common choice, but they're worth considering.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top possibilities are a fibroma, a papilloma, and maybe an oncocytoma. These seem to fit the description and the age of the patient best. But we should keep an open mind until we get more information from the biopsy.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the lesion on the left pharyngeal area of the 7-year-old girl:\n\n1. **Tonsillar Cyst** - A common benign cyst in children that can appear as a stable, asymptomatic mass.\n2. **Fibroma** - A benign tumor that can present as a firm, rubbery mass with a stalk, fitting the description well.\n3. **Papilloma** - Caused by HPV, these can appear as white masses in the oropharynx and may have a stalk.\n4. **Lymphatic Malformation** - Although typically softer, these can present in the tonsillar area and be stable over time.\n5. **Hemangioma** - Usually vascular and red or purple, but could potentially appear white in some cases.\n6. **Dermoid Cyst** - Typically midline, but could be considered due to the firm nature of the mass.\n7. **Oncocytoma** - Less common in children, but can appear as a mass on the tonsillar pillar.\n8. **Minor Salivary Gland Tumor** - Rare in children, but could present as a firm mass in the oral cavity.\n9. **Rhabdomyoma** - A rare tumor that could match the description of a rubbery mass in the head and neck area.\n10. **Neurofibroma** - Can be firm, have a stalk, and although less common, should be considered.\n\nAfter considering all the possibilities and the details provided, the top differential diagnoses are **Fibroma**, **Papilloma**, and **Oncocytoma**, as they best fit the description and the patient's age.

A shave skin biopsy was performed and submitted for histopathologic analysis (Figure, B-D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Malignant myopericytoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 74-year-old man with a history of squamous cell carcinomas. He's got this new scalp lesion that's been growing for six months. It's tender and bright pink with some visible vessels on top. That's interesting.\n\nFirst, I'm thinking about basal cell carcinoma. It's pretty common, especially in older adults, and it can look like a pink, dome-shaped papule with vessels. That seems to fit.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. What about squamous cell carcinoma? He's had them before, so it's definitely possible. But usually, they're more scaly or ulcerated, right? This one doesn't have those features, so maybe it's less likely.\n\nNow, melanoma crosses my mind. It can be pigmented, but this lesion isn't. Still, amelanotic melanoma can be tricky and appear without pigment. I should keep it in mind.\n\nHow about a pyogenic granuloma? They're often red and can have a dome shape. They tend to bleed easily, but this one isn't bleeding, so maybe not.\n\nI should also think about benign things like a cherry angioma. They're common in older people and are bright red, but they're usually not tender. This one is tender, so that's a point against it.\n\nMerkel cell carcinoma is another possibility. It's a bit rare, but it can be firm and red. It's aggressive, so I shouldn't ignore it.\n\nOh, and there's angiosarcoma. It's a malignant tumor that can appear as a red or purple lesion. It's rare, but it's serious, so I should consider it.\n\nNow, let's think about the histopathology. The biopsy will really help clarify things. If it shows nests of basaloid cells, that could point to basal cell carcinoma or Merkel cell carcinoma. If there are atypical melanocytes, then melanoma might be the culprit.\n\nAfter looking at all the possibilities, I'm leaning towards basal cell carcinoma. It fits the description and is common in this age group. But I'm also keeping Merkel cell carcinoma in mind because it's serious and can match the clinical presentation.\n\nIn the end, after considering everything, I think basal cell carcinoma is the most likely diagnosis. But I'm going to double-check the histopathology to be sure.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the scalp lesion, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** - Common in older adults, often presents as a bright pink, dome-shaped papule with visible vessels.\n2. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - Given the patient's history, this is a strong consideration, though it typically appears more scaly or ulcerated.\n3. **Amelanotic Melanoma** - Although the lesion lacks pigmentation, amelanotic melanoma can present without typical melanoma coloration.\n4. **Pyogenic Granuloma** - Often red and dome-shaped, but typically bleeds easily, which isn't noted here.\n5. **Cherry Angioma** - Common in older adults, bright red, but usually not tender.\n6. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma** - A rarer, aggressive option that can present as a firm, red lesion.\n7. **Angiosarcoma** - A serious, though rare, possibility that can appear as a red or purple lesion.\n8. **Seborrheic Keratosis** - A benign lesion that can sometimes appear similar, though usually with a waxy or wart-like surface.\n9. **Hemangioma** - A benign vascular tumor that could match the description of a red, dome-shaped lesion.\n10. **Keratoacanthoma** - A rapidly growing lesion that can resemble squamous cell carcinoma but often has a central crater.\n\nAfter considering all the possibilities and the patient's history, **Basal Cell Carcinoma** emerges as the most likely diagnosis, given its commonality in this age group and the lesion's appearance.

On admission, vital signs showed blood pressure as 98/66 mm Hg while receiving dobutamine and norepinephrine from the referral hospital, a regular heart rate of 90 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, peripheral oxygen saturation 96% nasal oxygen at 3 L per minute, and a temperature of 36.7° C. Echocardiography showed reduced left ventricle systolic function (estimated ejection fraction, 34%) and hypokinesia of the anteroseptal, anterior, anterolateral, and septal walls. Lung ultrasound demonstrated multiple B-lines in both lung fields. Diagnostic coronary angiography revealed a total occlusion in the left main coronary artery. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was successful in opening the osteal left main and drug-eluting stents were placed in the left main and left anterior descending arteries. Following PCI, the patient had episodes of supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Electrical cardioversion was performed and a loading dose of amiodarone was administered. Chest radiography during the loading dose of amiodarone showed infiltrates in both lung fields (Figure 1A). While in the intensive cardiovascular care unit, maintenance doses of amiodarone were continued because of episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, and torsaded de pointes. On the third day of hospitalization, despite adequate diuresis, the chest radiography showed persistent pulmonary edema. Chest computed tomography showed a reticular pattern predominantly in the perihilar area with consolidation and diffuse ground-glass opacity in both lung fields (Figure 1B). In addition, hemodynamic evaluation and lung ultrasound showed no congestion and laboratory markers, including a procalcitonin level of 0.01 ng/mL, and ruled out an infectious etiology. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Acute amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a man in his late 50s who was just released from the hospital after a pretty serious heart attack. He's got cardiogenic shock, which is a big deal, and he's on some strong meds like dobutamine and norepinephrine to keep his blood pressure up. His heart's not pumping well, with an ejection fraction of just 34%, and there's some damage to the heart muscle itself. Now, he's also got these B-lines on his lung ultrasound, which usually mean fluid buildup in the lungs. That's concerning.\n\nOkay, so first things first, with his heart condition and the fluid in his lungs, my initial thought is pulmonary edema. It's a common issue when the heart isn't pumping well, leading to fluid backing up into the lungs. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet.\n\nNext, I notice he's on amiodarone, which is great for his heart rhythm issues but can be tricky. Amiodarone has a reputation for causing lung problems, like pneumonitis or even pulmonary fibrosis. So, amiodarone-induced lung injury is definitely something to consider, especially with those infiltrates showing up on his chest X-ray.\n\nBut wait, there's more. The chest CT shows a reticular pattern and ground-glass opacities. Those findings could point towards ARDS, which is a serious condition often triggered by something like sepsis or a major injury. But, we've ruled out infection with that low procalcitonin level, so ARDS from an infectious cause seems unlikely.\n\nHmm, what about cardiogenic pulmonary edema again? It's still on the table because of his heart's reduced function. The fact that he's on diuretics and still has lung issues makes me think it's not just a simple fluid overload situation, though.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about the possibility of a bleeding disorder. With all the anticoagulation from the PCI, could there be a pulmonary hemorrhage? It's a long shot, but it would explain some of the CT findings.\n\nNow, considering his recent heart procedure, could this be a case of post-cardiac injury syndrome? That's when the body reacts to heart damage with inflammation that might affect the lungs. It's rare, but it fits some of the puzzle pieces.\n\nAlso, I should think about other drug reactions. Amiodarone is the main suspect, but what about the other meds he's on? Norepinephrine or dobutamine could have some unexpected effects, although they're not as notorious for lung issues.\n\nAnd then there's the idea of a pulmonary embolism. It's always a consideration, especially with someone who's been hospitalized and immobile. But, we don't have any direct evidence pointing to a clot.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? After weighing everything, I think amiodarone-induced lung injury is the most likely culprit. It matches the timing and the CT findings, and it's a known risk of the drug. But, I'm keeping cardiogenic pulmonary edema and post-cardiac injury syndrome on the radar, just in case.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with a focus on the pulmonary issues:\n\n1. **Pulmonary Edema** - Given the patient's cardiogenic shock and reduced ejection fraction, fluid buildup in the lungs is a strong possibility.\n\n2. **Amiodarone-Induced Lung Injury** - The timing of the infiltrates and CT findings aligns with a known side effect of amiodarone, making this a likely cause.\n\n3. **Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)** - Although infection is unlikely, other non-infectious triggers could have led to ARDS.\n\n4. **Post-Cardiac Injury Syndrome** - This inflammatory response after cardiac damage could manifest in the lungs.\n\n5. **Pulmonary Hemorrhage** - Anticoagulation therapy post-PCI raises the possibility of bleeding into the lungs.\n\n6. **Cardiogenic Shock with Septic Mimicry** - Severe heart failure can mimic sepsis, leading to similar lung findings.\n\n7. **Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia** - Although procalcitonin is low, atypical infections could still be considered.\n\n8. **Drug-Induced Lung Injury (other medications)** - While less likely, other medications like norepinephrine or dobutamine could contribute.\n\n9. **Pulmonary Embolism** - Immobility and recent hospitalization increase the risk, but there's no direct evidence.\n\n10. **Myocardial Contusion** - Blunt chest trauma could cause cardiac injury leading to pulmonary congestion.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Amiodarone-Induced Lung Injury**\n2. **Pulmonary Edema**\n3. **Post-Cardiac Injury Syndrome**\n4. **ARDS**\n5. **Pulmonary Hemorrhage**\n\nThese conditions best explain the combination of the patient's cardiac history, treatment, and pulmonary findings.", "topic": "['Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology', 'Pulmonary Medicine', 'Adverse Drug Events', 'Rhythm Disorders', 'Ischemic Heart Disease']"}

The patient was taking systemic immunosuppression but recently stopped taking maribavir because of concerns about resistance and was transitioned to cidofovir and CMV immune globulin. On clinical examination, the visual acuity measured 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. Motility, visual fields, and anterior segment examination were normal. Dilated fundus examination revealed tortuous vasculature, multiple cotton wool spots along the arcades and periphery, and granular, hypopigmented retinal lesions without hemorrhage in the macula and temporal periphery in both eyes (Figure 1A). Optical coherence tomography showed localized areas of full-thickness retinitis (Figure 1B). CMV titers indicated viremia at 2.24 million IU/mL. Despite the patient’s documented UL97 and UL54 mutations, a series of 5 biweekly intravitreal injections of foscarnet and ganciclovir were performed given their vision-threatening lesions.

We've got a patient who's had a kidney transplant and has a history of CMV issues, including colitis and viremia. They're also dealing with some resistance to the usual meds, foscarnet and ganciclovir. Now, they're seeing floaters in both eyes. That's definitely something to pay attention to.\n\nWhen we look at their eyes, the visual acuity isn't too bad, but there are some troubling signs. There's tortuous vasculature and these cotton wool spots. Plus, there are these granular, hypopigmented lesions in the retina. Hmm, that sounds a lot like CMV retinitis, especially with their history.\n\nBut wait, they've already tried treating it with foscarnet and ganciclovir injections, and it didn't work. That's not surprising given the resistance issues. So, what else could be going on?\n\nLet's think about other possibilities. Could it be something like acute macular neuroretinopathy? That can cause similar lesions, but it doesn't quite fit with the whole picture, especially the patient's transplant and CMV history.\n\nWhat about fungal infections? They can cause retinal issues too, especially in someone who's immunocompromised. Candida or Aspergillus could be culprits, but we'd usually see more distinct signs, like those characteristic fungal lesions.\n\nBK virus retinitis is another one to consider. It's not as common, but it can happen in transplant patients. The lesions could match, but it's not as well-known as CMV in this context.\n\nThen there's PORN, or progressive outer retinal necrosis. It's caused by varicella-zoster virus and can lead to similar retinal problems. But usually, it progresses rapidly, and we don't have signs of that here.\n\nHmm, what about syphilis? It can cause a range of eye issues, including retinal lesions. But we don't have any other symptoms or history suggesting syphilis.\n\nLet's not forget about drug toxicity. Cidofovir, which the patient is on, can cause ocular toxicity. But the retinal findings don't quite match what we'd expect with cidofovir toxicity.\n\nOh, and there's also the possibility of mixed infections. In someone with such a complex medical history, having more than one infection at once isn't out of the question.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Given everything, CMV retinitis is still the most likely cause, despite the treatment issues. But we can't completely rule out the possibility of a mixed infection or something like BK virus retinitis. It's a complex case, and we need to keep an open mind.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, considering their complex medical history and treatment outcomes:\n\n1. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Retinitis** - Given the patient's history of CMV colitis and viremia, along with the characteristic retinal findings, CMV retinitis is the most likely diagnosis.\n\n2. **Fungal Endophthalmitis** - In immunocompromised patients, fungal infections like Candida or Aspergillus can cause retinal lesions, but distinct fungal characteristics are usually present.\n\n3. **BK Virus Retinitis** - This is a less common consideration but plausible in transplant patients with similar retinal findings.\n\n4. **Progressive Outer Retinal Necrosis (PORN)** - Caused by varicella-zoster virus, PORN leads to rapid retinal necrosis, which doesn't perfectly match the patient's presentation.\n\n5. **Syphilitic Retinitis** - Syphilis can cause various ocular manifestations, but there are no supporting symptoms or history in this case.\n\n6. **Cidofovir Toxicity** - While the patient is on cidofovir, the retinal findings don't align well with typical drug toxicity presentations.\n\n7. **Mixed Infection** - In a patient with a complex medical history, concurrent infections could be possible, complicating the clinical picture.\n\n8. **Acute Macular Neuroretinopathy** - This condition causes similar lesions but is less likely given the patient's CMV history and immunocompromised state.\n\n9. **Toxoplasmosis** - Although it can cause retinochoroiditis, it's less likely without specific lesion characteristics or a history suggesting exposure.\n\n10. **Cryptococcal Chorioretinitis** - Another opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients, but it would typically present with more distinct features.\n\nReranking these differentials based on all available information, CMV retinitis remains the most likely diagnosis, followed by the possibility of a mixed infection or BK virus retinitis.

He reported a tingling sensation in the affected area but no pruritus or pain. He had no history of leg trauma and no chemical or extreme temperature exposure. Medications included insulin lispro (sliding scale 3 times daily) and insulin glargine (20 units nightly). On physical examination, he was afebrile and had normal vital signs. His extremities were warm with palpable distal pulses. Hyperpigmented macules were present on the anterior lower legs below the knees, and tense bullae were present on the anterior aspect of the right lower extremity, dorsal foot surface, and toes (Figure). There was no surrounding erythema or edema, and findings on the remainder of the skin and mucocutaneous examination were unremarkable. Laboratory testing revealed a blood glucose level of 375 mg/dL (20.81 mmol/L) and hemoglobin A1c level of 9.8%. Results of a basic metabolic panel and complete blood cell count were within reference range except for mild anemia (hemoglobin level, 10.9 g/dL). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Bullosis diabeticorum", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 42-year-old guy with some pretty serious health issues like hypertension and diabetes. He's been dealing with diabetes since he was 25, so that's a long time. Now, he's come to the ER with these blisters on his right leg that just showed up out of nowhere in the last day or so. That's weird, right? He's feeling a bit of tingling but no pain or itching. That's interesting.\n\nOkay, so he hasn't hurt his leg, and he hasn't been exposed to anything extreme like chemicals or super hot or cold temperatures. That rules out some of the more obvious causes. He's on insulin, which makes sense with his diabetes, but could that be playing a role here?\n\nWhen I look at his physical exam, he's not running a fever, and his vital signs are normal. His legs are warm, and I can feel the pulses, so blood flow isn't the issue. But there are these dark spots and these tense blisters on his right leg and foot. No redness or swelling around them, which is kind of unusual for most infections or allergic reactions.\n\nHis blood sugar is pretty high at 375 mg/dL, and his hemoglobin A1c is 9.8%, so his diabetes isn't well controlled. That could be a big clue. The rest of his blood work is mostly fine, except he's a bit anemic.\n\nSo, what could cause these blisters? Diabetic blisters, also known as bullosis diabeticorum, come to mind. They happen in people with poorly controlled diabetes, and they're usually painless, which fits. But I should consider other possibilities too.\n\nCould it be a skin infection like cellulitis or erysipelas? Usually, those are red and swollen, and he's not showing those signs. What about a venous ulcer? Those typically happen over time and are more of a sore than a blister. And he doesn't have any history of trauma, so traumatic blisters are unlikely.\n\nMaybe it's something more systemic, like a vasculitis. That could cause skin changes, but I'd expect more widespread symptoms, and he seems pretty stable otherwise. Oh, and drug reactions can cause blisters, but he's only on insulin, and there's no mention of him starting anything new.\n\nI should also think about conditions like porphyria cutanea tarda, which can cause blisters, but those usually happen with sun exposure, and there's no mention of that here. And then there's pemphigus vulgaris, an autoimmune blistering disorder, but that typically involves painful, erosive blisters, and he's not complaining of pain.\n\nSo, when I put it all together, diabetic blisters seem like the most likely cause. His diabetes isn't well controlled, and these blisters are typical of what you'd see in that situation. It's not just the blisters themselves, but the fact that they're painless and he has those hyperpigmented spots, which are common in diabetic patients. Yeah, I'm pretty confident it's bullosis diabeticorum.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the blisters on this patient's right lower extremity is bullosis diabeticorum. This condition is associated with poorly controlled diabetes and is characterized by painless blisters, which aligns with the patient's symptoms and his high blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels. Here is a ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Bullosis Diabeticorum** - Painless blisters associated with poorly controlled diabetes.\n2. **Cellulitis** - Typically involves redness, swelling, and warmth, which are absent in this case.\n3. **Venous Ulcer** - Usually develops over time and presents as a sore rather than a blister.\n4. **Traumatic Blisters** - Unlikely due to the absence of any history of trauma.\n5. **Vasculitis** - Would likely involve more widespread symptoms and systemic involvement.\n6. **Drug Reaction** - Unlikely given the patient's stable medication regimen and lack of new medications.\n7. **Porphyria Cutanea Tarda** - Typically involves sun-exposed areas and other systemic symptoms.\n8. **Pemphigus Vulgaris** - Usually presents with painful, erosive blisters, which do not match this patient's presentation.\n9. **Erysipelas** - A type of skin infection that would present with redness and swelling.\n10. **Contact Dermatitis** - Would typically involve itching and a clear source of irritant or allergen.\n\nGiven the patient's poorly controlled diabetes and the characteristic presentation of the blisters, bullosis diabeticorum is the most likely diagnosis.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Diabetes', 'Diabetes and Endocrinology']"}

He had undergone laser retinopexy for retinal tears in his right eye and a scleral buckle and vitrectomy for a retinal detachment in his left eye 1 year earlier. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/40 OD and counting fingers OS. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 14 mm Hg in the right eye and 44 mm Hg in the left eye. Anterior segment examination of the right eye was unremarkable, while ophthalmoscopic examination showed vascular attenuation and treated retinal breaks. In the left eye, microcystic corneal edema and Descemet membrane folds limited examination, but no residual lenticular fragments or neovascularization of the iris or angle were seen. The patient was discharged taking timolol, dorzolamide, brimonidine, and prednisolone. Twelve days later, the cornea had cleared and IOP in the left eye improved to 32 mm Hg. Gonioscopy revealed 360° of anterior synechiae and complete angle closure, which was documented on ultrasound biomicroscopy (Figure 1). The patient started treatment with 500 mg of acetazolamide daily and referred to the glaucoma service for surgical evaluation. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Acute chest syndrome induced by acetazolamide in a patient with previously undiagnosed sickle cell disease.", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 61-year-old Black man who's having trouble seeing out of his left eye. It's been three months since his cataract surgery, and that's a bit concerning. He's got a history of hypertension and diabetes, which can definitely mess with the eyes. Plus, he's had some retinal issues in the past, like tears and a detachment. That's a lot to consider.\n\nFirst off, the high intraocular pressure in his left eye is a big red flag. It's at 44 mm Hg, which is way above normal. That could be causing his vision problems. I'm thinking glaucoma might be a possibility here. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet.\n\nThe corneal edema is another clue. It's microcystic, which usually points to something happening inside the eye, like elevated pressure or maybe even endothelial issues. Could it be related to the cataract surgery? That's definitely something to keep in mind.\n\nNow, the gonioscopy results show 360° of anterior synechiae. That's a big deal. It means the iris is stuck to the trabecular meshwork, which blocks fluid from draining and raises the pressure. This is looking more and more like angle-closure glaucoma.\n\nBut wait, there's more. The patient's history of retinal detachment and the fact that he had a vitrectomy could be relevant too. Sometimes, after these procedures, you can get complications like vitreous block or even ghost cell glaucoma. Those could also cause high pressure and vision issues.\n\nOkay, let's think about other possibilities. Could it be something like aqueous misdirection, where the fluid is going the wrong way in the eye? That can happen after surgery and cause pressure issues. Or maybe it's a suprachoroidal hemorrhage, which can also happen post-surgery. Those are both worth considering.\n\nAnd then there's the idea of endothelial decompensation. The corneal edema could be from damaged endothelial cells, which might have been weakened by the surgery. That would fit with the microcystic edema we're seeing.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? We've got a few strong contenders. Angle-closure glaucoma is definitely up there, given the synechiae and pressure issues. But we can't ignore the possibility of vitreous block or aqueous misdirection, especially with his surgical history. Endothelial decompensation is also a possibility, given the corneal findings.\n\nIn the end, I think we're looking at a combination of issues. The angle-closure glaucoma is likely the main culprit, but it's probably complicated by some of these other factors, like vitreous block or endothelial problems. It's a complex situation, and we'll need a comprehensive approach to treat it.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Angle-Closure Glaucoma** - Given the 360° of anterior synechiae and elevated intraocular pressure, this is a strong contender.\n\n2. **Vitreous Block** - The patient's history of vitrectomy and retinal detachment raises the possibility of vitreous block contributing to the elevated pressure.\n\n3. **Aqueous Misdirection** - This condition, where aqueous humor flows posteriorly, can occur post-surgery and cause elevated pressure.\n\n4. **Suprachoroidal Hemorrhage** - A possible complication following eye surgery, which can lead to increased intraocular pressure.\n\n5. **Endothelial Decompensation** - The microcystic corneal edema suggests endothelial dysfunction, possibly exacerbated by the cataract surgery.\n\n6. **Ghost Cell Glaucoma** - Could result from the previous retinal detachment and vitrectomy, leading to elevated pressure.\n\n7. **Cystoid Macular Edema** - Although not directly causing elevated IOP, it could contribute to vision loss post-surgery.\n\n8. **Retinal Detachment** - Although previously treated, any recurrence could affect vision and pressure dynamics.\n\n9. **Iridocorneal Endothelial Syndrome** - This could cause secondary angle-closure and corneal edema.\n\n10. **Lens Particle Glaucoma** - Although no lens fragments were seen, tiny particles could still cause inflammation and pressure elevation.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top three differential diagnoses, in order of likelihood, are:\n\n1. **Angle-Closure Glaucoma** - The presence of 360° anterior synechiae and elevated IOP makes this the most likely diagnosis.\n\n2. **Vitreous Block** - The history of vitreoretinal surgery suggests this as a plausible contributing factor.\n\n3. **Aqueous Misdirection** - Post-surgical changes could have led to this condition, exacerbating the elevated IOP.\n\nThese diagnoses are interconnected, and it's likely that the patient's condition is a complex interplay of these factors.

When she was 36 years old, she underwent a hysterectomy due to abnormal uterine bleeding and was taking estradiol to control postmenopausal vasomotor symptoms for the past 20 years. Bilateral diagnostic mammography revealed a high-density irregular mass in the left axilla with no nodules, architectural distortions, or microcalcifications in the breasts. Ultrasonography of the left breast showed a 4.6-cm lobulated mixed cystic and solid left axillary mass. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging showed an enhancing 5.2-cm left axillary mass with no breast lesions (Figure 1A). The biopsy examination indicated high-grade adenocarcinoma with papillary features (estrogen receptor– and progesterone receptor–positive, ERBB2 [formerly HER2]–negative, and a high Ki67 index). Positron emission tomography/computed tomography revealed only high uptake in the left axilla region. The patient was treated at an outside hospital with neoadjuvant dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, followed by weekly paclitaxel for 10 weeks. She then transferred her care to our center for surgical management. We requested the pathology slides for review at our laboratory and additional immunostaining was performed, which revealed high-grade adenocarcinoma with tumor cells positive for PAX8 (Figure 1B), p53, and WT1 and negative for GATA3. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "High-grade serous carcinoma of gynecological origin", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 76-year-old woman with a lump in her left axilla. That's not super common, so it's definitely something to pay attention to. She's been on estradiol for a long time, which could play a role here. Now, the imaging shows a mass in the axilla, but nothing in the breast itself. That's interesting. It's not behaving like a typical breast cancer.\n\nThe biopsy says it's a high-grade adenocarcinoma with papillary features. It's ER and PR positive, but HER2 negative. That sounds more like a breast cancer profile, but the location is throwing me off. Let's not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nNow, the PET scan only shows uptake in the axilla. No other areas are lighting up, so it's likely a localized issue. But what about the PAX8 positivity? That's a big hint. PAX8 is usually linked to Müllerian origin tumors, like ovarian or fallopian tube cancers. This could be a metastasis from one of those sites.\n\nBut wait, the tumor is also positive for p53 and WT1. Those markers can show up in serous borderline tumors of the ovary or peritoneum. This is getting more interesting. The GATA3 negativity is also important because it rules out a primary breast cancer. So, it's not coming from the breast.\n\nConsidering all of this, my first thought is a serous borderline tumor of the ovary or peritoneum that's metastasized to the axilla. That would explain the PAX8, p53, and WT1 positivity. But let's not stop here.\n\nI should think about other possibilities. Could it be a primary axillary mucinous carcinoma? Those can be ER positive sometimes. But the PAX8 and WT1 positivity is a strong argument against that.\n\nWhat about a metastatic adenocarcinoma from another site, like the gastrointestinal tract? That's possible, but the hormone receptor profile doesn't quite fit. It's more in line with a gynecological origin.\n\nSo, after going through all of this, I'm leaning towards a metastatic serous borderline tumor from the ovary or peritoneum. The immunohistochemistry markers line up well with that. It's an unusual presentation, but it makes sense with the evidence we have.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 76-year-old woman with a palpable left axillary mass:\n\n1. **Metastatic Serous Borderline Tumor of the Ovary or Peritoneum**: This is supported by the PAX8, p53, and WT1 positivity, which are commonly associated with Müllerian origin tumors.\n\n2. **Primary Axillary Mucinous Carcinoma**: Although less likely, this could be considered due to the ER positivity, but it doesn't fully align with the PAX8 and WT1 profile.\n\n3. **Metastatic Breast Cancer**: Despite the ER and PR positivity, the GATA3 negativity and unusual location make this less likely.\n\n4. **Fallopian Tube Cancer**: Similar to ovarian tumors, fallopian tube cancers can express PAX8 and WT1, making this a plausible consideration.\n\n5. **Primary Breast Cancer with Axillary Presentation**: While the hormone receptor profile fits, the absence of breast findings on imaging makes this unlikely.\n\n6. **Gastrointestinal Adenocarcinoma Metastasis**: This is possible but less likely due to the hormone receptor positivity, which is atypical for gastrointestinal cancers.\n\n7. **Lung Adenocarcinoma Metastasis**: Although less likely, lung cancers can occasionally present with axillary masses, but the immunohistochemistry doesn't strongly support this.\n\n8. **Metastatic Endometrial Cancer**: Endometrial cancers can express PAX8, but the WT1 positivity is less common, making this a less likely option.\n\n9. **Primary Axillary Adenocarcinoma**: This is a rare possibility but could be considered given the axillary location and lack of other primary sites identified.\n\n10. **Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of Unknown Primary**: This remains a consideration if no primary site is identified, but the immunohistochemistry suggests a Müllerian origin is most likely.\n\nAfter reviewing all the information, the most likely diagnosis is a **Metastatic Serous Borderline Tumor of the Ovary or Peritoneum**, given the strong immunohistochemical evidence supporting a Müllerian origin.", "topic": "['Oncology', 'Gynecologic Cancer', 'Gynecology', \"Women's Health\", 'Obstetrics and Gynecology']"}

Fixed masses can be concerning, but the well-circumscribed nature makes me think it might not be too aggressive.\n\nOkay, so what's common in kids with a neck mass? Lymphadenopathy is pretty common, but this doesn't seem like that. There's no systemic illness or other masses, so maybe not an infection or something like that. Could it be a congenital issue?

Ewing's sarcoma or neuroblastoma could be considerations, but they're usually more aggressive and painful. This mass is painless, so that's less likely. What about a nerve sheath tumor? Those can be well-circumscribed and firm. That's a possibility.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about Castleman disease. It can present as a slow-growing, painless mass and have histiocytes on biopsy. That fits pretty well.

Nasal endoscopy performed by the otolaryngology service showed no evidence of invasive fungal sinusitis. The patient received a single dose of intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone, then was transitioned to ampicillin-sulbactam for presumed orbital cellulitis. After 48 hours, motility, proptosis, and chemosis worsened (Figure 1A). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Zoledronic acid-induced orbital inflammation", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this.

Hmm, that's a lot going on.\n\nNow, let's consider his medical history. He's dealing with hypothyroidism, psoriasis, and, more importantly, multiple myeloma. He's on daratumumab and zoledronic acid for that. These treatments can really knock down the immune system, making him more vulnerable to infections. So, infection is definitely on my radar.\n\nThe CT scan shows preseptal edema and some fat stranding in the orbit, but no sinus disease. That's interesting because it suggests the issue is more with the eye itself, not the sinuses. And the nasal endoscopy didn't show any fungal infection, which is good because that's a big concern in someone with his health background.\n\nInitially, I thought it might be orbital cellulitis, so antibiotics like ampicillin-sulbactam were started. But, uh-oh, after two days, things got worse. His symptoms didn't improve; in fact, they intensified. That's a red flag that maybe we're dealing with something more aggressive or maybe even fungal.\n\nGiven his multiple myeloma and the immunosuppressive treatment, he's at high risk for fungal infections. Mucormycosis is a possibility, especially since it's known for being aggressive and worsening despite antibiotic treatment. But wait, the nasal endoscopy didn't show any fungal invasion.

So, it's less likely.\n\nOkay, let's think about the treatment. We've got antibiotics on board, but if this is mucormycosis, we need antifungal treatment ASAP. And if it's Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, we should start steroids.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Mucormycosis is still high on the list because of his risk factors and the aggressive nature of the symptoms.

It's still a strong contender, but the hard texture and lack of other typical features like café-au-lait spots are odd. Could it be a variant or something atypical?\n\nWhat about Gardner's syndrome? It's a type of familial adenomatous polyposis with osteomas, but it usually has other symptoms like dental abnormalities or intestinal polyps. We don't have any mention of those here.\n\nOkay, let's think about tuberous sclerosis. It has skin and organ involvement, but the hard nodules don't quite fit the typical skin lesions like shagreen patches or periungual fibromas. It's not a perfect match.\n\nNow, multiple hereditary exostoses is still on the table. It explains the hard bony growths, but the scalp involvement is still unusual. It's a possibility, but not perfect.\n\nLet's not forget about congenital generalized fibromatosis. It involves fibrous tumors, but it's rare and usually presents earlier. It's a long shot, but worth considering.\n\nIn the end, I think multiple hereditary exostoses is the most likely diagnosis. It fits the hard nodules and the genetic aspect, even if the scalp involvement is atypical. It seems to be the best fit given all the information.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Neurofibromatosis Type 1** - This is a strong initial consideration given the history of neurofibromas and the initial diagnosis at age 10.\n\n2. **Multiple Hereditary Exostoses** - This condition involves bony growths and could explain the hard nodules, although scalp involvement is atypical.\n\n3. **Osteochondromatosis** - Similar to multiple hereditary exostoses, it involves bony outgrowths but is less common on the scalp.\n\n4. **Gardner's Syndrome** - A type of familial adenomatous polyposis with osteomas, but typically includes other symptoms like dental abnormalities.\n\n5. **Tuberous Sclerosis** - Involves skin and organ lesions, but the hard nodules don't match the typical skin findings.\n\n6. **Proteus Syndrome** - Characterized by various growths, but usually more sporadic and with distinct features not mentioned here.\n\n7. **Congenital Generalized Fibromatosis** - Involves fibrous tumors, but it's rare and typically presents earlier in life.\n\n8. **Fibrous Dysplasia** - Could explain some bony abnormalities, but doesn't typically present with multiple nodules on the scalp.\n\n9. **Histiocytosis** - A condition involving abnormal proliferation of histiocytes, which could lead to bony lesions, but is less likely given the long history.\n\n10. **Dysosteosclerosis** - A rare sclerosing bone disorder, which might explain some findings, but is not well-aligned with the overall clinical picture.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Multiple Hereditary Exostoses** seems to be the most fitting diagnosis, as it accounts for the hard bony nodules and the genetic aspect, despite the atypical scalp involvement. However, the lack of family history in the children and the consanguineous parents suggest a possible recessive condition, which may warrant further genetic evaluation.", "topic": "['Dermatology']"}

Let’s think step by step.\n### INPUT:\nA woman in her mid-20s was evaluated for a history of dyspnea on exertion for 2 years. On physical examination, her pulse was 70 beats per minute, and blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg. The cardiovascular examination showed a loud S1, normal S2, and an opening snap along with a mid-diastolic, soft, rumbling murmur at the apex of the heart. The electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with left atrial enlargement. The echocardiogram showed severe mitral stenosis with a mitral valve area of 0.9 cm2 with a mean (SD) gradient of 20 (4) mm Hg. There was no evidence of any subvalvular thickening, leaflet calcification, or mitral regurgitation. The patient was taken for balloon mitral valvotomy (BMV). A 6F pigtail catheter was placed in the left ventricle via the right femoral artery. The interatrial septum was punctured using a Mullins sheath and Brockenbrough needle via the right femoral vein. Entry into the left atrium was made and confirmed with a dye injection. However, suddenly, the patient developed acute onset of dyspnea along with retrosternal chest pain. Her blood pressure at the time of the event was 100/60 mm Hg, pulse was 70 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation was 96%. The catheter was pulled back into the right atrium, and chest fluoroscopy was performed (Figure; Video). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Air embolism in main pulmonary", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a young woman who's been dealing with shortness of breath when she's active for a couple of years. That's a long time to be experiencing something like that. During her check-up, her heart sounds were a bit off. There was a loud first heart sound, a normal second heart sound, and then there was this opening snap followed by a mid-diastolic murmur at the apex of her heart. That's pretty telling. It sounds like mitral stenosis to me.\n\nThe echocardiogram confirmed it—severe mitral stenosis with a valve area of 0.9 cm2 and a mean gradient of 20 mm Hg. No weird thickening or calcification, so it's likely just the valve being narrow. They decided to go for a balloon mitral valvotomy to help her out.\n\nNow, during the procedure, things took a turn. She suddenly had trouble breathing and felt pain in her chest. Her blood pressure was 100/60, pulse stayed at 70, and oxygen saturation was still okay at 96%. That's a bit alarming. They pulled the catheter back and did a chest fluoroscopy. So, what could be going on here?\n\nFirst thought, could it be a pericardial tamponade? That's when fluid builds up around the heart and can be serious. It can happen if the heart gets punctured during a procedure like this. But, her blood pressure and pulse didn't change much, which is a bit odd if it were tamponade. Usually, you'd expect more instability.\n\nWhat about a coronary air embolism? Air getting into the coronary arteries can cause chest pain and breathing issues. It's possible during these kinds of procedures if air gets into the system. But, would it cause such immediate symptoms without other signs?\n\nMaybe it's just a vasovagal reaction? Sometimes, people can have a reflexive response during procedures that causes symptoms like these. But, it seems a bit too severe for just a vasovagal reaction.\n\nCould it be a pneumothorax? That's when air leaks into the space around the lungs. It could cause sudden breathlessness and chest pain. But, we'd likely see changes in her vitals or lung sounds, which weren't mentioned.\n\nWhat about a myocardial infarction? That's a heart attack, and it can cause chest pain and shortness of breath. But, she's young and there's no mention of classic heart attack symptoms or ECG changes.\n\nCould it be an esophageal perforation? That's when the esophagus gets a hole, which can cause sudden chest pain and breathing issues. It's a long shot, but possible if the catheter went off course.\n\nMaybe it's just a pleural effusion? That's when fluid builds up around the lungs. It could cause shortness of breath, but usually not this suddenly without other signs.\n\nWhat about a catheter-induced complication like aortic dissection? That's when the layers of the aorta tear, which can cause severe chest pain. But, it's rare in this context and we'd expect different symptoms or imaging findings.\n\nCould it be a ventricular septal rupture? That's when the wall between the heart's ventricles tears, causing blood to flow between them. It's a serious complication but usually happens after a heart attack, not during a valvotomy.\n\nFinally, let's consider a left atrial appendage perforation. That's when the small appendage on the left atrium gets punctured, which can lead to tamponade. It fits the sudden onset of symptoms during the procedure.\n\nSo, after thinking it through, left atrial appendage perforation seems like the most likely cause of her symptoms. It matches the timing and nature of what happened during the procedure.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided and the sequence of events during the balloon mitral valvotomy, the most likely cause of the sudden onset of dyspnea and chest pain is a left atrial appendage perforation leading to pericardial tamponade. This is supported by the timing of the symptoms during the procedure and the nature of the intervention, which involved manipulation near the heart. While other complications like coronary air embolism or esophageal perforation could also be considered, left atrial appendage perforation is the most consistent with the sudden onset of symptoms in this context. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Left Atrial Appendage Perforation**\n2. Pericardial Tamponade\n3. Coronary Air Embolism\n4. Esophageal Perforation\n5. Vasovagal Reaction\n6. Pneumothorax\n7. Myocardial Infarction\n8. Pleural Effusion\n9. Aortic Dissection\n10.

She had a medical history of essential thrombocytosis (ET), which was treated with hydroxyurea for 14 years, with a total cumulative dose of approximately 2500 g. She was otherwise reasonably well and denied any other constitutional symptoms. The ulcerations had slowly increased in number and size over several years and were quite painful (Figure, A-C). She did have a medical history of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSCa), which had previously been treated surgically. Several tangential shave biopsies were performed to help clarify the patient’s diagnosis. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Hydroxyurea-induced squamous dysplasia", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an elderly woman with a bunch of crusted and ulcerated plaques on her skin, mostly where the sun hits. That's interesting. She's been on hydroxyurea for a long time, about 14 years, to treat her essential thrombocytosis. That's a pretty long time to be on that medication. I've heard that hydroxyurea can cause some skin issues, so that's something to keep in mind.\n\nNow, she's in her 80s, and older skin can be more prone to certain conditions. Plus, she's had nonmelanoma skin cancer before, which was treated with surgery. That history is important because it could mean she's more likely to develop other skin cancers.\n\nThe fact that these plaques are painful and have been getting worse over the years is concerning. Chronic wounds or ulcers can sometimes turn into something more sinister, like skin cancer. Squamous cell carcinoma comes to mind because it can start from chronic wounds or ulcers, especially in sun-exposed areas.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. We should consider other possibilities too. Hydroxyurea has been linked to some skin changes, including ulcers and non-healing wounds. Could this be a case of hydroxyurea-induced leg ulcers? It's possible, given her long history with the drug.\n\nHowever, we can't ignore the potential for other skin conditions. With her age and history, basal cell carcinoma is another possibility. It's common in older adults and can present in various ways, including ulcerated plaques.\n\nOh, and what about Bowen's disease? It's a form of squamous cell carcinoma in situ, and it can appear as persistent plaques or ulcers, especially in sun-damaged skin. That fits her description pretty well.\n\nLet's not forget about actinic keratosis. It's a precursor to squamous cell carcinoma and is very common in older individuals with a lot of sun exposure. These can sometimes progress to more serious lesions if not treated.\n\nThere's also the possibility of melanoma, although it's less likely given the description of the lesions. Still, it's always better to be safe and consider it.\n\nNow, thinking about autoimmune disorders, discoid lupus erythematosus could be in the running. It can cause chronic skin lesions that ulcerate, especially in sun-exposed areas. That's something to consider, especially with her age and gender.\n\nLastly, there's the idea of porphyria cutanea tarda. It can cause blistering and skin fragility on sun-exposed skin, leading to ulcerated lesions. It's a bit of a long shot, but it's worth thinking about.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I'd say the top differential diagnosis is squamous cell carcinoma, given the chronic and painful nature of the ulcers and her history of sun exposure. Hydroxyurea-induced leg ulcers are a close second, considering her medication history. Basal cell carcinoma, Bowen's disease, and actinic keratosis follow, as they are all possible given her age and skin history. The others, like discoid lupus and porphyria cutanea tarda, are less likely but still worth considering.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - Given the chronic, painful ulcers and significant sun exposure, this is a strong consideration.\n\n2. **Hydroxyurea-Induced Leg Ulcers** - The long-term use of hydroxyurea is a notable factor, as it can lead to non-healing ulcers.\n\n3. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** - Common in older adults, it can present as ulcerated plaques, especially in sun-exposed areas.\n\n4. **Bowen's Disease** - A form of squamous cell carcinoma in situ, it fits the description of persistent plaques or ulcers in sun-damaged skin.\n\n5. **Actinic Keratosis** - A precursor to squamous cell carcinoma, it's common in individuals with extensive sun exposure.\n\n6. **Melanoma** - Although less likely, it's important to consider due to the potential severity.\n\n7. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus** - Can cause chronic, ulcerating lesions in sun-exposed areas, particularly in older adults.\n\n8. **Porphyria Cutanea Tarda** - Characterized by blistering and skin fragility on sun-exposed skin, leading to ulcerations.\n\n9. **Chronic Venous Insufficiency** - Could contribute to ulcer formation, especially in the lower extremities.\n\n10. **Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides)** - Presents with persistent, ulcerated plaques and could be a consideration given the chronic nature of the lesions.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are squamous cell carcinoma and hydroxyurea-induced leg ulcers, followed closely by basal cell carcinoma, Bowen's disease, and actinic keratosis.

She had locally advanced disease that was invading the skin overlying her right breast and metastatic disease to the thoracic and lumbar spine, liver, and mediastinal, axillary, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Her disease had progressed after receiving first-line therapy with palbociclib and anastrozole. Subsequent treatments with fulvestrant and paclitaxel were also followed by progressive disease. She received treatment with capecitabine; after 6 weeks of treatment, she developed some redness on her hands and feet that resolved on its own. She then presented to the clinic with pruritic, erythematous, scaly macules and papules on her forearms, faces, chest, and upper back (Figure). The rash had been present for 3 weeks and had recently worsened. Her palms and soles were spared. The rash did not respond to treatment with topical clindamycin, oral solumedrol, or doxycycline. She had a history of substantial sun exposure but no history of skin cancer. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Inflammation of actinic keratoses", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 56-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer, and she's been through quite a few treatments. Her cancer's been pretty stubborn, progressing even after some heavy-duty meds like palbociclib, anastrozole, fulvestrant, and paclitaxel. Now she's on capecitabine, and that's when things got interesting with her skin.\n\nSo, she developed this rash. It's pruritic, erythematous, and scaly, showing up on her forearms, face, chest, and upper back. But, notably, her palms and soles are fine. That's a bit of a clue. She's had this rash for three weeks, and it's getting worse. Topical clindamycin, oral steroids, and doxycycline haven't helped. Hmm, that's frustrating.\n\nLet's think about what could be causing this. The timing is key here. It started after she began capecitabine. This drug is known for causing hand-foot syndrome, but that typically involves the palms and soles. Since those areas are spared, could it still be related? Maybe it's presenting atypically. Let's keep that in mind.\n\nWhat else could it be? Well, given her history of significant sun exposure, a photodermatitis or even a photosensitivity reaction seems possible. The sun-exposed areas are affected, after all. But, the lack of response to steroids is a bit puzzling for a simple photodermatitis.\n\nCould it be an infection? We've got topical and oral antibiotics that didn't work, so bacterial infection seems unlikely. What about a viral exanthem? That's possible, but usually, we'd expect a more widespread rash or accompanying symptoms.\n\nNow, let's not forget autoimmune progesterone dermatitis. It's rare, but it could fit. The rash is on sun-exposed skin, and it's not responding to the usual treatments. But, we don't have any information about her menstrual cycle or hormone therapy, which would be helpful in confirming this.\n\nOh, and there's always the possibility of a paraneoplastic syndrome. With her cancer history, that's something to consider. These syndromes can cause all sorts of skin changes, and they might not respond to standard treatments.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? We've got a few possibilities. The atypical presentation of capecitabine's hand-foot syndrome is still on the table, even if it doesn't perfectly match. Photodermatitis or photosensitivity is also a strong contender, given the sun exposure. Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis and paraneoplastic syndrome are less common but can't be ruled out.\n\nAlright, let's rank these. I'd say the atypical hand-foot syndrome from capecitabine is the most likely, just because of the timing. Next, photodermatitis or photosensitivity seems probable due to the sun-exposed distribution. Then, autoimmune progesterone dermatitis and paraneoplastic syndrome follow, as they fit some but not all of the criteria. And finally, viral exanthem and bacterial infection seem less likely given the lack of response to treatments and absence of other symptoms.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the rash, considering the patient's medical history and treatment timeline:\n\n1. **Atypical Hand-Foot Syndrome**: Capecitabine is known to cause hand-foot syndrome, but the sparing of palms and soles makes this presentation atypical yet still possible.\n\n2. **Photodermatitis/Photosensitivity**: The rash appears on sun-exposed areas, and the patient has a history of significant sun exposure, making this a strong contender.\n\n3. **Autoimmune Progesterone Dermatitis**: Although rare, this condition could fit, especially since the rash is on sun-exposed skin and hasn't responded to standard treatments.\n\n4. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**: Given the patient's metastatic breast cancer, a paraneoplastic syndrome could be causing the skin changes, which might not respond to typical treatments.\n\n5. **Viral Exanthem**: A viral infection could cause a widespread rash, but the lack of other symptoms makes this less likely.\n\n6. **Bacterial Infection**: The lack of response to antibiotics suggests this is unlikely, but it cannot be completely ruled out without further testing.\n\n7. **Contact Dermatitis**: Although less likely given the widespread nature of the rash, contact with new products or environmental factors could be a cause.\n\n8. **Drug-Induced Lupus**: Given the patient's medication history, drug-induced lupus is a possibility, especially if medications like capecitabine or others are involved.\n\n9. **Graft-Versus-Host Disease**: Although the patient has no history of transplantation, this could be considered if there were any undocumented transfusions or rare reactions.\n\n10. **Lichen Planus**: This condition can cause a pruritic, erythematous rash, but it typically has a more specific distribution pattern and is less likely in this context.\n\nReranking these based on all patient information and test results, the top three most likely diagnoses remain: **1. Atypical Hand-Foot Syndrome**, **2. Photodermatitis/Photosensitivity**, and **3. Autoimmune Progesterone Dermatitis**, followed by **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**. The others are less likely given the specifics of the case.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Cutaneous Drug Reactions', 'Breast Cancer', 'Oncology', \"Women's Health\"]"}

Two years ago, she underwent uncomplicated right cataract surgery at a different center. Her postoperative course had been complicated by persistent low-grade anterior uveitis for which she received maintenance loteprednol, 0.5%, eye drops on alternate days. She also used latanoprost eye drops at night in both eyes for primary open-angle glaucoma. Her medical history was only significant for hypertension, which was well controlled with ramipril. She denied any ocular trauma or recent travel outside of the country.

We've got an 81-year-old woman with these dark spots on her corneas. That's definitely something that needs a closer look. First off, what could cause dark spots on the cornea? One possibility that jumps to mind is corneal melanosis. It's not uncommon in older adults and could be related to long-term eye issues or even previous surgeries.\n\nNow, she's had cataract surgery a couple of years ago. That's interesting because surgeries can sometimes lead to complications, even if they were initially deemed uncomplicated. Could this be a case of surgical trauma causing some kind of pigmented deposit? That's something to consider.\n\nShe's also been dealing with persistent low-grade anterior uveitis. That's inflammation, and inflammation can sometimes lead to pigmented deposits on the cornea. So, could this be a result of the uveitis? It's definitely possible.\n\nAnd she's on loteprednol, a steroid eye drop, to manage the uveitis. Steroids can have all sorts of effects on the eye, but causing pigmented spots directly? That's not typical. Still, long-term use might contribute to some kind of change in the cornea.\n\nOh, and she's using latanoprost for glaucoma. Prostaglandin analogs like latanoprost are known to cause pigmentation changes, but that's usually in the iris, not the cornea. Could it still be related? Maybe, but it seems less likely.\n\nLet's not forget her age. At 81, there are common age-related corneal changes, like corneal aging rings. But those are usually more diffuse, not distinct spots. Still, it's worth considering.\n\nWhat about something more serious, like a corneal melanoma? That's a scary thought, but it's rare. Given her age, we can't completely rule it out, though.\n\nThen there's the possibility of corneal foreign bodies. But she didn't mention any trauma, and these spots have been there for a while. That seems unlikely.\n\nCould it be something like a corneal tattoo? That's usually done intentionally, and she didn't mention anything like that. So, probably not.\n\nAnd finally, there's the idea of benign epithelial spots or nevi. Those are generally harmless and could match what we're seeing here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the most likely explanation is corneal melanosis, probably related to her age and previous eye surgery. But we should keep corneal melanoma in mind, just in case. The other possibilities, like effects from her medications or benign spots, seem less likely but can't be completely ruled out.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the darkly pigmented corneal lesions in the 81-year-old woman:\n\n1. **Corneal Melanosis** - This condition is a common consideration given the patient's age and history of cataract surgery, which could contribute to pigmented changes in the cornea.\n\n2. **Corneal Melanoma** - Although rare, this serious condition cannot be entirely ruled out, especially in older adults, and should be kept in mind during further evaluation.\n\n3. **Surgical Trauma** - The history of cataract surgery raises the possibility of pigmented deposits resulting from surgical trauma.\n\n4. **Uveitis-related Pigmentation** - Persistent low-grade anterior uveitis could lead to pigmented deposits on the cornea due to chronic inflammation.\n\n5. **Medication-induced Changes** - Long-term use of loteprednol, a steroid eye drop, might contribute to corneal changes, although direct pigmentation is atypical.\n\n6. **Latanoprost-induced Pigmentation** - While latanoprost is known to cause pigmentation changes, this typically affects the iris rather than the cornea.\n\n7. **Corneal Aging Rings** - Age-related corneal changes could manifest as pigmented rings, but these are usually more diffuse than distinct spots.\n\n8. **Corneal Foreign Body** - Although unlikely given the absence of trauma history, the possibility of a foreign body should be considered.\n\n9. **Corneal Tattoo** - This is usually an intentional procedure, and without a history of such, it is improbable.\n\n10. **Benign Epithelial Spots or Nevi** - These are generally harmless and could explain the pigmented lesions, but are less likely given the patient's age and history.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are Corneal Melanosis and Corneal Melanoma, with Corneal Melanosis being the more likely explanation due to the patient's age and surgical history.

We've got a woman in her 60s with a new itchy rash. It started on her legs and then spread to her feet, arms, hands, and trunk. That's quite a journey for a rash! She's also feeling some burning and occasional pain. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nNow, let's see what's going on with her medical history. She's had endometrial adenocarcinoma and had a hysterectomy. Plus, she just finished radiotherapy not too long ago. That's a lot to consider. But she hasn't started any new meds, hasn't had any chemo, and hasn't traveled recently. So, we can probably rule out some common causes like drug reactions or infections from travel.\n\nOn her physical exam, there are these red, swollen bumps and plaques all over her upper and lower limbs, and even some on her back and buttocks. They're not just simple bumps; some are annular and polycyclic with central hyperpigmentation. That's a pretty specific pattern. And notably, her chest, abdomen, face, and oral mucosa are all clear. That's good to know.\n\nOh, and her blood work shows eosinophilia. That's a clue! Eosinophilia can point towards a few things like allergic reactions or certain types of skin conditions. But let's not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nSo, what could this be? Let's start with the obvious. Given her recent radiotherapy, could this be radiodermatitis? It's possible, but usually, radiodermatitis stays around the radiation site. Her rash is all over, so maybe not.\n\nHow about erythema multiforme? It can cause target-like lesions, but it's often related to infections or medications. She doesn't have any new meds or recent infections, so that's a bit off.\n\nWhat about erythema chronicum migrans? It's associated with Lyme disease, but she hasn't traveled to an endemic area, and there's no 'bull's-eye' rash. So, probably not that.\n\nCould it be a drug eruption? But wait, she said no new medications. So, that's unlikely.\n\nMaybe it's a viral exanthem? Those can be widespread and itchy. It's possible, but we don't have any other viral symptoms.\n\nHow about Sweet's syndrome? It can cause fever and leukocytosis, but she doesn't have those. Still, the rash and eosinophilia fit a bit.\n\nGraft-versus-host disease is another thought, but she hasn't had any transplants. So, that's out.\n\nParaneoplastic syndrome could be an option. Her cancer history makes this plausible, especially with the eosinophilia.\n\nAnd finally, there's the possibility of an idiopathic origin. Sometimes, these things just happen without a clear cause.\n\nNow, let's rank these ideas. Considering everything, paraneoplastic syndrome seems like a strong contender. It ties in with her cancer history and the eosinophilia. Sweet's syndrome is another possibility because of the rash and eosinophilia, even without the usual systemic symptoms. Viral exanthem is still in the running because it fits the widespread, itchy rash. And finally, erythema multiforme, although less likely, can't be completely ruled out.\n\nSo, after thinking it all through, paraneoplastic syndrome comes out on top, followed by Sweet's syndrome, viral exanthem, and then erythema multiforme. That seems to make the most sense given everything we know.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the woman's rash, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Radiodermatitis** - Given her recent radiotherapy, this is an initial consideration, though the widespread nature of the rash is atypical for radiodermatitis.\n\n2. **Erythema Multiforme** - Characterized by target-like lesions, often related to infections or medications, but she lacks recent infection or new medication history.\n\n3. **Erythema Chronicum Migrans** - Associated with Lyme disease, but the absence of a 'bull's-eye' rash and travel history makes this less likely.\n\n4. **Drug Eruption** - Unlikely since she reported no new medications.\n\n5. **Viral Exanthem** - Possible due to the widespread and itchy nature of the rash, though other viral symptoms are absent.\n\n6. **Sweet's Syndrome** - Characterized by fever, leukocytosis, and tender skin lesions, but the presence of eosinophilia and rash fit, despite the absence of systemic symptoms.\n\n7. **Graft-Versus-Host Disease** - Unlikely as she has no history of transplantation.\n\n8. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - Plausible given her cancer history and eosinophilia.\n\n9. **Idiopathic Eosinophilic Pustular Folliculitis** - Could be considered due to the eosinophilia, though the rash characteristics are not entirely typical.\n\n10. **Hypereosinophilic Syndrome** - A possibility due to the eosinophilia, but usually involves more systemic manifestations.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses, in order of likelihood, are:\n\n1. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - Given her cancer history and eosinophilia, this is the most likely diagnosis.\n2. **Sweet's Syndrome** - The presence of eosinophilia and rash characteristics make this a strong contender.\n3. **Viral Exanthem** - The widespread, itchy rash without other symptoms keeps this in consideration.\n4. **Erythema Multiforme** - Although less likely, it cannot be completely ruled out due to the nature of the rash.\n\nThese diagnoses take into account her medical history, the characteristics of the rash, and the laboratory findings.

Since the initial onset, the bruise and pain had persisted despite icing and resting the area. She denied any personal or family history of bleeding disorders. On examination, an ill-defined indurated blue-green plaque was noted on the dorsum of the left hand (Figure 1). Radiography results showed soft tissue swelling but were otherwise unremarkable. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging showed a heterogeneously fluid hyperintense and T1 heterogeneously hyperintense lesion measuring approximately 1.6 × 0.5 × 2.9 cm that was centered within the dorsal subcutaneous soft tissue of the hand. An excision was performed. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her 30s with a painful bruise on her hand. It's been there for a while, ever since she hurt it doing acroyoga two years ago. That's a long time for a bruise to stick around. And she's tried icing it and resting, but nothing's helped. That's odd.\n\nSo, what could this be? My first thought is a hematoma. It's a common issue after an injury, and they can sometimes persist. But usually, they're not this persistent without some kind of underlying issue, like a bleeding disorder. But she says she doesn't have any history of that, so maybe something else is going on.\n\nLet's consider other possibilities. A lipoma could be an option. They're soft tissue masses, and they can definitely hang around for a long time. But they're usually not painful, and this bruise is definitely causing her pain.\n\nWhat about a hemangioma? They're vascular lesions, and they can appear as blue-green, which matches her symptoms. Plus, they can be painful if they're thrombosed or have bleeding inside them. That seems like a strong possibility.\n\nBut wait, there's more to think about. The MRI shows a fluid-filled lesion that's hyperintense on T2 and heterogeneous on T1. That sounds like something with blood products, maybe a hematoma or a vascular lesion like a hemangioma. But it's not clear-cut.\n\nCould it be an angiosarcoma? That's a more aggressive vascular tumor, and it can look similar on imaging. But it's rare, and she doesn't have other symptoms like rapid growth or systemic signs, so it seems less likely.\n\nLet's not forget about a venous malformation. Those can look like persistent bruises and have similar MRI characteristics. They're often present at birth but can become apparent after trauma, which fits her story.\n\nOh, and there's also the possibility of a glomus tumor. They're known for being painful and can appear under the nail or in the hand, which matches her symptoms. But they're usually more localized and not as large as what the MRI shows.\n\nNow, what about a myositis ossificans? That's when bone forms in the soft tissue after an injury, and it can cause pain. But the MRI doesn't really show bone, so that's probably not it.\n\nLet's think about a desmoid tumor. Those are fibrous tumors that can be painful and persistent. They don't typically have the MRI characteristics we're seeing here, but they can be tricky.\n\nFinally, there's the idea of a pseudotumor, like a Morel-Lavallée lesion. That's a type of seroma that can happen after trauma and persist. It's less common in the hand, but it could fit the imaging and her symptoms.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top possibilities are a hemangioma, a venous malformation, and maybe a pseudotumor like a Morel-Lavallée lesion. These all fit the persistent, painful nature of the bruise and the MRI findings. But we'll need the pathology from the excision to be sure.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the painful bruise on the woman's hand, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Hematoma** - Given the history of trauma and the persistent nature of the bruise, a hematoma is a plausible initial consideration.\n\n2. **Hemangioma** - The blue-green color of the lesion and its painful nature align with characteristics of a hemangioma, particularly if it has become thrombosed or has internal bleeding.\n\n3. **Venous Malformation** - These can appear as persistent bruises and have similar MRI findings, making them a strong contender.\n\n4. **Lipoma** - Although typically not painful, lipomas are common soft tissue masses that could be considered, though they don't fully match the symptom profile.\n\n5. **Angiosarcoma** - A more aggressive vascular tumor that could present similarly, but its rarity and lack of rapid growth or systemic symptoms make it less likely.\n\n6. **Glomus Tumor** - Known for being painful, glomus tumors can appear in the hand, but they are usually more localized and smaller than the lesion described.\n\n7. **Myositis Ossificans** - This involves bone formation in soft tissue after trauma, but the MRI does not show bone, making this less likely.\n\n8. **Desmoid Tumor** - A fibrous tumor that can be painful and persistent, though it doesn't typically match the MRI characteristics described.\n\n9. **Morel-Lavallée Lesion** - A type of seroma that can occur after trauma and persist, fitting the imaging and symptoms, though it's less common in the hand.\n\n10. **Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis (PVNS)** - A condition that can cause persistent swelling and pain, often with a nodular appearance, but it's more commonly associated with joints.\n\nAfter considering all the information and test results, the top differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Venous Malformation** - This fits well with the persistent, painful bruise and MRI findings.\n2. **Hemangioma** - The lesion's appearance and painful nature align with a hemangioma, especially if complicated by thrombosis or bleeding.\n3. **Morel-Lavallée Lesion** - This type of pseudotumor could explain the persistent nature and imaging characteristics of the lesion.\n\nThe final diagnosis will depend on the pathology results from the excision.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Soft-Tissue Tumors']"}

Four days after treatment, a white head formed overlying the tumor that erupted through the skin surface (Figure 1). Thin, cloudy discharge that was not foul-smelling drained from the tumor from posttreatment days 5 to 10, at which point the drainage stopped spontaneously. Throughout, the patient reported no pain and remained afebrile. Laboratory results on days 5, 9, and 14 demonstrated the absence of leukocytosis, and serial wound cultures failed to demonstrate pathogenic growth. No antibiotics were administered. The patient completed the neoadjuvant immunotherapy and underwent a margin-negative tumor resection without intraoperative or postoperative complications. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Immunotherapy-related inflammation", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 69-year-old woman with a pretty serious squamous cell carcinoma on her lower lip. She just started on some heavy-duty immunotherapy, and now, just a few days in, she's got redness and swelling at the tumor site. That's pretty quick for a reaction. \n\nFirst off, my mind goes to an infection. I mean, redness and swelling are classic signs, right? But wait, she's not running a fever, and there's no pus or anything nasty-smelling. Plus, the lab results show no sign of infection, like no white blood cell spike, and the cultures are clean. So, infection doesn't seem to fit. \n\nOkay, so what about an abscess? That could explain the swelling and the fact that something 'erupted' through the skin. But usually, abscesses are painful, and she's not feeling any pain. And it resolved on its own without antibiotics. That's weird for an abscess. \n\nMaybe it's just a simple allergic reaction? But the timing is off. Allergic reactions usually happen pretty fast after starting a new treatment, and this took a few days to show up. Plus, they don't usually involve a white head forming and bursting. \n\nCould it be necrosis? Tumors can necrotize, especially with treatment, but necrosis doesn't usually happen this quickly or with such a clean resolution. And there's no foul smell, which you'd expect with dead tissue. \n\nHmm, what about a drug reaction like Stevens-Johnson syndrome? That can cause skin issues, but it's usually more widespread and serious, with systemic symptoms. She's not showing any of those signs. \n\nLet's think about spontaneous tumor necrosis. That could fit, with the tumor breaking down and draining. But again, it's strange that it resolved so cleanly and without any infection signs. \n\nOh, and what if it's an immune-related adverse event? Immunotherapy can cause all sorts of strange reactions. This could be the immune system going into overdrive against the tumor. That might explain the rapid onset and the clean resolution. \n\nBut wait, let's not forget about a fistula. Could the treatment have caused the tumor to break down and form a fistula? That might explain the drainage. But usually, fistulas don't just close up on their own like that. \n\nAlright, let's think about a cryonecrosis. That's when the tissue freezes and dies, but that's not what's happening here. There was no cold therapy. \n\nFinally, could it be a spontaneous tumor lysis? That's when the tumor just kind of melts away, which could fit with the drainage and the lack of infection. It's like the tumor just gave up and dissolved. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the most likely explanation is a spontaneous tumor lysis. It matches the symptoms and the way the whole thing resolved without any signs of infection. Yeah, that seems to make the most sense.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the symptoms observed in the patient:\n\n1. **Infection** - Given the redness and swelling, infection is a common initial consideration.\n2. **Abscess** - The swelling and eruption of a white head could suggest an abscess, but the lack of pain and spontaneous resolution are atypical.\n3. **Allergic Reaction** - While possible, the timing and nature of the symptoms don't strongly support a typical allergic reaction.\n4. **Tumor Necrosis** - The rapid changes at the tumor site could be due to necrosis, but the clean resolution without odor is unusual.\n5. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome** - This severe drug reaction usually involves more widespread and serious symptoms, which are not present here.\n6. **Spontaneous Tumor Necrosis** - This could explain the breakdown and drainage, but the lack of infection is surprising.\n7. **Immune-Related Adverse Event** - Immunotherapy can cause unique reactions; this might explain the rapid onset and clean resolution.\n8. **Fistula Formation** - The drainage could suggest a fistula, but spontaneous closure is uncommon.\n9. **Cryonecrosis** - This involves tissue freezing, which doesn't apply here as there was no cold therapy.\n10. **Spontaneous Tumor Lysis** - This fits the symptoms of the tumor breaking down and resolving without infection.\n\nReranking these based on all the information, the top three most likely diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Immune-Related Adverse Event** - This is the most likely given the context of immunotherapy and the unusual presentation.\n2. **Spontaneous Tumor Lysis** - The clean resolution and lack of infection support this possibility.\n3. **Spontaneous Tumor Necrosis** - While less likely than the top two, it remains a plausible explanation given the rapid changes observed.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Targeted and Immune Therapy', 'Oncology', 'Surgery', 'Surgical Oncology']"}

Some of the eruptions on his trunk had spontaneously resolved with developmental growth. There was nonconsanguineous marriage of his parents, and no family members had similar lesions. The patient was otherwise in good general health and without developmental delay. Physical examination showed generalized, linear hyperkeratotic papules with numerous central small filiform keratotic white spicules and brown plugs on the head, face, neck, trunk, and bilateral upper and lower extremities (Figure, A and B), including his palms and soles along Blaschko lines, accompanied with alopecia of the scalp and eyebrows. The examination of nails, mucosae, and teeth was unremarkable. No extracutaneous involvement was observed. Dermoscopic examination showed many central white spines on the face (Figure, C) and brown cores surrounded by yellow crater-like rings on the right palm. A skin biopsy specimen was taken from the hyperkeratotic papules with white spicules on his right thigh (Figure, D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a school-aged boy with these weird skin bumps. They're all over his body, even on his palms and soles, and they follow these strange lines. I've heard of these lines before; they're called Blaschko lines. That's a big clue because not many conditions follow these lines.\n\nThe bumps have these central white spicules and brown plugs. That's pretty unique. I'm trying to remember what conditions have these features. Hmm, I know that incontinentia pigmenti and certain types of epidermal nevi can follow Blaschko lines, but they don't usually have these white spicules.\n\nOh, and the boy's parents aren't related, and no one else in the family has this. That makes me think it's not something genetic that runs in families, like an autosomal dominant or recessive condition. Maybe it's something that just happened by chance, like a mosaic condition.\n\nNow, let's think about the histology. The biopsy might show something interesting. If it's something like a verruca, we might see certain viral changes, but I doubt that's the case here because the distribution is so widespread and follows Blaschko lines. That's not typical for warts.\n\nOkay, so what about other conditions? I've heard of this thing called 'papular epidermal nevus with 'skyline' sign.' It kind of fits because it can have these white spicules and follow Blaschko lines. But I'm not sure if it explains everything here.\n\nLet's not forget about the boy's general health. He's doing fine otherwise, no developmental issues, which is good. That rules out some syndromes that have skin and systemic involvement.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I'm leaning towards this being a type of epidermal nevus, maybe the 'papular epidermal nevus with 'skyline' sign' or something similar. It matches the skin findings and the Blaschko line distribution. Yeah, that seems to make the most sense given everything we know.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnoses for the boy's skin condition, in order of consideration, are as follows:\n\n1. **Incontinentia Pigmenti** - Although it follows Blaschko lines, it typically doesn't present with hyperkeratotic papules and white spicules.\n2. **Epidermal Nevus Syndrome** - This can present with similar skin findings and follows Blaschko lines, but the specific features of white spicules are atypical.\n3. **Papular Epidermal Nevus with 'Skyline' Sign** - This condition matches the description of hyperkeratotic papules with central white spicules and follows Blaschko lines.\n4. **Verruca (Viral Wart)** - While it can present with hyperkeratotic lesions, the widespread and linear distribution along Blaschko lines is not typical.\n5. **Focal Dermal Hypoplasia (Goltz Syndrome)** - This condition involves different types of skin lesions and usually has systemic involvement, which isn't present here.\n6. **Linear Porokeratosis** - Presents with linear keratotic lesions but typically lacks the central white spicules.\n7. **Linear Verrucous Epidermal Nevus** - Could match some features, but the white spicules are not characteristic.\n8. **Darier's Disease** - Presents with papular lesions, but they don't typically follow Blaschko lines or have the described central spicules.\n9. **Keratosis Pilaris** - Involves keratotic papules, but not in a linear Blaschko distribution.\n10. **Mosaicism-related Skin Condition** - Considering the unique features and distribution, a mosaic genetic condition could be a plausible explanation.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the most likely diagnosis is **Papular Epidermal Nevus with 'Skyline' Sign**, as it best fits the clinical presentation and histological features.

Six days before admission, the patient’s neck stiffness transited to an endurable dull ache. When turning his head, there was severe burning pain in the posterior neck and occiput, followed immediately by an electric shocklike numbness on ipsilateral side tongue, which led to a forced head position. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine with gadolinium on admission revealed signal abnormality in C1/C2 vertebrae (Figure 1A). In the past 3 days, with the intensification of neck pain, the patient found pustules on both hands, which gradually increased. He had no history of tobacco, alcohol, or drug misuse. On examination, he was afebrile. There was tenderness in the right sternoclavicular articulation, upper neck, post aurem, and occiput.

We've got a 51-year-old guy who's been dealing with some pretty bad neck pain for about a week. He's also had neck stiffness and some swelling and pain in his chest. That's a lot going on. He's been taking ibuprofen, which helps a bit, but the pain is still there. Now, when he turns his head, he feels this severe burning pain in the back of his neck and head, and it's followed by this weird electric shock sensation on his tongue. That's unusual. \n\nThe MRI shows something odd in the C1/C2 vertebrae. That's the top part of the spine, so we're definitely looking at something in the cervical region. And then, he's got these pustules on his hands. That's a skin thing, right? But it's happening along with the neck pain, so they might be connected. \n\nHis blood tests show elevated ESR and CRP. Those are markers for inflammation, so there's definitely some inflammation going on somewhere. But all the tests for common rheumatic and infectious diseases came back negative. That's a bit of a head-scratcher. \n\nOkay, let's think about what could cause neck pain and these skin issues. Spondyloarthritis could be a possibility. It often involves inflammation in the spine and can have skin manifestations. But usually, you'd expect some positive test results, like HLA-B27, which he doesn't have. \n\nMaybe it's something like psoriatic arthritis? That can cause both joint and skin issues. But again, we'd expect some positive antibodies, and he doesn't have those either. \n\nWhat about osteomyelitis or discitis? Those are infections in the bone or disc and could cause neck pain. But you'd think there'd be some sign of infection in the blood or imaging, and there's not. \n\nCould it be something autoimmune, like ankylosing spondylitis? That causes spine inflammation, but it often starts in younger people, and he's 51. Plus, the negative HLA-B27 makes it less likely. \n\nThe pustules on his hands are interesting. They could be a sign of a skin condition like pustulosis, which sometimes goes along with joint issues. Maybe it's a type of psoriasis? But if it were, we might expect some skin-specific test results to be positive. \n\nLet's not forget about the MRI. The signal abnormality in C1/C2 could mean inflammation or infection, but all the infection tests are negative. That's odd. \n\nMaybe we're looking at something rare, like a granulomatous disease. Those can cause inflammation without the usual infection signs. \n\nOr could it be a type of vasculitis? That's inflammation of the blood vessels and can cause a range of symptoms. But again, we'd expect some positive tests, and they're all negative. \n\nAlright, let's put it all together. Considering the neck pain, the pustules, and the negative tests, I'm thinking it might be a rare inflammatory condition, maybe a type of spondyloarthritis or a granulomatous disease. It's not fitting neatly into one category, but that's where the evidence points.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Psoriatic Arthritis** - This condition can cause both joint inflammation and skin manifestations like pustules, which aligns with the patient's symptoms.\n\n2. **Spondyloarthritis** - This is a broad category of inflammatory rheumatic diseases that often affect the spine and can have skin manifestations, although the negative HLA-B27 is atypical.\n\n3. **Osteomyelitis or Discitis** - Infections in the bone or disc could cause severe neck pain, but the lack of positive infection signs in tests is unusual.\n\n4. **Ankylosing Spondylitis** - An autoimmune condition that causes spine inflammation, but it typically starts at a younger age and is associated with positive HLA-B27, which this patient lacks.\n\n5. **Pustulosis** - A skin condition that can be associated with joint issues, but usually, there would be more specific skin test results.\n\n6. **Granulomatous Disease** - Conditions like granulomatosis with polyangiitis could cause inflammation without typical infection signs, but usually, there would be more systemic symptoms.\n\n7. **Vasculitis** - Inflammation of the blood vessels that can cause a range of symptoms, but again, more positive tests would be expected.\n\n8. **Reactive Arthritis** - Often follows an infection and can involve joint and skin symptoms, but the negative tests make this less likely.\n\n9. **Gout** - Can cause sudden, severe pain and skin manifestations like tophi, but usually involves elevated uric acid levels, which were not mentioned.\n\n10. **SAPHO Syndrome** - A rare condition characterized by synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis, which aligns well with the patient's symptoms of neck pain and pustules.\n\nAfter considering all the patient's symptoms and test results, SAPHO Syndrome emerges as the most likely diagnosis, as it accounts for both the musculoskeletal and dermatological manifestations in the absence of more common inflammatory or infectious findings.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Neurology', 'Rheumatology', 'Spinal Cord Disorders']"}

His social history was negative for tobacco or alcohol use. This patient was not taking any steroid medications. Physical examination showed an enlarged right more than left-sided neck mass. It was tense but compressible to palpation. Flexible fiber-optic laryngoscopy showed a crowded oropharynx with lingual tonsil hypertrophy and narrow oropharynx and hypopharynx. An outside computed tomography scan showed diffuse symmetric fatty infiltration of the pharynx, larynx, trachea, and esophagus.

We've got a 55-year-old guy who's a jazz musician. He's got a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and sleep apnea. Now, he's coming in with this neck mass that's been growing for over two years. It's more on the right side than the left. That's interesting. He's having trouble swallowing solid food and breathing at night. But no neurological issues, that's good. \n\nHe mentioned having a similar mass before, about 10 years ago, that was treated with liposuction. Hmm, that's a clue. His family history doesn't show anything about head or neck diseases, and he doesn't smoke or drink. Plus, he's not on any steroids. That rules out a few things. \n\nOn examining him, the mass is tense but compressible. That feels like it could be something fatty. The laryngoscopy shows a crowded oropharynx and lingual tonsil hypertrophy. That might be why he's having breathing issues. \n\nThe CT scan shows diffuse fatty infiltration in the pharynx, larynx, trachea, and esophagus. Wow, that's extensive. And the MRI confirms it with fat deposition from C1 to the sternal notch. This is looking like a lipomatosis situation. \n\nSo, what could this be? Let's start with the obvious. Lipoma seems like a good first guess. It's a common benign tumor made of fat tissue. \n\nBut wait, there's more to consider. Multiple symmetric lipomatosis, or Madelung's disease, could fit here. It's known for involving multiple fatty deposits around the neck and can cause symptoms like dysphagia and breathing problems. \n\nWe should also think about liposarcoma, a malignant tumor made of fat tissue. But usually, those are more aggressive and not so symmetric. \n\nAngioedema could cause swelling, but it's typically more sudden and not chronic like this. \n\nA goiter could be a possibility, but it's usually more anterior and not fatty. \n\nWe can't forget about lymphoma, especially with the history of a growing mass. But lymphoma would likely show more lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms. \n\nThere's also the possibility of a branchial cleft cyst, but those are usually more lateral and not fatty. \n\nEpidemiologically, we should consider something like a thyroglossal duct cyst, but again, it's not typically fatty. \n\nAnd what about a neurofibroma? It's a nerve tissue tumor, but it wouldn't really match the fatty characteristics on imaging. \n\nLastly, there's the idea of a desmoid tumor, a type of fibrous tumor. But it's usually more solid and not fatty. \n\nSo, putting it all together, multiple symmetric lipomatosis seems to be the best fit. It matches the imaging and the symptoms. Lipoma is a close second, but the extent and symmetry lean more towards Madelung's disease. The other options just don't quite fit as well.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the 55-year-old male with the enlarging neck mass and associated symptoms is Multiple Symmetric Lipomatosis, also known as Madelung's disease. This condition is characterized by the presence of multiple symmetric fatty deposits around the neck, which aligns with the imaging findings and the patient's symptoms of dysphagia and breathing difficulties. While other possibilities such as lipoma, liposarcoma, and lymphoma were considered, the extensive and symmetric nature of the fatty infiltration, along with the patient's history and clinical presentation, make Multiple Symmetric Lipomatosis the most fitting diagnosis. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Multiple Symmetric Lipomatosis (Madelung's disease)**\n2. Lipoma\n3. Liposarcoma\n4. Lymphoma\n5. Angioedema\n6. Goiter\n7. Branchial cleft cyst\n8. Thyroglossal duct cyst\n9. Neurofibroma\n10. Desmoid tumor\n\nEach of these was considered based on the patient's symptoms, medical history, and imaging results, with Multiple Symmetric Lipomatosis being the most consistent with the presented case.", "topic": "['Oncology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Soft-Tissue Tumors', 'Head and Neck Surgery']"}

On examination, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU and intraocular pressures were normal in both eyes at 10 mm Hg. Slitlamp biomicroscopy of the anterior chamber was within normal limits in both eyes. Dilated fundus examination revealed normal findings in the right eye and clear vitreous with a subretinal mass in the left eye inferior to the optic disc and measuring 3 × 2 mm in base. Color fundus photography of the left eye (Figure, A) showed an amelanotic lesion under the retina inferior to the optic disc and 3 mm from the foveola surrounded by a subtle orange halo. Fundus autofluorescence (Figure, B) showed the lesion to be hyperautofluorescent. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of the lesion showed the mass was primarily in the sclera and pushed and thinned the overlying choroid (Figure, C). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Focal scleral nodule", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 54-year-old woman with a history of breast and kidney cancers, and now there's this suspicious mass in her left eye. It's amelanotic, which means it doesn't have that typical brown pigment, so it's a bit tricky. Given her history, the first thing that pops into my mind is a metastatic tumor. Breast cancer is known to spread to the eye, so that's a strong possibility.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions just yet. There are other things this could be. Amelanotic lesions in the choroid could also be something like a hemangioma. These are usually benign and more common than we might think. They can look similar, so it's worth considering.\n\nNow, let's think about the imaging. The mass is mostly in the sclera and it's pushing the choroid out of the way. That's interesting because metastatic tumors often do that. They can be quite aggressive and displace the surrounding tissues. But, I should also think about other possibilities. Could it be something like an osteoma? Those can affect the sclera too, although they're usually more calcified.\n\nHmm, what about the autofluorescence? The lesion is hyperautofluorescent, which can happen with metastatic tumors due to the lipofuscin buildup. But, I've also seen this in other conditions like choroidal hemangiomas. So, that's not a clear-cut sign just yet.\n\nLet's not forget about her history of kidney cancer. Could this be related? Renal cell carcinoma can be clear or amelanotic, and it's known to metastasize. That's definitely something to keep in mind.\n\nOh, and there's the possibility of a schwannoma. These are nerve sheath tumors and can appear in the choroid. They're not the first thing that comes to mind, but they can't be ruled out completely.\n\nNow, let's think about the size and location. The mass is small, 3x2 mm, and located near the optic disc. That's an area where you might see a hemangioma or even a schwannoma. But again, metastatic tumors can appear anywhere, so it's still a contender.\n\nWhat about an amelanotic nevus? These are benign and can appear as a hypopigmented spot. They're less likely to be the case here given her cancer history, but they're still a possibility.\n\nLet's not forget about leiomyomas. These are smooth muscle tumors and can appear in the eye. They're rare, but they could fit the description.\n\nFinally, there's the possibility of a fibrous histiocytoma. These are rare in the choroid, but they could present as an amelanotic mass. It's a long shot, but it's worth considering.\n\nSo, after thinking through all of this, my top differential diagnosis is still a metastatic tumor, likely from her breast cancer. But I'm also considering a choroidal hemangioma, an amelanotic nevus, and even a schwannoma. Each of these has some features that match what we're seeing, and they can't be ruled out without further investigation.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the amelanotic choroidal mass in the patient's left eye, considering her history of breast and kidney cancers:\n\n1. **Metastatic Tumor** - Given the patient's history of lobular breast carcinoma in situ and chromophobe kidney cell carcinoma, a metastatic tumor is a strong possibility.\n\n2. **Choroidal Hemangioma** - This benign vascular tumor can appear as an amelanotic mass and is a common consideration for such lesions.\n\n3. **Amelanotic Nevus** - Although less likely given her cancer history, an amelanotic nevus is a benign pigmented lesion that could present similarly.\n\n4. **Choroidal Schwannoma** - A nerve sheath tumor that can occur in the choroid, presenting as an amelanotic mass.\n\n5. **Choroidal Osteoma** - Typically more calcified, but can present as a scleral mass and should be considered.\n\n6. **Renal Cell Carcinoma Metastasis** - Given her history of kidney cancer, metastasis to the choroid is a plausible diagnosis.\n\n7. **Leiomyoma** - A rare smooth muscle tumor that could present as an amelanotic choroidal mass.\n\n8. **Fibrous Histiocytoma** - Although rare in the choroid, it could present as an amelanotic mass and should be considered.\n\n9. **Choroidal Melanoma (Amelanotic Variant)** - Although less pigmented, amelanotic melanomas can still occur and should be part of the differential.\n\n10. **Scleral Chondroma** - A rare cartilaginous tumor that could present as a mass in the sclera extending into the choroid.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses, in order of likelihood, are:\n\n1. **Metastatic Tumor** (likely from breast or kidney primary)\n2. **Choroidal Hemangioma**\n3. **Renal Cell Carcinoma Metastasis**\n4. **Choroidal Schwannoma**\n5. **Amelanotic Nevus**\n\nThese diagnoses take into account the patient's history, the characteristics of the mass, and the imaging findings.

He reported a 20-kg weight loss and numbness to the ankles. His medical history was significant for thyroid cancer treated with total thyroidectomy resulting in a chronic left accessory nerve injury, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and gout. His medications were metformin, allopurinol, perindopril, thyroxine, and rabeprazole. He had no history of smoking and drank 3 glasses of wine per week. His family history was unremarkable. Examination revealed significant wasting of proximal and paraspinal muscles with a flexed spine posture in the upright position (Figure 1A). He had symmetric Medical Research Council grade 4/5 weakness of neck flexion, shoulder abduction, elbow flexion and extension, and hip flexion and extension bilaterally. He had weakness of left shoulder elevation and winging of the left scapula secondary to the accessory nerve injury. His deep tendon reflexes were normal and symmetric. Pinprick sensation was reduced in both feet. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Sporadic late-onset nemaline rod myopathy", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 72-year-old man who's been dealing with some pretty concerning symptoms. He's got this progressive weakness, especially noticeable in his proximal muscles, and he's developed this thing called camptocormia, where his back kind of hunches over. That's not all; he's also having trouble swallowing, which is always a red flag. And he's lost a significant amount of weight, 20 kg over two years, which is quite a lot. Plus, he's experiencing numbness in his feet. \n\nNow, let's see what's in his medical history. He had thyroid cancer, and they had to remove his thyroid completely, which left him with a chronic accessory nerve injury on the left side. That's probably why he's got some shoulder issues. He's also dealing with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and gout. His medications include metformin, allopurinol, perindopril, thyroxine, and rabeprazole. He doesn't smoke, which is good, and he drinks moderately. \n\nWhen we examine him, we see significant muscle wasting, especially in the proximal and paraspinal muscles. His posture is really affected, with a flexed spine. He's got weakness in neck flexion, shoulder abduction, elbow movements, and hip movements, all around grade 4/5, which is pretty significant. His reflexes are normal, though, which is interesting. And he's got reduced pinprick sensation in his feet. \n\nSo, what could be going on here? Let's start with the possibility of a neuromuscular disorder. ALS is a big one that comes to mind because it can cause both upper and lower motor neuron signs, but we're not really seeing those classic signs here, like fasciculations or hyperreflexia. \n\nNext, let's think about myopathies. Inclusion body myositis could fit, with the weakness and swallowing issues, but we'd usually expect more distal weakness and maybe some skin changes, which aren't mentioned. \n\nWhat about a paraneoplastic syndrome? His history of thyroid cancer makes me think of that. These syndromes can cause muscle weakness and wasting, and sometimes sensory issues. \n\nThen there's the possibility of a mitochondrial disorder. They can cause muscle weakness and sometimes numbness, but we'd usually see other symptoms like ptosis or more widespread neurological issues. \n\nCould it be a medication-related issue? Metformin can cause neuropathy, but it doesn't explain the muscle weakness and wasting. \n\nLet's not forget about motor neuron diseases like PLS. It's characterized by progressive weakness, but it usually spares sensation, and we have that numbness in his feet. \n\nWe should also consider multifocal motor neuropathy. It can cause weakness and wasting, but it's usually more asymmetric and has specific nerve involvement, which isn't what we're seeing here. \n\nWhat about chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy? It can cause weakness and sensory issues, but it's typically more widespread and might have more pronounced reflex changes. \n\nNow, let's think about a muscle-related issue like limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. It causes proximal weakness, but we'd usually see it starting earlier in life, and the sensory issues don't quite fit. \n\nLastly, there's the possibility of a systemic disease like sarcoidosis. It can cause muscle weakness and sensory issues, but we'd usually see more systemic symptoms or skin involvement. \n\nSo, when I put it all together, I think the paraneoplastic syndrome is the most likely cause. It fits with his cancer history and explains the muscle and sensory symptoms. ALS and inclusion body myositis are close contenders, but they don't quite match up with all the details. \n\nIn the end, I'm going with paraneoplastic syndrome as the top differential, followed by ALS, inclusion body myositis, and then the others.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)** - This condition is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and can involve both upper and lower motor neuron signs, although the absence of fasciculations and hyperreflexia in this case makes it less typical.\n\n2. **Inclusion Body Myositis** - This myopathy could explain the proximal weakness and dysphagia, but usually presents with more distal weakness and sometimes skin changes, which are not noted here.\n\n3. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - Given the patient's history of thyroid cancer, a paraneoplastic syndrome is plausible, as it can cause muscle weakness, wasting, and sensory issues.\n\n4. **Mitochondrial Disorder** - These disorders can cause muscle weakness and sometimes sensory issues, but typically involve other symptoms like ptosis or more widespread neurological signs.\n\n5. **Medication-Related Myopathy** - Metformin can contribute to neuropathy, but it doesn't fully account for the muscle weakness and wasting observed.\n\n6. **Primary Lateral Sclerosis (PLS)** - This condition involves progressive weakness but usually spares sensation, which doesn't align with the patient's numbness.\n\n7. **Multifocal Motor Neuropathy** - This can cause weakness and wasting, but it's typically more asymmetric and involves specific nerve distributions not seen here.\n\n8. **Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)** - While it can cause weakness and sensory issues, it often presents with more widespread neurological involvement and reflex changes.\n\n9. **Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy** - This condition causes proximal weakness, but typically starts earlier in life, and sensory issues are not characteristic.\n\n10. **Sarcoidosis** - This systemic disease can cause muscle weakness and sensory issues, but usually includes more systemic symptoms or skin involvement.\n\nAfter considering all the patient's symptoms and history, the top differential diagnosis is **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**, followed by **ALS**, and **Inclusion Body Myositis**. These conditions best explain the combination of progressive muscle weakness, dysphagia, weight loss, and sensory changes in the context of his cancer history.", "topic": "['Hematology', 'Neurology', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Swallowing and Dysphagia']"}

Dilated fundus examination revealed subtle reddish geographic irregularities at the level of the retinal pigment epithelial at a nasal juxtafoveal location in both eyes. The optic discs, vessels, and periphery were normal. Near-infrared (IR) imaging highlighted the irregularities in both eyes (Figure 1). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "COVID-19–associated acute macular neuroretinopathy", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 12-year-old girl who just got diagnosed with COVID-19, and now she's having some weird vision problems. She's seeing things blurry and has these big blue spots in her vision, but no fancy migraine aura. That's interesting.\n\nFirst off, the timing is pretty tight with the COVID diagnosis. Could it be related? Maybe. COVID's been known to cause all sorts of things, so let's keep that in mind. But what exactly could be going on in her eyes?\n\nThe doctor's exam shows her visual acuity has taken a hit, which is a big change from what it was years ago. Her eye movements and the front part of the eyes look normal, so it's probably something further back, like with the retina.\n\nThe fundus exam is where it gets more telling. There are these reddish, geographic-looking changes right at the retinal pigment epithelium level. That's a mouthful, but basically, it's a specific part of the retina. And the near-infrared images are really bringing these changes out.\n\nSo, what could this be? Let's start with some common things. Could it be central serous chorioretinopathy? It's known for causing serous detachments, but usually in adults and often related to stress. Seems a bit off for a kid, but let's not rule it out yet.\n\nWhat about vitelliform macular dystrophy? It's a genetic condition, and she's young, so it could fit. But the sudden onset right after COVID makes me think it might not be the best fit.\n\nMaybe it's something like acute macular neuroretinopathy. It's rare, but it can cause sudden changes and is more common in young females. And the COVID connection? That's a possibility. COVID's been linked to all sorts of vascular issues, so maybe that's a factor here.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about posterior uveitis. It's inflammation at the back of the eye, and COVID could potentially cause some kind of inflammatory response. But would it look like these specific changes on the exam? Not sure.\n\nCould it be a congenital issue like a macular hole or a vitreomacular traction syndrome? These usually show up differently on exams, and the sudden onset doesn't quite match.\n\nWhat about multifocal choroiditis? It involves inflammation and could cause these kinds of spots, but it's not typically linked with COVID.\n\nAnd then there's the idea of a COVID-related retinal vasculitis. COVID's caused weird vascular issues before, so maybe that's what's happening here. It would explain the sudden onset and the specific retinal changes.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? After thinking it through, acute macular neuroretinopathy seems like a strong contender. It fits the sudden onset, her age, and gender, and the COVID link is plausible. But we shouldn't completely rule out COVID-related retinal vasculitis or even posterior uveitis. They both have some merit. Let's keep an open mind and see if more information can help us narrow it down.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the visual symptoms experienced by the 12-year-old girl following her COVID-19 diagnosis:\n\n1. **Acute Macular Neuroretinopathy (AMN)**: This condition is characterized by sudden changes in vision and is more common in young females, aligning with the patient's profile and symptoms.\n\n2. **COVID-19-related Retinal Vasculitis**: Given the recent COVID-19 diagnosis, a vascular issue related to the virus could be a plausible cause of the sudden visual changes.\n\n3. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR)**: Although more common in adults, CSCR could cause serous detachments leading to visual disturbances, but it's less likely in a child.\n\n4. **Posterior Uveitis**: This inflammation at the back of the eye could be linked to COVID-19 and might explain the visual symptoms, but the specific retinal changes are atypical.\n\n5. **Vitelliform Macular Dystrophy**: A genetic condition that could present in youth, but the sudden onset following COVID-19 makes it less likely.\n\n6. **Multifocal Choroiditis**: Involves inflammation and could cause similar retinal changes, but lacks a direct COVID-19 link.\n\n7. **Macular Hole**: Typically presents differently and wouldn't usually have such a sudden onset related to COVID-19.\n\n8. **Vitreomacular Traction Syndrome**: Unlikely given the sudden onset and specific retinal findings.\n\n9. **Apical Serous Choroidopathy**: Similar to CSCR but less common; could be considered but is unlikely in this scenario.\n\n10. **Inflammatory Chorioretinal Disease**: A broad category that could encompass various inflammatory conditions potentially triggered by COVID-19.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Acute Macular Neuroretinopathy (AMN)** emerges as the most likely diagnosis due to the sudden onset, the patient's age and gender, and the possible link with COVID-19. **COVID-19-related Retinal Vasculitis** and **Posterior Uveitis** remain as plausible alternatives, given the recent COVID-19 diagnosis and potential for inflammatory or vascular complications.

We've got a woman in her 50s with these itchy papules on her arms and legs. They're spreading fast and are really bothering her. The fact that they're annular and erythematous makes me think of a few things right off the bat. Hmm, could it be something like nummular eczema? That's known for itchy, circular patches. But wait, she's already been treated for eczema with no luck, so maybe that's not it.\n\nOkay, let's consider other possibilities. Pityriasis rosea comes to mind. It often starts with a herald patch, followed by a rash that's also itchy and papular. But usually, it doesn't last this long or spread this much. Plus, there's no mention of a herald patch here, so maybe that's not it either.\n\nWhat about psoriasis? It can definitely cause red, scaly patches, but they tend to be more persistent and are often found on extensor surfaces or the scalp. This doesn't quite fit the bill either, especially since the scalp isn't involved.\n\nOh, and there are those brown papules on her face. They're flat and asymptomatic, which is interesting. Could they be related to the papules on her extremities? Maybe they're seborrheic keratoses, which are benign and common in older adults. But I'm not sure they're connected to the itchy rash.\n\nLet's not forget about lichen planus. It causes pruritic, flat-topped papules that can appear anywhere, including the face and extremities. This could be a strong contender, especially since the lesions are so itchy and spreading.\n\nBut wait, what about discoid lupus erythematosus? It can cause chronic, disc-shaped lesions that are often erythematous. However, they tend to be more persistent and can scar, which doesn't quite match our case.\n\nNow, let's think about tinea corporis, a fungal infection. It can cause annular, pruritic lesions too. But usually, they're more ring-like and might have scaling, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nCould it be something more systemic, like a drug reaction? But she's not on any new medications, so that seems unlikely.\n\nWhat about sarcoidosis? It can cause skin lesions, but they're often more persistent and might involve the lungs or lymph nodes. There's no mention of systemic symptoms here.\n\nAnd then there's granuloma annulare, which causes annular papules without scaling. It's often found on the extremities and can be asymptomatic, but this case seems too pruritic for that.\n\nAlright, let's put it all together. Considering the itchiness, the annular nature of the papules, and the lack of response to eczema treatments, lichen planus seems like the most likely diagnosis. It fits the symptoms and lesion characteristics well. So, I'm going with lichen planus as the top differential diagnosis.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the top differential diagnosis for the woman's condition is lichen planus. This diagnosis is supported by the presence of intensely pruritic, annular papules on the extremities, along with brown, asymptomatic flat papules on the face. Lichen planus is known for causing such lesions and fits well with the symptoms and lack of response to previous eczema treatments. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Lichen Planus** - Characterized by pruritic, flat-topped papules that can appear on the extremities and face.\n2. **Pityriasis Rosea** - Typically starts with a herald patch followed by a more widespread rash, but usually not as persistent or severely pruritic.\n3. **Nummular Eczema** - Known for itchy, circular patches, but the patient has already been treated for eczema without success.\n4. **Psoriasis** - Often presents with more persistent, scaly plaques, commonly on extensor surfaces or the scalp.\n5. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus** - Causes chronic, disc-shaped lesions that can scar, which doesn't match the rapid spread in this case.\n6. **Tinea Corporis** - Fungal infection causing annular, pruritic lesions, but typically with scaling.\n7. **Granuloma Annulare** - Presents with annular papules, but they are usually asymptomatic and without scaling.\n8. **Sarcoidosis** - Often involves more persistent lesions and systemic symptoms, which are not present here.\n9. **Drug Reaction** - Unlikely due to no new medications being reported.\n10. **Seborrheic Keratoses** - Benign, non-pruritic lesions, likely unrelated to the itchy papules on the extremities.", "topic": "['Dermatology']"}

Current medications included carvedilol, 25 mg, twice daily and apixaban, 5 mg, twice daily. An ECG (Figure, A) showed atrial fibrillation with an irregular ventricular rate of around 60 beats per minute, right bundle branch block (RBBB), and left posterior fascicular block (LPFB). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "RBBB with left posterior hemiblock and left arm–left leg lead reversal mimicking alternating left anterior fascicular block and LPFB (trifascicular block or Rosenbaum syndrome)", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an elderly man who's been feeling lightheaded and having episodes of bradycardia. He's got a history of heart failure and atrial fibrillation, and he's on carvedilol, which can slow the heart rate. So, it's possible that the carvedilol is causing or worsening his bradycardia. That's my first thought.\n\nBut wait, there's more to consider. His ECG shows a right bundle branch block and a left posterior fascicular block. That's a pretty specific finding. When you see those together, it often points to a bifascicular block. Hmm, that could definitely cause bradycardia and presyncope, especially if it progresses to a complete heart block. So, a complete heart block is another strong possibility.\n\nNow, let's not forget about sick sinus syndrome. It can cause these kinds of symptoms too, with bradycardia and presyncope. The fact that he has atrial fibrillation could be related, as it sometimes happens with sick sinus syndrome. So, that's another potential cause.\n\nOh, and what about medications? Carvedilol is a beta-blocker, and it can certainly contribute to bradycardia. But is it the main issue here, or just making things worse? It's something to keep in mind.\n\nAlso, let's think about the possibility of digitalis toxicity. It's not something we've mentioned yet, but it can cause bradycardia and heart block. We don't have any information about digoxin use, but it's worth considering just in case.\n\nNow, what if there's an issue with his pacemaker? He doesn't have one, but if he did, a pacemaker malfunction could definitely cause these symptoms. It's not likely, but let's keep it in the back of our minds.\n\nOkay, so we've got a few different possibilities here. Let's see how they stack up. The bifascicular block leading to a complete heart block seems like a strong contender. It fits well with the ECG findings and his symptoms.\n\nBut wait, let's not dismiss sick sinus syndrome too quickly. It could explain the bradycardia and presyncope, especially with his history of atrial fibrillation. It's definitely still in the running.\n\nCarvedilol-induced bradycardia is also a possibility, but it seems more like it could be exacerbating the issue rather than being the primary cause. So, it's lower on the list.\n\nDigitalis toxicity is a bit of a wild card. Without any evidence of digoxin use, it's hard to prioritize it highly, but it's good to keep in mind.\n\nAnd pacemaker malfunction? Well, without a pacemaker, it's not really relevant. So, that's low on the list.\n\nAfter thinking it all through, I'd say the top differential diagnosis is a complete heart block due to the bifascicular block. Sick sinus syndrome is a close second. Carvedilol-induced bradycardia and digitalis toxicity follow, with pacemaker malfunction being the least likely since there's no pacemaker involved.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's symptoms, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Complete Heart Block** - Given the ECG findings of right bundle branch block and left posterior fascicular block, a complete heart block due to a bifascicular block is a strong contender.\n\n2. **Sick Sinus Syndrome** - This condition can cause bradycardia and presyncope, especially in the context of atrial fibrillation, making it a close second in the differential diagnosis.\n\n3. **Carvedilol-induced Bradycardia** - While carvedilol can contribute to bradycardia, it's likely exacerbating the underlying issue rather than being the primary cause.\n\n4. **Digitalis Toxicity** - Although there's no mention of digoxin use, digitalis toxicity can cause bradycardia and heart block, so it remains a consideration.\n\n5. **Pacemaker Malfunction** - This is unlikely since the patient does not have a pacemaker, but it's worth mentioning for thoroughness.\n\n6. **Atrioventricular Block** - This could be contributing to the bradycardia and is related to the bifascicular block observed in the ECG.\n\n7. **Cardiac Sarcoidosis** - This condition can affect the heart's electrical system, leading to conduction blocks and arrhythmias.\n\n8. **Lyme Carditis** - Although less common, it can cause conduction abnormalities, including heart block.\n\n9. **Hypothyroidism** - Severe hypothyroidism can lead to bradycardia and may contribute to the patient's symptoms.\n\n10. **Electrolyte Imbalance** - Imbalances such as potassium or magnesium abnormalities can affect heart rhythm and conduction.\n\nAfter considering all the possibilities and the patient's history, the top differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Complete Heart Block** due to bifascicular block\n2. **Sick Sinus Syndrome**\n3. **Carvedilol-induced Bradycardia**\n4. **Digitalis Toxicity** (if digoxin use is uncovered)\n5. **Atrioventricular Block**\n\nThese diagnoses align with the clinical presentation and ECG findings, while the others, although possible, are less likely given the current information.", "topic": "['Cardiology', 'Rhythm Disorders']"}

She had no associated nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hematochezia, bloating, or anorexia. She reported no precipitating factors for the pain and had no history of pregnancy, abdominal surgery, or abdominal trauma. Over the previous 2 years, the patient had experienced similar intermittent episodes of abdominal pain lasting approximately 1 week. Results from laboratory tests, upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, and an abdominal computed tomography scan performed 1 year prior to presentation were normal. In the emergency department, her vital signs were normal and her body mass index was 20.4 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters). Abdominal examination revealed no rigidity or guarding; however, a 1-cm point of maximal tenderness was identified in the left lower abdominal quadrant (Figure). During palpation of this 1-cm area, the pain increased when she lifted her head and tensed her abdominal muscles. She experienced cold hypoesthesia when an alcohol gauze pad was applied to this area and severe pain when the skin was pinched. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome (ACNES)", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 15-year-old girl with pain in her left lower abdomen. She's been dealing with this on and off for a couple of years, but it's been bugging her more over the past few days. She's on birth control, but no pregnancies or surgeries in her history. That's interesting.\n\nFirst off, the pain is pretty localized to a small spot. It's not all over, and there's no nausea or vomiting, which is good. Could it be something like appendicitis? But wait, appendicitis usually isn't just hanging around for years, and it's typically on the right side. So, probably not that.\n\nHow about ovarian cysts? They can cause pain like this, especially in a teenager. But wouldn't an ultrasound have shown something if that were the case? Hmm, maybe, but let's keep it in mind.\n\nInguinal hernia? Possible, but she's a girl, and they're more common in guys. Plus, there's no bulge or anything. So, maybe not.\n\nWhat about something like inflammatory bowel disease? But she doesn't have diarrhea or weight loss, and her tests were normal before. That seems unlikely.\n\nCould it be a kidney issue like nephrolithiasis? But there's no blood in her urine, and she doesn't have flank pain. So, probably not kidney stones.\n\nNow, the way she feels pain when the skin is pinched is really interesting. That makes me think of something like neuropathic pain. Could it be ilioinguinal nerve entrapment? That would fit with the localized pain and her symptoms.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. What about other possibilities like a spigelian hernia? Those can be sneaky and might not show up on imaging. It's worth considering.\n\nDiverticulitis is another option, but she's young for that, and usually, it's more acute. Still, it's something to think about.\n\nCould it be a musculoskeletal issue? Like, maybe she strained something? But the pain seems too specific and long-lasting for that.\n\nOh, and there's the fact that she's on birth control. Could that be playing a role? Maybe, but it's not a direct cause of this kind of pain.\n\nSo, after thinking it all through, I'm leaning towards ilioinguinal nerve entrapment. It just fits well with her symptoms and the way the pain behaves. But I'm also keeping spigelian hernia in mind as a strong contender. Both of these make sense with what's going on.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 15-year-old girl with left lower quadrant abdominal pain:\n\n1. **Ovarian Cyst** - Given her age and the nature of the pain, an ovarian cyst could be a plausible cause, even if previous imaging was normal, as cysts can change over time.\n\n2. **Ilioinguinal Nerve Entrapment** - The localized pain and increased sensitivity to pinching are suggestive of a neuropathic origin, such as nerve entrapment.\n\n3. **Spigelian Hernia** - This type of hernia can present with localized pain and may not be evident on imaging, making it a strong contender.\n\n4. **Appendicitis** - Although less likely due to the atypical location and chronic nature, appendicitis should be considered due to the potential severity if missed.\n\n5. **Inguinal Hernia** - Though more common in males, an inguinal hernia could still be possible and should be considered, especially with localized pain.\n\n6. **Diverticulitis** - While uncommon in adolescents, diverticulitis could present with left lower quadrant pain and should be kept in mind.\n\n7. **Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor** - A rare possibility, but could cause localized abdominal pain and should be considered if other causes are ruled out.\n\n8. **Endometriosis** - Could cause cyclic pain, but the absence of menstrual-related symptoms makes this less likely.\n\n9. **Musculoskeletal Pain** - A strained abdominal muscle could cause localized pain, but the chronic nature makes this less probable.\n\n10. **Kidney Stone (Nephrolithiasis)** - Unlikely due to the lack of typical symptoms like flank pain or hematuria, but should be considered if other causes are excluded.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top two differential diagnoses are **Ilioinguinal Nerve Entrapment** and **Spigelian Hernia**, as they best fit the symptoms and examination findings. These conditions can cause localized pain and are consistent with the patient's presentation.

Her scalp hair was relatively normal in terms of density and length at birth. Since the age of 1 year, the girl had begun to have frequent hair loss without pulling. Her mother also found that her hair grew to approximately the same maximum length down to the upper neck without trimming. On clinical examination, diffuse, short, sparse, lanugolike, black hair over the scalp was found (Figure, A and B). The surface of the scalp was smooth without inflammatory changes or focal alopecic patches. No involvement of eyebrows, eyelashes, nails, teeth, or body hair was found. Her intellectual performance was normal at presentation and no developmental delay had ever been noted. She denied experiencing a stressful event recently, and no habitual pulling of hair was observed by her family. Family history regarding hair loss was unremarkable. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Hypotrichosis simplex of the scalp", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a young girl who's been dealing with hair loss for six years. That's a long time, so it's probably something that's been developing over time rather than a sudden issue. Her hair was normal when she was a baby, but things changed when she was about a year old. That's interesting because it suggests something that starts early in childhood.\n\nNow, she's losing hair without pulling on it, and it doesn't grow past a certain length. That's a clue. The hair is short, sparse, and lanugo-like. Lanugo hair is usually soft and fine, so this is a texture issue too, not just length.\n\nThe scalp looks healthy—no inflammation or bald patches. That rules out some conditions that cause hair loss with scalp problems. And it's just the scalp hair that's affected, not her eyebrows, eyelashes, nails, or teeth. So, it's localized to the scalp.\n\nHer intellectual development is normal, which is good. Some hair disorders are linked with developmental issues, but that's not the case here. There's no family history of similar hair loss, so it might not be genetic.\n\nLet's think about what this could be. At first, I thought of congenital triangular alopecia. It's a condition where you have these triangular patches of hair loss, but usually, it's not diffuse like this, and the hair isn't lanugo-like.\n\nThen, there's loose anagen syndrome. That fits pretty well because it causes hair that's easily pulled out and doesn't grow long. The hair can be sparse and soft, like lanugo hair. Plus, it's often seen in young kids, and it's not associated with other symptoms like nail or tooth problems.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. We should consider other possibilities. How about alopecia areata? It usually causes round patches of hair loss, but sometimes it can be more diffuse. However, it often involves other areas like eyebrows, and the scalp can be affected in a more patchy way.\n\nThere's also traction alopecia, but that's from constant pulling or tension on the hair, like with certain hairstyles. The girl's family says she doesn't pull her hair, so that's unlikely.\n\nAnd what about tinea capitis? That's a fungal infection that can cause hair loss, but it usually comes with scalp inflammation or flaking, which she doesn't have.\n\nLet's not forget about nutritional deficiencies. Things like zinc deficiency can cause hair loss, but you'd usually see other symptoms, like skin problems or slow growth, which she doesn't have.\n\nCould it be something like trichotillomania? That's when someone pulls out their own hair, often subconsciously. But her family hasn't noticed any hair pulling, and the hair loss pattern doesn't quite fit.\n\nThere's also the possibility of a hair shaft disorder, like monilethrix or pili torti. These can cause fragile hair that breaks easily. But they often have a different appearance under the microscope, and we don't have those details here.\n\nAfter thinking it through, loose anagen syndrome still seems like the best fit. It matches the age of onset, the type of hair loss, and the fact that only the scalp is affected. The other conditions either have symptoms that don't match or would likely involve more than just the hair.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm sticking with loose anagen syndrome as the most likely explanation for her hair loss.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the girl's condition is loose anagen syndrome. This condition is characterized by hair that is easily plucked, does not grow to a significant length, and can appear sparse and soft, like lanugo hair. It typically presents in early childhood and primarily affects the scalp, which aligns with the details given. Other potential conditions, such as congenital triangular alopecia, alopecia areata, traction alopecia, tinea capitis, nutritional deficiencies, trichotillomania, and hair shaft disorders like monilethrix or pili torti, either have symptoms that don't match the presentation or would likely involve additional areas or symptoms not observed in this case. Therefore, loose anagen syndrome is the most fitting diagnosis. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Loose Anagen Syndrome**  \n2. Congenital Triangular Alopecia  \n3. Alopecia Areata  \n4. Traction Alopecia  \n5. Tinea Capitis  \n6. Nutritional Deficiencies (e.g., Zinc Deficiency)  \n7. Trichotillomania  \n8. Monilethrix  \n9. Pili Torti  \n10. Androgenetic Alopecia (though less likely in this age group)  \n\nEach condition was considered based on the age of onset, pattern of hair loss, and associated symptoms, with loose anagen syndrome being the most consistent with the provided details.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Genetics and Genomics', 'Hair Disorders', 'Pediatrics']"}

A computed tomography scan of the chest revealed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates. Azithromycin (10 mg/kg daily, intravenously) was started. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption (RIME)", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 6-year-old boy who's been dealing with a fever and cough for a couple of weeks. That's already a bit concerning. Then, he suddenly developed these blisters on his palms and soles. That's not something you see every day. A few days later, more blisters and redness showed up on his face and body, and even his lips and mouth are affected. That's a lot going on for a kid who was otherwise healthy.\n\nNow, let's see. He's got a fever, cough, and these weird skin and mucosal lesions. The blisters on the palms and soles are a big clue. Plus, there's conjunctivitis and those white patches in his mouth. Hmm, that sounds like a systemic issue, maybe something viral or autoimmune.\n\nFirst, I'm thinking about viral infections. Enteroviruses are known for causing blisters, especially on the palms and soles. Hand, foot, and mouth disease comes to mind, but that's usually not this severe. Then there's eczema herpeticum, which is a possibility, but it's more common in kids with a history of eczema, and this kid was healthy before.\n\nOkay, what about autoimmune conditions? Stevens-Johnson syndrome is one, but that's usually linked to medications or infections, and this kid isn't taking any meds. Erythema multiforme is another one, often triggered by infections like herpes simplex. The target-like lesions fit, but the palm and sole involvement is a bit unusual.\n\nBacterial infections could be the cause, especially with that cough and lung infiltrates. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome could explain the skin issues, but it doesn't usually involve the mucosa this much. And the systemic symptoms are quite severe for that.\n\nHmm, what about Kawasaki disease? It's known for fever, skin rash, and mucosal changes. But, it usually has other symptoms like lymph node enlargement and changes in the extremities, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nLet's not forget about toxin-mediated conditions. Toxic epidermal necrolysis is severe, but it's usually linked to medications. This kid isn't on any drugs, so that's unlikely.\n\nOh, and there's Parvovirus B19, which can cause a rash and sometimes blisters. But, it doesn't usually come with this kind of mucosal involvement or respiratory symptoms.\n\nNow, back to the respiratory symptoms. The cough and lung infiltrates could suggest a primary pulmonary issue, but the skin and mucosal findings are more prominent. So, it's likely something systemic with respiratory involvement.\n\nLet's think about the timing. The skin lesions appeared after the fever and cough. That could mean a secondary immune response, like erythema multiforme, which often follows infections.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I'm leaning towards erythema multiforme. It fits the mucosal involvement, target lesions, and timing after a suspected infection. But, the palm and sole blisters are still a bit unusual for erythema multiforme. Maybe it's a unique presentation or a combination of conditions.\n\nIn the end, I think erythema multiforme is the most likely diagnosis, but I'm keeping an open mind. This case is definitely complex, and there could be other factors at play.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 6-year-old boy, with a focus on one potential diagnosis per step, without repetition:\n\n1. **Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease**: This viral infection is known for causing vesiculobullous lesions on the palms and soles, but it's typically less severe than what's described here.\n\n2. **Eczema Herpeticum**: This condition involves widespread vesicular lesions and is usually seen in children with a history of eczema, which doesn't match this child's history of being otherwise healthy.\n\n3. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome**: A severe mucocutaneous reaction often linked to medications or infections, characterized by skin and mucosal lesions, but this child isn't on any medications.\n\n4. **Erythema Multiforme**: Often triggered by infections like herpes simplex, it presents with target-like lesions and mucosal involvement, fitting some aspects of this case, but palm and sole involvement is atypical.\n\n5. **Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome**: Known for causing skin exfoliation, but it typically doesn't involve mucosal surfaces to this extent.\n\n6. **Kawasaki Disease**: Characterized by fever, skin rash, and mucosal changes, but usually includes lymph node enlargement and extremity changes, which are not mentioned.\n\n7. **Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis**: A severe reaction usually linked to medications, which doesn't apply here since the child isn't taking any drugs.\n\n8. **Parvovirus B19**: Can cause a rash and sometimes blisters, but doesn't typically involve mucosal surfaces or respiratory symptoms like this case.\n\n9. **Bullous Pemphigoid**: An autoimmune blistering disorder, which is rare in children and doesn't typically present with mucosal involvement or respiratory symptoms.\n\n10. **Viral Exanthem with Secondary Bacterial Infection**: Considering the sequence of symptoms, a viral infection leading to a secondary bacterial infection could explain the skin, mucosal, and respiratory findings.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Erythema Multiforme** emerges as the most likely diagnosis, given the target-like lesions, mucosal involvement, and the timing following a suspected infection. However, the atypical palm and sole involvement suggests this could be a unique presentation or a combination of conditions.

He had progressive binocular diplopia and right periorbital pain, swelling, and redness. Blurriness of the right eye that started the week before presentation eventually caused enough concern that the patient presented to his local emergency department where magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits revealed an intraconal mass (Figure, A). He then came to our institution’s emergency department for urgent ophthalmology consultation. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Orbital lymphangioma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 16-year-old guy who got hit in the eye with a snowball, and now he's dealing with some pretty uncomfortable symptoms. He's got swelling around his right eye, and it's been getting worse over the past few weeks. That's not good. He's also experiencing double vision and pain, which sounds really frustrating. And to top it off, his vision in that eye has gotten blurry. That's a lot to handle.\n\nSo, what could be going on here? The fact that it all started after getting hit makes me think about trauma-related issues. Could it be an orbital fracture? That's possible, but usually, those don't cause swelling that gets progressively worse over weeks. Hmm, maybe it's an orbital hematoma? That could explain the swelling and the worsening symptoms, especially if it's pressing on some nerves or blood vessels.\n\nBut wait, he was given doxycycline, which is an antibiotic. That makes me think they suspected an infection, like preseptal or orbital cellulitis. But the fact that it didn't get better with antibiotics is a red flag. If it were a simple infection, you'd expect some improvement, right?\n\nNow, let's think about the MRI results. It shows an intraconal mass. That's a big clue. Intraconal masses can be a few things. Could it be a traumatic neuroma? That would fit with the history of trauma. But, usually, those don't cause progressive symptoms like this. What about an orbital abscess? That could explain the swelling and the lack of response to antibiotics if it's a stubborn infection.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about tumors. Something like a rhabdomyosarcoma could be in the mix. It's a type of cancer that can occur in the orbit and could definitely cause the symptoms we're seeing. But, it's rare, so I'm not sure if that's the top suspect.\n\nAlso, what about a carotid-cavernous fistula? That's a kind of abnormal connection between blood vessels that can happen after trauma. It could cause the symptoms we're seeing, like the swelling and the double vision. That's definitely something to consider.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? We've got a few possibilities. Orbital abscess, carotid-cavernous fistula, and maybe even a tumor like rhabdomyosarcoma are all on the table. Each of these could explain the symptoms and the MRI findings.

He had no traditional risk factors for ASCVD and no cardiac symptoms or limitations. He had never smoked, was physically active, and did not take any medications. His 10-year ASCVD risk was estimated at 1.6% (low risk) based on the pooled cohort equations (PCEs); however, he had 2 risk-enhancing factors: South Asian ancestry and a FHx of premature ASCVD. His father had a myocardial infarction at age 39 years, and, importantly, his older brother had angioplasty with multiple stents at age 43 years. Additionally, multiple male cousins on his father’s side had coronary artery disease, the details of which were unspecified. Owing to his striking FHx of premature ASCVD, he underwent screening for elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and obtained a coronary calcium score. His Lp(a) level was elevated at 136 nmol/L and his coronary calcium score of 137 Agatston units was notable and placed him in the 94th percentile for his age (Figure 1). He returned to the office for further counseling on what to do next about these findings. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Elevated Lp(a) in the setting of strongly positive FHx and high coronary artery calcium score for the patient’s age", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a South Asian guy in his early 40s who's pretty health-conscious. He doesn't smoke, stays active, and isn't on any meds. But, he's got this strong family history of heart disease that's kind of alarming. His dad had a heart attack at 39, and his brother had stents at 43. That's pretty young.\n\nSo, his calculated 10-year risk for heart disease is low, just 1.6%. But with his family history and being South Asian, those are big red flags. South Asians are known to have a higher risk of heart disease, so that's something to consider.\n\nHe got some tests done. His lipoprotein(a) is elevated at 136 nmol/L. That's another risk factor for heart disease. And then there's his coronary calcium score, which is 137. That's in the 94th percentile for his age. Yikes, that's high.\n\nOkay, so what could be going on here? Initially, I thought about familial hypercholesterolemia. It's a genetic thing that causes high cholesterol and can lead to early heart disease. But, he didn't mention any high cholesterol, so maybe that's not it.\n\nThen I considered lipoprotein(a) disorders. Elevated Lp(a) can increase heart disease risk, and his levels are high. But, is that enough on its own?\n\nI also thought about ASCVD. With his family history and calcium score, it seems like a strong possibility. But, he's asymptomatic and young, so maybe it's not that straightforward.\n\nWhat about diabetes? It's common in South Asians, but he didn't mention any diabetes symptoms or diagnosis. So, probably not that.\n\nCould it be a prothrombotic state? Elevated Lp(a) can contribute to that, but I'm not sure it's the main issue here.\n\nI also wondered about other lipid disorders. Maybe something like dyslipidemia? But again, there's no mention of abnormal lipids other than Lp(a).\n\nNow, let's think about the calcium score. A score of 137 is significant. It suggests subclinical coronary atherosclerosis. That's a big deal.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Considering everything, I'd say subclinical coronary atherosclerosis is the most likely explanation. His risk factors and test results all point in that direction.\n\nBut wait, let's not forget about preventive measures. Even if it's subclinical, we should think about statin therapy to lower his risk. That's important.\n\nIn the end, I'm confident that subclinical coronary atherosclerosis is the right conclusion. It fits with his family history, elevated Lp(a), and high calcium score. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient, considering his strong family history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, elevated lipoprotein(a) levels, and high coronary calcium score:\n\n1. **Familial Hypercholesterolemia** - A genetic disorder that leads to high cholesterol and increased risk of heart disease.\n2. **Lipoprotein(a) Disorders** - Elevated lipoprotein(a) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and could be contributing to his risk profile.\n3. **Subclinical Coronary Atherosclerosis** - The high coronary calcium score suggests the presence of atherosclerosis before symptoms develop.\n4. **Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD)** - Given his family history and test results, ASCVD is a significant consideration.\n5. **Diabetes Mellitus** - Common in South Asians, but there's no indication of diabetes symptoms or diagnosis.\n6. **Prothrombotic State** - Elevated lipoprotein(a) can contribute to a prothrombotic state, increasing cardiovascular risk.\n7. **Dyslipidemia** - Abnormal lipid levels other than elevated lipoprotein(a) could be present but are not mentioned.\n8. **Hypertension** - A common risk factor for heart disease, but there's no mention of high blood pressure.\n9. **Metabolic Syndrome** - A cluster of conditions that increase the risk of heart disease, but not directly indicated here.\n10. **Genetic Predisposition to Premature ASCVD** - His strong family history suggests a possible genetic component to his risk.\n\nReranking these differential diagnoses based on all available information, **Subclinical Coronary Atherosclerosis** emerges as the most likely diagnosis, given the significant coronary calcium score and strong family history of premature cardiovascular events. This is followed closely by **Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD)** and **Lipoprotein(a) Disorders** as key considerations. **Familial Hypercholesterolemia** is also a possibility, though traditional cholesterol levels were not mentioned.

He also had mild chronic macular edema in both eyes after remote cataract surgery and vitrectomy with membrane peel in both eyes. Two years prior, he underwent Baerveldt tube shunt in his left eye, and his IOP since surgery had been 8 to 14 mm Hg. Ophthalmic medications on presentation were timolol eye drops twice daily, brinzolamide-brimonidine eye drops 3 times daily, bimatoprost eye drops every night at bedtime, bromfenac eye drops once daily, and fluorometholone eye drops twice daily in both eyes. During his visit, the patient complained of severe physical exhaustion, syncopal episodes, dysphagia, and sinus congestion. On external examination, he had diffuse facial edema and erythema without proptosis. Slitlamp examination showed mild chemosis and hyperemia in both eyes and a patent Baerveldt tube ostium in the midanterior chamber with normal bleb morphology without a tense capsule. A 24-2 Humphrey visual field showed new glaucoma progression in the left eye (Figure 1). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Elevated IOP due to elevated episcleral venous pressure secondary to superior vena cava syndrome", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 52-year-old guy who's been dealing with some pretty serious eye issues, mainly glaucoma. His intraocular pressure is a bit high, which isn't great, and he's had some surgeries to help with that. He's also got this chronic macular edema, which is just lingering around after his cataract surgery and vitrectomy. So, he's on a bunch of eye meds to keep things in check.\n\nNow, he's coming in with some new symptoms that are a bit concerning. He's feeling really exhausted, having these fainting spells, trouble swallowing, and some sinus congestion. That's quite a mix of symptoms. And when we look at him, he's got this facial swelling and redness, but no bulging eyes, which is interesting.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. The facial swelling and these systemic symptoms make me think of something more than just his eye issues. Could it be related to his medications? He's on a lot of them, including fluorometholone, which is a corticosteroid. Corticosteroids can cause all sorts of side effects, but I'm not sure they would explain everything here.\n\nHmm, what about the glaucoma surgery he had? The Baerveldt tube shunt could be playing a role. Sometimes these devices can cause issues, like tube exposure or erosion, but his exam showed the tube was okay, so that's probably not it.\n\nLet's think about other possibilities. Could this be some kind of orbital issue, like an orbital tumor or thyroid eye disease? But wait, there's no proptosis, which usually comes with those. So, maybe not.\n\nWhat about systemic conditions? This combination of symptoms is making me think of something like superior vena cava syndrome. That would explain the facial swelling and dysphagia. But, it's usually associated with some kind of obstruction in the chest, and we don't have any info on that.\n\nOkay, let's not forget about the meds. Brimonidine is one of his medications, and it can cause systemic side effects like hypotension, which might explain the fainting. But, would it cause facial swelling? That's a stretch.\n\nLet's go back to the corticosteroids. They can cause fluid retention, but usually not this kind of facial swelling without other signs. Hmm, what if it's a combination of things? Maybe the brimonidine is contributing to his fainting spells, and something else is causing the swelling.\n\nOh, and there's the sinus congestion. Could this be related to his eye meds somehow? Maybe there's some kind of systemic absorption or reaction happening. That could tie everything together.\n\nAlright, let's put it all together. Based on everything, it seems like we might be dealing with a drug-induced issue, maybe from the brimonidine or an interaction with the corticosteroids. The sinus congestion could be a clue to some kind of systemic reaction. This would explain the facial swelling, fainting, and dysphagia. Yeah, that seems to fit best with what we're seeing.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, considering his symptoms and treatment history:\n\n1. **Superior Vena Cava Syndrome** - This condition could explain the facial swelling and dysphagia due to obstruction of venous return from the head and neck.\n\n2. **Drug-Induced Reaction** - Given the patient's medications, a systemic reaction, particularly to brimonidine or an interaction with fluorometholone, could contribute to his symptoms.\n\n3. **Orbital Tumor** - Although there's no proptosis, an orbital tumor could cause some of the symptoms if it's impacting surrounding structures.\n\n4. **Thyroid Eye Disease** - Despite the lack of proptosis, thyroid eye disease can sometimes present with periorbital swelling and erythema.\n\n5. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension** - This condition can cause papilledema, leading to increased IOP and potentially some systemic symptoms.\n\n6. **Corticosteroid-Induced Side Effects** - Fluorometholone could be causing fluid retention and contributing to the facial swelling.\n\n7. **Brinzolamide-Brimonidine-Induced Hypotension** - This medication combination might lead to systemic hypotension, explaining the syncopal episodes.\n\n8. **Carotid Cavernous Fistula** - Abnormal connections between the carotid artery and cavernous sinus could lead to venous congestion and facial swelling.\n\n9. **Chronic Sinusitis** - Sinus congestion could be related to chronic sinusitis, potentially exacerbating facial symptoms.\n\n10. **Glaucoma Medication Overuse** - The complexity of his glaucoma regimen might be contributing to systemic absorption and side effects.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnosis is **Superior Vena Cava Syndrome** due to the combination of facial swelling, dysphagia, and systemic symptoms. However, a **Drug-Induced Reaction**, particularly from brimonidine, is also a strong contender given the syncopal episodes and potential systemic effects. Further investigation into both possibilities is warranted.", "topic": "['Glaucoma', 'Hematology', 'Oncology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Radiation Oncology']"}

The patient developed a rash on the dorsal aspect of his hand half a year ago without any pain or itching discomfort and denied any history of injury or exposure to suspected pathogens prior to onset. After self-medication with topical herbal medicine, the lesions gradually spread to the forearm and fused into plaques, and ulcers often recurred on the surface. He denied any systemic symptoms and concerns. Physical examination revealed large, firm, mildly swollen erythematous plaques on the back of the left forearm with purulent discharge and crusting (Figure, A). Results of routine laboratory investigations, including complete blood cell count, biochemical profile, and chest radiography, were normal. A biopsy specimen was taken for pathological examination (Figure, B-D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cutaneous protothecosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a man in his 70s with a rash on his left forearm that's been hanging around for six months. It started on the back of his hand and then spread to his forearm. That's interesting. He says it didn't hurt or itch, and he didn't have any injury or exposure to anything funky before it showed up. Hmm, that's a bit unusual.\n\nHe tried some topical herbal medicine on his own, and instead of getting better, the rash got worse and turned into plaques with ulcers. That's a red flag for something more serious. He doesn't have any systemic symptoms, which is good, but the fact that it's spreading is concerning.\n\nWhen I look at the physical exam findings, there are these large, firm, reddish plaques that are a bit swollen and have some pus and crusting. That sounds like it could be some kind of chronic skin condition or maybe an infection. But the lab tests are all normal, which is a bit puzzling. Usually, with an infection, you'd expect some abnormal lab results.\n\nLet's think about what this could be. My first thought is discoid lupus erythematosus. It can cause those kinds of plaques, and it's chronic like this. But wait, lupus usually has some systemic signs, and his labs are normal. Plus, lupus doesn't typically crust like that.\n\nNext, I'm considering psoriasis. It can definitely cause plaques, but psoriasis usually has a different appearance, more silvery scales than crusts. And it doesn't usually start in someone's 70s without previous history.\n\nThen there's cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, like mycosis fungoides. That can cause persistent rashes and plaques too. It's rare, but it fits the age and the chronic nature. But usually, you'd expect some lymph node involvement or abnormal blood tests.\n\nInfectious causes like cutaneous tuberculosis or leprosy come to mind too. They can cause chronic skin lesions, but you'd usually see some systemic signs or abnormal tests. And the lack of response to herbal medicine makes me think it's not a simple infection.\n\nOh, and what about Bowen's disease? It's a form of squamous cell carcinoma in situ and can cause persistent plaques. It's more common in older adults and can look like this. But it usually doesn't crust like this unless it gets infected.\n\nLet's not forget about foreign body reactions. If something was lodged in the skin, it could cause a chronic reaction like this. But there's no history of trauma, so that seems unlikely.\n\nI should also think about granuloma annulare. It causes chronic plaques, but it's usually more ring-like and doesn't crust. Plus, it's not common for it to start in someone's 70s.\n\nAnd then there's sarcoidosis. It can cause skin plaques, but you'd usually see lung involvement or other systemic signs on the tests. And it doesn't typically crust.\n\nSo, after going through all of this, I'm leaning towards cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, like mycosis fungoides. It fits the age, the chronic nature, and the lack of systemic symptoms. The normal labs are a bit odd, but it's possible in early stages. Yeah, that seems like the most likely explanation.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the man's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus** - This condition can cause chronic plaques and is a common consideration for persistent rashes.\n\n2. **Psoriasis** - Although it typically has a different appearance, psoriasis can sometimes present with atypical features.\n\n3. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides)** - This is a strong consideration given the age, chronic nature, and lack of systemic symptoms.\n\n4. **Bowen's Disease** - A form of squamous cell carcinoma in situ, it can cause persistent plaques and is more common in older adults.\n\n5. **Cutaneous Tuberculosis** - This infectious cause can result in chronic skin lesions, though systemic signs are often present.\n\n6. **Leprosy** - Another infectious cause that can lead to chronic skin changes, often with nerve involvement.\n\n7. **Foreign Body Reaction** - Although unlikely without a history of trauma, it could cause a chronic skin reaction.\n\n8. **Granuloma Annulare** - Typically presents with ring-like plaques and is less common in this age group.\n\n9. **Sarcoidosis** - Usually involves systemic symptoms and lung involvement, but can present with skin plaques.\n\n10. **Chronic Dermatitis** - Could be a reaction to the herbal remedies, leading to a spreading rash.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides)** emerges as the most likely diagnosis due to the chronic nature of the rash, the patient's age, and the lack of systemic symptoms or abnormal lab findings.

Intraoral examination revealed multiple yellowish to erythematous papules and verrucous cobblestone-like plaques on the mucosal surface on both sides of his tongue (Figure, A and B). The skin of the face, neck, arms, and other sun-exposed areas did not reveal any associated lesions. He reported occasional alcohol intake, and there was no history of tobacco-related habits or oral trauma. The results of laboratory investigations, including a complete blood cell count, serum chemistry panel, liver and kidney function test, C-reactive protein levels, lipid profile, and serum and urine electrophoresis disclosed no abnormalities. With the clinical suspicion of squamous cell carcinoma, an incisional biopsy was performed (Figure, C and D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Nodular colloid degeneration", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an elderly man with some unusual lesions on his tongue. They're yellowish to reddish and kind of bumpy. That's interesting. He's had these for a few months, and they're not causing him any pain. That's a bit odd, isn't it? Usually, if something's wrong, it tends to hurt or feel uncomfortable. \n\nNow, let's see. He's had gastric adenocarcinoma before, which is a pretty serious thing. That was treated with a total gastrectomy. Hmm, that might be important. People who have had cancer before can be at higher risk for more cancers. That's something to keep in mind. \n\nHe doesn't smoke or use tobacco, and he only drinks alcohol occasionally. That's good because tobacco is a big risk factor for oral cancers. But, he's still got these strange lesions. \n\nThe rest of his skin looks fine, no lesions there. That's a bit of a relief, but it also means whatever this is might be specific to the mouth. \n\nOkay, let's think about what this could be. Squamous cell carcinoma is a possibility. It's a common oral cancer, and it can look like this. But, we should consider other things too. \n\nMaybe it's oral lichen planus? That can cause lesions in the mouth, but they're usually more widespread and not just on the tongue. Plus, they often come with other symptoms. \n\nWhat about candidiasis? That's a fungal infection, and it can cause white lesions, but these are yellowish to reddish. So, probably not that. \n\nLeukoplakia could be another option. It's a precancerous condition, and it can look like white patches, but these lesions are more colorful. \n\nLet's not forget about verrucous carcinoma. It's a type of cancer that looks like these cobblestone plaques. It's less aggressive than squamous cell carcinoma but still something to consider. \n\nOh, and there's the possibility of a benign condition like a papilloma. Those are usually solitary and not multiple like this. \n\nNow, considering his history of gastric cancer, we should think about the possibility of a second primary cancer. That's not uncommon in people who have had cancer before. \n\nHmm, what about lymphoma? That can show up in the mouth, but it usually comes with other symptoms like swelling or pain. \n\nLet's see, we've got a few possibilities here. Squamous cell carcinoma, verrucous carcinoma, oral lichen planus, candidiasis, leukoplakia, papilloma, and lymphoma. \n\nWait, let's not forget about necrotizing sialometaplasia. That's a condition that can mimic cancer but is actually benign. It's worth considering. \n\nSo, after thinking it all through, I'd say the top possibilities are squamous cell carcinoma and verrucous carcinoma. They both fit the description, and given his history, they're plausible. \n\nBut, we should keep necrotizing sialometaplasia in mind too. It's a sneaky one that can look like cancer but isn't. \n\nAlright, I think that covers it. We've got our top suspects, and we can move forward from here.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the lesions on the man's tongue, considering his medical history and the characteristics of the lesions:\n\n1. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - Given the patient's history of gastric adenocarcinoma and the appearance of the lesions, this is a strong consideration.\n\n2. **Verrucous Carcinoma** - The cobblestone-like plaques are characteristic of this type of well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.\n\n3. **Oral Lichen Planus** - Although it typically presents with more widespread lesions, it's a possibility due to the chronic nature of the lesions.\n\n4. **Leukoplakia** - A precancerous condition that can appear as white patches, but the color variation here makes it less likely.\n\n5. **Candidiasis** - Unlikely due to the color and chronicity of the lesions, as candidiasis usually presents with white lesions.\n\n6. **Papilloma** - Typically solitary, so less likely given the multiple lesions.\n\n7. **Lymphoma** - Can present in the oral cavity, but usually with accompanying symptoms like swelling or pain.\n\n8. **Necrotizing Sialometaplasia** - A benign condition that can mimic malignant lesions, worth considering due to its deceptive appearance.\n\n9. **Erythroplakia** - A red patch in the mouth that can be dysplastic or malignant, could fit the erythematous component of the lesions.\n\n10. **Chronic Hyperplastic Candidiasis** - Associated with persistent candidal infection, but the color and history don't strongly support this.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** and **Verrucous Carcinoma**, given the patient's history and lesion characteristics. **Necrotizing Sialometaplasia** is also an important consideration due to its potential to mimic malignancy.

His initial electrocardiogram (ECG) is shown in Figure 1. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Wellens syndrome type A", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 46-year-old guy who came to the ER after having chest pain and sweating for about 20 minutes. It happened while he was just resting, and it went away on its own. That's interesting. He had a similar episode a couple of days ago too. He's a pretty heavy smoker, 30 cigarettes a day, and he's been smoking for a long time, 20 pack-years. That's definitely something to consider. He's not on any medications, and there's no family history of heart disease. When he got to the ER, he was feeling fine. His blood pressure and heart rate were normal, and his oxygen levels were good. The physical exam didn't show anything unusual. \n\nNow, let's look at the lab results. His troponin T is a bit high, 16 ng/mL, when it should be under 14 ng/mL. That's a red flag for some kind of heart muscle damage. Creatine kinase and CK-MB are within normal ranges, which is good, but that elevated troponin is still concerning. His cholesterol levels are mostly okay, with LDL at 106 mg/dL, which isn't too bad, and HDL at 38 mg/dL, which is just at the lower end of normal. \n\nSo, what could be going on here? The chest pain and elevated troponin make me think of acute coronary syndrome, like unstable angina or a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, NSTEMI. Those are serious possibilities. But wait, let's not jump to conclusions. There are other things that could cause chest pain and troponin elevation, like a pulmonary embolism. That's when a blood clot travels to the lungs, and it can cause chest pain and stress to the heart. \n\nThere's also myocarditis, which is inflammation of the heart muscle, often from a viral infection. It can cause chest pain and troponin elevation too. And what about aortic dissection? That's when the layers of the aorta tear, causing severe chest pain. It's less likely here, but it's something to keep in mind. \n\nLet's not forget about gastroesophageal issues like esophageal spasm or reflux. They can cause chest pain that feels like a heart problem, but they wouldn't usually cause troponin to rise. \n\nNow, looking at the ECG, it might show some changes that could help us figure this out. If there are ST-segment changes or arrhythmias, that could point to a heart attack or other heart issues. \n\nSo, where does that leave us? Based on everything, unstable angina or NSTEMI seems like the most likely explanation. The chest pain, troponin elevation, and smoking history all point in that direction. But we can't completely rule out things like pulmonary embolism or myocarditis without more information. \n\nLet's keep an open mind and consider all the possibilities. Maybe more tests, like another ECG or some imaging, could help clarify things. It's a complex situation, but focusing on the most likely causes while keeping other options in mind seems like the best approach.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with a focus on the most likely causes and consideration of other possibilities:\n\n1. **Unstable Angina** - Given the patient's chest pain, elevated troponin, and significant smoking history, unstable angina is a strong consideration.\n\n2. **Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)** - The elevated troponin and history of chest pain at rest align with NSTEMI, making it a likely possibility.\n\n3. **Pulmonary Embolism** - Although less likely, pulmonary embolism can cause chest pain and elevated troponin, especially if there is unexplained hypoxia or other suggestive symptoms.\n\n4. **Myocarditis** - This inflammation of the heart muscle can cause chest pain and troponin elevation, often following a viral infection.\n\n5. **Aortic Dissection** - While less likely given the lack of severe or radiating pain, aortic dissection is a critical condition that should be considered.\n\n6. **Esophageal Spasm** - This can cause chest pain similar to cardiac pain but typically does not result in troponin elevation.\n\n7. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)** - Like esophageal spasm, GERD can cause chest pain but is unlikely to elevate troponin.\n\n8. **Stress Cardiomyopathy** - Also known as \"broken heart syndrome,\" this can mimic a heart attack with chest pain and troponin elevation, often triggered by emotional stress.\n\n9. **Coronary Vasospasm** - This involves spasms of the coronary arteries, which can cause chest pain and troponin elevation, especially in smokers.\n\n10. **Musculoskeletal Pain** - While less likely to cause troponin elevation, musculoskeletal issues can cause chest pain and should be considered if other causes are ruled out.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are unstable angina and NSTEMI, given the combination of chest pain, elevated troponin, and significant smoking history. Pulmonary embolism and myocarditis are also important to consider, as they can present with similar symptoms.

Review of systems was negative for any recent changes in health, weight loss, fever, or night sweats. Visual acuity without correction was 20/20 OD and 20/25+ OS. Intraocular pressures were normal. Slitlamp examination of the right eye was unremarkable, and the left eye had a raised pigmented iris lesion without prominent internal vasculature and with mammillations on the surface (multiple small smooth dome-shaped protuberances on the surface of the tumor). There were large pigment granules on the surface of the tumor and on the adjacent iris surrounding the mass (Figure 1A). There was no ectropion uvea or iris neovascularization. There were mild nuclear sclerotic changes across the lens in the left eye. Ultrasound biomicroscopy showed a homogeneous intrinsic iris solid tumor with a height of 1.4 mm and basal diameter of 4.1 mm, without angle or ciliary body involvement (Figure 1B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Iris melanocytoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a patient in their mid-60s with a pigmented lesion on the left iris. It's been there for a long time, and it hasn't changed in size for years. That's a good sign, right? Usually, if something is growing or changing quickly, it's more concerning. So, maybe it's benign.\n\nFirst, let's consider what's common. A nevus is a usual suspect for a stable, pigmented iris lesion. They're pretty common and usually don't cause problems. So, that's my first thought.\n\nBut wait, there's more to consider. The lesion has these mammillations on the surface. That's interesting. Mammillations can be seen in certain types of melanocytic tumors. So, I should think about melanoma, but the fact that it's been stable for so long makes me hesitate. Melanomas are usually more aggressive, so maybe it's not that.\n\nLet's not forget about freckles. Iris freckles are another benign option. They're flat and stable, but this lesion is raised. Hmm, probably not a freckle then.\n\nWhat about an iris cyst? Cysts can be pigmented, but they tend to have a different appearance on ultrasound. This one is solid, so I'm not convinced it's a cyst.\n\nNow, let's think about less common things. Could it be a metastatic tumor? Those usually have a different appearance and grow quickly. This one hasn't changed, so that's unlikely.\n\nOh, and there's leiomyoma. It's a rare tumor, but it can appear as a well-defined mass like this one. It's worth considering, but it's not very common.\n\nThen there's the idea of a vascular tumor like a hemangioma. But there's no prominent vasculature here, so that's probably not it.\n\nLet's not forget about inflammatory conditions. Something like Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis could cause iris changes, but this lesion is solid and has been stable. That doesn't quite fit.\n\nOkay, so what about a neurofibroma? That's rare for the iris, but it could present as a solid mass. It's a possibility, but I'd expect other signs of neurofibromatosis.\n\nFinally, let's think about an adenoma. Specifically, an adenoma of the iris pigment epithelium. These can be pigmented and have a smooth surface. That sounds like what we're seeing here.\n\nSo, after going through all of this, I think the most likely diagnosis is an adenoma of the iris pigment epithelium. It fits the description and the behavior of the lesion. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the pigmented iris lesion, with each step presenting a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Nevus** - A common benign pigmented lesion that is stable over time.\n2. **Melanoma** - Although less likely due to the stable nature, it's important to consider given the mammillations.\n3. **Iris Freckle** - Typically flat and stable, but this lesion is raised.\n4. **Iris Cyst** - Usually has a different ultrasound appearance, tending to be less solid.\n5. **Metastatic Tumor** - Unlikely due to the lack of rapid growth or change.\n6. **Leiomyoma** - A rare, well-defined tumor that could match the lesion's appearance.\n7. **Hemangioma** - Unlikely due to the absence of prominent vasculature.\n8. **Fuchs' Heterochromic Iridocyclitis** - Inflammatory changes usually present differently.\n9. **Neurofibroma** - Rare for the iris, but could present as a solid mass.\n10. **Adenoma of the Iris Pigment Epithelium** - Fits the description of a pigmented, smooth-surfaced lesion.\n\nAfter considering all the possibilities and the stable nature of the lesion, the most likely diagnosis is an **Adenoma of the Iris Pigment Epithelium**. This diagnosis aligns well with the lesion's characteristics and behavior.", "topic": "['Intraocular Tumors', 'Ophthalmology']"}

He denied systemic complaints such as weakness, fever, night sweats, or weight loss. Oral glucocorticoids did not show any therapeutic effect. His medical history was remarkable for mild anemia because of untreated hemorrhoids. Physical examination revealed numerous symmetrically distributed, well-defined, erythematous skin nodules on his back, buttocks, and limb extensors (Figure, A). Prominent lymphadenopathies on bilateral cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes were noted, with the largest lymph node measuring approximately 5 × 2 cm. Laboratory tests were significant for atypical lymphocytes in the peripheral blood (count up to 6%), an elevated CD4+/CD8+ lymphocyte ratio (9.21; normal range, 0.7-3.1), moderate anemia (hemoglobin level, 8.7 g/dL; normal range, 11.5-15.0 g/dL [to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0]), a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (35 mm/h; normal range, 0-25 mm/h), and cryoglobulins composed of mixed polyclonal immunoglobulins. The platelet count (161 × 103/μL; normal range, 125-350 × 103/μL [to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 1.0]) and lactate dehydrogenase (217 U/L; normal range, 100-240 U/L [to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167]) were normal. Quantification of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA showed high loads of virus in the peripheral blood (846 copies/mL in serum, 27 700 copies/mL in lymphocytes; normal range, <500 copies/mL). A biopsy specimen from a skin nodule was sent for histopathologic examination (Figure, B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cutaneous angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 61-year-old man with these itchy, rapidly growing skin nodules. That's interesting. He's also got lymphadenopathy, which is a bit concerning. And he's been dealing with this for about three months. Hmm, no systemic symptoms like fever or weight loss, which is good. But the fact that glucocorticoids didn't work is a red flag. That makes me think it's not your run-of-the-mill skin condition.\n\nOkay, let's look at the lab results. There are atypical lymphocytes in his blood, and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio is really high. That's unusual. He's also got moderate anemia and a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Cryoglobulins are present too, which can indicate some immune complex activity. And wow, the EBV DNA levels are through the roof. That's a big clue.\n\nNow, what could this be? My first thought is some kind of lymphoproliferative disorder. The atypical lymphocytes and high CD4+/CD8+ ratio are pointing me in that direction. Maybe something like T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia? That could fit.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. The high EBV DNA loads are really striking. That makes me think of EBV-associated conditions. Could it be something like hydroa vacciniforme or a natural killer/T-cell lymphoma? Those are possibilities.\n\nThe skin nodules and lymphadenopathy are also making me consider other conditions. What about adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma? That's associated with HTLV-1, but the EBV presence is throwing me off a bit.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about the cryoglobulins. Those could suggest a lymphoproliferative disorder or even something autoimmune. Maybe we're looking at something like lymphomatoid papulosis?\n\nI should also think about other conditions that could cause these symptoms. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, like mycosis fungoides, is a possibility. And what about angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma? That can present with similar features.\n\nNow, let's re-evaluate everything. The high EBV DNA is a big deal, and the lack of response to glucocorticoids is important. I'm leaning towards a lymphoproliferative disorder, maybe angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. But I can't shake off the idea of a natural killer/T-cell lymphoma given the EBV association.\n\nAfter going through all the information again, I think angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma is the most likely diagnosis. It fits with the lymphadenopathy, skin nodules, and high EBV DNA. But I'm going to keep natural killer/T-cell lymphoma on my radar too, just in case.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia** - This condition is considered due to the presence of atypical lymphocytes and a high CD4+/CD8+ ratio.\n\n2. **Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma** - The lymphadenopathy, skin nodules, and elevated EBV DNA levels align with this diagnosis.\n\n3. **Natural killer/T-cell lymphoma** - The high EBV DNA loads are a strong indicator for this type of lymphoma.\n\n4. **Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma** - Although typically associated with HTLV-1, the skin nodules and lymphadenopathy could suggest this condition.\n\n5. **Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides)** - The skin manifestations and atypical lymphocytes make this a possible diagnosis.\n\n6. **Lymphomatoid papulosis** - The presence of cryoglobulins and skin nodules could point towards this condition.\n\n7. **Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma** - Although less likely, the lymphadenopathy and systemic involvement warrant consideration.\n\n8. **Primary effusion lymphoma** - The high EBV DNA and lymphadenopathy could suggest this rare lymphoma type.\n\n9. **Peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified** - This is a broader category that could encompass the patient's symptoms.\n\n10. **EBV-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis** - The high EBV DNA and systemic symptoms might also indicate this condition.\n\nAfter re-evaluating all the information, **Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma** emerges as the most likely diagnosis, given the combination of lymphadenopathy, skin nodules, and elevated EBV DNA levels. However, **Natural killer/T-cell lymphoma** remains a strong contender due to the significant EBV association.

Five months after surgery, he presented to the otolaryngology clinic with 3 weeks of mild odynophagia and dysphagia. It was noted that the patient had a prominent posterior pharyngeal wall, subtle asymmetry of vocal fold motion, and pooling of secretions in the left pyriform (Video 1). During the next 6 months, he gradually developed shortness of breath and stridor, and eventually presented to the emergency department in respiratory distress requiring intubation for 2 days. Shortly after extubation, laryngeal examination showed fullness of the posterior pharyngeal wall and severely limited vocal fold abduction bilaterally (Figure 1A; Video 1). A modified barium swallow study showed intermittent laryngeal penetration without aspiration (Video 2). Although the patient was unable to tolerate magnetic resonance imaging, a soft tissue computed tomography scan of the neck with contrast revealed a well-positioned plate with no evidence of fluid collection in the setting of a normal leukocyte count. One month later, a neuromuscular specialist investigated potential underlying neurological causes; however, results of nerve conduction, antiacetylcholine receptor, antimuscle-specific kinase, methylmalonic acid, HIV, rapid plasma reagin, vitamin B-12, thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroxine, copper, creatine kinase, and immunofixation studies were all unremarkable. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Delayed iatrogenic bilateral vocal fold paralysis (BVFP)", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 68-year-old man who's had some pretty serious neck surgery not too long ago. He's now having trouble swallowing and some pain with it, plus his voice seems off. That's definitely something to pay attention to. \n\nFirst off, given his recent surgery, I'm thinking about the possibility of a hematoma. It's not uncommon for bleeding to happen after surgery, and it could be pressing on his airway or vocal cords, causing these symptoms. \n\nBut wait, they did a CT scan and didn't find any fluid collection. That makes a hematoma less likely, but I shouldn't completely rule it out yet. Maybe it's just not big enough to show up or it's kind of resolved by now. \n\nNow, let's think about infections. He's had surgery, so there's always a risk of infection. An abscess could cause similar symptoms, but again, the CT didn't show anything, and his white blood cell count is normal. That makes an abscess less likely too. \n\nWhat about neurological issues? The surgery could have affected a nerve, like the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which controls the vocal cords. That could explain the vocal cord problems and swallowing issues. \n\nBut then, all those neurological tests came back normal. That's a bit puzzling. Maybe it's a nerve issue that the tests just didn't pick up, or maybe it's something more subtle. \n\nNow, let's not forget about his history of atrial fibrillation. That could lead to embolic events, which might cause something like a brainstem stroke. That could definitely affect his swallowing and vocal cord function. \n\nBut, there's no clear sign of a stroke on the CT, and his other symptoms don't fully match a typical stroke. So, I'm not sure about that. \n\nCould it be something related to his thyroid? Thyroid problems can cause compression of the esophagus or trachea. But his thyroid function tests were normal, so that's probably not it. \n\nWhat about a tumor? It's possible that there's a mass pressing on his airway, but the CT didn't show anything obvious. Maybe it's a small or subtle lesion that was missed. \n\nAnd then there's the possibility of a laryngeal fracture from intubation. That could definitely cause vocal cord paralysis. But, there's no mention of any trauma during intubation, so it's a bit of a stretch. \n\nFinally, let's consider a cricoarytenoid joint issue. That could cause problems with vocal cord movement. It's not something that would show up on a CT, and it fits with his symptoms. \n\nSo, after thinking through all of this, I'm leaning towards a cricoarytenoid joint problem. It makes sense with what we're seeing, and it's something that might not have been picked up in the tests they've done so far.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's symptoms, with a focus on the most likely causes given the recent cervical spine surgery and subsequent symptoms:\n\n1. **Hematoma**: Post-surgical bleeding could lead to airway compression or vocal cord paralysis.\n2. **Abscess**: An infection post-surgery could cause similar symptoms, but the normal white blood cell count and CT findings make this less likely.\n3. **Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Injury**: Surgical trauma could affect the nerves controlling the vocal cords, leading to swallowing and voice issues.\n4. **Brainstem Stroke**: Given the patient's atrial fibrillation, an embolic event could cause neurological deficits affecting swallowing and vocal cord function.\n5. **Thyroid Compression**: Although thyroid function tests were normal, anatomical changes could still cause compression symptoms.\n6. **Tumor or Mass**: A mass not evident on the CT could be pressing on the airway or esophagus.\n7. **Laryngeal Fracture from Intubation**: Trauma during intubation could lead to vocal cord paralysis, though there's no mention of intubation difficulty.\n8. **Cricoarytenoid Joint Dysfunction**: This could cause vocal cord movement issues and fits the symptoms without clear evidence on CT.\n9. **Neuromuscular Disorder**: Despite normal tests, a subtle neuromuscular issue could be affecting vocal cord function.\n10. **Esophageal Motility Disorder**: This could contribute to swallowing difficulties, especially post-surgery.\n\nReranking these based on the patient's symptoms and test results, the top three most likely diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Injury**: This is highly plausible given the surgical history and persistent vocal cord issues.\n2. **Cricoarytenoid Joint Dysfunction**: This fits the symptoms of limited vocal cord movement without clear CT evidence.\n3. **Neuromuscular Disorder**: Despite normal tests, a subtle disorder could be causing the vocal cord and swallowing problems.\n\nThese three options best explain the combination of symptoms and the lack of significant findings on imaging and neurological tests.", "topic": "['Laryngology', 'Neurosurgery', 'Otolaryngology', 'Health Care Safety', 'Surgery']"}

In April 2018, axillary lymphadenectomy was performed for local recurrence and the patient started treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) pembrolizumab, without further local or metastatic evidence of the tumor. Ocular history was positive for cataract surgery bilaterally. After cataract surgery in the right eye, an asymptomatic vision loss was noted and the cause was attributed to the presence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), for which the patient underwent intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections. Examination showed a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/60 OD and 20/20 OS, unremarkable anterior segment findings, and intraocular pressures of 12 mm Hg OU. A fundus examination in the right eye revealed scarce pigmented cells in the anterior vitreous, a dark-pigmented epiretinal membrane, and an area of retinal hyperpigmentation in the inferior temporal arcade corresponding to the CNV (Figure 1). Optical coherence tomography imaging revealed a hyperreflective structure on the surface of the inner retina with increased macular thickness, compatible with the described epiretinal membrane (Figure 1). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cutaneous melanoma metastatic to the vitreous cavity and deposition of melanoma cells over the epiretinal membrane", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 75-year-old woman who's having trouble seeing and experiencing metamorphopsia in her right eye. She's got a history of melanoma, and that's a big clue. Melanoma can spread, so I'm immediately thinking about the possibility of metastatic disease. Could this be a metastatic tumor in the eye? That's my first thought.\n\nBut wait, there's more to consider. She's had cataract surgery, and after that, she developed some vision issues. They found choroidal neovascularization and treated it with anti-VEGF injections. That's a known complication post-surgery, so maybe this is related to the CNV. Could it be that the CNV is causing these symptoms? That's another possibility.\n\nNow, let's talk about the pigmented epiretinal membrane. It's not every day you see that. Given her history of melanoma, I'm thinking this could be related. Could it be a melanoma-associated retinopathy? That's a rare condition, but it fits with her history.\n\nOh, and she's on pembrolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor. These drugs can cause all sorts of immune-related side effects. Could this be an immune-related reaction causing the epiretinal membrane? That's something to consider.\n\nBut let's not forget about other possibilities. What about a primary vitreoretinal lymphoma? That's a rare condition, but it can cause similar symptoms. It's worth keeping in the back of my mind.\n\nNow, let's think about the imaging. The OCT shows a hyperreflective structure on the retina. That's consistent with an epiretinal membrane, but it could also be something else. Could it be a sign of a retinal pigment epithelium tear? Those can happen with CNV.\n\nAnd what about a central serous chorioretinopathy? That's another condition that can cause serous retinal detachment and vision changes. It's a long shot, but it's possible.\n\nLet's not forget about the role of the melanoma itself. Could this be a direct infiltration of the retina by melanoma cells? That would explain the pigmented cells in the vitreous.\n\nAlso, there's the possibility of a melanocytoma. That's a benign tumor, but it can cause pigmented lesions in the eye. It's less likely given her history, but it's worth considering.\n\nFinally, let's think about the treatment she's on. Pembrolizumab can cause uveitis as a side effect. Could this be a case of uveitis causing the symptoms? It's possible, given her treatment history.\n\nSo, putting it all together, my top differential diagnoses are: metastatic tumor, melanoma-associated retinopathy, immune-related reaction, primary vitreoretinal lymphoma, retinal pigment epithelium tear, central serous chorioretinopathy, direct melanoma infiltration, melanocytoma, and uveitis. Each of these has some merit based on her history and symptoms.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 75-year-old woman with decreased visual acuity and metamorphopsia in the right eye, along with her history of melanoma:\n\n1. **Metastatic Tumor**: Given her history of melanoma, the possibility of a metastatic tumor in the eye is a strong consideration.\n\n2. **Melanoma-Associated Retinopathy**: This rare condition is associated with melanoma and could explain the visual disturbances and pigmented epiretinal membrane.\n\n3. **Immune-Related Reaction**: Pembrolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, can cause various immune-related side effects, including ocular reactions that might lead to the development of an epiretinal membrane.\n\n4. **Primary Vitreoretinal Lymphoma**: Although rare, this condition can present with similar symptoms and should be considered in the differential diagnosis.\n\n5. **Retinal Pigment Epithelium Tear**: This could be related to the choroidal neovascularization and might explain some of the findings on the OCT.\n\n6. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy**: This condition can cause serous retinal detachment and vision changes, although it is less directly related to her melanoma history.\n\n7. **Direct Melanoma Infiltration**: The presence of pigmented cells in the vitreous raises the possibility of direct infiltration of the retina by melanoma cells.\n\n8. **Melanocytoma**: A benign tumor that can cause pigmented lesions in the eye, although it is less likely given her history of melanoma.\n\n9. **Uveitis**: Pembrolizumab can cause uveitis as a side effect, which might contribute to her symptoms.\n\n10. **Choroidal Neovascularization**: Although already diagnosed and treated, ongoing activity could still be contributing to her visual changes.\n\nThese differential diagnoses take into account her history of melanoma, treatment with pembrolizumab, and the ocular findings, including the pigmented epiretinal membrane and choroidal neovascularization.

At the height of severity, the patient had 39 lesions, some of which were associated with ulceration and bleeding. The patient was born at full term via spontaneous vaginal delivery; the birth mother had not received prenatal care. Neither the birth mother nor the infant had any known history of environmental or occupational exposure to hazardous substances.

Physical examination revealed numerous bright red macules, papules, and plaques ranging in size from 1.0 × 1.0 mm to 2.2 × 2.3 cm, many of which had hemorrhagic crust and dark scale (Figure, A and B). Additional examination findings included retrognathia, thickened maxillary frenulum, and anterior ankyloglossia. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Congenital disseminated pyogenic granuloma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 3-month-old baby with a bunch of red papules all over his body. They've been there since birth and are growing in number and size. That's pretty unusual. Hmm, some of these papules are even bleeding and have ulcers. That's definitely something to pay attention to.\n\nFirst, let's think about what could cause red papules in a newborn. One possibility that comes to mind is infantile hemangiomas. They're pretty common and can be there at birth or show up soon after. They're usually red and can grow rapidly, so that seems to fit.\n\nBut wait, there are 39 lesions! That's a lot. Infantile hemangiomas can be multiple, but this many is a bit unusual. Let's keep that in mind and think about other possibilities.\n\nAnother condition that could cause multiple red papules is congenital rubella syndrome. It can cause a variety of skin issues, including papules, and there's often a history of maternal infection. But, the mother didn't have prenatal care, so we don't know if she had rubella. This could still be a possibility.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about congenital CMV infection. It can cause skin lesions too, and it's something to consider when there are multiple papules present at birth.\n\nNow, what about the baby's other symptoms? There's retrognathia, a thickened maxillary frenulum, and anterior ankyloglossia. These are oral and facial anomalies. Could they be related to the skin findings?\n\nThese anomalies make me think of certain syndromes. Maybe something like Apert syndrome or another craniofacial disorder. But, those usually have other features like limb abnormalities, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nLet's go back to the skin lesions. 39 of them is a lot, and they're bleeding. That's not typical for infantile hemangiomas. Could it be something more serious, like a vascular tumor?\n\nMaybe a condition like congenital Kaposi's sarcoma? That's rare, but it could fit the widespread nature and bleeding of the lesions.\n\nBut wait, congenital Kaposi's sarcoma is often associated with HIV, and there's no mention of that here. So, maybe that's not it.\n\nLet's think about other vascular conditions. How about congenital hemangiomas? They can be present at birth and grow, but they usually don't bleed this much.\n\nOh, and there's also the possibility of a neonatal melanoma. That's extremely rare, but it could explain the bleeding and number of lesions.\n\nNow, let's not forget about the mother's lack of prenatal care. That could mean exposure to something during pregnancy that we don't know about. Maybe an infection like varicella?\n\nCongenital varicella syndrome can cause skin scarring and other anomalies. The mother might have had an infection without knowing it. This could explain the skin findings and maybe even the oral anomalies.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think congenital varicella syndrome is a strong possibility. It fits the skin lesions, the bleeding, and the anomalies. Plus, it explains the lack of prenatal care and potential maternal infection.\n\nYeah, that seems to make the most sense given everything we know.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 3-month-old boy with multiple cutaneous red papules:\n\n1. **Infantile Hemangiomas** - Common vascular tumors in infants that can be present at birth and grow rapidly.\n2. **Congenital Rubella Syndrome** - Can cause skin lesions and other systemic issues due to maternal rubella infection during pregnancy.\n3. **Congenital CMV Infection** - A common congenital infection that can cause skin lesions, among other symptoms.\n4. **Congenital Kaposi's Sarcoma** - A rare vascular tumor associated with HIV, which could explain the widespread and bleeding nature of the lesions.\n5. **Congenital Varicella Syndrome** - Results from maternal varicella infection during pregnancy and can cause skin scarring and other anomalies.\n6. **Neonatal Melanoma** - Although extremely rare, it could explain the bleeding and numerous lesions.\n7. **Congenital Hemangiomas** - Unlike infantile hemangiomas, these are present at birth and usually do not grow.\n8. **Tufted Angioma** - A rare vascular tumor that can present as multiple red papules.\n9. **Glomuvenous Malformation** - A type of vascular malformation that can appear as red papules.\n10. **Erythema Toxicum Neonatorum** - A common and benign condition in newborns, but usually resolves quickly without bleeding.\n\nAfter considering all the information, including the number of lesions, bleeding, and oral anomalies, **Congenital Varicella Syndrome** emerges as a strong possibility.

Laboratory workup was positive for elevated antinuclear antibodies and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and was consequently referred to our institution. On presentation, the patient had only minimal dysphonia. She underwent a transnasal flexible laryngoscopy that demonstrated a severely edematous epiglottis, posterior pharyngeal wall, aryepiglottic folds, and arytenoids (Figure, A). The vocal folds were difficult to visualize but seemed normal in appearance and mobility. Stroboscopy could not be performed because of obstruction from the prolapsing arytenoids. Interestingly, the patient denied any shortness of breath. Results of laboratory testing revealed normal levels of all components of a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and angiotensin-converting enzyme. The patient’s erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated to 75 mm/h (reference range, 0-15 mm/h). Findings of chest radiography were normal. An esophagram showed no evidence of reflux esophagitis and a computed tomography of the neck showed edema of the supraglottis with some edema in the posterior hypopharyngeal wall. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Laryngeal sarcoidosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 28-year-old woman who's been having trouble with her voice and some pain when swallowing for over a year. That's quite a while to be dealing with these issues. She's also feeling like there's something stuck in her throat and has a bit of trouble swallowing solid foods. Hmm, that's interesting. She was treated for chronic laryngitis before, but it didn't help. That makes me think it's not your run-of-the-mill inflammation or infection.\n\nNow, let's look at her lab results. Her antinuclear antibodies are elevated, and she's got a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Those are markers that often point to some kind of autoimmune issue. So, I'm thinking we might be dealing with something like that here.\n\nThe laryngoscopy showed a lot of swelling in her epiglottis and around her larynx, but her vocal cords looked normal. That's a bit unusual because if it were a vocal cord problem, we'd expect to see some changes there. So, the issue seems to be more in the supraglottic area.\n\nLet's consider some possibilities. With her symptoms and lab results, autoimmune disorders are definitely on the table. Sarcoidosis comes to mind because it can cause swelling in the larynx and is associated with elevated inflammatory markers. But wait, her ACE levels are normal, which is usually not the case in sarcoidosis. So, maybe that's not it.\n\nWhat about lupus? It's an autoimmune disease that can affect various parts of the body, including the larynx, and could explain her symptoms. But, lupus often has other systemic symptoms, and she doesn't seem to have those. Hmm, maybe it's not lupus either.\n\nRelapsing polychondritis is another possibility. It's a condition where the body's cartilage is attacked, and it can definitely affect the larynx. The swelling we saw could be due to chondritis, which fits with her symptoms. Plus, it would explain the elevated ESR. This is starting to sound more likely.\n\nBut let's not jump to conclusions. We should also think about other conditions like Wegener's granulomatosis, which can cause laryngeal swelling and has systemic implications. However, it often involves the kidneys or lungs, and her tests didn't show anything like that. So, maybe it's not that either.\n\nOh, and there's Hashimoto's thyroiditis. It's an autoimmune condition, but it mainly affects the thyroid. She doesn't have any thyroid symptoms, and her thyroid function tests are normal, so that's probably not it.\n\nWhat about celiac disease? It's an autoimmune disorder that can cause all sorts of symptoms, including dysphagia. But, it usually involves the gut more than the larynx, and she doesn't have gastrointestinal symptoms. So, that's unlikely.\n\nWe should also consider infections like tuberculosis. It can cause laryngeal swelling and has systemic effects, but she doesn't have any respiratory symptoms or abnormalities on her chest X-ray. So, that's probably not it.\n\nAnd then there's amyloidosis, which can deposit protein in various tissues, including the larynx, causing swelling. But, it often has other systemic signs, and she doesn't seem to have those. So, that's probably not it either.\n\nAfter thinking through all of this, relapsing polychondritis seems like the most likely diagnosis. It fits with her symptoms, the laryngoscopy findings, and the elevated ESR. Plus, it explains the lack of response to previous treatments. Yeah, that makes the most sense.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnoses for the patient's condition are as follows:\n\n1. **Relapsing Polychondritis** - This condition involves inflammation of cartilage and could explain the laryngeal swelling and elevated ESR.\n2. **Sarcoidosis** - Although the normal ACE levels are atypical, sarcoidosis can cause laryngeal involvement and elevated inflammatory markers.\n3. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)** - This condition can cause laryngeal swelling but often involves the kidneys or lungs, which were not indicated in her test results.\n4. **Lupus (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus)** - An autoimmune disease that can affect the larynx, but typically presents with other systemic symptoms.\n5. **Hashimoto's Thyroiditis** - Primarily affects the thyroid, and the patient's normal thyroid function tests make this less likely.\n6. **Celiac Disease** - An autoimmune disorder that can cause various symptoms, but it mainly affects the gut and is unlikely to present with laryngeal swelling.\n7. **Tuberculosis** - Can cause laryngeal involvement, but the lack of respiratory symptoms and normal chest X-ray make this less likely.\n8. **Amyloidosis** - Involves protein deposition in tissues, which can cause swelling, but often has other systemic manifestations.\n9. **Chronic Laryngitis** - Previously diagnosed, but the lack of response to treatment suggests a different condition.\n10. **Laryngeal Carcinoma** - Although unlikely given the symptoms and findings, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis.\n\nAfter considering all the information, relapsing polychondritis emerges as the most likely diagnosis due to the combination of symptoms, laryngoscopy findings, and elevated ESR, along with the lack of response to previous treatments.", "topic": "['Laryngology', 'Otolaryngology']"}

On review of history, maxillofacial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without contrast done 5 months prior to presentation showed a 5.9 × 5.3 × 3.7-cm mass centered at the right temple that tracked along the right lateral orbital wall as well as an enhancing right intraparotid lymph node. The patient was lost to follow-up and re-presented 5 months later with an enlarged crusting and ulcerating lesion of the right temple/brow (Figure 1A). On ocular examination, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/100 OD and 20/125 OS due to cataracts, pupils reacted normally without afferent pupillary defect, and ocular motility was full. He had mild proptosis in the right eye and right lower eyelid retraction. Orbicularis strength was intact and symmetric in both eyes. MRI of the orbits, face, and neck with and without contrast showed a 6.1 × 5.7 × 4.0-cm mass with erosion through the right sphenoid wing, involvement of the lacrimal gland, and abutment of the lateral rectus (Figure 1B). In discussing treatment strategies for the orbital component of the disease, the patient was strongly against an orbital exenteration. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Stage T3N1M0 recurrent cutaneous SCC of the face", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 72-year-old homeless man with a history of squamous cell carcinoma on his right temple and brow. It's come back, and it's not looking good. The MRI from a while back showed a pretty big mass, about 5.9 by 5.3 by 3.7 cm, and it's creeping along the right lateral orbital wall. There's also an enhancing lymph node in the right intraparotid area. He lost touch with his care team for a bit and now it's worse. The lesion is bigger and nastier, and he's got some proptosis and eyelid issues on the right side. His vision isn't great, but that's mostly due to cataracts. Pupils are reacting fine, and he can move his eyes, so that's good. But this mass is no joke; it's 6.1 by 5.7 by 4.0 cm now and it's eaten through the right sphenoid wing. It's also messing with the lacrimal gland and pushing on the lateral rectus muscle. He's really against the idea of having an orbital exenteration, which is a pretty drastic procedure. So, what could be going on here?\n\nFirst off, the obvious thought is that this is a recurrence of his squamous cell carcinoma. It's aggressive and has spread further than before. That's our top suspect.\n\nBut wait, there could be other things going on. Maybe it's not just the SCC. Could it be something like a basal cell carcinoma? It's another type of skin cancer, and while it's usually less aggressive, it could still cause problems if it's been left untreated.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about the lymph node in the parotid gland. That could mean the cancer has spread, or it could be something else entirely, like a primary parotid tumor. We should keep that in mind.\n\nThe way the mass is behaving, eating away at the bone and involving the lacrimal gland, it's pretty aggressive. Could it be a malignant fibrous histiocytoma? That's a type of sarcoma that can be really aggressive and destructive.\n\nAlso, the fact that it's involving the orbit and the sphenoid wing makes me think of something more sinister, like a mucormycosis infection. Those can be really nasty, especially in someone who might have compromised health due to being homeless.\n\nBut let's not jump to conclusions. We should also consider more benign conditions, like a pleomorphic adenoma. Those are usually benign but can grow and cause problems if they're not removed.\n\nAnd what about a sebaceous gland carcinoma? Those can be aggressive and involve the orbit, so they're worth considering.\n\nOh, and there's always the possibility of a metastatic tumor. If the SCC has spread, or if there's a whole other primary cancer somewhere else, that could explain the aggressive behavior.\n\nLet's not forget about osteosarcoma either. That's a bone cancer that could explain the bony erosion we're seeing.\n\nAnd finally, there's always the chance of an inflammatory condition like orbital pseudotumor. Those can mimic aggressive tumors but are actually non-cancerous.\n\nSo, putting it all together, our top 10 differential diagnoses are: 1) recurrent squamous cell carcinoma, 2) basal cell carcinoma, 3) malignant fibrous histiocytoma, 4) mucormycosis, 5) pleomorphic adenoma, 6) sebaceous gland carcinoma, 7) metastatic tumor, 8) osteosarcoma, 9) orbital pseudotumor, and 10) primary parotid tumor. Each of these takes into account the aggressive nature of the mass, the orbital involvement, and the patient's history and risk factors.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the top 10 differential diagnoses for the 72-year-old man with a recurrent lesion on his right temple and brow, along with orbital involvement, are as follows:\n\n1. **Recurrent Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - Given the history of squamous cell carcinoma and the aggressive nature of the mass, this is the most likely diagnosis.\n2. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** - Another type of skin cancer that, although typically less aggressive, could still cause significant issues if neglected.\n3. **Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma** - A type of sarcoma known for aggressive and destructive behavior, which aligns with the bone erosion and orbital involvement.\n4. **Mucormycosis** - A serious fungal infection that can be aggressive, especially in individuals with compromised health, such as the homeless.\n5. **Pleomorphic Adenoma** - A benign tumor that can grow and cause problems if not addressed, though it's usually less aggressive than what's described.\n6. **Sebaceous Gland Carcinoma** - An aggressive cancer that can involve the orbit and is a plausible consideration.\n7. **Metastatic Tumor** - The possibility of the squamous cell carcinoma metastasizing or a different primary cancer spreading to this area.\n8. **Osteosarcoma** - A bone cancer that could explain the erosion of the sphenoid wing.\n9. **Orbital Pseudotumor** - An inflammatory condition that can mimic aggressive tumors but is non-cancerous.\n10. **Primary Parotid Tumor** - Considering the involvement of the intraparotid lymph node, a primary tumor in the parotid gland is also a possibility.\n\nEach of these diagnoses takes into account the aggressive nature of the mass, the orbital involvement, and the patient's history and risk factors.

The patient had been initially diagnosed with nodular prurigo at a local hospital and treated with various topical steroids and oral antihistamines for 2 months, without significant improvement. The skin lesions continued to progress and worsened after scratching. Physical examinations revealed disseminated erythematous papules, hypertrophic plaques approximately 1 to 2 cm in diameter, and dome-shaped nodules with excoriated whitish or pink centers on the scalp, chest, abdomen, back, waist, and extremities (Figure, A and B). Subsequent examinations of the mucosal membranes appeared normal. Other physical examinations as well as his medical and family histories were unremarkable. Peripheral eosinophils, serum total immunoglobulin E level, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test for HIV, and results of other routine laboratory tests were within normal ranges or negative.

We've got a man in his 60s with these itchy, bumpy skin lesions all over his body. They've been there for 8 months, and he's been trying to treat them with steroids and antihistamines, but nothing's working. That's frustrating. So, what could this be? \n\nFirst, let's consider nodular prurigo. It's known for causing itchy nodules, and it's already been diagnosed by another hospital. But, since the treatment didn't work, maybe we should keep looking. \n\nNext, I'm thinking about eczema, or atopic dermatitis. It's pretty common and can cause itchy, inflamed skin. But, usually, eczema starts earlier in life, and this guy's in his 60s. Plus, his blood work is normal, and eczema often comes with high IgE levels. So, maybe not eczema. \n\nNow, let's think about psoriasis. It can cause red, scaly plaques, but it's not usually super itchy, and the biopsy would show some specific features that we haven't heard about here. So, psoriasis might not be it. \n\nWhat about lichen planus? It causes purplish, itchy bumps, and can show up in adults. But, it often affects the mucous membranes too, and his are clear. Hmm, maybe not lichen planus. \n\nCould it be an infection like molluscum contagiosum? That causes dome-shaped lesions, but they usually have a central dimple, and we didn't hear about that. Plus, the biopsy would show something distinctive. So, probably not molluscum. \n\nLet's not forget about cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, like mycosis fungoides. It can cause persistent, itchy lesions, and it's more common in older adults. This could fit, especially since the other treatments haven't worked. \n\nOh, and what about insect bites or contact dermatitis? They can cause itchy lesions too, but the pattern and persistence of these lesions make that less likely. \n\nNow, let's think about the biopsy results. They might show something that points us in the right direction. If there are specific features like atypical lymphocytes, that could confirm a lymphoma. \n\nSo, putting it all together, my top suspect is cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, mycosis fungoides. It fits the age, the symptoms, and the fact that other treatments haven't worked. Yeah, that seems like the most likely diagnosis.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Nodular Prurigo** - Initially diagnosed by another hospital, this condition is known for causing itchy nodules, but the lack of response to treatment suggests reevaluating this diagnosis.\n\n2. **Atopic Dermatitis (Eczema)** - Although it's common and can cause itchy, inflamed skin, it typically presents earlier in life and often correlates with elevated IgE levels, which are normal in this patient.\n\n3. **Psoriasis** - Characterized by red, scaly plaques, but it's usually less itchy and has specific histological features not mentioned here.\n\n4. **Lichen Planus** - Presents with purplish, itchy bumps and can occur in adults, but often involves mucous membranes, which are unaffected in this case.\n\n5. **Molluscum Contagiosum** - Causes dome-shaped lesions, but they typically have a central dimple and distinct histological features not noted here.\n\n6. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides)** - A strong consideration given the patient's age, persistent and treatment-resistant lesions, and potential for atypical lymphocytes on biopsy.\n\n7. **Insect Bites** - Can cause itchy lesions, but the pattern and persistence are less typical for this diagnosis.\n\n8. **Contact Dermatitis** - Possible, but the widespread and chronic nature of the lesions makes this less likely.\n\n9. **Pityriasis Rosea** - Usually starts with a herald patch followed by a rash, which doesn't match this patient's presentation.\n\n10. **Granuloma Annulare** - Typically presents with annular plaques without significant itching, which doesn't align well with this case.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides)** emerges as the most likely diagnosis due to the patient's age, the chronic and resistant nature of the lesions, and the potential biopsy findings.

He did not complain of headaches, facial numbness, dysarthria, facial droop, dysphagia, or limb weakness or numbness. There was no history of joint pain or constitutional symptoms. Neurological examination revealed a nonfatigable partial left-eyelid ptosis, left-eye hypotropia at primary position, and impaired left eye supraduction (Figure 1) with a nonreactive left pupil on direct and consensual light reflexes. There were no other cranial nerve deficits. Limb reflexes, motor testing, and sensory testing results were normal, and the plantar responses were flexor. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Neurovascular conflict of the oculomotor nerve", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 37-year-old Asian guy who's not a smoker, and he's been dealing with some eye issues for a year now. He's got this droopy eyelid on the left side, and it's not something that just popped up overnight. It's been slowly becoming more noticeable, and his friends even pointed it out in some photos. That's interesting. And he's also seeing double, but only vertically, and there's no pain involved. That's a big clue.\n\nNow, when I hear about ptosis and double vision, my mind immediately jumps to something going on with the muscles around the eye or maybe the nerves controlling them. The fact that the droopy eyelid isn't getting worse with fatigue is a bit of a hint. Usually, if it was something like myasthenia gravis, the ptosis would get worse with use, but that's not happening here. So, maybe it's not myasthenia gravis.\n\nLet's think about the pupil. It's not reacting to light, which is strange. Normally, if the third cranial nerve, the oculomotor nerve, is working right, the pupil should constrict when light hits it. So, this could mean there's something wrong with that nerve. But wait, the ptosis isn't fatigable, which makes this a bit more complicated.\n\nOkay, so what could be causing this? A nonfatigable ptosis with a dilated pupil? Hmm, could it be a compressive lesion? Like, maybe a tumor or an aneurysm pressing on the nerve? That would explain the pupil issue. But there's no pain, and he's not mentioning any other symptoms like headaches, which you might expect with something like that.\n\nLet's not forget about other possibilities. Horner's syndrome could cause ptosis, but that usually comes with some other symptoms like miosis, not mydriasis. And it's not really fitting here. What about a diabetic third nerve palsy? That can cause a droopy eyelid and affect the pupil, but usually, it's in people with diabetes, and he didn't mention any history of that.\n\nOh, and we can't ignore the fact that he's Asian. There are some genetic conditions, like chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia, that are more common in certain populations. This condition causes ptosis and eye movement issues, but the pupil is usually okay. So, maybe that's not it.\n\nSo, what's the deal with the vertical double vision and the eye movement problems? The left eye can't move up properly, which suggests something wrong with the muscles or the nerves controlling them. This could still be a nerve issue, maybe related to the oculomotor nerve.\n\nLet's think about other nerve-related problems. Could it be a nuclear or fascicular issue within the brainstem? That might explain the specific eye movement problems without affecting the pupil. But usually, you'd expect more symptoms if it was something in the brainstem.\n\nOkay, so putting it all together, it seems like we're dealing with a third cranial nerve issue. The nonfatigable ptosis, the pupil not reacting, and the specific eye movement problems all point to something affecting that nerve. Maybe it's a compressive lesion, like an aneurysm or a tumor, but it's strange that there's no pain or other symptoms. We should definitely consider getting some imaging done to check that out.\n\nSo, in the end, I think we're looking at a compressive third nerve palsy. It fits the symptoms, especially with the pupil involvement. And even though it's a bit unusual without pain, it's still the most likely explanation.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Compressive Third Nerve Palsy** - This condition involves a lesion, such as an aneurysm or tumor, compressing the oculomotor nerve, leading to ptosis, pupil dilation, and impaired eye movement.\n\n2. **Diabetic Third Nerve Palsy** - Although typically associated with diabetes, this condition can cause similar symptoms due to nerve ischemia, often sparing the pupil.\n\n3. **Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)** - A mitochondrial disorder causing progressive ptosis and eye movement issues, usually without pupil involvement.\n\n4. **Myasthenia Gravis** - An autoimmune condition causing muscle weakness, but typically presents with fatigable ptosis, not nonfatigable as seen here.\n\n5. **Horner's Syndrome** - Characterized by ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis, but the presence of mydriasis in this case makes it less likely.\n\n6. **Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia** - Involves impaired adduction with nystagmus of the abducting eye, not matching the symptoms described.\n\n7. **Skew Deviation** - A vertical misalignment due to brainstem or cerebellar lesion, but usually accompanied by other neurological signs.\n\n8. **Trochlear Nerve Palsy** - Causes vertical diplopia due to impaired superior oblique muscle function, but not ptosis or pupil changes.\n\n9. **Oculomotor Nerve Nuclear Lesion** - A lesion within the brainstem affecting the oculomotor nerve, potentially causing the described eye movement issues.\n\n10. **Fisher Syndrome** - A rare neurological disorder that can cause ophthalmoplegia, but typically includes other symptoms like ataxia and areflexia.\n\nAfter considering all the symptoms and test results, the top differential diagnosis is **Compressive Third Nerve Palsy**, as it best explains the combination of nonfatigable ptosis, impaired eye movement, and pupil involvement.

The mass had been present since birth but had slowly grown larger in the previous 2 years. On physical examination, a 2.5 × 1.5-cm, nontender, blue, soft, cystic mass was observed in the right postauricular area. There were no fistular openings around the auricle or in the external auditory canal (EAC), and there were no additional cysts, sinuses, or fistulas at the right neck from the hyoid bone and chin to the EAC. On temporal bone computed tomography, a 2.5 × 1.5-cm, hypodense, oval-shaped cystic mass was revealed at the subcutaneous fat layer superoposterior to the right auricle. On temporal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an oval cystic mass was revealed at the same location, with high signal intensity on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images and low signal intensity on enhanced T1-weighted fat suppression and T2-weighted short T1 inversion recovery images (Figure, A-D). In surgery, the well-demarcated cystic mass was completely excised. Yellowish fluid leaked out of the cyst during excision. On histopathologic examination, the cyst was lined by keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium with hair follicles and sebaceous glands. The cyst contained keratinous debris (Figure, E). There was no recurrence 6 months after surgery. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Type 1 first branchial cleft cyst", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 15-year-old girl with a mass behind her ear. It's been there since birth but has grown a bit over the past two years. That's interesting. It's nontender, blue, and feels soft and cystic. Hmm, that's quite specific.\n\nFirst, let's consider what kind of things usually show up in that area. A congenital cyst is a strong possibility. Branchial cleft cysts often appear around there, so that's one option. But let's not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nThe fact that it's blue and cystic makes me think of a dermoid cyst. Those can be present at birth and might have a blue tint. They're also known to contain material like hair and skin components, which fits the description.\n\nNow, let's look at the imaging. The MRI shows high signal intensity on T1 and T2, but it drops when we add fat suppression. That suggests we're dealing with fat or sebaceous material inside. This is really pointing towards a dermoid cyst.\n\nBut wait, let's not forget other possibilities. Epidermoid cysts are similar but typically don't have the same signal characteristics on MRI. They're more likely to just show high T2 signal. Still, they're worth considering.\n\nThe histopathology is a big clue. We've got keratinizing squamous epithelium, hair follicles, and sebaceous glands. That's a classic dermoid cyst finding. It's like a mini skin structure in there.\n\nSo, what else could it be? Well, a branchial cleft cyst could be in the running, but they usually don't have these histological features. They're more likely to be lined with respiratory epithelium.\n\nLet's think about the clinical presentation again. The mass is nontender and has been stable for years, which fits a benign condition like a dermoid cyst. If it were infected or inflamed, we might consider other options.\n\nNow, what about an inclusion cyst? Also known as epidermoid cysts, they can appear similar but usually lack adnexal structures like hair follicles and sebaceous glands. So, that's less likely.\n\nA neuroglial cyst is another thought, but those are rare in this location and don't match the histology. We can probably rule that out.\n\nHow about a thyroglossal duct cyst? They're usually more midline or near the hyoid, and the histology doesn't match. So, that's not it.\n\nLet's not forget about vascular anomalies like a venous lake, but the imaging and histology don't support that. It's not likely.\n\nIn the end, considering all the evidence, a dermoid cyst is the most likely diagnosis. It fits the clinical, imaging, and histological findings perfectly. I feel confident about this conclusion.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis for the mass behind the ear is a dermoid cyst. This conclusion is supported by the clinical presentation of a nontender, blue, soft, and cystic mass, the imaging findings of high signal intensity on T1 and T2 MRI with signal drop on fat suppression, and the histopathological features of keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium with hair follicles and sebaceous glands. These characteristics are classic for a dermoid cyst, which is a type of congenital inclusion cyst that often contains elements like skin and hair appendages. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Dermoid Cyst** - This is the most likely diagnosis given the clinical, imaging, and histological findings.\n2. **Epidermoid Cyst** - While similar, epidermoid cysts typically lack adnexal structures like hair follicles and sebaceous glands.\n3. **Branchial Cleft Cyst** - Usually lined with respiratory epithelium and doesn't match the histological description.\n4. **Inclusion Cyst** - Essentially an epidermoid cyst, which is less likely due to the absence of adnexal structures.\n5. **Neuroglial Cyst** - Rare in this location and doesn't match the histology.\n6. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst** - Typically more midline or near the hyoid with different histological features.\n7. **Venous Lake** - Vascular anomaly that doesn't fit the imaging and histological findings.\n8. **Lipoma** - Would show different signal characteristics on MRI and lacks epithelial lining.\n9. **Sebaceous Cyst** - Similar but typically lacks hair follicles and other adnexal structures.\n10. **Pilomatrixoma** - Usually a solid mass with different histological features.\n\nThe dermoid cyst is the best fit for the presented case.", "topic": "['Otolaryngology', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine', 'Pediatrics']"}

The family reported that the stridor had remained stable since onset. Her parents noted mild dysphagia but denied shortness of breath, cyanosis, or apnea. Laboratory test results revealed acute COVID-19 infection. Physical examination was unremarkable other than mild inspiratory stridor. Findings from bedside flexible laryngoscopy revealed intact vocal fold motion bilaterally with glottic competence. No supraglottic or glottic masses were identified. Anterior-posterior neck and chest radiography demonstrated narrowing and tortuosity of the trachea with displacement to the right proximal to the thoracic inlet and diffuse patchy heterogenous airspace opacities (Figure, A). Subsequent neck ultrasonography and computed tomography scan demonstrated a 3.2 × 2.0-cm low-density lesion abutting the trachea and hypopharynx at the level of thoracic inlet, with rightward displacement of the trachea and larynx (Figure, B-D). Operative laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, and esophagoscopy revealed extrinsic compression of the trachea, right mainstem bronchus, and esophagus with rightward deviation of the trachea and esophagus. No mucosal tract was identified. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Foregut duplication cyst", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 6-month-old girl with fever and mild inspiratory stridor. Her parents say the stridor started suddenly when she was 4 months old, and it gets worse when she's agitated. But it doesn't seem to change with position, which is interesting. They also mention she has a bit of trouble swallowing, but no shortness of breath or anything too alarming like cyanosis or apnea. Okay, so what could be going on here?\n\nFirst, let's consider laryngomalacia. It's pretty common in infants and can cause stridor. But usually, it's positional and gets worse when the baby is lying on their back. Since this stridor isn't positional, laryngomalacia might not be the best fit.\n\nHow about vocal cord paralysis? That can cause stridor and dysphagia. But wait, the laryngoscopy showed her vocal cords are moving just fine. So, vocal cord paralysis is probably not it.\n\nNow, let's think about a vascular ring. It's a congenital anomaly that can compress the trachea and esophagus, causing stridor and swallowing issues. The fact that her trachea is displaced to the right is a big clue. This could definitely be what's going on.\n\nThere's also the possibility of a lymphatic malformation. These can compress nearby structures and cause similar symptoms. But would it cause the trachea to shift like that? Maybe, but vascular ring seems more likely.\n\nWhat about a neurogenic tumor? These can cause compression too. But usually, you'd expect some other neurological symptoms, and the imaging characteristics might be different. So, I'm not leaning towards this one.\n\nLet's not forget about tracheomalacia. It can cause stridor, but it's usually more about the trachea being soft and collapsing, not being displaced by something else. So, tracheomalacia doesn't quite fit the bill here.\n\nHow about a bronchogenic cyst? These can compress the airways and cause symptoms like this. The imaging shows a low-density lesion, which could be a cyst. This is a strong possibility.\n\nWe should also consider a tracheoesophageal fistula. These can cause respiratory and swallowing issues, but usually, there's a connection between the trachea and esophagus, which they didn't find during the scopes. So, this seems less likely.\n\nLet's think about a congenital diaphragmatic hernia. These can cause respiratory distress, but you'd usually see bowel in the chest on imaging, which we don't have here. So, this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nFinally, there's the possibility of a teratoma. These can be compressive, but they often have a mix of different tissue types, and the imaging doesn't really suggest that. So, teratoma is probably not it.\n\nOkay, let's put it all together. Considering the stridor, the rightward tracheal displacement, and the imaging findings, a vascular ring seems like the most likely cause. It fits well with the symptoms and the imaging. Bronchogenic cyst is also a strong contender, but vascular ring just explains everything a bit better. So, that's what I'm going with.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the 6-month-old girl is a vascular ring. This condition can cause compression of the trachea and esophagus, leading to symptoms such as stridor and dysphagia, and the rightward displacement of the trachea observed in the imaging is consistent with this diagnosis. While a bronchogenic cyst is also a strong possibility given the imaging findings, the overall clinical picture and the specific tracheal displacement align more closely with a vascular ring. Therefore, the top differential diagnosis is:\n\n1. Vascular Ring\n\nOther considerations in the differential diagnosis, in order of likelihood, are:\n\n2. Bronchogenic Cyst\n3. Lymphatic Malformation\n4. Neurogenic Tumor\n5. Tracheomalacia\n6. Tracheoesophageal Fistula\n7. Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia\n8. Teratoma\n9. Laryngomalacia\n10. Vocal Cord Paralysis\n\nEach of these conditions was considered based on the symptoms and imaging findings, but vascular ring remains the most likely diagnosis given the specific presentation and test results.", "topic": "['Pediatrics', 'Otolaryngology', 'Swallowing and Dysphagia']"}

Three years prior, she was diagnosed with a solitary HCC and underwent surgical resection with curative intent. Pathology revealed poorly differentiated HCC, 16 cm in largest dimension, with large vein involvement (T3bNXM0, R0 resection). The patient underwent expectant observation. One and a half years prior to the current presentation, laboratory results revealed an elevated α-fetoprotein (AFP), and cross-sectional imaging revealed multiple lung nodules consistent with metastases. She was treated with nivolumab every other week and attained a biochemical (baseline, 212.2 ng/dL; best response, 3.3 ng/dL) and radiographic complete response. In the current presentation, the patient reported nonradiating epigastric pain of moderate intensity for 1 month. Associated symptoms included nausea, anorexia, and water brash without emesis. Review of systems was positive for unchanged chronic abdominal bloating and negative for other constitutional or gastrointestinal symptoms. Laboratory results, including liver function tests, amylase, lipase, and AFP, were within normal limits, and hepatitis B virus polymerase chain reaction was undetectable. Computed tomography with multiphasic liver protocol showed new enlarged mesenteric nodes and diffuse thickening of the gastric body (Figure, A). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) identified diffuse inflammation and ulcerations in the gastric body and antrum (Figure, B). Biopsy specimens showed chronic and active mixed inflammatory infiltrate, including intraepithelial lymphocytosis (Figure, C). No overt viral cytopathic effects were observed, and immunostaining results for Helicobacter pylori, cytomegalovirus, and adenovirus were negative. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Immunotherapy-related gastritis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 66-year-old woman who's been dealing with chronic hepatitis B and hepatocellular carcinoma. She's had a pretty rough history with cancer, having had a big tumor removed a few years ago, and then she developed lung metastases. But the good news is she responded really well to nivolumab and got a complete response. Now, she's back with some new symptoms - she's got this epigastric pain that's been bugging her for a month. It's not just the pain; she's also feeling nauseous, doesn't have much of an appetite, and is experiencing water brash, which is that sour taste you get when stomach acid irritates your esophagus. But she's not actually vomiting, which is interesting.\n\nSo, what's going on here? Her lab tests are all normal, which is a bit surprising. Her liver function tests, amylase, lipase, and even her AFP levels are fine. And her hepatitis B is under control, with no detectable virus. That's a relief. But then, the CT scan shows something new - enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes and thickening of the gastric body. That's definitely something to pay attention to.\n\nThe EGD shows inflammation and ulcerations in her stomach, and the biopsy reveals a mixed inflammatory infiltrate with intraepithelial lymphocytosis. Hmm, that sounds like some kind of chronic gastritis. But what's causing it? The tests are negative for Helicobacter pylori, cytomegalovirus, and adenovirus, so we can rule those out.\n\nLet's think about the possibilities. Could it be a gastric cancer? That's a concern, especially with her history. But there's no obvious mass or tumor on the imaging, so maybe not. What about lymphoma? The lymph node enlargement and gastric thickening could fit that. Or maybe it's something like MALT lymphoma, which can be linked to H. pylori, but she tested negative for that.\n\nOh, and we can't forget about her treatment with nivolumab. It's an immunotherapy drug, and it can cause all sorts of immune-related adverse effects. Could this be one of them? Maybe an immune-related gastritis? That would fit with the inflammation and ulcerations we're seeing.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? We've got a few possibilities. Gastric cancer is still on the list, but it's not the top suspect right now. Lymphoma, maybe. And definitely, we should consider nivolumab-induced gastritis. It's a bit of a puzzle, but I think the immune-related adverse effect from nivolumab is the most likely explanation for what's going on.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, considering her history and current symptoms:\n\n1. **Gastric Cancer**: Given her history of hepatocellular carcinoma, the possibility of a new primary malignancy, such as gastric cancer, should be considered, especially with the gastric thickening observed on CT.\n\n2. **Nivolumab-induced Gastritis**: As she has been treated with nivolumab, an immunotherapy drug known to cause immune-related adverse effects, drug-induced gastritis is a plausible explanation for her symptoms and biopsy findings.\n\n3. **Lymphoma**: The presence of enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes and gastric inflammation raises the suspicion of a lymphoma, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or MALT lymphoma, despite the negative test for H. pylori.\n\n4. **Chronic Viral Gastritis**: Although her hepatitis B is well-controlled, chronic viral infections can sometimes lead to gastritis, and it's important to consider this given her history.\n\n5. **Autoimmune Gastritis**: This condition could cause chronic inflammation and is characterized by lymphocytic infiltration, fitting her biopsy results.\n\n6. **Cytomegalovirus Infection**: Despite negative immunostaining, CMV can sometimes cause gastritis, especially in immunocompromised individuals, and should remain a consideration.\n\n7. **Adenovirus Infection**: Similar to CMV, adenovirus could potentially cause gastric inflammation, although it is less common.\n\n8. **Crohn's Disease**: This inflammatory bowel disease can manifest with gastric involvement, and the biopsy findings could align with this diagnosis.\n\n9. **Eosinophilic Gastritis**: This is a less common condition that could present with similar symptoms and biopsy findings, especially if there is an allergic or parasitic trigger.\n\n10. **Post-Radiation Gastropathy**: If she underwent any radiation therapy as part of her cancer treatment, this could contribute to her gastric symptoms and histological findings.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are **Nivolumab-induced Gastritis** and **Lymphoma**, as they best explain the combination of her symptoms, imaging, and biopsy results. These should be further investigated to determine the definitive cause of her condition.", "topic": "['Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology', 'Hepatobiliary Disease', 'Adverse Drug Events', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology', 'Targeted and Immune Therapy']"}

We've got a 65-year-old man who's been dealing with hearing loss on his left side for the past six months. That's quite a while, and it's got to be concerning. He's got a history of some serious stuff, like a myocardial infarction, sleep apnea, Ménière disease, and congenital cataracts. That's quite a medical history. \n\nNow, he's not reporting any ear pain or discharge, and there's no recent flare-up of Ménière disease. That's good to know because it helps narrow things down a bit. He's on atorvastatin and acetylsalicylic acid, doesn't smoke, and drinks a couple of glasses of wine daily. \n\nThe otoscopy shows a yellow-whitish, calcareous, lobular mass in the left ear. It's in the mesotympanum, right in front of the malleus, and the tympanic membrane is intact. That's interesting. The mass is hard and painful when touched. Hmm, that's a clue. \n\nSo, what could this be? Let's start with the obvious. A cholesteatoma could be a possibility. They can cause hearing loss and often show up as a mass in the middle ear. But wait, cholesteatomas are usually not painful, and this one is. \n\nNext, let's think about otosclerosis. It's a common cause of hearing loss in older adults and can present as a mass in the middle ear. It's often associated with a fixation of the stapes, which could explain the hearing loss. And the fact that it's painful could fit if there's some inflammation or bony growth involved. \n\nWhat about a glomus tumor? These can occur in the middle ear and cause hearing loss. They're usually vascular and can be painful, but they often come with other symptoms like pulsatile tinnitus or a red mass behind the tympanic membrane, which isn't mentioned here. \n\nAcoustic neuroma is another possibility. It's a type of schwannoma that can cause unilateral hearing loss. But, these tumors are usually located in the cerebellopontine angle, not in the middle ear, and don't typically present as a visible mass in the ear. \n\nLet's not forget about osteoma. These are benign bone tumors that can occur in the ear. They're usually not painful, but if it's pressing on something, it could cause discomfort. \n\nNow, what about a meningioma? These are rare, but they can present as a mass in the middle ear. They might be painful if they're compressing nearby structures. \n\nWe should also consider a metastatic tumor. If there's an underlying malignancy elsewhere, it could metastasize to the ear. These can be painful and cause hearing loss. \n\nHmm, let's think about the possibility of fibrous dysplasia. This condition can cause bone lesions that might appear as a mass in the ear. It can be painful and cause hearing loss if it affects the ear structures. \n\nAnd finally, there's the chance of an ossifying fibroma. These are benign tumors that can occur in the ear and cause similar symptoms. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I think otosclerosis is the most likely diagnosis. It fits the age, the symptoms, and the otoscopy findings. But, we can't completely rule out other possibilities like a glomus tumor or a meningioma without further testing. \n\nIn the end, otosclerosis seems to be the best fit, but it's always good to keep an open mind and consider other potential diagnoses.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step presenting a unique potential diagnosis:\n\n1. **Cholesteatoma** - This is a common middle ear condition that can cause hearing loss and often appears as a mass. However, cholesteatomas are typically not painful, which doesn't fully align with the patient's symptoms.\n\n2. **Ototoxicity** - Given the patient's use of acetylsalicylic acid, ototoxicity could be considered, but it usually causes bilateral hearing loss and doesn't present as a visible mass.\n\n3. **Otosclerosis** - This is a leading candidate, as it's a common cause of progressive hearing loss in older adults and can present as a middle ear mass. The pain could be due to inflammation or bony changes.\n\n4. **Glomus Tumor** - These are vascular tumors that can occur in the middle ear, causing hearing loss and potentially being painful. However, they often present with other symptoms like pulsatile tinnitus.\n\n5. **Acoustic Neuroma** - While this can cause unilateral hearing loss, it typically doesn't present as a visible mass in the ear and is located in the cerebellopontine angle.\n\n6. **Osteoma** - A benign bone tumor that could cause hearing loss if it affects the ear structures. While usually not painful, it could cause discomfort if pressing on nearby structures.\n\n7. **Meningioma** - A rare possibility that could present as a middle ear mass. It might be painful if compressing nearby structures.\n\n8. **Metastatic Tumor** - If there's an underlying malignancy, it could metastasize to the ear, causing painful hearing loss.\n\n9. **Fibrous Dysplasia** - This condition can cause bone lesions appearing as a mass in the ear, potentially leading to painful hearing loss.\n\n10. **Ossifying Fibroma** - A benign tumor that could occur in the ear, causing similar symptoms to what the patient is experiencing.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **otosclerosis** is the most likely diagnosis, given the patient's age, symptoms, and otoscopy findings.

She had been taking 60 mg of oral prednisone; topical prednisolone acetate, 1%; and oral ibuprofen for 10 days without relief.

Three years prior, sinus pressure symptoms led to magnetic resonance imaging that revealed a nasal sinus mass.

Staging evaluations showed no other sites of RDD disease. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Episcleral-uveal nodule and uveitis associated with histiocytosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 59-year-old woman who's been dealing with some pretty uncomfortable eye issues. She's had this on-and-off uveitis and scleritis for about five years. Now, she's back with more pain in her left eye and she's got this episcleral nodule. That's a bump on the eye, which doesn't sound pleasant at all. \n\nSo, what's going on here? The ultrasound biomicroscopy shows there's an elevated and tender lesion. That's definitely something to pay attention to. Her vision isn't great in the left eye either, it's 20/30, whereas the right eye is slightly better at 20/25. And she's been on quite a bit of medication—60 mg of oral prednisone, some topical prednisolone, and ibuprofen. But, surprisingly, she's not getting any relief from all that. \n\nOh, and there's more. She's got elevated intraocular pressure in both eyes, which makes me think she might be a steroid responder. That's a common issue with long-term steroid use. \n\nNow, here's an interesting twist. Three years ago, she had some sinus pressure, and they found a nasal sinus mass. A biopsy back then showed something called Rosai-Dorfman-Destombes disease. That's a rare condition with these histiocytes and something called emperipolesis. \n\nSo, what could be causing all this? Let's start with the obvious. Rosai-Dorfman-Destombes disease is already on the table, given her history. But, there could be other things going on too. \n\nSarcoidosis comes to mind. It's known for causing uveitis and can affect the skin and lymph nodes. Then there's orbital lymphoma, which could explain the episcleral nodule and her resistance to steroids. \n\nIgG4-related disease is another possibility. It can cause scleritis and nodules, and it's known to be resistant to steroid treatment. \n\nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis is another option. It can cause eye inflammation and has systemic effects. \n\nHow about tuberculosis? It can cause uveitis and might be why she's not responding to the steroids. \n\nThere's also syphilis, which can cause all sorts of eye problems, including uveitis. \n\nCancer metastasis could be a culprit too, especially if there's a nodule involved. \n\nThen there's Behçet's disease, which can cause recurrent uveitis and other systemic symptoms. \n\nAnd finally, let's not forget about idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome. It can cause scleritis and episcleral nodules without a clear cause. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I'd say Rosai-Dorfman-Destombes disease is still a strong contender, given her history. But, IgG4-related disease and sarcoidosis are close seconds. Orbital lymphoma and tuberculosis are also up there, considering her symptoms and lack of response to treatment. \n\nIn the end, I think Rosai-Dorfman-Destombes disease is the most likely cause, but I wouldn't rule out IgG4-related disease or sarcoidosis without further testing.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Rosai-Dorfman-Destombes Disease**  \n2. **Sarcoidosis**  \n3. **Orbital Lymphoma**  \n4. **IgG4-related Disease**  \n5. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis**  \n6. **Tuberculosis**  \n7. **Syphilis**  \n8. **Cancer Metastasis**  \n9. **Behçet's Disease**  \n10. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome**  \n\nAfter considering all the patient's symptoms and history, the top three most likely diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Rosai-Dorfman-Destombes Disease**  \n2. **IgG4-related Disease**  \n3. **Sarcoidosis**  \n\nThese conditions align with the patient's history of uveitis, scleritis, the episcleral nodule, and the previous finding of a nasal sinus mass consistent with Rosai-Dorfman-Destombes disease.

On physical examination, the patient showed a rhythmic tachycardia with a rate of 178 beats/min and blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg. The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a regular tachycardia with a rate of 178 beats/min; no obvious P waves were recognizable (Figure 1A). The QRS complexes displayed 2 different morphologies occurring with a definite allorhythmic distribution: pairs of beats exhibiting complete right bundle branch block (RBBB) and QRS duration of 140 milliseconds followed by a third beat with normal configuration and QRS duration of 70 milliseconds. This trigeminal variation in intraventricular conduction occurred without any change in cycle length and was maintained. Adenosine administration quickly slowed the ventricular rate allowing recognition of an atrial tachycardia with a rate of 178/min and a 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) ratio (Figure 1B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Atypical atrial flutter with RBBB aberration and conduction improvement every third beat resulting from concealed type I (Wenckebach) second-degree block in the right bundle branch with 3:2 ratio", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a man in his mid-50s who's just come into the emergency department. He's been feeling palpitations that started just an hour ago. That's pretty recent. He's got a history of mitral valve repair, which could be important. \n\nWhen we check his vitals, his heart is racing at 178 beats per minute. That's fast! But his blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, which is okay. So, he's not hypotensive, but his heart is definitely beating quickly. \n\nNow, let's look at the ECG. It shows a regular tachycardia, and the rate matches his heart rate. But here's the thing, we can't see any obvious P waves. That's interesting. And the QRS complexes are doing something weird. They have two different shapes, and they're alternating in a pattern. Every two beats with one shape, then a third beat with another. The first two have a complete right bundle branch block pattern, and the third one looks normal. This is happening without any change in the cycle length. That's a pretty unique pattern. \n\nSo, what could this be? My first thought is a supraventricular tachycardia, like AVNRT or AVRT. Those are common causes of regular tachycardia. But the changing QRS pattern is a twist. \n\nLet's consider other possibilities. Could it be atrial flutter? That can have a regular pattern too, and the 2:1 block could fit. But usually, we see more obvious P wave patterns with flutter. \n\nWhat about ventricular tachycardia? It can have different QRS morphologies, but it's usually less regular, and the response to adenosine is key here. \n\nSpeaking of adenosine, when we gave it to him, it slowed down the ventricular rate, and we saw an atrial tachycardia with a 2:1 AV block. That's a big clue. Adenosine typically slows down AV node conduction, so this suggests the arrhythmia is above the ventricles. \n\nSo, let's think about focal atrial tachycardia. It fits with the atrial origin and the 2:1 block. But what about that unique QRS pattern? \n\nCould it be something like a sinoatrial node reentry tachycardia? That's a bit less common, but it could explain the atrial origin and the QRS changes. \n\nOh, and let's not forget about junctional tachycardia. It can have a similar pattern, especially if there's a 2:1 block. \n\nBut wait, the QRS pattern is still bugging me. The alternation between RBBB and normal complexes is not typical for most supraventricular tachycardias. \n\nWhat if it's something rarer, like a Mahaim fiber tachycardia? That involves an accessory pathway and could explain the unique QRS pattern. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the most likely diagnosis is Mahaim fiber tachycardia. It fits the ECG findings and the response to adenosine. \n\nBut let's not stop there. We should also consider other possibilities, like bundle branch reentrant tachycardia or even an atriofascicular tachycardia. Those could also explain the QRS changes. \n\nIn the end, after thinking through all the possibilities, I'm going with Mahaim fiber tachycardia as the top diagnosis. It just fits the best with everything we've seen.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the patient's condition is Mahaim fiber tachycardia. This diagnosis is supported by the unique ECG findings, which show a regular tachycardia with a rate of 178 beats per minute, absence of obvious P waves, and a distinctive pattern of QRS complexes with two different morphologies. The response to adenosine, which slowed the ventricular rate and revealed an atrial tachycardia with a 2:1 atrioventricular block, further suggests a supraventricular origin. Mahaim fiber tachycardia involves an accessory pathway, which can explain the observed QRS pattern and the response to adenosine.\n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Mahaim Fiber Tachycardia** - This is the most likely diagnosis given the ECG findings and response to adenosine.\n2. **Atriofascicular Tachycardia** - Similar to Mahaim fiber tachycardia, it involves an accessory pathway and could explain the QRS changes.\n3. **Bundle Branch Reentrant Tachycardia** - This could also account for the QRS pattern, especially with the alternation between different morphologies.\n4. **Focal Atrial Tachycardia** - This is a possible cause of the atrial tachycardia with 2:1 block, but it doesn't fully explain the QRS pattern.\n5. **Sinoatrial Node Reentry Tachycardia** - A less common cause of supraventricular tachycardia that could fit the atrial origin and QRS changes.\n6. **Junctional Tachycardia** - Could present with a similar pattern, especially with a 2:1 AV block.\n7. **Atrial Flutter** - Typically shows more obvious P wave patterns, but can have a regular rhythm with 2:1 block.\n8. **AVNRT (Atrioventricular Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia)** - A common supraventricular tachycardia, but doesn't usually present with the unique QRS alternans.\n9. **AVRT (Atrioventricular Reentrant Tachycardia)** - Similar to AVNRT, it's a common cause of regular tachycardia but lacks the QRS pattern seen here.\n10. **Ventricular Tachycardia** - Less likely given the regularity and adenosine response, which suggest a supraventricular origin.", "topic": "['Cardiology', 'Rhythm Disorders', 'Cardiothoracic Surgery', 'Surgery']"}

His medical history was noncontributory, except for allergic rhinitis, for which he was prescribed fexofenadrine pro re nata. His visual acuity was 6/6 in both eyes. Examination of his right eye revealed erythematous swollen eyelids. A slightly raised dome-shaped umbilicated nodule, of approximately 3 mm, was present on his medial one-third lower eyelid margin, with a similar lesion developing on the corresponding upper eyelid margin (Figure). A vesicular lesion was also present on the caruncle and there was global conjunctival hyperemia, mostly pronounced nasally and around the lesions (Figure, B). There were no signs of corneal involvement, and the anterior chamber was quiet. The left eye was normal. Results of fundus examination in both eyes were normal.

Conjunctival swabs and eyelid vesicle fluid were taken for polymerase chain reaction testing. Swabs of the upper respiratory tract were also taken. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Ocular manifestation of Monkeypox infection", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 27-year-old guy who's feeling pretty crummy with malaise, chills, night sweats, and a sore throat. That's a lot of symptoms right off the bat. He's also having trouble swallowing, which could mean something's going on in his throat or with his glands. And then there's the eye issue. His right eye is red and watery, and he's got these interesting skin lesions all over, including his eyelids. That's a lot to unpack.\n\nFirst, let's focus on the eye. The redness and watery discharge could be conjunctivitis, but the presence of those dome-shaped nodules on his eyelids is a big clue. They're umbilicated, which makes me think of molluscum contagiosum. That's a viral infection caused by a poxvirus. It's known for those kinds of lesions.\n\nBut wait, there's more. He's got a rash on his trunk, limbs, and even his genital area. The rash is made up of similar dome-shaped papules. This could still be molluscum contagiosum, but the widespread nature is a bit unusual. I should consider other possibilities too.\n\nNow, about those systemic symptoms like malaise, chills, and night sweats. These could be signs of a viral infection. Maybe something like infectious mononucleosis? That can cause a lot of these symptoms, including sore throat and swollen lymph nodes. But would it explain the skin and eye findings? Not really.\n\nThe sore throat with white pus patches is interesting. That sounds like pharyngitis, possibly of bacterial origin, but it could also be viral. Let's not forget the cervical lymphadenopathy. Swollen lymph nodes can occur with both infections and other conditions.\n\nI should think about other viral infections too. Herpes simplex virus can cause vesicular lesions, but they're usually not umbilicated like these. And varicella-zoster virus? That's more about a painful vesicular rash, not quite what we're seeing here.\n\nWhat about syphilis? It can cause a wide range of symptoms, including skin rashes. But usually, the rash in syphilis is more generalized and not umbilicated. Plus, the eye findings don't quite fit.\n\nHIV could be another possibility. It can cause a variety of skin issues and systemic symptoms, but the specific lesions we're seeing don't really match up with what's typical for HIV.\n\nOkay, let's not forget about allergic reactions. His history of allergic rhinitis and the use of fexofenadine make me wonder if this could be a drug reaction. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) is a possibility. It's a drug-induced rash that can look like this, but it usually involves pustules, not umbilicated papules.\n\nI should also consider autoimmune conditions like lupus. It can cause a variety of systemic and skin symptoms, but the specific eye and skin findings here don't quite fit.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Molluscum contagiosum is still a strong contender for the skin and eye lesions. But the systemic symptoms are a bit of a mystery. Could this be a viral infection like infectious mononucleosis causing the systemic symptoms, with molluscum contagiosum as a separate issue? That seems plausible.\n\nIn the end, I think we're looking at molluscum contagiosum for the eye and skin lesions, and possibly infectious mononucleosis for the systemic symptoms. It's not a perfect fit, but it explains most of what's going on.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the symptoms and findings described, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition:\n\n1. **Molluscum Contagiosum** - The presence of umbilicated dome-shaped nodules on the eyelids and similar lesions on the skin strongly suggests this viral infection caused by a poxvirus.\n\n2. **Infectious Mononucleosis** - The systemic symptoms like malaise, chills, night sweats, sore throat, and cervical lymphadenopathy could be indicative of this condition, often caused by the Epstein-Barr virus.\n\n3. **Herpes Simplex Virus Infection** - Although the lesions are not typical, HSV can cause vesicular lesions and should be considered, especially with eye involvement.\n\n4. **Varicella-Zoster Virus Infection** - Known for causing a painful vesicular rash, it's less likely here due to the lack of pain and the umbilicated nature of the lesions.\n\n5. **Syphilis** - While syphilis can cause a wide range of symptoms, the specific type of skin lesions and eye findings are not typical for this condition.\n\n6. **HIV-Related Skin Condition** - HIV can cause various skin issues, but the specific lesions described don't match the common presentations associated with HIV.\n\n7. **Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP)** - A drug-induced rash characterized by pustules, which doesn't perfectly match the umbilicated papules seen here.\n\n8. **Lupus (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus)** - An autoimmune condition that can cause systemic and skin symptoms, but the specific findings here are not typical for lupus.\n\n9. **Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome** - A viral exanthem that can cause a papular rash, often associated with systemic symptoms, but usually seen in children.\n\n10. **Erythema Multiforme** - Characterized by target-like lesions, which are not described here, but it can involve the mucosa and skin.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the most likely diagnoses are **Molluscum Contagiosum** for the skin and eye lesions, and **Infectious Mononucleosis** for the systemic symptoms. These two conditions together explain the majority of the patient's symptoms.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'External Eye Disease', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Ophthalmology', 'Mpox (Monkeypox)']"}

Six months prior, he found his palms could not make full contact with each other (the “prayer sign”). He had not been able to fully clench his fists for 2 months or squat for the past 10 days. No erythema, edema, or sclerotic skin plaque had been found on his limbs or trunk. No Raynaud phenomenon had occurred. His medical and family histories were unremarkable. On examination, he showed bilateral limited mobility of interphalangeal (hands), metacarpophalangeal, wrist, interphalangeal (feet), metatarsophalangeal, and ankle joints (Video). No muscular atrophy or sclerodactyly was found. The prayer sign (Figure 1A) and the “groove sign” (Figure 1B) were observed. Blood test results indicated eosinophilia (absolute eosinophil count, 1300 μL; reference, <500μL [to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001]), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, 31 mm/h; reference, <15 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (CRP, 3.01 mg/dL; reference, <0.8 mg/dL [to convert to mg/L, multiply by 10]). Liver and kidney function tests, creatine kinase level, electrolyte level, thyroid function, globulin concentration, and antinuclear antibody (ANA) level were unremarkable. Electrocardiogram, cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging, and plain radiographs of hands, wrists, feet, and ankles were normal. Nerve conduction studies performed in all 4 limbs were normal. Electromyography (EMG) showed spontaneous activities in muscles of limbs, including fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves (1+ or 2+). Myotonic discharges were seen in bilateral extensor digitorum. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Eosinophilic fasciitis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 31-year-old guy who's having trouble with his joints. He can't make his palms touch each other fully, and he's having a hard time clenching his fists or squatting. That's interesting. No skin changes or Raynaud's phenomenon, so it's probably not something like scleroderma. Hmm, what about the blood tests? There's eosinophilia, which is unusual, and his inflammatory markers are up. That's a clue. The rest of his blood work is normal, so it's not a widespread systemic issue. \n\nOkay, let's think about what could cause these joint issues and eosinophilia. Eosinophilia can be seen in conditions like hypereosinophilic syndrome, but that usually has more systemic involvement. Could it be an infection? Maybe, but there's no fever or weight loss. What about autoimmune diseases? Some of them can cause eosinophilia, like certain types of vasculitis. \n\nThe EMG shows myotonic discharges and spontaneous activity. That's pointing towards a muscle issue, maybe myotonia or a muscular dystrophy. But wait, muscular dystrophies don't usually cause eosinophilia. Hmm, this is tricky. \n\nLet's think about the prayer sign and groove sign. These are pretty specific. The prayer sign is often seen in conditions that affect collagen, like scleroderma, but there's no skin involvement here. Could it be related to something like eosinophilic fasciitis? That would fit the eosinophilia and the joint issues. \n\nSo, what's the most likely diagnosis? Eosinophilic fasciitis seems to fit well. It explains the eosinophilia, the joint issues, and the specific signs like the prayer sign. Yeah, that makes sense. Let's go with that.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for this 31-year-old man is eosinophilic fasciitis. This condition, also known as Shulman's syndrome, is characterized by the sudden onset of bilateral extremity swelling, induration, and thickening of the skin, often accompanied by eosinophilia and the \"prayer sign\" or \"groove sign\" due to skin and fascial thickening. The absence of skin changes like scleroderma, normal muscle strength, and the specific EMG findings further support this diagnosis. \n\nHere is a 10-step differential diagnosis list, considering the symptoms and test results:\n\n1. **Eosinophilic Fasciitis** - Characterized by eosinophilia, joint contractures, and skin thickening without systemic sclerosis.\n2. **Scleroderma** - Typically involves skin changes and Raynaud's phenomenon, which are absent here.\n3. **Hypereosinophilic Syndrome** - Usually involves multi-systemic manifestations, which are not prominent in this case.\n4. **Polymyositis** - Often presents with muscle weakness and elevated muscle enzymes, not seen here.\n5. **Fibromyalgia** - Involves widespread pain and tender points, not the eosinophilia or joint signs seen here.\n6. **Rheumatoid Arthritis** - Typically involves joint pain and swelling, not eosinophilia or the prayer sign.\n7. **Mixed Connective Tissue Disease** - Combines features of scleroderma, myositis, and arthritis, which don't fully match this case.\n8. **Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome** - Associated with tryptophan use and more severe systemic symptoms.\n9. **Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy** - Unlikely without a history of head trauma.\n10. **Myotonic Dystrophy** - Involves muscle stiffness and weakness, but not eosinophilia or joint contractures.\n\nReranking these based on the provided information, eosinophilic fasciitis remains the most likely diagnosis, followed by hypereosinophilic syndrome and polymyositis, although these are less likely given the specific presentation and test results.", "topic": "['Neurology', 'Rheumatology']"}

On audiometry, normal hearing sensitivity in the right ear and a severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss with poor word recognition score in the left ear were noted. On physical examination, the patient presented a grade VI peripheral left facial paralysis. Findings from the rest of the clinical examination were within normal limits. Results of cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and temporal bone computed tomography (CT) revealed a left internal auditory canal mass, measuring 13×12 mm, developed at the expense of nerve VII, with a dilation of the various portions of the facial nerve with extension to its distal branches. It presented a hypointensity on T2, isointensity on T1, and was strongly enhanced after the injection of gadolinium. This mass was responsible for the enlargement of the internal auditory canal and was in close contact with the left middle cerebral fossa, without intraparenchymal extension (Figure 1A and B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Neuromuscular choristoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 21-year-old guy with a left-sided facial weakness and hearing loss that he's had since birth. That's quite a long time to have these issues, so it's likely something he was born with. \n\nFirst off, facial weakness on one side and hearing loss on the same side? That's a big clue. It makes me think of something affecting the nerves that control these functions. The facial nerve, which is cranial nerve VII, is definitely involved here. And since he's also got hearing loss, the auditory nerve, or cranial nerve VIII, might be affected too. \n\nNow, let's think about what kind of conditions could cause these symptoms. A vestibular schwannoma, also known as an acoustic neuroma, often affects hearing and balance. But, it mainly impacts the auditory nerve, not so much the facial nerve, especially at a young age. So, maybe that's not it. \n\nHmm, what about a facial nerve schwannoma? That could explain the facial paralysis. These tumors can definitely cause nerve enlargement and affect nerve function. But, would it cause such severe hearing loss? Maybe, if it's pressing on the auditory nerve. \n\nOh, and there's the MRI and CT results. The mass is in the internal auditory canal, and it's enhancing with gadolinium. That suggests a nerve sheath tumor, like a schwannoma. But, it's involving the facial nerve more than the auditory nerve. \n\nWait, let's not forget about other possibilities. There's also the chance of a meningioma or an epidermoid cyst. Meningiomas can be near nerves and affect them, but they usually don't arise from the nerve itself. Epidermoid cysts are a bit different; they're more congenital and could compress nearby structures. \n\nOkay, let's think about the patient's age and symptoms again. He's young, and these issues have been there since birth. That leans me towards something congenital, like a facial nerve schwannoma or an epidermoid cyst. \n\nBut, what about other congenital conditions? Like, could this be related to a syndrome? CHARGE syndrome comes to mind. It can cause facial nerve issues and hearing loss. But, it usually has other symptoms too, like eye and heart problems, which aren't mentioned here. \n\nSo, where does that leave us? Based on everything, a facial nerve schwannoma seems like a strong possibility. It fits the symptoms and the imaging. But, I shouldn't completely rule out an epidermoid cyst or even a meningioma. \n\nIn the end, I think a facial nerve schwannoma is the most likely diagnosis. But, it's always good to keep other options in mind, just in case.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Facial Nerve Schwannoma** - This is a strong contender given the patient's symptoms and imaging results, which show a mass involving the facial nerve.\n\n2. **Vestibular Schwannoma (Acoustic Neuroma)** - Although it primarily affects the auditory nerve, it could potentially impact the facial nerve and cause hearing loss.\n\n3. **Meningioma** - These tumors can be near nerves and affect their function, but they typically don't originate from the nerves themselves.\n\n4. **Epidermoid Cyst** - A congenital condition that could compress nearby structures, leading to the symptoms observed.\n\n5. **Hemifacial Microsomia** - A congenital disorder that could cause facial asymmetry and hearing loss.\n\n6. **CHARGE Syndrome** - A genetic syndrome that can cause facial nerve issues and hearing loss, among other symptoms.\n\n7. **Lipoma** - A benign tumor that could potentially compress nerves and cause similar symptoms.\n\n8. **Neurofibroma** - A nerve sheath tumor that could affect the facial and auditory nerves.\n\n9. **Osteoma** - A benign bone tumor that might affect the structures within the internal auditory canal.\n\n10. **Arachnoid Cyst** - A congenital cyst that could compress nearby nerves and lead to the observed symptoms.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnosis is a **Facial Nerve Schwannoma**, given the specific involvement of the facial nerve and the imaging characteristics.

At age 4 years, she developed white oral plaques that resolved with oral nystatin. Approximately 6 months later, the oral plaques recurred, her toenails became thickened and yellowed, and red plaques appeared on both feet and lower legs. After 3 months of daily oral itraconazole, her skin, nail, and oral mucosal abnormalities resolved for approximately 1 year. Over the following years, she received intermittent 3- to 6-month courses of daily itraconazole for recurrent skin, nail, and oral mucosal abnormalities, which typically recurred within 6 to 12 months of discontinuing itraconazole. Her last dose of itraconazole was approximately 2 years prior to presentation. On physical examination, the patient had white, moist, nonadherent plaques in the oral mucosa and moist red fissures at bilateral oral commissures (Figure, left panel). She also had thickened, yellowed toenails and scaly erythematous plaques on her lower legs and feet bilaterally (Figure, right panel). Results of complete blood cell count with differential were normal, as were results of measurement of serum IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE levels and analysis of CD3, CD4, and CD8 T-cell subsets. Potassium hydroxide wet mount preparation of skin scrapings from the lower extremities demonstrated fungal elements. Fungal culture of the skin scrapings grew Candida albicans. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC)", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an 18-year-old woman who's been dealing with these pesky skin, nail, and oral issues for a while now. It all started when she was just 4 years old with white patches in her mouth. They went away with nystatin, but then came back, and she also got these thick, yellow toenails and red patches on her feet and legs. That's a lot for a kid to handle!\n\nSo, she took itraconazole, and it worked like a charm for about a year. But then, the problems kept coming back whenever she stopped the medication. That's a bit of a red flag for something underlying, right?\n\nNow, let's think about what's going on here. We've got oral plaques, nail issues, and skin problems, all caused by Candida. That's a pretty big hint. Could it be something like chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis? That makes sense because it's a condition where people get these recurrent Candida infections in the mouth, nails, and skin.\n\nBut wait, there's more to consider. The fact that she's had these issues since she was little suggests it might be a genetic thing. Maybe something like autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1? That's known to cause chronic candidiasis, among other things.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about her immune system. Her blood work and immune cell counts are all normal, which is good. But, that doesn't completely rule out a subtle immune problem. Sometimes, these issues can be sneaky and not show up in standard tests.\n\nSo, what else could it be? Chronic oral candidiasis can happen in isolation, but given her nail and skin issues, that seems less likely. And what about tinea corporis or onychomycosis? Those are more localized, though, and don't explain the oral involvement.\n\nHmm, how about Job's syndrome? That's a hyper-IgE syndrome that can cause skin and mucosal problems, but her IgE levels are normal, so that's probably not it.\n\nLet's see, could it be something like a congenital immune deficiency? Those can cause recurrent infections, but her immune workup was normal, so that's a stretch.\n\nOh, and there's this condition called DOCK8 deficiency. It's a bit rare, but it can cause recurrent skin infections and nail problems. That sounds familiar, doesn't it?\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the most likely explanation is chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, possibly linked to something like autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 or DOCK8 deficiency. Those would fit with her symptoms and the fact that she's had these issues for so long.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. It's probably one of those underlying immune issues that's not immediately obvious from her test results. That would explain why she keeps getting these infections despite treatment.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 18-year-old woman with recurrent skin, nail, and oral mucosal abnormalities:\n\n1. **Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis** - This condition is characterized by recurrent Candida infections in the mouth, nails, and skin, which matches the patient's symptoms.\n\n2. **Autoimmune Polyendocrine Syndrome Type 1** - This genetic disorder can cause chronic candidiasis along with other autoimmune features, which could explain the recurrent nature of her symptoms.\n\n3. **DOCK8 Deficiency** - This rare immunodeficiency is associated with recurrent skin infections and nail abnormalities, aligning with her presentation.\n\n4. **Hyper-IgE Syndrome (Job's Syndrome)** - Although her IgE levels are normal, this condition can cause recurrent skin and mucosal infections, so it remains a consideration.\n\n5. **Chronic Oral Candidiasis** - While this could explain the oral plaques, it doesn't account for the nail and skin involvement.\n\n6. **Tinea Corporis** - This fungal infection affects the skin but doesn't explain the oral and nail findings.\n\n7. **Onychomycosis** - Fungal infection of the nails, which is part of her presentation, but doesn't account for the oral and skin issues.\n\n8. **Selective IgA Deficiency** - Although her IgA levels are normal, this deficiency can predispose to mucosal infections, so it's a possibility.\n\n9. **Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID)** - This condition can cause recurrent infections, but her immune workup was normal, making it less likely.\n\n10. **Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID)** - Typically presents more severely in early childhood, but could be considered if there are underlying immune defects not apparent in standard tests.\n\nReranking these based on the patient's symptoms and test results, the top three most likely diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis**\n2. **Autoimmune Polyendocrine Syndrome Type 1**\n3. **DOCK8 Deficiency**\n\nThese conditions best explain the combination of recurrent oral, nail, and skin infections, and the chronic nature of her symptoms.

We've got a man in his 60s with a pretty complex medical history. He's dealing with systemic sclerosis, which is already a lot to handle. Now, he's got this itchy rash that's been bothering him for three months. That's quite a while to be dealing with something like this. He's tried using topical aloe, but no luck there. So, what could be going on?\n\nFirst off, let's consider the possibility of a drug reaction. He's on mycophenolate mofetil, which is known to cause skin issues. It's a common medication for his condition, but it doesn't mean it can't cause problems. So, a drug-induced rash is definitely on the table.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. The rash is described as firm, red-brown plaques without any scaling. That's a bit unusual for a typical drug rash, which often looks different. So, maybe we should think about other possibilities.\n\nNephrogenic systemic fibrosis could be a contender. It's linked to kidney issues, and this guy has had a scleroderma kidney crisis in the past. That's a significant clue. NSF usually presents with thickening and hardening of the skin, which kind of fits the description of firm plaques.\n\nHowever, let's not forget about other skin conditions. Scleroderma itself can cause skin changes, but usually, you'd expect more of a tightening or hardening of the skin, which isn't mentioned here. So, maybe that's not it.\n\nWhat about sarcoidosis? It can cause skin plaques too, and it might fit the description. Plus, it can be associated with systemic symptoms, although this patient doesn't have any new ones. It's still worth considering.\n\nOh, and there's lupus profundus. It causes inflammation of the fat under the skin, leading to firm plaques. That sounds like what we're seeing here. And it's associated with systemic autoimmune diseases like scleroderma.\n\nLet's not forget about infections. Erythema infectiosum, caused by parvovirus B19, can cause a rash, but it's usually more widespread and not just firm plaques. So, maybe that's not it.\n\nThere's also the possibility of a granuloma annulare. It can cause red-brown plaques, but it's usually more localized and not as widespread. Still, it's worth a thought.\n\nNow, considering all of this, I think lupus profundus is a strong contender. It fits the description well, and the patient's autoimmune background makes it plausible.\n\nBut wait, let's not dismiss NSF yet. The patient's kidney history is significant, and NSF can present similarly. It's still a strong possibility.\n\nAfter thinking it through, I'm leaning towards NSF as the most likely diagnosis. The kidney connection and the skin findings make it fit well. But lupus profundus is a close second. It's a tough call, but NSF seems to tick more boxes.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Drug-induced rash** - Given the patient's use of mycophenolate mofetil, a drug-induced rash is a plausible initial consideration.\n\n2. **Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF)** - The patient's history of a scleroderma kidney crisis makes NSF a strong contender, as it is associated with kidney issues and presents with skin thickening and hardening.\n\n3. **Lupus profundus** - This condition causes inflammation of the fat under the skin, leading to firm plaques, and is associated with systemic autoimmune diseases like scleroderma.\n\n4. **Sarcoidosis** - This can cause skin plaques and is associated with systemic symptoms, although the patient doesn't have new symptoms.\n\n5. **Erythema infectiosum** - Caused by parvovirus B19, it usually presents with a more widespread rash, but could be considered.\n\n6. **Granuloma annulare** - This condition can cause red-brown plaques, typically more localized, but is worth considering.\n\n7. **Scleroderma skin changes** - While the patient has systemic sclerosis, the lack of skin tightening makes this less likely.\n\n8. **Lichen planus** - An inflammatory condition that can affect the skin, but usually presents with purplish, itchy bumps.\n\n9. **Dermatitis herpetiformis** - Associated with celiac disease, it causes intensely itchy blisters, which doesn't quite match the description.\n\n10. **Eosinophilic fasciitis** - Involves skin thickening and inflammation, but usually with other systemic symptoms.\n\nAfter considering all the possibilities and the patient's medical history, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) and lupus profundus emerge as the top two likely diagnoses.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits revealed a right retro-orbital hemorrhage. No etiology could be identified on the image. Systemic corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone, 1 mg/kg per day) was prescribed for 48 hours. The proptosis decreased, and the patient was discharged. After 6 months, complete ophthalmologic examination was performed again; VA was 20/20 OU, and there was no remaining proptosis. Two weeks later, the patient presented to the ED for another episode of acute, painless, right proptosis, and the VA had decreased to 20/40 OD. MRI showed a right retrobulbar hemorrhage. Systemic corticosteroid therapy was again prescribed for 48 hours with rapid resolution of the visual impairment but incomplete resolution of the proptosis. One month later, the patient presented to our ophthalmology department. The VA was 20/20 OU, with a persistent, mild, nonreducible, nonpulsatile proptosis unrelated to Valsalva maneuver but associated with extraocular movement limitation in upgaze. A repeated MRI was performed, which showed the following images (Figure 1). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Recurrent retrobulbar hemorrhage owing to an orbital tumor: a primary orbital melanoma.", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a patient in their 70s with this sudden, painless bulging of the right eye, or proptosis, that just showed up out of nowhere. It's been three days, and there's no history of anything major medically, no recent knocks or surgeries. That's interesting.\n\nThe visual acuity is a bit off in the right eye, 20/32, but the left eye is perfect at 20/20. And when they checked the front and back of the eyes, everything looked normal. Hmm, that's a bit puzzling.\n\nThen, the MRI shows a retro-orbital hemorrhage. That's blood behind the eye, but they can't see what's causing it. That's odd. They gave corticosteroids, and it got better. That's a clue! Could it be something inflammatory?\n\nFast forward six months, and everything's back to normal. But then, boom, it happens again. The right eye starts bulging, and the vision drops to 20/40. Another MRI, another hemorrhage. They treat it the same way, and the vision gets better, but not the proptosis. Hmm, what's going on here?\n\nA month later, the vision's perfect again, but there's still some proptosis. It's not changing with the Valsalva maneuver, so it's not related to any blockage or pressure issue. And there's trouble moving the eye upwards. That's a new symptom.\n\nSo, let's think about what could cause this. Initially, I thought about a carotid-cavernous fistula because of the proptosis and hemorrhage, but there's no pulsation or bruit, so that's probably not it.\n\nCould it be a tumor? Something like a lymphoma or a hemangioma? They can cause proptosis, but would they resolve with steroids? Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWhat about an orbital varix? That's a possibility. It's a venous thing that can expand with pressure changes, but it doesn't quite fit because the proptosis isn't changing with the Valsalva.\n\nMaybe it's an inflammatory condition like idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome. It can cause proptosis and responds to steroids, but the recurrent hemorrhage is unusual for this.\n\nCould it be a dural shunt or something like that? But again, no pulsations or bruit.\n\nLet's not forget about thyroid eye disease. It can cause proptosis and muscle issues, but there's no sign of thyroid problems here.\n\nWhat about a venous malformation? That could explain the hemorrhage and the proptosis. It's not changing with the Valsalva, which fits.\n\nOr maybe it's a cavernous hemangioma. They're slow-growing and can cause proptosis, but do they cause recurrent hemorrhage? Hmm, not usually.\n\nLet's think about a dural arteriovenous fistula. They can cause these kinds of symptoms, but again, no pulsations.\n\nCould it be an orbital lymphangioma? They can cause proptosis and hemorrhage, and they're not necessarily visible on MRI. That's a strong possibility.\n\nSo, after going through all of this, I think the most likely cause is an orbital lymphangioma. It fits the pattern of recurrent hemorrhage and proptosis, and it's not responding completely to steroids. Yeah, that seems to make the most sense.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Carotid-Cavernous Fistula** - Although the absence of pulsation or bruit makes this less likely, it's important to consider due to the proptosis and hemorrhage.\n\n2. **Orbital Lymphoma** - A possibility given the proptosis, but the rapid response to corticosteroids is atypical for lymphoma.\n\n3. **Cavernous Hemangioma** - A common benign orbital tumor that can cause proptosis, but usually doesn't cause recurrent hemorrhages.\n\n4. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome** - Responds well to steroids, but recurrent hemorrhage is not typical for this condition.\n\n5. **Orbital Varix** - A venous anomaly that can cause proptosis, but the lack of change with the Valsalva maneuver is unusual.\n\n6. **Dural Arteriovenous Fistula** - Similar to carotid-cavernous fistula, but without pulsations or bruit, it's less likely.\n\n7. **Thyroid Eye Disease** - Can cause proptosis and muscle issues, but there's no indication of thyroid dysfunction here.\n\n8. **Venous Malformation** - Could explain the hemorrhage and proptosis, but the incomplete response to steroids is a consideration.\n\n9. **Orbital Lymphangioma** - A strong possibility due to the recurrent hemorrhage and proptosis, with incomplete response to treatment.\n\n10. **Sphenoid Wing Meningioma** - Could cause proptosis and may be related to the persistent symptoms, but typically has a more gradual onset.\n\nAfter considering all the information and test results, the top differential diagnosis is **Orbital Lymphangioma**, as it best explains the recurrent hemorrhage and proptosis with an incomplete response to corticosteroids.

The lesions started on the left foot and subsequently progressed to involve the face, trunk, and extremities, with distal interphalangeal joint deformity of both hands (Figure, A). The child had an older sibling with no skin ailments, and no other family members were affected. Parents reported decreased oral intake, decreased activity, and delayed motor development. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Farber disease (disseminated lipogranuloma)", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 2-year-old girl with these skin-colored bumps that showed up when she was just about a month and a half old. They started on her foot and then spread all over her body. That's interesting. And there's something about her fingers too, they're deformed. Hmm, that's not something you see every day.\n\nOkay, so what could cause skin nodules and joint problems in a toddler? The first thing that comes to mind is neurofibromatosis type 1. It's known for café-au-lait spots and neurofibromas, but those usually aren't the first signs in babies this young. Plus, there's no mention of café-au-lait spots here, so maybe not.\n\nLet's think about other possibilities. Tuberous sclerosis could be a contender. It can cause skin lesions like these, and sometimes they appear early. But usually, you'd expect to see other signs, like ash leaf spots or neurological issues, which aren't mentioned here. So, maybe?\n\nWhat about some kind of infection? Congenital infections can cause skin problems, but they often come with other systemic signs, and this doesn't quite fit the bill. Let's keep it in mind, but it's not the top suspect.\n\nNow, the joint deformities are quite distinctive. That makes me think of rheumatologic conditions, like juvenile idiopathic arthritis. It can cause joint issues, but skin nodules aren't typical. Still, it's worth considering.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about storage disorders. They can cause skin changes and developmental delays. Something like Farber's disease could fit, with its skin and joint involvement. That's a strong possibility.\n\nBut wait, what about other genetic conditions? Noonan syndrome sometimes has skin features, but it's more about heart issues and distinct facial features, which aren't highlighted here. So, probably not that.\n\nEncephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis is another rare one. It involves skin and sometimes neurological issues, but it's pretty specific and not an exact match here.\n\nAnd then there's McCune-Albright syndrome, which has skin changes and bone issues, but it's more about hormonal problems and fibrous dysplasia. That's not what we're seeing.\n\nLet's not forget about the possibility of a congenital syndrome. Something like Proteus syndrome could cause skin and skeletal abnormalities, but it's usually more asymmetric and severe. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? After thinking it through, Farber's disease seems like a strong contender because it matches the skin and joint symptoms, along with the developmental delays. But we should keep an open mind. Conditions like tuberous sclerosis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis are still in the running, given the right circumstances. It's a complex case, and we might need more information to pin it down for sure.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 2-year-old girl with skin-colored subcutaneous nodules and joint deformities:\n\n1. **Neurofibromatosis Type 1** - While it's known for café-au-lait spots and neurofibromas, the presentation in this case is atypical due to the early onset and specific symptoms.\n\n2. **Tuberous Sclerosis** - This condition can cause early skin lesions, but usually, other signs like ash leaf spots or neurological issues are present.\n\n3. **Farber's Disease** - A strong contender due to the combination of skin and joint involvement along with developmental delays.\n\n4. **Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis** - Considered due to the joint deformities, though skin nodules are not typical for this condition.\n\n5. **Congenital Infection** - Possible, but usually accompanied by other systemic signs which are not prominent here.\n\n6. **Noonan Syndrome** - More characterized by heart issues and distinct facial features, which are not highlighted in this case.\n\n7. **Encephalocraniocutaneous Lipomatosis** - Involves skin and sometimes neurological issues, but is quite specific and not an exact match.\n\n8. **McCune-Albright Syndrome** - Known for skin changes and bone issues, but typically involves hormonal problems and fibrous dysplasia.\n\n9. **Proteus Syndrome** - Could cause skin and skeletal abnormalities, but usually more asymmetric and severe than described.\n\n10. **Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva** - Characterized by skin nodules and skeletal malformations, which aligns with some of the symptoms presented.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are Farber's disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, as they most closely align with the symptoms of skin nodules, joint deformities, and developmental delays.

Her ocular history was notable for recent cataract surgery 5 weeks prior to presentation that was complicated by endophthalmitis. A normal funduscopic examination was documented prior to cataract surgery. At the time of initial presentation to her local retina specialist 1 week following her cataract surgery, the patient had severe pain and redness. Her visual acuity was light perception. An examination revealed a 2-mm hypopyon and dense vitreous haze with no view of the retina. She was treated for presumed endophthalmitis with a vitreous tap and intravitreal injections of vancomycin (1 mg/0.1 mL), ceftazidime (2.2 mg/0.1 mL), and dexamethasone (0.4 mg/0.1 mL). The vitreous sample obtained at the time of treatment grew Staphylococcus caprae susceptible to vancomycin. At time of examination in our clinic 4 weeks following treatment, the patient was receiving topical steroid and cycloplegic drops. Her best-corrected visual acuity had improved to 20/70. Examination showed a deep and quiet anterior chamber with a well-positioned intraocular lens without any plaques or deposits on the lens capsule. Dilated ophthalmoscopic examination demonstrated improvement in the vitreous debris with 1+ vitritis and numerous superficial, round, white lesions spread throughout the fundus in all 4 quadrants and in the macula (Figure 1A). Optical coherence tomography verified the preretinal location of the lesions (Figure 1B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Vancomycin and ceftazidime deposits", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 74-year-old woman who just had cataract surgery, and now she's dealing with some pretty serious issues in her left eye. She's had endophthalmitis, which is a big deal, and was treated with antibiotics and steroids. Now, she's got these weird white lesions all over her retina. What could be going on here?\n\nFirst off, let's consider infectious causes. After all, she did have an infection. Could it be something like fungal endophthalmitis? That's known to cause white lesions in the retina. But wait, her vitreous culture only showed bacteria, Staphylococcus caprae, and it was treated with antibiotics. So, maybe not fungi this time.\n\nOkay, what about other infectious possibilities? Bacterial endophthalmitis was treated, but could there be a persistent bacterial infection? Maybe. But the fact that her condition improved with antibiotics makes me think otherwise.\n\nNow, let's think about non-infectious causes. These lesions are on the surface of the retina, which is interesting. Could they be inflammatory? Maybe something like vitreous base detachment? That can cause lesions, but they're usually not so widespread.\n\nWhat about other inflammatory conditions? Diffuse unilateral subacute neuroretinitis (DUSN) comes to mind. It's caused by a parasite, but it's usually more localized. Plus, she's had recent surgery, which makes me think it's related to that.\n\nOh, and there's also acute retinal necrosis. That's a possibility, but it usually presents with more retinal necrosis and less of these discrete lesions.\n\nLet's not forget about drug-related issues. She's been on steroids, which can cause all sorts of things. Could they be causing these lesions? Maybe, but it's not the most common side effect.\n\nNow, what about surgical complications? Cataract surgery can sometimes lead to issues like lens irritation or even intraocular lens deposits. But she doesn't have any lens deposits, so that's probably not it.\n\nHmm, what if it's something more systemic? Like a metastatic tumor? That's a long shot, but it could explain the widespread nature of the lesions. But wouldn't there be other symptoms or a history suggesting that?\n\nAlright, let's put it all together. Given her recent surgery and the improvement with antibiotics, I'm leaning towards something related to the surgery. Maybe it's a non-infectious inflammatory response, like a vitreous base detachment or something similar. That seems to fit best with what we're seeing.\n\nSo, after going through all of this, I think the most likely explanation for these retinal lesions is a non-infectious inflammatory response, possibly related to the recent cataract surgery. It's not the most straightforward case, but that's where the evidence points.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the retinal lesions observed in the patient's left eye, considering her recent cataract surgery and history of endophthalmitis:\n\n1. **Fungal Endophthalmitis** - Although the vitreous culture showed bacterial growth, fungal infections can sometimes present with similar white retinal lesions.\n\n2. **Persistent Bacterial Endophthalmitis** - Despite treatment, there's a possibility of persistent bacterial infection causing the lesions.\n\n3. **Vitreous Base Detachment** - A non-infectious inflammatory response related to recent surgery could manifest as retinal lesions.\n\n4. **Diffuse Unilateral Subacute Neuroretinitis (DUSN)** - Caused by a parasitic infection, it typically presents with more localized lesions but could be considered.\n\n5. **Acute Retinal Necrosis** - Usually involves more extensive retinal necrosis, but the discrete lesions could fit in some cases.\n\n6. **Steroid Response** - Prolonged use of steroids can lead to various ocular changes, though not commonly these types of lesions.\n\n7. **Lens-Related Complications** - Although no lens deposits are present, irritation from the intraocular lens could potentially cause inflammation.\n\n8. **Metastatic Tumor** - A systemic condition that could present with widespread retinal lesions, though unlikely without other symptoms.\n\n9. **Retinal Detachment** - Could cause lesions if associated with traction or inflammation.\n\n10. **Inflammatory Chorioretinal Pseudotumors** - Non-infectious inflammatory nodules could form post-surgery.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the most likely explanation for the retinal lesions is a **non-infectious inflammatory response**, possibly related to the recent cataract surgery, such as a vitreous base detachment or inflammatory chorioretinal pseudotumors.

She had not traveled to any other countries. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Ocular dirofilariasis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 54-year-old woman with a red, worm-like lesion on her right lower eyelid. It's itchy and painful, but it went away on its own after a month. That's interesting. Then, the next day, her right eye's inner conjunctiva gets red and swollen. She's not having any vision problems or systemic symptoms like fever or weight loss, which is good. She just moved from rural Moldova, where she was around farm animals like dogs and cats. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the lesion's appearance and her symptoms make me think of a parasitic infection. Maybe something like cutaneous larva migrans, which is caused by dog or cat hookworms. That fits with her animal exposure.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. The lesion resolved on its own, which is common for many skin conditions. Could it be something like a resolving insect bite? Those can be itchy and red too.\n\nNow, about that conjunctival redness and swelling. It showed up right after the skin lesion went away. That's a bit of a coincidence, isn't it? Maybe it's related to the same issue. Could be an allergic reaction or an infection.\n\nLet's think about other possibilities. What about a bacterial infection like impetigo? It's contagious and can cause red sores, but it usually doesn't just go away without treatment.\n\nOh, and there's the fact that she's from rural Moldova. There are certain infections that are more common in rural areas, like trichinosis from undercooked meat. But she didn't have any systemic symptoms, so that seems unlikely.\n\nHmm, what about an autoimmune issue like lupus? It can cause skin lesions and eye problems, but usually, there are more widespread symptoms.\n\nLet's not forget about other parasites. Onchocerca volvulus causes skin and eye issues, but it's more common in certain parts of Africa, not Moldova.\n\nOkay, so what about a fungal infection like sporotrichosis? It can cause skin lesions that follow the lymphatic vessels, but it doesn't usually affect the eyes.\n\nNow, considering everything, I think cutaneous larva migrans is still a strong possibility. The animal exposure and lesion appearance fit well.\n\nBut wait, let's not ignore the conjunctival symptoms. They could be a separate issue, maybe an allergic reaction or a viral conjunctivitis.\n\nAlright, so here's where I'm at. The top differential diagnosis is cutaneous larva migrans. Then, considering the conjunctival symptoms, allergic conjunctivitis or viral conjunctivitis could be next. Impetigo and sporotrichosis are also possibilities, though less likely. And just to cover all bases, maybe lupus or onchocerciasis, but those seem less probable given the symptoms.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, considering her symptoms and recent exposure history:\n\n1. **Cutaneous Larva Migrans** - This parasitic infection, caused by dog or cat hookworms, fits well with the patient's animal exposure and the appearance of the lesion.\n\n2. **Allergic Conjunctivitis** - The redness and swelling of the conjunctiva could be an allergic reaction, possibly related to the same allergen causing the skin lesion.\n\n3. **Insect Bite Reaction** - The itchy, red lesion could be a resolving insect bite, which often clears on its own.\n\n4. **Impetigo** - A bacterial infection that can cause red sores, although it typically requires treatment to resolve.\n\n5. **Viral Conjunctivitis** - The conjunctival symptoms could be due to a viral infection, which might coincide with the skin lesion resolution.\n\n6. **Sporotrichosis** - A fungal infection that causes skin lesions, but it doesn't usually affect the eyes.\n\n7. **Lupus** - An autoimmune condition that can cause skin and eye symptoms, but usually accompanied by more systemic symptoms.\n\n8. **Onchocerciasis** - Caused by the parasite Onchocerca volvulus, it affects the skin and eyes, but is more common in certain African regions, not Moldova.\n\n9. **Trichinosis** - A parasitic infection from undercooked meat, but the lack of systemic symptoms makes this less likely.\n\n10. **Erysipelas** - A type of bacterial skin infection that can cause red, raised lesions, but typically requires treatment to resolve.\n\nReranking these diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and history, cutaneous larva migrans remains the most likely diagnosis, followed by allergic conjunctivitis or viral conjunctivitis for the eye symptoms.

She denied having fever, fatigue, chills, night sweats, or weight loss. Physical examination demonstrated ill-defined, indurated erythematous-violaceous patches, nodules, and plaques involving the surface of her head and face with sporadic erosion and brownish crusts (Figure, A). The findings of systemic reviews were unremarkable, and there was no lymphadenopathy. The complete blood cell count revealed normal white blood cell count. The biopsy from an erythematous nodule displayed sheets of medium to large mononuclear cells infiltrated in the dermis, some of which filled and expanded apparent dermal blood vessels and had large, irregular, pleomorphic nuclei (Figure, B). In addition, some neoplastic cells formed a balloon appearance. No epidermotrophism was found. The initial immunohistochemical stain revealed the tumor cells were positive for CD3 and negative for CD20, AE1/AE3, CK20, chromogranin A, and melan-A. The Ki-67 labeling index was 70%. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Intravascular anaplastic large cell lymphoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 79-year-old woman with these red, infiltrated patches and plaques on one side of her scalp and face. They've been there for two years and have slowly gotten bigger and merged into these large plaques and nodules. That's quite a while to have something like this without other symptoms, isn't it? She's not reporting any fever, fatigue, or weight loss, which is interesting. \n\nNow, let's look at the physical exam. There are these ill-defined, indurated patches, nodules, and plaques on her head and face. They're erythematous-violaceous, which means they have a reddish-purple color, and there's some erosion and crusting. That sounds like something that's been there for a while and might be more serious than it looks. \n\nThe biopsy is really telling. It shows sheets of medium to large mononuclear cells in the dermis. Some of these cells are filling up blood vessels, and they have these large, irregular, pleomorphic nuclei. That's a bit concerning because it suggests something malignant. And then there are these balloon-like cells. No epidermotrophism, so it's not involving the epidermis. \n\nThe immunohistochemistry is key here. The tumor cells are positive for CD3, which means we're dealing with a T-cell issue. They're negative for CD20, AE1/AE3, CK20, chromogranin A, and melan-A, so it's not B-cell lymphoma or a carcinoma or melanoma. The Ki-67 index is 70%, which is pretty high and indicates a lot of proliferation. \n\nOkay, so what could this be? My first thought is a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, like mycosis fungoides. But wait, the lack of epidermotrophism and the CD3 positivity with that high Ki-67 index make me think it's more aggressive. Maybe it's a peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not of the mycosis fungoides type. \n\nBut let's not jump to conclusions. What about other possibilities? Could it be a B-cell lymphoma? The CD3 positivity rules that out, so it's definitely a T-cell issue. What about something like Langerhans cell histiocytosis? The immunohistochemistry doesn't support that. \n\nLet's think about other T-cell lymphomas. Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma comes to mind, but that usually has systemic symptoms, and she doesn't have any. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is another possibility, but the description doesn't quite fit. \n\nAfter going through all this, I'm leaning towards a more aggressive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, maybe a peripheral T-cell lymphoma. The CD3 positivity, high Ki-67 index, and lack of systemic symptoms fit. But I should double-check. \n\nOh, and let's not forget about other conditions like pseudolymphoma or even a benign condition like discoid lupus erythematosus. But the biopsy and immunohistochemistry are too suggestive of a lymphoma for those to be likely. \n\nIn the end, I'm confident that this is an aggressive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, likely a peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified. The evidence all points in that direction.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnosis for the 79-year-old woman with the described skin lesions and biopsy results is as follows:\n\n1. **Peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified** - This is the most likely diagnosis given the CD3 positivity, high Ki-67 index, and the absence of systemic symptoms or lymphadenopathy.\n\n2. **Cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma** - Although the description doesn't perfectly match, it remains a consideration due to the CD3 positivity and high proliferation index.\n\n3. **Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma** - Typically presents with systemic symptoms, which are absent in this case, making it less likely.\n\n4. **Mycosis fungoides** - The lack of epidermotrophism and high Ki-67 index suggest a more aggressive form than typical mycosis fungoides.\n\n5. **Langerhans cell histiocytosis** - The immunohistochemistry profile does not support this diagnosis.\n\n6. **Pseudolymphoma** - The biopsy and immunohistochemistry findings are more indicative of a true lymphoma.\n\n7. **Discoid lupus erythematosus** - The histological and immunohistochemical findings are not consistent with this benign condition.\n\n8. **Primary cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic CD8+ T-cell lymphoma** - Could be considered due to the CD3 positivity, but the lack of epidermotropism makes it less likely.\n\n9. **Primary cutaneous gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma** - Although rare, it could be considered, but the clinical presentation and immunophenotype are not typical.\n\n10. **Transformed mycosis fungoides** - Possible, given the aggressive nature suggested by the high Ki-67 index, but the lack of prior typical mycosis fungoides features makes it less likely.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the most likely diagnosis is a **peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified**, given the aggressive nature and immunohistochemical profile.

The lesion measured approximately 1.6 mm in height, exhibited mild underlying chorioretinal changes, and had associated 3 vitreous seeds (Figure, A). There were no signs of internal vascularization or vitritis. Optical coherence tomography confirmed an intraretinal location and calcified deposits within the lesion (Figure, B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Retinoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an 11-year-old boy with a retinal mass in his left eye. The mass is white, translucent, and has calcification. That's pretty specific. \n\nFirst, retinoblastoma comes to mind. It's a common eye cancer in kids and often shows up with calcifications. So, that's my first thought.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. What else could it be? Retinal astrocytoma is another possibility. It's a type of benign tumor that can also have calcifications. \n\nNow, thinking about the age, this boy is 11. While retinoblastoma is more common in younger kids, it's not impossible at this age. But I should consider other things too. \n\nHow about a congenital retinal scar? Sometimes these can look like lesions and might have calcifications. They're usually stable, but they can be mistaken for tumors. \n\nOh, and there are those vitreous seeds. That's interesting. Retinoblastoma can definitely spread to the vitreous, but I shouldn't rule out other possibilities just yet. \n\nLet's see, what else fits? Osteoma could be a consideration, but it's usually found in different parts of the eye, like the choroid or sclera. \n\nI should also think about medulloepithelioma, a rare tumor that can have calcifications. It's not as common as retinoblastoma, but it's worth keeping in mind. \n\nNow, let's go back to the details. The mass is intraretinal, which is important. Not all conditions fit that description. \n\nHmm, what about a hamartoma? Those are benign growths and can appear in the retina. They might not be the first thing that comes to mind, but they're possible. \n\nLet's not forget about less common conditions like choroidal osteoma. While it's typically found in the choroid, it could potentially appear in the retina. \n\nOkay, so putting it all together, I think retinoblastoma is still the most likely diagnosis. It matches the age, the calcified mass, and the vitreous seeds. \n\nBut I should keep retinal astrocytoma and congenital retinal scar in mind as alternatives. They fit some of the features, even if they're not as likely. \n\nIn the end, after considering everything, retinoblastoma seems like the best fit.

Physical examination revealed an ill-defined, nonindurated, erythematous-violaceous plaque that was slightly raised but with an atrophic appearance (Figure, A). A skin biopsy was obtained for histopathology examination (Figure, B-D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Poikilodermatous plaque–like hemangioma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a man in his early 70s with a lesion on his calf. It's been there for 2 years, and it's itchy, red, and getting bigger. He's tried corticosteroids and antifungals, but nothing's working. That's interesting because it suggests this isn't a simple fungal infection or inflammation.\n\nNow, let's look at the physical characteristics. The lesion is ill-defined, nonindurated, and has a reddish-violaceous color. It's slightly raised but also has an atrophic look. Hmm, that's a bit unusual. Atrophic plaques can be a sign of something more complex, maybe even a type of skin cancer.\n\nLet's think about what this could be. Given his age and the fact that it's on his calf, my first thought is basal cell carcinoma. It's common in older adults and can appear as a persistent, growing lesion. But wait, the atrophic appearance throws me off a bit. BCCs are usually more nodular or waxy-looking.\n\nOkay, what else could it be? Maybe a squamous cell carcinoma? They can appear as persistent, growing lesions too, especially in sun-exposed areas. But this lesion isn't indurated or scaly, which are typical features of SCC.\n\nHow about Bowen's disease? It's a form of squamous cell carcinoma in situ and can present as a slowly enlarging, erythematous plaque. That fits the description pretty well, and it's often found on sun-exposed skin.\n\nLet's not forget about other possibilities. Nummular eczema could cause an itchy, red plaque, but it usually responds to corticosteroids, and this lesion didn't. What about psoriasis? It can cause red, scaly plaques, but the atrophic appearance doesn't match, and there's no mention of other typical psoriatic lesions.\n\nMycosis fungoides is another consideration. It's a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that can present with erythematous patches or plaques. The atrophic appearance and lack of response to treatments make this a plausible option.\n\nNow, let's think about the biopsy results. They're not described in detail, but the fact that a biopsy was done suggests they saw something unusual. If it showed atypical cells or specific structures, that could point us in the right direction.\n\nConsidering all of this, my top differential diagnosis is Bowen's disease. It fits the clinical presentation and the fact that it's a precursor to squamous cell carcinoma makes sense given the patient's age and sun exposure.\n\nBut wait, let's not rule out mycosis fungoides yet. The atrophic appearance and lack of response to treatments align with this diagnosis too. It's less common, but it can't be ignored.\n\nAfter reevaluating everything, I think mycosis fungoides is the most likely diagnosis. It explains the clinical features and the biopsy results, even though we don't have the specifics. This seems like the best fit given all the information.\n\n### FINAL RESPONSE:\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the lesion on the patient's calf, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** - Given the patient's age and the lesion's persistent growth, basal cell carcinoma is a strong initial consideration.\n\n2. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - This is another common skin cancer in older adults, often appearing as a growing lesion in sun-exposed areas.\n\n3. **Bowen's Disease** - A form of squamous cell carcinoma in situ, it presents as a slowly enlarging, erythematous plaque, fitting the description well.\n\n4. **Mycosis Fungoides** - A type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that can present with erythematous patches or plaques, and the atrophic appearance aligns with this diagnosis.\n\n5. **Nummular Eczema** - Although it typically responds to corticosteroids, it's worth considering due to the itchy, red nature of the lesion.\n\n6. **Psoriasis** - While the atrophic appearance doesn't match, psoriasis can cause red, scaly plaques, so it remains a possibility.\n\n7. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus** - This can cause chronic, discoid lesions that might appear atrophic, especially if there's significant scarring.\n\n8. **Lichen Planus** - Known for causing purplish, itchy lesions, although they are usually more papular than plaque-like.\n\n9. **Chronic Radiodermatitis** - If the patient had previous radiation exposure, this could cause atrophic, erythematous changes in the skin.\n\n10. **Granuloma Annulare** - Typically presents as annular plaques, but can sometimes appear as non-specific, persistent lesions.\n\nAfter considering all the information, including the lack of response to treatments and the atrophic appearance, **Mycosis Fungoides** emerges as the most likely diagnosis. This condition aligns well with the clinical presentation and the fact that it did not respond to topical corticosteroids or antifungals.", "topic": "['Geriatrics', 'Cutaneous Vascular Malformations', 'Dermatology']"}

We've got a 59-year-old guy with a history of melanoma, and now there's this pigmented lesion in his eye. That's definitely something to pay attention to. Melanoma can be tricky, so I'm thinking about the possibility of ocular melanoma right off the bat. It's a common enough issue in people with his history.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. The lesion is well-demarcated and doesn't seem to be affecting the angle or causing any symptoms. That's a good sign, right? So, maybe it's not something as serious as melanoma. Could it be a benign nevus? Those are pretty common and usually harmless.\n\nNow, considering his history of cutaneous melanoma, I can't ignore the possibility of a metastatic tumor. It's rare, but it happens. I should keep that in mind as a potential differential diagnosis.\n\nHmm, what about other pigmented lesions? There's congenital ocular melanocytosis to think about. It's usually present from birth, but it's worth considering. And then there's the possibility of a pigmented adenoma of the ciliary body. Those can be tricky to distinguish without more information.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about inflammation. Although he's not reporting any symptoms, could this be a case of pigment dispersion syndrome? It's a long shot, but I should think about it.\n\nNow, going back to the idea of a nevus, it seems pretty likely. Nevi are common and benign, and this lesion doesn't seem to be doing anything alarming.\n\nBut, I'm still worried about the melanoma connection. What if this is an early sign of something more serious, like a primary ocular melanoma? I need to keep that high on my list.\n\nAlright, let's think about less common things. Could this be a leiomyoma? Those are rare, but they can happen. And what about a vascular lesion like a hemangioma? That's another possibility.\n\nOkay, so putting it all together, I think the top differential diagnosis is a benign nevus. It fits the description and behavior of the lesion. But I'm also keeping primary ocular melanoma high on the list, given his history. And I'll consider congenital ocular melanocytosis, pigmented adenoma of the ciliary body, and even metastatic tumor in the mix. Those are all possibilities, even if they're not as likely.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the pigmented lesion in the patient's eye, considering his history of cutaneous melanoma:\n\n1. **Ocular Melanoma** - Given the patient's history of melanoma, this is a primary concern.\n2. **Benign Nevus** - A common and usually harmless pigmented lesion.\n3. **Congenital Ocular Melanocytosis** - A condition typically present from birth, but worth considering.\n4. **Pigmented Adenoma of the Ciliary Body** - A rare, benign tumor that can be pigmented.\n5. **Metastatic Tumor** - Although rare, it's a possibility given the patient's melanoma history.\n6. **Pigment Dispersion Syndrome** - Unlikely, but could be considered due to pigment involvement.\n7. **Leiomyoma** - A rare possibility, as leiomyomas can appear as pigmented lesions.\n8. **Hemangioma** - A vascular lesion that could present as pigmented in the eye.\n9. **Choroidal Freckle** - A benign pigmented spot, more common than other differentials.\n10. **Scleral Melanocytosis** - A benign condition with pigmentation, less likely to be problematic.\n\nReranking these based on the patient's history and the lesion's characteristics, the top differentials are:\n1. **Benign Nevus**\n2. **Ocular Melanoma**\n3. **Congenital Ocular Melanocytosis**\n4. **Pigmented Adenoma of the Ciliary Body**\n5. **Metastatic Tumor**\n\nThese rankings consider the lesion's well-demarcated nature and lack of symptoms, while still prioritizing the patient's history of melanoma.

She reported 2 months of increasing right-sided blurry vision and a sensation of eye dryness. She was found to have incomplete eyelid closure by her primary care physician, who initiated artificial tear lubrication and bedtime eyelid taping with partial symptom improvement. Clinical examination revealed 20/25 visual acuity OD with full extraocular motility and normal intraocular pressure. She was noted to have right upper eyelid retraction (Figure 1A) with substantial static upper eyelid lag on downgaze (Figure 1B). She had 1-mm right lagophthalmos with incomplete blink. Frontalis and orbicularis oculi strength were intact. She was measured to have a 2-mm relative right enophthalmos and no resistance to retropulsion. A review of patient photographs from 2 years prior showed symmetric bilateral eyelid appearance without retraction. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cicatricial upper eyelid retraction from metastatic breast carcinoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 42-year-old woman who's been dealing with some eye issues. She's had breast cancer, and she's on tamoxifen. Oh, and she's had some laser eye surgery too. Now, she's got this right lagophthalmos thing going on. So, she's experiencing blurry vision and dryness in her right eye. That's been going on for a couple of months. Her doctor noticed she can't close her eyelid all the way and suggested some artificial tears and taping her eyelid shut at night, which helped a bit. \n\nWhen we look at her, her vision is pretty good, 20/25 in that eye, and she can move her eye just fine. The pressure in her eye is normal too. But, there's this upper eyelid retraction and a lot of lag when she looks down. That's interesting. She's also got a little bit of lagophthalmos, just 1 mm, but it's there. And her blink is incomplete. Her frontalis and orbicularis oculi muscles seem to be working fine, though. \n\nNow, she's also got this enophthalmos on the right side, about 2 mm. That's when the eye sits back a bit in the socket. And there's no resistance when you push the eye back, which is something to note. \n\nLooking at old photos, her eyelids used to be symmetrical, so this is a new development. \n\nOkay, let's think about what could be causing this. Thyroid eye disease comes to mind first. It's known for causing eyelid retraction and can definitely cause some of these symptoms. \n\nBut wait, she's on tamoxifen, which can cause some eye issues too. Maybe it's related to that? Tamoxifen has been linked to corneal and retinal problems, but could it cause eyelid retraction? That's less common. \n\nWhat about orbital tumors? They can push things around in the orbit and cause some of these symptoms. But usually, you'd expect some resistance when you try to push the eye back, and she doesn't have that. \n\nHow about Horner's syndrome? That can cause some drooping and enophthalmos, but it usually comes with a constricted pupil, and there's no mention of that here. \n\nAnd then there's orbital pseudotumor. That's an inflammation thing that can cause a bunch of symptoms, but it often comes with pain or resistance, which she doesn't have. \n\nCould it be something like a carotid-cavernous fistula? Those can cause some eye symptoms, but they often have pulsating features, and that's not mentioned. \n\nMaybe it's a nerve issue, like a facial nerve palsy? But she doesn't have weakness in her facial muscles, so that's unlikely. \n\nWhat about a orbital varix? That's a venous thing that can cause some protrusion or enophthalmos, but it's usually more positional, and she doesn't have that. \n\nAnd then there's the idea of a silent sinus syndrome. That's when the sinus issues cause the eye to sink in a bit. It's possible, but usually, there's some sinus-related history or findings. \n\nSo, putting it all together, thyroid eye disease seems like the strongest contender. The eyelid retraction and lack of old symptoms make it fit. Tamoxifen is a wild card, but it's less likely to cause these exact symptoms. Orbital tumors and the others just don't have enough supporting evidence. Yeah, thyroid eye disease makes the most sense here.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is thyroid eye disease. This condition is characterized by eyelid retraction and can cause many of the symptoms described, including upper eyelid retraction, lag on downgaze, and enophthalmos. The absence of resistance to retropulsion and the lack of old symptoms in previous photographs further support this diagnosis. While tamoxifen and other conditions were considered, they are less likely to cause the specific combination of symptoms presented. Therefore, thyroid eye disease is the strongest contender in this case. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Thyroid Eye Disease** - Characterized by eyelid retraction and enophthalmos, fitting well with the symptoms.\n2. **Tamoxifen-Related Eye Issues** - Although tamoxifen can cause eye problems, eyelid retraction is less common.\n3. **Orbital Tumor** - Typically would present with resistance to retropulsion, which is not present here.\n4. **Horner's Syndrome** - Usually includes miosis, which is not mentioned.\n5. **Orbital Pseudotumor** - Often involves pain or resistance, neither of which are present.\n6. **Carotid-Cavernous Fistula** - Would likely have pulsating features, which are not noted.\n7. **Facial Nerve Palsy** - Would involve muscle weakness, which is not the case here.\n8. **Orbital Varix** - Usually more positional and not consistent with the findings.\n9. **Silent Sinus Syndrome** - Typically involves sinus-related history or findings, which are absent.\n10. **Other Orbital Conditions** - Less likely given the specific symptom presentation.", "topic": "['External Eye Disease', 'Oncology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Breast Cancer', \"Women's Health\"]"}

Her last intravenous heroin use occurred 9 days prior to presentation. She was not taking any prescription or herbal medications and had not been prescribed suppressive antiviral medication for chronic HBV infection. She reported no history of travel outside the US and no raw meat ingestion. Her vital signs, mentation, and physical examination were normal except for scleral icterus (Figure). Results of blood testing were negative for hepatitis C virus RNA, anti–hepatitis A IgM, and HIV antibody. Other selected laboratory values are shown in the Table. A liver ultrasound performed 6 months prior to presentation and a repeat liver ultrasound with Doppler revealed no abnormalities. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Hepatitis D superinfection", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 58-year-old woman who's suddenly turned yellow, and she's feeling pretty meh for the past week. She's got a history of using heroin, but she hasn't touched the stuff for about 9 days. And, oh, she's also got this chronic inactive hepatitis B thing going on. Her liver's been behaving though, with normal enzyme levels and no cirrhosis. So, what's up with the jaundice?\n\nFirst off, let's consider acute hepatitis A. It's a classic cause of jaundice, and it's pretty common. But wait, her test for anti-hepatitis A IgM came back negative. So, we can probably scratch that off the list.\n\nNext, let's think about hepatitis C. It's another virus that could cause liver issues, especially with her history of IV drug use. But, her hepatitis C RNA test is negative, so that's not it either.\n\nHow about hepatitis D? It's a bit of a tricky one because it only shows up in people who already have hepatitis B. And since she's got that chronic HBV infection, hepatitis D could definitely be a player here. It can cause flare-ups in people with existing HBV infections.\n\nNow, let's not forget about drug-induced liver injury. She's not on any meds, and she stopped using heroin recently, but could there be something else she's not telling us? Unlikely, but let's keep it in mind just in case.\n\nAutoimmune hepatitis is another possibility. It's not as common, but it can cause liver problems out of the blue. We don't have any info on autoantibodies, so we can't rule it out yet.\n\nThere's also the chance of something obstructing her bile ducts, like stones or strictures. But, her ultrasounds have been clear, so that's probably not it.\n\nHmm, what about alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency? It's a genetic thing that can cause liver issues, but we don't have any specific tests for it here. It's a long shot, but let's not completely ignore it.\n\nGilbert's syndrome could be another explanation. It's usually harmless, but it can cause jaundice, especially when someone's not feeling well. It's more common than we think, so it's worth considering.\n\nWilson's disease is another genetic condition that can mess with the liver and cause jaundice. But, it's pretty rare, and we don't have any signs of neurological issues, which are common with Wilson's. So, it's unlikely.\n\nAnd finally, there's the possibility of some other viral infection, maybe something unusual like Epstein-Barr virus or cytomegalovirus. These can cause liver problems, but we don't have any tests for them here. It's a bit of a stretch, but let's keep it in the back of our minds.\n\nSo, when we put it all together, hepatitis D seems like the most likely culprit. It fits with her history and the sudden jaundice. But, we should also keep autoimmune hepatitis and Gilbert's syndrome on our radar, just in case.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Hepatitis D** - Given the patient's history of chronic hepatitis B infection, hepatitis D is a strong contender as it can cause acute exacerbations in individuals with existing HBV infection.\n\n2. **Autoimmune Hepatitis** - This condition can present with liver enzyme abnormalities and jaundice, and it's important to consider due to the lack of information on autoantibodies.\n\n3. **Gilbert's Syndrome** - A common genetic condition that can cause jaundice, especially during periods of stress or illness, making it a plausible explanation.\n\n4. **Drug-Induced Liver Injury** - Although the patient denies current medication use, recent cessation of heroin could potentially contribute to liver issues.\n\n5. **Acute Hepatitis A** - Despite the negative IgM anti-hepatitis A test, it's essential to consider due to its commonality in causing acute jaundice.\n\n6. **Cholestasis** - Although ultrasounds show no bile duct obstruction, other causes of cholestasis, like drug effects or metabolic issues, should be considered.\n\n7. **Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency** - A genetic condition that can lead to liver disease, although less likely without specific testing.\n\n8. **Wilson's Disease** - A genetic disorder that can cause liver issues, but the absence of neurological symptoms makes it less probable.\n\n9. **Other Viral Infections** - Such as Epstein-Barr virus or cytomegalovirus, which can affect the liver and cause jaundice, although they are less common.\n\n10. **Hemolysis** - Conditions like hemolytic anemia could cause jaundice due to increased bilirubin from red blood cell breakdown, but there's no evidence of anemia here.\n\nUpon reviewing all the information, hepatitis D remains the most likely diagnosis due to the patient's chronic HBV infection and the acute presentation of jaundice. Autoimmune hepatitis and Gilbert's syndrome are also important considerations given the context. Further testing, such as hepatitis D antibody testing and autoimmune markers, would be essential to confirm the diagnosis.", "topic": "['Infectious Diseases', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatobiliary Disease', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology', 'Viral Hepatitis']"}

Her parents reported no fevers, constitutional symptoms, or enlargement of the mass. On physical examination, there was a nontender 4-cm mass in the left submandibular region with no overlying skin changes. Ultrasonography results showed an avascular cystic structure with internal debris and a single thin septation. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the neck soft tissue revealed a 3-cm low attenuation, nonenhancing, cystic-appearing mass that elevated the submandibular gland to the level of the parapharyngeal fat space with medial extension of the lesion into the tongue musculature. The walls were thin except for mildly thickened capsule along the posterior aspect of the lesion (Figure, A and B). Fluid that aspirated from the cyst was serous, and cytology showed mature and anucleate squamous cells with acute inflammation. The mass returned after 3 weeks. Further analysis 8 months after the initial CT via contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a large, multiseptated cystic structure (Figure, C); the capsule of the wall was mildly thickened and was contrast enhancing. At age 12 months, the mass was excised via neck dissection. A lateral component at the level of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was completely excised. An intraoperative rupture of the thin capsule caused some spillage of cystic contents that were milky white in some areas and mucinous in others. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Foregut duplication cyst", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 2-month-old baby with a neck mass that's been there since birth. It's on the left side, and the parents haven't noticed any fever or changes in size. That's interesting. At this age, we should consider congenital causes. Hmm, what are common congenital neck masses? Lateral neck cysts, like branchial cleft cysts, come to mind. They're usually present at birth and can appear around the upper neck area. So, let's start with that as a possibility.\n\nNow, let's look at the ultrasound results. It shows an avascular cystic structure with some debris and a thin septation. Avascular is key here; it suggests this isn't a vascular tumor. The debris and septation could mean it's not just a simple cyst. This could still fit with a branchial cleft cyst, but let's not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nThe CT scan gives us more information. We've got a low attenuation, nonenhancing mass. It's cystic and has a mildly thickened capsule in one area. It's also pushing the submandibular gland and extending into the tongue musculature. That's quite a bit of detail. This could still be a branchial cleft cyst, but the extension into the tongue musculature is a bit unusual. Let's keep that in mind.\n\nThe fluid from the cyst is serous, and the cytology shows mature squamous cells and some inflammation. This is interesting. Squamous cells could point towards a dermoid cyst, but the location and extension make me think otherwise. Maybe it's still a branchial cleft cyst with some squamous cell debris. Let's not rule out a dermoid cyst just yet, though.\n\nThe mass came back after being aspirated. That's a sign it's not just a simple cyst. Branchial cleft cysts can recur if not completely excised. But, let's consider other possibilities too. Lymphatic malformations can also recur and have a cystic nature. They might fit, but the imaging doesn't scream lymphatic malformation to me.\n\nThe MRI shows a multiseptated cystic structure now. The capsule is mildly thickened and enhancing. This is getting more complex. The septations and thickening could mean this is more than just a simple cyst. We should think about other cystic neck masses, like a thyroglossal duct cyst. They can have a complex structure and extend into different areas.\n\nDuring surgery, the mass was excised, and the contents were milky white and mucinous. That's a big clue. Milky and mucinous fluid can be seen in branchial cleft cysts, but also in other cystic masses. The location and extension make me reconsider a dermoid cyst, but the surgical findings don't fully match.\n\nLet's think about the possibility of a cystic hygroma. They're lymphatic in origin and can have a complex, multiseptated appearance on imaging. The fluid characteristics could fit, but the location is a bit off for a typical cystic hygroma.\n\nHmm, what about a plunging ranula? They can extend into the neck and have a cystic nature. The surgical findings of milky and mucinous contents could match. But, they usually originate from the oral cavity, and this mass was more lateral.\n\nLet's not forget about a laryngocele. They can present as a neck mass and have a cystic structure. The imaging and surgical findings could fit, but they're not as common in this age group.\n\nAfter considering all the information, I think a branchial cleft cyst is still the most likely diagnosis. The location, imaging findings, and surgical results all point towards it. But, it's good to have considered other possibilities to make sure we're not missing anything.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the neck mass in the 2-month-old infant:\n\n1. **Branchial Cleft Cyst** - Given the congenital nature and location of the mass, this is a strong initial consideration.\n2. **Dermoid Cyst** - The presence of mature squamous cells in the cyst fluid suggests this possibility, although the location is somewhat atypical.\n3. **Lymphatic Malformation** - The recurrence of the mass after aspiration and its cystic nature on imaging could fit this diagnosis.\n4. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst** - The complex structure and extension of the mass into the tongue musculature might suggest this, but the location is not typical.\n5. **Cystic Hygroma** - The multiseptated appearance on MRI and the cystic nature could align with this, though the location is somewhat unusual.\n6. **Plunging Ranula** - The extension into the neck and milky, mucinous contents could fit, but this typically originates in the oral cavity.\n7. **Laryngocele** - This could present as a cystic neck mass, but it's less common in this age group.\n8. **Vascular Malformation** - Although the mass is avascular on ultrasound, this remains a consideration due to the complex nature of the mass.\n9. **Teratoma** - The presence of different tissue types could suggest this, but it's less likely given the imaging and surgical findings.\n10. **Epidermoid Cyst** - The cystic nature and squamous cells in the fluid could fit, but the location and extension are atypical.\n\nAfter considering all the information, a **Branchial Cleft Cyst** remains the most likely diagnosis due to the location, imaging characteristics, and surgical findings. However, the complex nature of the mass and the surgical findings of milky and mucinous contents suggest that other possibilities, like a **Plunging Ranula** or **Lymphatic Malformation**, should also be considered.

Her history was notable for phthisis in her left eye due to a left orbit clear cell sarcoma with metastatic disease, after surgical excision and radiation, with recent enrollment in a palliative immunotherapy research protocol. After completing 2 days of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics and antivirals for presumed septic meningitis, her laboratory and imaging results returned negative and she was transitioned to intravenous methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg). One day later, her mental status improved, and she reported central blurry vision in her right eye. On examination, her visual acuity was 20/40 in this eye, she had normal intraocular pressure, and there was no evidence of anterior chamber or vitreous cells.

An optical coherence tomography scan of the right eye revealed hyperreflective changes along the outer plexiform and outer nuclear layers, small intraretinal cysts, and disruption of the ellipsoid and especially the interdigitation zone (Figure 1B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Atezolizumab-associated retinopathy", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 32-year-old woman who's suddenly having blurry vision in her right eye. She's been through a lot already with that clear cell sarcoma in her left eye and now it's metastatic. Plus, she's on some heavy-duty meds, including palliative immunotherapy. That's a lot to consider.\n\nFirst off, the blurry vision. It's central, which makes me think about the macula, the part of the eye responsible for detailed central vision. Could it be something like cystoid macular edema? That's a possibility given her recent treatments and condition.\n\nBut wait, there's more. She's got a history of cancer, and with that comes the risk of metastasis. Could this be a brain metastasis affecting her vision? It's not uncommon for metastatic disease to spread to the brain and cause visual disturbances.\n\nNow, let's talk about the venous sheathing seen in the fundus exam. That's a bit of a red flag for something inflammatory or infectious, like intermediate uveitis or even a retinal vasculitis. And she's on immunotherapy, which can sometimes trigger or exacerbate these kinds of issues.\n\nOh, and the OCT scan shows some interesting findings. There are hyperreflective changes and some disruption in the outer retinal layers. This could point towards a condition like acute macular neuroretinopathy. It's not super common, but it can happen in young women and is often triggered by stress or inflammation.\n\nBut let's not forget about the possibility of an infection. She's been on antibiotics and antivirals, and her mental status improved with steroids. That makes me think about something like PML, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, which can happen in immunocompromised patients.\n\nAnd then there's the fact that she responded well to steroids. That suggests an inflammatory process, which could be anything from uveitis to a demyelinating condition like optic neuritis.\n\nHmm, what about cancer-related causes? With her history, a tumor embolus causing a vascular event in the eye is possible. That could explain the sudden vision change and the sheathing.\n\nOh, and let's not overlook the role of the immunotherapy she's on. It can cause all sorts of immune-related adverse effects, including uveitis or even vasculitis.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top differential should be acute macular neuroretinopathy. It fits with the sudden vision change, the OCT findings, and her overall clinical picture.\n\nBut wait, let's not forget about other possibilities. Intermediate uveitis, PML, optic neuritis, and even a tumor embolus are all still on the table given her complex history and treatment.\n\nIn the end, after considering everything, I think acute macular neuroretinopathy is the most likely cause of her symptoms. But it's a complex case, and we need to keep an open mind to other possibilities.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Acute Macular Neuroretinopathy (AMN)** - This condition is characterized by sudden changes in vision and corresponds with the OCT findings of hyperreflective changes and outer retinal layer disruption.\n\n2. **Intermediate Uveitis** - The presence of venous sheathing and the patient's history of immunotherapy suggest an inflammatory process that could involve the intermediate zone of the eye.\n\n3. **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)** - Given the patient's immunocompromised state due to metastatic cancer and immunotherapy, PML is a consideration, especially with her initial neurological symptoms.\n\n4. **Optic Neuritis** - The improvement with steroids suggests an inflammatory optic nerve condition, which could be related to demyelinating diseases or other inflammatory processes.\n\n5. **Tumor Embolus** - The patient's history of metastatic cancer raises the possibility of a tumor embolus causing a vascular event in the eye, leading to sudden vision changes.\n\n6. **Cystoid Macular Edema (CME)** - This condition can occur following inflammation or surgical procedures and could cause the central blurry vision.\n\n7. **Retinal Vasculitis** - The venous sheathing and the patient's systemic treatment history make vasculitis a possible cause of her symptoms.\n\n8. **Neuroretinitis** - This condition involves inflammation of the optic nerve and retina and could explain the vision changes and OCT findings.\n\n9. **Toxicity from Immunotherapy** - The patient's treatment could have side effects that include ocular toxicity, leading to inflammation or retinal changes.\n\n10. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - The patient's cancer history raises the possibility of a paraneoplastic syndrome affecting the retina or optic nerve.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Acute Macular Neuroretinopathy (AMN)** emerges as the most likely diagnosis given the sudden onset of symptoms, the specific OCT findings, and the patient's overall clinical context. However, it's important to remain open to other possibilities, especially given the complexity of her medical history and treatment.", "topic": "['Targeted and Immune Therapy', 'Oncology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Sarcomas', 'Adverse Drug Events']"}

The skin lesion was nail sized when first noticed 1½ years earlier, then gradually developed over the 8 months prior to presentation. The patient denied any associated fevers, weight loss, or night sweats. Physical examination revealed a slightly reddish verrucous mass with translucent papules and plaques on the right temple, about 5 cm in diameter, with surface hemorrhagic crust in the side adjacent to right eyebrow arch (Figure, A). The lesion was nontender with no purulent discharge and no severe necrotic changes. There was no hepatosplenomegaly or superficial lymphadenopathy. Laboratory tests, including blood cell counts, urinalysis, and kidney and hepatic panels, revealed no abnormalities. A skin biopsy was performed and submitted for histopathologic analysis (Figure, B-D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Primary cutaneous embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an adolescent girl with a reddish, warty-looking plaque on her temple. It's been there for a while and has grown slowly over the past year and a half. She's not complaining of any pain, and there's no fever or weight loss, which is good. So, what could this be?\n\nFirst off, the fact that it's verrucous and reddish makes me think of a wart, maybe a verruca vulgaris. That's pretty common in kids and teens, right? But let's not jump to conclusions just yet.\n\nThe lesion has these translucent papules and a crust, which is interesting. That crust could mean there's some sort of trauma or irritation happening. Maybe it's a pyogenic granuloma? Those can bleed and crust like that.\n\nBut wait, let's not forget about other possibilities. It's on the face, so we should consider things like basal cell carcinoma. It's rare in someone this young, but it's not impossible. And it can have those pearly, translucent areas.\n\nOh, and there's also discoid lupus erythematosus. That can cause red, scaly plaques on the face too. But usually, there's more scaling and maybe some scarring, right?\n\nNow, let's think about the biopsy. If it shows certain cells like dilated capillaries or specific inflammatory patterns, that could point us in a different direction. Maybe something like a hemangioma or a vascular tumor?\n\nAlso, we should consider infectious causes. Tuberculosis verrucosa cutis is a possibility. It's rare, but it can look like this. And what about chromoblastomycosis? That's fungal and can cause warty nodules, but it's pretty rare in this age group.\n\nOkay, let's not forget about benign things like a sebaceous nevus. Those can be waxy and appear in childhood, but they don't usually crust like this.\n\nAnd then there's the idea of a malignant transformation. If the biopsy shows something like squamous cell carcinoma, that would explain the crust and the growth. But again, it's rare in someone so young.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Let's rank these possibilities. Verruca vulgaris is still high on the list because it's common and fits the description. But we can't ignore the possibility of basal cell carcinoma or even a pyogenic granuloma given the crusting.\n\nIn the end, after thinking it all through and considering the biopsy results, I'm leaning towards a pyogenic granuloma. It just seems to fit the clinical picture best, with that crust and rapid growth. But we should keep an open mind and make sure the biopsy results align with this.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the skin lesion on the adolescent girl's temple:\n\n1. **Verruca Vulgaris** - Common warts caused by HPV, which can present as verrucous plaques.\n2. **Pyogenic Granuloma** - Benign vascular tumor that can appear as a reddish, rapidly growing lesion with crusting.\n3. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** - Although rare in adolescents, it can present as a pearly, translucent plaque with possible crusting.\n4. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus** - Can cause red, scaly plaques on the face, but usually with more pronounced scaling and scarring.\n5. **Sebaceous Nevus** - A benign congenital lesion that can appear waxy, but typically doesn't crust.\n6. **Tuberculosis Verrucosa Cutis** - A rare form of cutaneous tuberculosis that can mimic a wart.\n7. **Chromoblastomycosis** - A chronic fungal infection causing warty nodules, more common in tropical regions.\n8. **Hemangioma** - Benign vascular tumors that can appear as reddish plaques.\n9. **Keratoacanthoma** - A rapidly growing lesion that can resemble a wart or crusty plaque.\n10. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - Although rare in adolescents, it can present as a growing plaque with crusting.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Pyogenic Granuloma** seems to be the most likely diagnosis given the lesion's rapid growth and crusting.

During admission in the intensive care unit, treatment with broad-spectrum oral antibiotics for presumed infection and oral fluconazole for thrush led to improvement in the patient’s medical condition, but the ulcers persisted. Dermatology was consulted for input on the cause of the ulcers, which had been ongoing for approximately 6 months prior; individual lesions lasted 1 to 3 weeks before self-resolving. Biopsy of an oral mucosal lesion performed 1 month earlier had shown nonspecific inflammation. Examination revealed exquisitely tender, ovoid, punched-out ulcerations of the inferior lip and scrapeable white plaques on the tongue (Figure, A), right buccal mucosa, and external anal mucosa (Figure, B). A punch biopsy from 1 of the perianal ulcers was performed (Figure, C and D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Epstein-Barr virus–positive mucocutaneous ulcers", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a man in his 40s with a history of poorly controlled HIV. His CD4 count is really low, just 40 cells/mm3, which means he's severely immunocompromised. That makes him a prime target for all sorts of infections. So, what's going on with him? He's got nausea, abdominal pain, bloody stools, pain when swallowing, and these nasty ulcers in his mouth and around his anus. Plus, he's got pancytopenia and septic shock. That's a lot to take in.\n\nFirst off, with his HIV status and low CD4 count, we should definitely consider infections that love to take advantage of a weakened immune system. CMV, or cytomegalovirus, jumps to mind. It's known for causing ulcers in the mouth and elsewhere in the GI tract in people with HIV. So, CMV colitis and esophagitis could explain a lot of his symptoms.\n\nBut wait, there's more. We can't ignore the possibility of HSV, or herpes simplex virus, which can also cause ulcers. It's another common infection in immunocompromised patients and could be causing his oral and anal ulcers.\n\nNow, let's not forget about thrush, or oropharyngeal candidiasis. He's already got those white plaques in his mouth, which are classic for candida. But candida usually doesn't cause punched-out ulcers, so it might not be the main player here.\n\nHmm, what about bacterial infections? With his symptoms and the fact that he responded to broad-spectrum antibiotics, a bacterial infection like syphilis could be in the mix. Syphilis can cause mucocutaneous ulcers, especially in someone with HIV.\n\nOh, and we should think about drug reactions too. His antiretroviral therapy could be causing some of these symptoms. Drugs like didanosine can lead to gastrointestinal issues, but they don't usually cause ulcers like these.\n\nThere's also the possibility of idiopathic aphthous ulcers. They're common in HIV patients and can be really painful, just like what he's experiencing.\n\nNow, let's not overlook the biopsy results. They showed nonspecific inflammation, which isn't very helpful. But, CMV and HSV can sometimes be missed on biopsy if the sample doesn't catch the right area.\n\nGiven all this, I'm leaning towards CMV as the top suspect. It fits well with his symptoms and HIV status. But, we can't completely rule out HSV or even a mixed infection. It's possible he's dealing with more than one of these pathogens.\n\nSo, after going through everything, here's my list of possibilities: CMV, HSV, idiopathic aphthous ulcers, syphilis, and drug-induced ulcers. Each of these could be contributing to his condition, but CMV seems like the most likely culprit.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, considering his history of poorly controlled HIV and the symptoms presented:\n\n1. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection** - Given the patient's low CD4 count and symptoms like odynophagia and bloody stools, CMV is a strong contender as it commonly causes esophagitis and colitis in immunocompromised individuals.\n\n2. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection** - HSV can cause painful ulcers in the mouth and anogenital region, especially in someone with a weakened immune system.\n\n3. **Idiopathic Aphthous Ulcers** - These are common in HIV patients and can cause significant pain, although they typically don't have a clear cause.\n\n4. **Syphilis** - This can cause mucocutaneous ulcers and should be considered, especially in the context of HIV co-infection.\n\n5. **Drug-Induced Ulcers** - Although less likely, his antiretroviral therapy could contribute to gastrointestinal symptoms, but it's less commonly associated with ulcer formation.\n\n6. **Candidiasis (Thrush)** - While primarily causing white plaques, in severe immunosuppression, it could contribute to ulcerative lesions.\n\n7. **Kaposi's Sarcoma** - This is a possibility in HIV patients, but it typically presents as pigmented lesions rather than ulcers.\n\n8. **Lymphoma** - HIV patients are at increased risk for lymphoma, which can present with oral and gastrointestinal lesions.\n\n9. **Bacterial Infections** - Such as those caused by *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* or *Chlamydia trachomatis*, which can cause anogenital ulcers.\n\n10. **Fungal Infections** - Like histoplasmosis, which can cause oral and gastrointestinal symptoms in immunocompromised patients.\n\nAfter considering all the information, CMV infection remains the most likely diagnosis given the patient's symptoms and HIV status. However, the possibility of co-infections, particularly with HSV, should not be ruled out.

About 10 minutes later, he had a second syncopal episode for 2 to 3 minutes with more than 20 muscle jerks. On presentation at the emergency department, he was afebrile, blood pressure was 120/59 mm Hg, heart rate was 85 beats per min, respiratory rate was 16 breaths per min, and oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. His cardiac examination revealed normal heart sounds with no murmurs. The electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed early on arrival in the emergency department (Figure). Transthoracic echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction of 54%, mild right ventricular (RV) dilation (RV diameter, 4.1 cm), and no significant valvular abnormalities. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed no RV abnormalities and qualitatively normal RV function. Neurology consultation was obtained with concern for an epileptic seizure event surrounding the recurrent syncopal episodes.

A young guy in his early 20s suddenly passes out and starts shaking. That sounds a lot like a seizure, right? But wait, he's not confused afterward, which is kind of unusual for a typical seizure. So, what's going on here?\n\nFirst, let's consider the possibility of an epileptic seizure. The shaking and loss of consciousness fit, but the lack of postictal confusion is a bit odd. Still, it's worth keeping in mind.\n\nNow, what about his heart? He's got some chest tightness and a rapid heartbeat. Could it be something cardiac? Arrhythmias can definitely cause syncope. Let's think about conditions like Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, which can cause episodes of fast heart rate.\n\nOh, and there's that family history. A young cousin who died suddenly? That's a big red flag for hereditary heart conditions. Maybe something like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). ARVC could explain the heart symptoms and the syncope.\n\nBut wait, his echocardiogram and cardiac MRI didn't show significant abnormalities. That makes ARVC less likely, but not impossible. These conditions can be sneaky and not always show up clearly in tests.\n\nLet's not forget about other neurological causes. Could it be something like a psychogenic non-epileptic seizure? They can mimic epileptic seizures but are related to psychological factors. It's possible, given the normal EEG and MRI.\n\nWhat about long QT interval syndrome? It can cause syncope and sudden cardiac death. But, we don't have the ECG results to confirm a long QT interval. Still, it's something to consider.\n\nAnd there's Brugada syndrome. It's known for causing sudden cardiac death in young people and can present with syncope and arrhythmias. It's a strong contender given the family history.\n\nLet's also think about other cardiac arrhythmias, like supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). It can cause rapid heart rate and syncope, but usually, there are more noticeable ECG changes.\n\nOh, and we shouldn't completely rule out epilepsy just yet. Even with a normal EEG, some seizures can be tricky to detect. Maybe it's a type of epilepsy that doesn't show up easily on tests.\n\nFinally, what about catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT)? It's a condition that can cause exercise-induced arrhythmias and syncope. It fits with the symptoms and family history.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I'd say Brugada syndrome is the most likely cause. It matches the sudden cardiac death in the family and the patient's symptoms. But, we should also keep CPVT and epilepsy in mind as possibilities.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Epileptic Seizure** - The initial presentation of syncope and shaking is highly suggestive of a seizure.\n\n2. **Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome** - The symptoms of rapid heart rate and syncope could be attributed to this cardiac condition.\n\n3. **Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)** - The family history of sudden cardiac death and the patient's symptoms align with this possibility, despite the normal cardiac imaging.\n\n4. **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizure** - Given the normal EEG and MRI, a psychological cause could be considered.\n\n5. **Long QT Interval Syndrome** - This condition can cause syncope and sudden cardiac death, but ECG results would be needed for confirmation.\n\n6. **Brugada Syndrome** - The sudden cardiac death in the family and the patient's symptoms make this a strong contender.\n\n7. **Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)** - This can cause rapid heart rate and syncope, but typically shows noticeable ECG changes.\n\n8. **Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT)** - This condition can cause exercise-induced arrhythmias and syncope, fitting the patient's profile.\n\n9. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy** - Although the cardiac imaging was normal, this condition can sometimes be subtle and should not be entirely ruled out.\n\n10. **Neurocardiogenic Syncope** - A common cause of fainting, especially in young people, often triggered by stress or certain situations.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top three differential diagnoses, in order of likelihood, are:\n\n1. **Brugada Syndrome** - Given the family history and the patient's symptoms, this is the most likely cause.\n\n2. **Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT)** - This condition fits well with the exercise-induced symptoms and family history.\n\n3. **Epileptic Seizure** - Although the postictal state was atypical, some types of epilepsy might not show clear EEG abnormalities.\n\nThese diagnoses take into account the cardiac and neurological aspects of the patient's presentation, as well as the significant family history of sudden cardiac death.", "topic": "['Neurology', 'Cardiology', 'Rhythm Disorders']"}

She reported pruritus and swelling, which were usually moderate but occasionally severe, prompting several emergency department visits. During an emergency department visit, she was diagnosed with acute parotitis based on clinical and radiographic findings of diffuse gland edema, without salivary stones or masses. Her symptoms responded to oral prednisone bursts and diphenhydramine, but not to second-generation antihistamines or montelukast. Her workup included immune serology and total immunoglobulin (Ig) E measurements, all of which were within normal limits.

We've got a 32-year-old Black woman who's been dealing with facial swelling for about a year. It's mostly around her right preauricular and left submandibular areas. That's interesting because it sounds like it's affecting her salivary glands. She mentioned this all started after she moved to California. Could there be something environmental triggering this? But she can't think of anything specific. Hmm, that's odd.\n\nShe's experiencing itching and swelling, and it's not just mild. It gets pretty severe at times, enough to send her to the emergency room. They've diagnosed her with acute parotitis, and it seems like there aren't any stones or masses in her salivary glands. That's good to know because it rules out some common causes of parotitis.\n\nShe's tried treatments like oral prednisone and diphenhydramine, which work, but antihistamines and montelukast don't. That's a clue. It suggests there's some inflammatory process going on, maybe allergic, but not the typical kind.\n\nHer blood tests show elevated eosinophils. That's definitely something to note. Eosinophils can be high in allergic reactions or certain infections, but there's no sign of infection here. Her autoimmune tests are all negative, so it's probably not something like Sjögren's syndrome.\n\nShe's had sialendoscopy, and no stones or strictures were found. That's good, but the steroid irrigation didn't help much. Hmm, maybe the issue is deeper in the tissue.\n\nThe biopsy of her parotid gland shows nonspecific inflammation and eosinophils. That's a big clue. Eosinophils in the tissue point towards an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction.\n\nShe's had a parotidectomy, and the histology shows periductal inflammatory infiltrate with eosinophils. This is really pointing towards some kind of eosinophilic or allergic process.\n\nSo, what could this be? Let's think about conditions with eosinophilia. There's Kimura's disease, but that usually has lymphadenopathy and more severe symptoms. IgG4-related disease is another possibility, but we don't have the typical histological features for that.\n\nAllergic reactions are still on the table, especially since she responds to steroids. But it's weird that she can't identify any triggers. Maybe it's an unusual allergen or something environmental in California.\n\nLet's consider autoimmune causes again. Sjögren's syndrome was ruled out, but what about MALT lymphoma? It can involve the salivary glands and cause swelling. But we don't have any histological evidence of lymphoma.\n\nCould this be some kind of eosinophilic fasciitis? That's a stretch, but it could explain the swelling and eosinophilia. However, we don't have skin involvement, which is typical.\n\nLet's not forget about infections. Could it be something atypical like a fungal infection? That might explain the eosinophilia, but we don't have any other signs of infection.\n\nIn the end, I'm thinking this might be an unusual allergic or hypersensitivity reaction. The lack of identifiable triggers is strange, but the response to steroids and eosinophilia fit. It's possible there's an environmental factor in California that she hasn't pinpointed yet.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Allergic Reaction**: The patient's symptoms and response to steroids, along with the presence of eosinophils, strongly suggest an allergic process.\n\n2. **Kimura's Disease**: Although it typically involves lymphadenopathy and more severe symptoms, the eosinophilic infiltrate is a characteristic feature.\n\n3. **IgG4-related Disease**: This condition can involve the salivary glands, but the histological findings do not fully align with this diagnosis.\n\n4. **Sjögren's Syndrome**: Although ruled out by negative autoantibodies, it's important to consider due to glandular involvement.\n\n5. **MALT Lymphoma**: This could involve the salivary glands, but there is no histological evidence of lymphoma.\n\n6. **Eosinophilic Fasciitis**: This is a less likely option due to the lack of skin involvement, but it could explain the swelling and eosinophilia.\n\n7. **Chronic Sclerosing Sialadenitis (Kuttner's Tumor)**: This condition involves chronic inflammation of the salivary glands but typically does not present with eosinophilia.\n\n8. **Sarcoidosis**: Although it can involve the salivary glands, the presence of eosinophils is not typical for this condition.\n\n9. **Fungal Infection**: An atypical fungal infection could potentially explain the eosinophilia, but there are no other signs of infection.\n\n10. **Idiopathic Eosinophilic Sialadenitis**: This is a rare condition characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the salivary glands without a clear cause or systemic involvement.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are an unusual allergic or hypersensitivity reaction and idiopathic eosinophilic sialadenitis. The environmental change associated with her move to California might have exposed her to an allergen that she hasn't yet identified. The lack of response to antihistamines and montelukast, but positive response to steroids, supports this hypothesis.

We've got a 78-year-old man who's been dealing with some vision issues for a while now, especially in his right eye. He's been using some glaucoma meds, so that's something to keep in mind. He had cataract surgery about 10 years ago, so that's not too recent. His visual acuity is better in his left eye, and there's a difference in his prescription between the two eyes. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nNow, when we look at the slitlamp exam, there's this milky substance behind the lens in both eyes, but it's more noticeable in the right one. That's a clue. The rest of the exam is pretty normal, except for some dry eye stuff and these Elschnig pearls, which are pretty common after cataract surgery.\n\nSo, what could be going on here? Posterior capsule opacification jumps out right away. It's pretty common after cataract surgery and can cause that milky appearance. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet.\n\nWhat about other possibilities? Well, there's Elschnig pearl formation, but those are usually harmless and don't really cause vision problems. Then there's the idea of a displaced intraocular lens, but there's no sign of that here. The lens seems to be in place.\n\nCould it be something like a vitreous haze or inflammation? Not really, because there's no sign of inflammation, and the haze would present differently.\n\nWhat about cystoid macular edema? That can happen after cataract surgery, but it usually causes swelling in the macula, and we don't have any info on that here.\n\nOh, and there's the glaucoma meds to consider. Could they be causing some kind of reaction? Unlikely, since he's been on them for a while, and there's no new inflammation.\n\nSo, after thinking it through, posterior capsule opacification seems like the most likely culprit. It fits the symptoms and the exam findings perfectly. But let's make sure we're not missing anything.\n\nOkay, what if it's something less obvious, like a subtle vitreous issue or early age-related macular degeneration? Those could cause vision changes, but they don't explain the milky substance we're seeing.\n\nIn the end, posterior capsule opacification is still the best fit. It's common after cataract surgery, and everything lines up. But it's good to consider all the possibilities to be sure.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the 78-year-old man's visual issues is posterior capsule opacification. This condition is a common complication following cataract surgery and is characterized by the milky appearance behind the intraocular lens, as noted in the slitlamp examination. The symptoms and examination findings align well with this diagnosis.\n\nHere is a 10-step differential diagnosis, considering other potential causes for the visual changes:\n\n1. **Posterior Capsule Opacification** - The most likely cause given the history and slitlamp findings.\n2. **Elschnig Pearl Formation** - While present, these are usually benign and do not typically affect vision.\n3. **Displaced Intraocular Lens** - There is no indication of lens displacement in the examination.\n4. **Vitreous Haze** - This would present differently and is not supported by the findings.\n5. **Cystoid Macular Edema** - Possible post-surgery, but there is no evidence of macular swelling.\n6. **Glaucoma Medication Reaction** - Unlikely, as he has been on the medication without new inflammation.\n7. **Age-related Macular Degeneration** - Could cause vision changes, but doesn't explain the milky substance.\n8. **Vitreous Detachment** - Would present with different symptoms and findings.\n9. **Retinal Disease** - No evidence of retinal abnormalities in the provided information.\n10. **Intraocular Lens Calcification** - A rare complication, but could cause similar symptoms.\n\nAfter considering all possibilities, posterior capsule opacification remains the most fitting diagnosis given the patient's history and examination results.", "topic": "['Cataract and Other Lens Disorders', 'Glaucoma', 'Ophthalmology']"}

He was otherwise well. The referring physician was treating him with prednisolone eye drops for cystoid macular edema after recent left Nd:YAG capsulotomy. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/30 OS with intraocular pressures of 20 mm Hg OD and 26 mm Hg OS. The anterior segments showed well-positioned posterior chamber intraocular lens implants with open posterior capsules. Dilated fundus examination revealed a small peripheral hypoautofluorescent chorioretinal scar in the right eye. In the left eye, there was trace vitreous haze and 2+ anterior vitreous cell. Multifocal chorioretinal scars extended from the left optic nerve into the macula in each quadrant (Figure 1). These lesions showed variable hypoautofluorescence and hyperautofluorescence. On indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), the confluent hypoautofluorescent lesions showed loss of the choriocapillaris and prominent large choroidal vessels, whereas the mottled hypoautofluorescence and hyperautofluorescent lesions appeared to block the underlying fluorescence. Routine laboratory testing was unremarkable except for a positive interferon-gamma release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A chest radiograph was normal. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Tuberculous serpiginouslike choroiditis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 55-year-old guy who's been dealing with some eye issues. He's had cataract surgery a while back, and now he's experiencing blurriness, seeing flashes of light, and has floaters. Plus, his left eye is looking a bit red sometimes. That's a lot going on.\n\nFirst off, the fact that he's had cataract surgery makes me think about cystoid macular edema. It's pretty common after surgery, and it can definitely cause some of the symptoms he's having. So, that's my first guess.\n\nBut wait, there's more to consider. He's got these chorioretinal scars in both eyes, and the left eye has some vitreous haze and cells. That's pointing towards some kind of inflammation or infection. I should think about something like intermediate uveitis. It often involves the vitreous and can cause those symptoms.\n\nNow, let's not forget about the positive interferon-gamma release assay for tuberculosis. That's a big clue. TB can cause ocular issues like choroidal tubercles, which could explain the scars and inflammation. So, ocular tuberculosis is definitely on my list.\n\nBut, hold on. The chest radiograph is normal, which usually helps rule out active TB. Hmm, that makes things a bit tricky. Maybe it's not active TB, but it could still be related somehow.\n\nI should also consider other possibilities. The multifocal scars and vitreous involvement could be due to something like sympathetic ophthalmia. It's an autoimmune condition that can cause bilateral inflammation after eye surgery. That fits the timeline and symptoms pretty well.\n\nOh, and what about sarcoidosis? It can cause uveitis and those kinds of scars too. Plus, it's known for having systemic involvement, but it can be sneaky and just show up in the eyes.\n\nI shouldn't ignore the possibility of fungal infections like candidiasis, especially since he's had cataract surgery. They can cause vitreous haze and inflammation, but usually, there are more specific signs on the exam.\n\nAnd then there's APMPPE, which is a type of posterior uveitis. It can cause those scars and haze, and it often follows a viral illness. It's a bit of a wildcard, but it fits some of the findings.\n\nOh, and I can't forget about birdshot chorioretinopathy. It's a rare condition that causes those kinds of scars and can have vitreous involvement. It's associated with HLA-A29, so that's something to consider.\n\nFinally, let's think about multifocal choroiditis and panuveitis. It's similar to some of the other conditions and can cause the symptoms he's experiencing. It's a bit broader, but it could fit.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I'd rank sympathetic ophthalmia as the top possibility. It matches the post-surgical timeline and the bilateral nature of his symptoms. Ocular tuberculosis is a close second, given the positive IGRA result. Then comes sarcoidosis, APMPPE, and birdshot chorioretinopathy, in that order. Cystoid macular edema and fungal infections are lower on the list, and multifocal choroiditis rounds out the bottom. That seems to cover all the bases.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step presenting a unique potential diagnosis:\n\n1. **Cystoid Macular Edema** - This is a common post-cataract surgery complication that can cause blurriness and vision issues.\n   \n2. **Intermediate Uveitis** - Characterized by vitreous haze and inflammation, which aligns with the patient's symptoms and examination findings.\n   \n3. **Ocular Tuberculosis** - The positive interferon-gamma release assay suggests TB as a possible cause, despite the normal chest radiograph.\n   \n4. **Sympathetic Ophthalmia** - An autoimmune condition that can occur after eye surgery, leading to bilateral inflammation and scarring.\n   \n5. **Sarcoidosis** - Known for causing uveitis and chorioretinal scars, with potential systemic involvement.\n   \n6. **Fungal Endophthalmitis** (e.g., Candidiasis) - A possible post-surgical infection causing vitreous haze and inflammation.\n   \n7. **Acute Posterior Multifocal Placoid Pigment Epitheliopathy (APMPPE)** - A type of posterior uveitis that can follow a viral illness and cause chorioretinal scars.\n   \n8. **Birdshot Chorioretinopathy** - Characterized by distinctive chorioretinal scars and associated with HLA-A29.\n   \n9. **Multifocal Choroiditis and Panuveitis** - Similar to other conditions, causing inflammation and scarring in the choroid and retina.\n   \n10. **Punctate Inner Choroidopathy (PIC)** - A condition causing multifocal choroidal lesions, often in young myopic individuals, but can present similarly.\n\nReranking these diagnoses based on the patient's history, examination, and test results, the top possibilities are:\n\n1. **Sympathetic Ophthalmia** - Fits the post-surgical timeline and bilateral nature of symptoms.\n   \n2. **Ocular Tuberculosis** - Strongly suggested by the positive IGRA result.\n   \n3. **Sarcoidosis** - Systemic condition that can cause similar ocular findings.\n   \n4. **APMPPE** - Matches some clinical features, especially the chorioretinal scars.\n   \n5. **Birdshot Chorioretinopathy** - Distinctive scars and potential HLA association.\n   \n6. **Multifocal Choroiditis and Panuveitis** - Broad differential that aligns with some findings.\n   \n7. **Cystoid Macular Edema** - Common post-surgical issue, but may not explain all symptoms.\n   \n8. **Intermediate Uveitis** - Possible, but less specific than other diagnoses.\n   \n9. **Fungal Endophthalmitis** - Less likely without specific exam findings or history.\n   \n10. **Punctate Inner Choroidopathy (PIC)** - Less likely given the patient's age and symptom profile.\n\nThis order reflects a balance between the clinical presentation, diagnostic test results, and the likelihood of each condition.", "topic": "['Infectious Diseases', 'Macular Diseases', 'Ophthalmology', 'Tuberculosis', 'Choroidal Disorders']"}

Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/70 in both eyes. Pupils, intraocular pressure, and color vision were normal. She had bilateral proptosis to 20/21 mm by Hertel exophthalmometer, −3 restriction of extraocular movements in all directions of gaze, diffuse punctate epithelial erosions, and mechanical lower lid entropion secondary to severe chemosis in both eyes (Figure 1A). Anterior segment examination and dilated ophthalmoscopy results were otherwise unremarkable. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Recurrent NET metastatic to the EOMs", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 47-year-old woman who's had a neuroendocrine carcinoid tumor in the past. She's now dealing with a new issue—a pancreatic mass that's raising eyebrows about a possible recurrence. But that's not all. She's suddenly developed some pretty alarming symptoms: severe swelling around her eyes, chemosis, and trouble moving her eyes. Plus, she's experiencing some flushing and palpitations. That's a lot to take in.\n\nFirst off, the eye symptoms are pretty striking. Severe bilateral periorbital swelling and chemosis, along with ophthalmoplegia, immediately make me think of something like thyroid eye disease. It's known for causing these kinds of symptoms, especially with the eye bulging and movement issues.\n\nBut wait, there's more to consider. She's got a history of a neuroendocrine tumor, which can produce all sorts of hormones. The flushing and palpitations she's experiencing could be linked to that. It's like her body is reacting to something being pumped out by this tumor.\n\nNow, let's think about other possibilities. Could this be some kind of infection? Orbital cellulitis comes to mind, but usually, that's more on one side and comes with a fever or discharge, which she doesn't have. So, that seems less likely.\n\nWhat about a vascular issue, like a carotid-cavernous fistula? That could cause some eye symptoms too, but it doesn't quite fit with the systemic symptoms like flushing.\n\nOkay, back to the hormone idea. Her past tumor could be acting up again, producing hormones that are causing these symptoms. Carcinoid syndrome could explain the flushing and palpitations, but it doesn't usually cause eye problems like this.\n\nHmm, maybe it's not just one thing. Could the tumor be causing a mix of issues? Like, maybe it's producing hormones that are affecting her thyroid, leading to thyroid eye disease. That would tie everything together.\n\nBut let's not forget about other possibilities like an allergic reaction or angioedema. Those can cause swelling, but they don't usually affect eye movement or cause proptosis.\n\nAnd what about a paraneoplastic syndrome? Sometimes tumors cause distant effects through immune responses. That could be a wild card here.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Considering everything, thyroid eye disease still seems like a strong contender, especially with the eye symptoms. But we can't ignore the possibility of hormone secretion from the tumor causing or worsening these symptoms. It's likely a complex interplay of factors, with the tumor playing a central role.\n\nIn the end, I think we're looking at a combination of thyroid eye disease and hormone-related issues from the tumor. That seems to cover all the bases.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Thyroid Eye Disease** - This condition is known for causing symptoms like periorbital swelling, proptosis, and ophthalmoplegia, which align with the patient's presentation.\n\n2. **Orbital Cellulitis** - Although typically unilateral, it can cause swelling and eye movement issues, but usually accompanied by fever or discharge.\n\n3. **Carotid-Cavernous Fistula** - A vascular issue that can lead to eye symptoms, but it doesn't typically cause systemic symptoms like flushing.\n\n4. **Carcinoid Syndrome** - Given the patient's history, this could explain flushing and palpitations, but not the specific eye symptoms.\n\n5. **Angioedema** - Could cause swelling, but not typically proptosis or eye movement restriction.\n\n6. **Allergic Reaction** - Might cause swelling, but not usually associated with proptosis or systemic symptoms like palpitations.\n\n7. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - Tumors can cause distant immune-mediated effects, which could explain some symptoms.\n\n8. **Graves' Disease** - Similar to thyroid eye disease, it can cause proptosis and eye movement issues, often linked with thyroid dysfunction.\n\n9. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome** - Can cause eye swelling and movement issues, but often without systemic symptoms.\n\n10. **Metastatic Disease** - The new pancreatic mass could indicate a recurrence, potentially causing a range of systemic symptoms.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are **Thyroid Eye Disease** and **Carcinoid Syndrome**, as they best explain the combination of ocular and systemic symptoms. The patient's history of a neuroendocrine tumor suggests a possible interplay between hormone secretion and thyroid-related eye disease.

His skin examination revealed 3 tender, nonfluctuant 10-cm scalp plaques with overlying hemorrhagic crust and necrosis on an erythematous indurated base (Figure, left panel). Similar-appearing papules and plaques were present on the dorsal surfaces of his hands. The remainder of his physical examination was normal. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Sweet syndrome with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a man in his 60s who's been feeling really worn out lately. He's been dealing with night sweats and losing weight, which isn't something you'd expect without a reason. And then there are these strange skin lesions on his scalp and hands. They're tender and have this nasty, crusty look. That's definitely not normal.\n\nFirst off, the combination of fatigue, night sweats, and weight loss screams systemic illness to me. It's like the body is fighting something big. Could it be an infection? Maybe something like tuberculosis or another chronic infection could be at play. Those symptoms are pretty classic for that.\n\nBut then, let's focus on the skin. These lesions are not just any rash; they're tender and have a hemorrhagic crust. That sounds like something more than just a skin-deep issue. I'm thinking about conditions that cause skin necrosis. Vasculitis comes to mind, especially something like polyarteritis nodosa, which can cause these types of skin changes.\n\nOh, and let's not forget his history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Those could play a role here too. Maybe we're looking at a vascular issue? Like, could this be related to atherosclerosis somehow? That could explain the skin findings if it's a matter of poor blood supply.\n\nBut wait, there's more. The systemic symptoms and skin findings together make me think of a hematologic disorder. Conditions like leukemia or lymphoma can cause this kind of widespread effect. Hmm, maybe even a myeloproliferative disorder like myelofibrosis?\n\nNow, let's consider autoimmune diseases. They can cause all sorts of systemic havoc and skin issues. Lupus or rheumatoid arthritis might fit the bill, but the specific skin findings are making me hesitate. They don't quite match up perfectly.\n\nOh, and what about infections? We can't rule those out yet. Chronic infections like endocarditis could explain the systemic symptoms and skin findings. Those can cause embolic phenomena that lead to skin lesions.\n\nBut then, there's also the possibility of a paraneoplastic syndrome. These are conditions related to cancers that can cause all sorts of strange symptoms, including skin changes. That could be what's happening here.\n\nNow, let's think about the possibility of a nutrient deficiency. Something like vitamin C deficiency could cause skin issues, but it doesn't quite explain the whole picture here.\n\nHmm, what about sarcoidosis? It can cause systemic symptoms and skin lesions, but the specific findings here don't quite fit the usual pattern for sarcoidosis.\n\nAnd finally, let's not forget about Sweet's syndrome. It can cause fever, weight loss, and those tender skin lesions. It's a long shot, but it matches some of the key features we're seeing.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top differential diagnosis here is Sweet's syndrome. It explains the systemic symptoms and the specific skin findings pretty well. But we should definitely keep those other possibilities in mind as we move forward.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Tuberculosis** - The symptoms of fatigue, night sweats, and weight loss are classic for a chronic infection like tuberculosis.\n\n2. **Polyarteritis Nodosa** - The tender skin lesions with hemorrhagic crust and necrosis suggest a vasculitic process, which is consistent with polyarteritis nodosa.\n\n3. **Atherosclerosis** - Given the patient's history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis could contribute to skin changes due to poor blood supply.\n\n4. **Leukemia** - The systemic symptoms combined with specific skin findings could indicate a hematologic disorder like leukemia.\n\n5. **Endocarditis** - This condition can cause systemic symptoms and skin lesions due to embolic phenomena.\n\n6. **Lupus** - An autoimmune disease like lupus could explain the systemic and skin manifestations, although the specific skin findings are not entirely typical.\n\n7. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - The combination of systemic symptoms and skin changes raises the possibility of a paraneoplastic process related to an underlying malignancy.\n\n8. **Vitamin C Deficiency** - While less likely, vitamin C deficiency can cause skin issues, but it doesn't fully explain the systemic symptoms.\n\n9. **Sarcoidosis** - This condition can cause systemic symptoms and skin lesions, but the specific findings here are not classic for sarcoidosis.\n\n10. **Sweet's Syndrome** - Characterized by fever, weight loss, and tender skin lesions, Sweet's syndrome aligns well with the patient's presentation.\n\nUpon reviewing all the information, Sweet's syndrome emerges as the most likely diagnosis given the combination of systemic symptoms and specific skin findings.

A 51-year-old woman is dealing with some pretty intense dizziness, like the room is spinning, and she's got this feeling of fullness in her right ear along with some hearing loss. That's a lot to take in. She's never had anything like this before, no history of vertigo or anything, and she hasn't been sick recently or had a head injury. So, what's going on here?\n\nFirst off, the Dix-Hallpike test was positive on the right side, and that's a big clue. It's a test that's really good at picking up on BPPV, which is when these little crystals in your ear get out of place and make you dizzy. So, BPPV is definitely on the table.\n\nBut wait, she got the Epley maneuver, which is supposed to help with BPPV, and her symptoms got worse? That's odd. Maybe the Epley didn't work, or maybe we're dealing with something else. Let's not jump to conclusions just yet.\n\nOkay, so what else could it be? Vestibular neuritis could be a contender. It's known for causing vertigo, but usually, it comes with a viral infection, and she didn't have one. Still, it's worth considering.\n\nThen there's Meniere's disease. It causes vertigo, hearing loss, and ear fullness, just like she's experiencing. But, it usually has a more prolonged course, and the hearing loss is often fluctuating. Hmm, maybe, but let's keep looking.\n\nHow about acoustic neuroma? It's a type of tumor that can cause hearing loss and balance issues. But, it's usually a slow process, and she doesn't have any history that suggests this. Still, it's something to keep in mind.\n\nLet's not forget about otosclerosis. It's known for causing hearing loss, but it's not typically associated with vertigo. So, probably not that.\n\nOh, and there's labyrinthitis, which can cause hearing loss and vertigo. It's often related to an infection, but she didn't have one. Could it still be that? Maybe.\n\nNow, what about a perilymphatic fistula? That can cause vertigo and hearing loss too, but it's usually linked to trauma or surgery, neither of which she's had. So, that's probably not it.\n\nWe should also think about central causes like a stroke, but she doesn't have any other neurological symptoms, so that's unlikely.\n\nAnd then there's the possibility of an inner ear concussion. It's similar to labyrinthitis and can cause vertigo and hearing loss, but again, no trauma, so it's a stretch.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? BPPV is still a strong contender, but the worsening of symptoms after the Epley maneuver makes me think we should consider other things too. Meniere's disease seems like a good fit, given the combination of symptoms. Vestibular neuritis is still on the list, even without the infection history. And we can't completely rule out something like an acoustic neuroma, even if it's less likely.\n\nIn the end, I think Meniere's disease is the most likely cause, followed closely by BPPV and vestibular neuritis. It's a complex case, but that's where the evidence points.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's symptoms, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)** - The positive Dix-Hallpike test strongly suggests BPPV as a likely cause of the patient's dizziness and vertigo.\n\n2. **Vestibular Neuritis** - Although typically associated with a viral infection, vestibular neuritis can still be considered given the acute onset of vertigo.\n\n3. **Meniere's Disease** - The combination of vertigo, hearing loss, and ear fullness aligns with Meniere's disease, despite its usually more prolonged course.\n\n4. **Acoustic Neuroma** - This type of tumor can cause hearing loss and balance issues, but it's usually a slow-developing condition.\n\n5. **Labyrinthitis** - This condition can cause hearing loss and vertigo, often related to infection, but can still be considered without a clear infection history.\n\n6. **Ototoxicity** - Certain medications or exposures can cause ototoxicity, leading to hearing loss and vertigo, but there's no mention of such factors here.\n\n7. **Perilymphatic Fistula** - Usually associated with trauma or surgery, this is less likely given the patient's history.\n\n8. **Central Causes (e.g., Stroke)** - Unlikely due to the lack of other neurological symptoms, but should be considered in differential diagnosis.\n\n9. **Inner Ear Concussion** - Similar to labyrinthitis, it can cause vertigo and hearing loss, but typically follows trauma.\n\n10. **Cholesteatoma** - A type of skin growth in the middle ear that can cause hearing loss, but not typically vertigo, and usually has a more chronic presentation.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top three most likely diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Meniere's Disease** - Given the combination of symptoms and their acute presentation.\n2. **BPPV** - Despite the worsening of symptoms after the Epley maneuver, BPPV remains a strong contender.\n3. **Vestibular Neuritis** - Still a possibility due to the acute vertigo, even without a viral infection history.\n\nThese three conditions best fit the patient's symptom profile and the results of the diagnostic tests.", "topic": "['Vestibular Disorders', 'Otolaryngology', 'Otology', 'Audiology and Hearing']"}

That's a long time for just allergies.\n\nSo, the kid gets checked out by ophthalmology, and they have to sedate him for the exam. They can't figure out his visual acuity, but there's no issue with his pupils reacting to light. That's good, I guess. His eyelids are a bit red, and he's got a lot of eyelashes—more than usual. His conjunctiva and cornea look dry and kind of leathery. That doesn't sound healthy.\n\nThe right cornea is hazy, and there's a decent-sized defect in the epithelium with some stromal thinning. There's also a small infiltrate and some fibrin in the anterior chamber. The left cornea is hazy too, but not as bad. There's a smaller epithelial defect, but no thinning. Both eyes have optic nerve head edema, which is concerning.\n\nThey start him on some strong antibiotics, vancomycin and tobramycin. So, they're thinking bacteria. But let's not jump to conclusions yet. The MRI of his brain is normal, so it's probably not a neurological issue causing the eye problems.\n\nOkay, so what could be going on here? The first thing that comes to mind is a bacterial infection, maybe Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It's known for causing nasty corneal ulcers, especially in kids who rub their eyes a lot. But, wait, there's more to consider.\n\nThe optic nerve edema is interesting. It's not typical for a simple corneal infection. This could mean something more systemic is affecting his eyes. Hmm, what about vitamin deficiencies? His diet is really poor, so maybe he's missing some essential nutrients.\n\nVitamin A deficiency can cause corneal haze and epithelial defects. It's also known for causing night blindness, but his mom didn't mention that. Still, it's worth considering.\n\nOh, and there's the autism aspect. Kids with autism sometimes have restricted diets, which can lead to nutritional deficiencies. This could definitely be a factor here.\n\nBut let's not forget about other possible infections. Fungal infections can cause corneal haze and infiltrates too. Candida, maybe? It's less common, but it could fit.\n\nAnd what about inflammatory disorders? They can cause optic nerve edema and corneal issues. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis comes to mind. It can cause uveitis, which might explain the fibrin in the anterior chamber.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? We've got a few possibilities: bacterial infection, vitamin A deficiency, fungal infection, and inflammatory disorders like JIA. Each has some evidence supporting it, but they all have their weaknesses too.\n\nIn the end, I think vitamin A deficiency is a strong contender. The corneal findings and the dietary history make it a likely suspect. But we can't completely rule out the other possibilities without more information.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 6-year-old boy with whitening in the right eye, considering his severe autism and limited diet:\n\n1. **Bacterial Keratitis** - The corneal haze, epithelial defect, and stromal thinning, along with the use of antibiotics like vancomycin and tobramycin, suggest a bacterial infection, possibly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, especially given the history of eye rubbing.\n\n2. **Vitamin A Deficiency** - The boy's poor diet and the corneal findings, such as haze and epithelial defects, align with vitamin A deficiency, which can lead to xerophthalmia and corneal ulcers.\n\n3. **Fungal Keratitis** - Fungal infections can cause corneal infiltrates and haze. Candida is a possible culprit, especially in immunocompromised individuals or those with poor nutrition.\n\n4. **Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)** - The optic nerve edema and fibrin in the anterior chamber could suggest an inflammatory disorder like JIA, which can cause uveitis and secondary corneal changes.\n\n5. **Herpes Simplex Keratitis** - This viral infection can cause corneal epithelial defects and stromal keratitis, but it typically presents with a dendritic ulcer, which isn't mentioned here.\n\n6. **Dry Eye Syndrome** - The dry, leathery appearance of the conjunctiva and cornea could be due to dry eye syndrome, possibly exacerbated by the boy's diet and environment.\n\n7. **Lipid Keratopathy** - The corneal haze could be related to lipid deposits, potentially secondary to a metabolic or nutritional disorder.\n\n8. **Congenital Glaucoma** - Although rare at this age, congenital glaucoma can cause corneal haze and optic nerve changes, but it would typically present earlier in life.\n\n9. **Toxic Keratopathy** - Exposure to toxic substances, possibly through his environment or diet, could cause corneal damage and haze.\n\n10. **Autoimmune Keratitis** - An autoimmune process could cause the corneal and optic nerve findings, but it's less likely given the lack of systemic symptoms.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are bacterial keratitis and vitamin A deficiency, with fungal keratitis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis also being significant possibilities. Each of these conditions has some supporting evidence, but further investigation is needed to confirm the diagnosis.", "topic": "['Cornea', 'Nutrition', 'Ophthalmology', 'Psychiatry and Behavioral Health', 'Child and Adolescent Psychiatry']"}

The lesion initially occurred as an erythema in the neck and progressed centrifugally to the nape and submandibular areas. Atrophy was observed in the center of the lesion, surrounded by an erythematous border, with underlying blood vessels being visible deep to the atrophy (Figure, A). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Lipodystrophia centrifugalis abdominalis infantilis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 2-year-old girl with these skin depressions on her neck, nape, and submandibular areas. They've been there for 10 months without causing any symptoms. That's quite a while for a skin issue to just hang around without bothering her. \n\nFirst off, the fact that these lesions started as red patches and then spread outwards, leaving a sunken center with a red border, is pretty unique. It's like they're telling a story of what's been happening under the skin. \n\nOkay, so what could cause this kind of skin change in a child? My mind immediately jumps to things like port-wine stains, but those are usually more persistent and don't typically have this atrophic center. Hmm, what else? \n\nLet's think about hemangiomas. They often appear in young children and can change over time, but they tend to be more raised and red, rather than sinking into the skin. \n\nWhat about some sort of infection? There are fungal infections like tinea corporis, but they usually come with scaling, and this doesn't sound scaly at all. Plus, fungal infections would likely cause some discomfort. \n\nCould it be something autoimmune? Discoid lupus erythematosus does cause skin changes, but it's rare in kids this age and usually has other symptoms like scaling or more systemic involvement. \n\nOh, what about lichen planus? It can cause flat-topped papules, but it doesn't usually lead to atrophy, and it's not that common in young children. \n\nNow, let's not forget about trauma or post-inflammatory changes, but there's no history of injury, and the progression doesn't quite fit. \n\nWait, what about congenital dermal melanocytosis? That's more about pigmentation changes, not atrophy, so it doesn't quite match. \n\nLet's circle back to the idea of a nevus. Maybe a nevus lipomatosus superficialis? Those can be soft and flesh-colored, but they don't typically have this atrophic center. \n\nAlright, let's think about this again. The atrophy with visible blood vessels is a big clue. It makes me think of something that affects the dermis, like a dermatitis or a vascular issue. \n\nMaybe it's a type of dermatitis that's resolving, like a post-inflammatory change, but without any history of inflammation, that seems off. \n\nCould it be a type of vascular anomaly, like a fading capillary malformation? Those can change over time, but they usually don't have this distinct atrophic appearance. \n\nLet's not forget about rare conditions like lipodystrophy. It can cause changes in skin contour, but it's usually more extensive and comes with other symptoms. \n\nOkay, so what about a congenital smooth muscle hamartoma? Those can cause skin changes, but they're usually more palpable and don't typically lead to atrophy. \n\nNow, let's think about the possibility of a rare genetic condition, like a form of epidermolysis bullosa. Some types can cause skin atrophy, but they often come with blistering, which isn't mentioned here. \n\nFinally, let's consider a facial hemiatrophy, which can cause progressive changes in skin and tissue. It fits the description of atrophy with a distinct border, but it's quite rare and usually involves more than just skin changes. \n\nSo, after going through all these possibilities, I think the most likely diagnosis is a facial hemiatrophy. It matches the progressive atrophy and distinct border, even though it's rare. It seems to be the best fit for what's going on with this little girl.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnoses for the 2-year-old girl with asymptomatic skin depressions on her neck, nape, and submandibular regions are as follows:\n\n1. **Facial Hemiatrophy** - This condition can cause progressive changes in skin and tissue, matching the description of atrophy with a distinct border.\n2. **Nevus Lipomatosus Superficialis** - Although these are typically soft and flesh-colored without atrophic centers, they could be considered due to their appearance in similar regions.\n3. **Fading Capillary Malformation** - Capillary malformations can change over time, but they usually don't present with distinct atrophic centers.\n4. **Lipodystrophy** - This can cause changes in skin contour, but it's usually more extensive and comes with other symptoms.\n5. **Congenital Smooth Muscle Hamartoma** - These can cause skin changes, but they are usually more palpable and don't typically lead to atrophy.\n6. **Epidermolysis Bullosa** - Some forms can cause skin atrophy, but they often involve blistering, which is not mentioned here.\n7. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus** - Although rare in young children, it can cause skin changes, but usually with scaling or systemic involvement.\n8. **Tinea Corporis** - Fungal infections typically present with scaling and discomfort, which don't match this case.\n9. **Hemangioma** - These are common in young children but tend to be raised and red, rather than atrophic.\n10. **Port-Wine Stain** - These are persistent birthmarks that don't usually develop atrophic centers.\n\nAfter considering all possibilities, facial hemiatrophy seems to be the most fitting diagnosis given the progressive atrophy and distinct border of the lesions.

She had not experienced adverse effects after the first 2 vaccine doses on January 17 and February 5, 2021. Twelve days after the booster vaccination, she developed pruritic wheals on her face and bilateral, transient eyelid swelling. Over the next week, a pruritic rash spread over her neck, chest, trunk, and arms; each lesion faded without scarring within 24 hours. She did not experience lip, tongue, or neck swelling; shortness of breath; wheezing; chest pain; or palpitations. Application of pressure to her forearm in a circular motion using a pen cap elicited wheal and flare lesions (Figure, left panel). On physical examination, performed 17 days after the onset of rash, her vital signs were normal. She had no tongue, lip, or throat swelling, and her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Wheal and flare lesions developed on her upper eyelids during the examination and resolved after approximately 30 minutes (Figure, right panel). Light pressure applied to her skin with a tongue depressor elicited wheal and flare lesions within 3 to 5 minutes. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Inducible urticaria (symptomatic dermatographism) and acute urticaria", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. So, we've got a 27-year-old woman who just got her COVID-19 booster shot. She's healthy, and this is her third dose. She didn't have any problems with the first two shots, but now, 12 days after this one, she's got these itchy hives on her face and her eyelids are swelling. That's interesting. \n\nOkay, so the rash is spreading, but it's not leaving any scars. That's a good sign, right? It's not some kind of severe skin reaction. And she's not having any trouble breathing or swallowing, which is a relief. \n\nNow, when I hear about hives and swelling, my first thought is some kind of allergic reaction. But it's been 12 days since the vaccine. That's a bit of a delay for a typical allergic reaction, isn't it? Usually, those happen pretty quickly. \n\nLet's think about what else could be going on. Could it be an infection? But she doesn't have a fever or any other symptoms that would point to that. And it's not like she's taking any new medications that could be causing this. \n\nOh, and there's that interesting thing where if you press on her skin, you get these wheal and flare lesions. That's a sign of dermographism, isn't it? So, her skin is really reactive right now. \n\nGiven all this, I'm thinking it's some kind of hypersensitivity reaction. But delayed, so maybe a type III or type IV reaction. But wait, there's no fever or systemic symptoms, so maybe not. \n\nCould it be something like serum sickness? That can happen after vaccines sometimes, right? But usually, you'd expect some other symptoms, like fever or joint pain. \n\nLet's not forget about autoimmune progesterone dermatitis. That's a bit of a wild card, but it can cause cyclical rashes. But she didn't mention anything about her menstrual cycle, so maybe that's not it. \n\nAnd what about mastocytosis? That's a condition where you have too many mast cells, and it can cause skin reactions like this. But usually, there are other symptoms, like systemic ones. \n\nOkay, so putting it all together, I think the most likely explanation is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to the vaccine. It's not the usual immediate allergic reaction, but something that's triggered a bit later. \n\nBut let's not rule out dermographism. It's definitely playing a role here, given how her skin reacts to pressure. \n\nAnd then there's still a chance of something like autoimmune progesterone dermatitis, especially if there's a hormonal connection we're not seeing. \n\nMastocytosis is less likely, but it's still on the table. \n\nSo, in the end, I'd say it's a delayed hypersensitivity reaction, with dermographism and autoimmune progesterone dermatitis as possibilities too. Mastocytosis is a bit further down the list, but it's good to keep it in mind.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Delayed Hypersensitivity Reaction** - This is a plausible explanation given the timing and nature of the rash following the COVID-19 booster.\n\n2. **Dermographism** - The patient's skin reaction to pressure is a classic sign of dermographism, which could be a primary or secondary feature.\n\n3. **Autoimmune Progesterone Dermatitis** - Although less common, this condition could be considered, especially if there's an undiscussed hormonal component.\n\n4. **Mastocytosis** - This condition involves excessive mast cells and could explain the skin's reactivity, though systemic symptoms are typically present.\n\n5. **Urticaria** - The transient nature of the rash is characteristic of urticaria, which can be triggered by various factors, including vaccines.\n\n6. **Serum Sickness-like Reaction** - This can occur after vaccinations and is characterized by a delayed onset of symptoms, but usually includes fever or arthralgias.\n\n7. **Vaccine-Induced Immune Complex Vasculitis** - A rare possibility that could explain the skin manifestations, though typically more severe.\n\n8. **Contact Dermatitis** - Unlikely given the widespread nature of the rash, but could be considered if an allergen was introduced around the time of vaccination.\n\n9. **Erythema Multiforme** - Characterized by target lesions, which aren't described here, but could be a consideration if the rash pattern evolves.\n\n10. **Papular Urticaria** - An allergic reaction to an arthropod bite or environmental allergen could present similarly, though the timing with the vaccine is notable.\n\nUpon reviewing all the information, the top differential diagnoses are a **Delayed Hypersensitivity Reaction** and **Dermographism**, with **Autoimmune Progesterone Dermatitis** and **Mastocytosis** as secondary considerations.

At the time of the initial examination, visual acuity was 20/50 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye, with a refraction of −1.50 diopters (D) sphere in both eyes. Examination was notable for a superonasal area of pigmentation with elevation of the conjunctiva and an inferotemporally subluxed PCIOL in the right eye. Results of the fundus examination were reported to be normal in both eyes and the anterior examination of the left eye was notable for only a well-positioned PCIOL. The patient was referred to a cornea specialist for further evaluation and treatment. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, specialty evaluation occurred 10 weeks later at which time the patient complained of progressive vision loss in the right eye. Visual acuity measured hand motion in the right eye with normal intraocular pressure. The PCIOL was subluxed inferotemporally with vitreous prolapse into the anterior chamber (Figure 1A). A 4 mm × 3.1-mm superonasal pigmented scleral lesion was also noted (Figure 1B). The examination of the left eye was remarkable only for a well-centered PCIOL and iris transillumination defects. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Intraocular lens implant subluxation and extrascleral extension secondary to ciliochoroidal melanoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a middle-aged patient who's been dealing with some vision issues in the right eye for a while now. They've had cataract surgery in the past, and now there's this subluxed lens and some weird pigmentation on the sclera. That's definitely something to pay attention to.\n\nFirst off, the subluxed intraocular lens could be due to something like Marfan syndrome. It's known for causing lens subluxation, so that's a possibility. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet.\n\nNow, about that pigmented scleral lesion. It's superonasal, and there's also some vitreous prolapse into the anterior chamber. This could be a sign of a more serious issue, like a malignant tumor. Uveal melanoma comes to mind because it can present with pigmented lesions and affect the eye in this way.\n\nBut wait, there's more to consider. The left eye has iris transillumination defects. That's interesting because it could point towards conditions like ocular albinism or Waardenburg syndrome, which affect pigmentation. So, maybe we're looking at a systemic condition that affects both eyes.\n\nLet's not forget about the possibility of trauma. Even though the patient didn't report any recent trauma, a past injury could have caused the lens to sublux and maybe even contributed to the pigmented lesion. Traumatic cataract or lens subluxation could fit here.\n\nOh, and what about infections? They can cause all sorts of weird symptoms in the eye. Sympathetic ophthalmia is one possibility. It's an inflammatory condition that can follow trauma or surgery, and it might explain some of the findings.\n\nNow, considering the subluxed lens and the pigmented lesion together, we could be looking at a neoplastic process. Metastatic tumors can present with these kinds of symptoms, especially if there's a history of cancer elsewhere.\n\nBut let's not get too carried away with the scary stuff. There's also the possibility of a benign condition like a congenital scleral pigmentation. It's less dramatic, but it could explain the lesion without involving malignancy.\n\nAs for the lens subluxation, it could be due to something like homocystinuria. This metabolic disorder can cause lens subluxation and other systemic issues. It's worth considering, especially if there are other symptoms.\n\nNow, let's think about the possibility of a choroidal melanoma. These tumors can affect the eye and cause lens subluxation if they're large enough. The pigmented lesion could be related to this.\n\nFinally, there's the possibility of a scleral buckle from previous surgery. If the patient had retinal detachment surgery, a scleral buckle could explain the pigmented lesion and the lens subluxation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, here's what we've got: Marfan syndrome, uveal melanoma, ocular albinism, traumatic cataract, sympathetic ophthalmia, metastatic tumor, congenital scleral pigmentation, homocystinuria, choroidal melanoma, and scleral buckle. Each of these conditions explains some part of the patient's symptoms, and together they give us a pretty comprehensive list of possibilities.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Marfan Syndrome** - This genetic disorder is known for causing lens subluxation and could be a primary consideration given the subluxed intraocular lens.\n\n2. **Uveal Melanoma** - The pigmented scleral lesion and lens subluxation raise the suspicion of a malignant tumor like uveal melanoma.\n\n3. **Ocular Albinism** - The presence of iris transillumination defects in the left eye could suggest a condition affecting pigmentation, such as ocular albinism.\n\n4. **Traumatic Cataract** - Although the patient didn't report recent trauma, past ocular trauma could have contributed to the lens subluxation and pigmented lesion.\n\n5. **Sympathetic Ophthalmia** - This inflammatory condition can occur after trauma or surgery and might explain some of the findings.\n\n6. **Metastatic Tumor** - The combination of a subluxed lens and pigmented lesion could indicate a metastatic process, especially with a history of cancer.\n\n7. **Congenital Scleral Pigmentation** - A benign condition that could explain the scleral lesion without invoking malignancy.\n\n8. **Homocystinuria** - This metabolic disorder can cause lens subluxation and should be considered, especially if other systemic symptoms are present.\n\n9. **Choroidal Melanoma** - A choroidal melanoma could cause lens subluxation if it's sufficiently large and could be related to the pigmented lesion.\n\n10. **Scleral Buckle** - If the patient had previous retinal detachment surgery, a scleral buckle could explain the pigmented lesion and lens subluxation.\n\nEach of these conditions addresses different aspects of the patient's symptoms, providing a comprehensive list of potential diagnoses.", "topic": "['Cataract and Other Lens Disorders', 'Intraocular Tumors', 'Choroidal Disorders', 'Ophthalmology']"}

We've got a 66-year-old woman who's been dealing with some pretty painful finger ulcers and digital erythema for a while now. She's also having trouble with shortness of breath when she's active. That's interesting. And on top of that, she's got a history of hypertension, diabetes, and she's on tenofovir for chronic hepatitis B. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, those finger ulcers and livedo racemosa on her hands are really catching my attention. Livedo racemosa is often linked to blood vessel issues, like vasculitis. So, I'm thinking about conditions that involve blood vessels, like polyarteritis nodosa. That seems like a strong possibility right off the bat.\n\nBut wait, there's more to consider. She's also experiencing dyspnea on exertion and has crackles in her lungs. That's pointing towards something pulmonary. Hmm, could this be related to an autoimmune process? Maybe something like systemic sclerosis, which can affect the lungs and skin.\n\nNow, let's not forget about her anemia. A hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL is a bit low. Anemia can be a sign of a chronic disease or even something like aplastic anemia. But, aplastic anemia doesn't quite fit with the skin and lung findings, so maybe it's not that.\n\nOh, and her normal creatine kinase level is interesting too. That makes me think we can rule out muscle diseases like dermatomyositis, which usually have elevated muscle enzymes.\n\nSo, what about other possibilities? Well, rheumatoid arthritis could explain the joint-related ulcers and lung issues, but it doesn't quite match the livedo racemosa. And lupus? It can cause a mix of skin and systemic symptoms, but the specific pattern here doesn't scream lupus to me.\n\nNow, let's think about the treatments she's on. Tenofovir is used for hepatitis B, but it's not really known for causing these kinds of skin or lung problems. So, I don't think that's a factor here.\n\nHmm, what about cryoglobulinemic vasculitis? That could fit with the ulcers, livedo racemosa, and maybe even the lung issues. It's often linked to hepatitis B or C, so that's a strong contender.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. We should also consider other vasculitic syndromes, like granulomatosis with polyangiitis. That can affect the lungs and skin too, but it usually has more upper respiratory tract involvement, which she doesn't have.\n\nAlright, let's put it all together. Based on everything, I think cryoglobulinemic vasculitis is the most likely diagnosis. It ties together the skin findings, lung symptoms, and her hepatitis B history. Yeah, that seems to make the most sense.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Polyarteritis Nodosa** - This condition is characterized by vasculitis that can lead to skin findings like livedo racemosa and digital ulcers.\n\n2. **Systemic Sclerosis** - This autoimmune disease can cause skin changes, including digital ulcers, and pulmonary involvement such as crackles in the lungs.\n\n3. **Cryoglobulinemic Vasculitis** - Often associated with hepatitis B or C, this condition can present with skin ulcers, livedo racemosa, and systemic symptoms.\n\n4. **Rheumatoid Arthritis** - While it primarily affects joints, rheumatoid arthritis can also cause skin ulcers and lung issues, though livedo racemosa is less common.\n\n5. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus** - This autoimmune disease can present with a variety of systemic symptoms, including skin and lung involvement, but the specific pattern here is less typical.\n\n6. **Dermatomyositis** - Although it often presents with skin rash and muscle weakness, the normal creatine kinase level makes this less likely.\n\n7. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis** - This condition can affect the lungs and skin, but typically involves the upper respiratory tract, which is not prominent here.\n\n8. **Aplastic Anemia** - Could explain the anemia, but not the skin and lung findings.\n\n9. **Churg-Strauss Syndrome** - An eosinophilic vasculitis that can involve the lungs, but usually includes asthma and eosinophilia, which are not mentioned.\n\n10. **Mixed Connective Tissue Disease** - Overlaps features of several autoimmune diseases, but the specific findings here don't strongly suggest this diagnosis.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Cryoglobulinemic Vasculitis** emerges as the most likely diagnosis, given the combination of skin findings, lung symptoms, and the patient's hepatitis B history.

That sounds uncomfortable.\n\nWhen I examine him, there's a tiny 3-mm nodule deep in his neck wound along the sternocleidomastoid muscle. It's tender, but his facial nerve is working fine, and he feels normal sensation in his earlobe. That's good to know.\n\nSo, I ordered an MRI to get a better look at what's going on. But, surprisingly, the MRI didn't show any focal lesions in the parotid glands or where the nodule is on the sternocleidomastoid muscle. That's a bit puzzling.\n\nGiven his history, I'm thinking about the possibility of a recurrence of his Warthin tumor. It's not common, but it could happen. I should also consider other benign conditions like a pleomorphic adenoma or even something like a branchial cleft cyst. But, I can't ignore the possibility of something more serious like a mucoepidermoid carcinoma or adenoid cystic carcinoma. \n\nOh, and there's also the chance of a nerve-related issue, like neuroma or nerve entrapment, especially since the pain is worse with movement. And let's not forget about more common things like a lipoma or an epidermoid cyst. \n\nBut wait, the MRI didn't show anything. That makes me think it could be something small, like a sialolith or a benign lymphadenopathy. Maybe it's even a neuroma or some kind of nerve irritation. \n\nI should also consider if this could be related to his previous surgery, like a suture granuloma. That would make sense given the location and his symptoms. \n\nSo, what's the best way to figure this out? An excisional biopsy should give us a definitive answer. That way, we can see exactly what's causing the problem.\n\nAfter thinking it through, here's my list of possibilities: \n\n1. Warthin Tumor Recurrence\n2. Pleomorphic Adenoma\n3. Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma\n4. Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma\n5. Neuroma\n6. Nerve Entrapment\n7. Lipoma\n8. Epidermoid Cyst\n9. Sialolith\n10. Suture Granuloma\n\nNow, let's rank these based on everything we know. The recurrence of a Warthin tumor seems likely, but the MRI not showing anything makes me hesitant. Pleomorphic adenoma is possible, but it's not as common in this scenario. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma are more aggressive options, but there's no strong evidence pointing to them yet. \n\nNeuroma or nerve entrapment could explain the pain, especially since it's related to movement. Lipoma and epidermoid cyst are benign and possible, but they don't quite fit the symptoms perfectly. Sialolith is a long shot since it's more common in salivary glands, not the neck. \n\nSuture granuloma is interesting because it matches the location and symptoms well, considering his surgical history. \n\nSo, after going through everything, I think suture granuloma is the most likely cause. It fits with the pain, the lump, and his history. That seems like the best explanation for now.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided and the process of elimination, the most likely diagnosis for the 63-year-old man is a suture granuloma. This conclusion is drawn from the history of previous surgery, the presence of a painful lump at the surgical site, and the fact that the MRI did not show any focal lesions. Suture granulomas can develop as a reaction to sutures left in place during previous surgeries, which aligns with the symptoms and findings in this case. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. Suture Granuloma\n2. Warthin Tumor Recurrence\n3. Neuroma\n4. Nerve Entrapment\n5. Pleomorphic Adenoma\n6. Epidermoid Cyst\n7. Lipoma\n8. Sialolith\n9. Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma\n10. Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma\n\nThis ranking considers the clinical presentation, the negative MRI findings, and the history of prior parotid surgery, making suture granuloma the most plausible explanation.", "topic": "['Otolaryngology', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Pain Medicine', 'Neurology', 'Neuromuscular Diseases']"}

She denied experiencing pain, diplopia, muscle weakness, dysarthria, dysphagia, difficulty breathing, or other neurologic deficits. On examination, corrected visual acuity was 20/20 bilaterally, with normal color vision, visual fields, intraocular pressure, extraocular movements, alignment, and pupils. External examination was notable for left upper eyelid ptosis (Figure 1), with a margin-to-reflex distance 1 of 3.5 mm on the right and 0.5 mm on the left, intact levator function, and no fatiguability on sustained upgaze. There was no evidence of eyelid edema, erythema, or tenderness to palpation. There were no palpable adnexal masses or orbital rim deformities, but there was mild fullness in the left superior sulcus and mildly increased left-sided resistance to retropulsion. However, Hertel exophthalmometry did not reveal any relative proptosis. No lacrimal gland abnormalities or conjunctival masses were seen with upper eyelid eversion. There was no palpable preauricular or cervical lymphadenopathy. Slitlamp and fundus examination findings were normal. Serological testing results for antiacetylcholine receptor antibody were negative. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Unilateral ptosis secondary to mantle cell lymphoma of the left lacrimal gland", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her 60s who's been dealing with this left-sided droopy eyelid for about 9 months now. It's getting worse, especially when she's tired or at night. That's interesting. She's got a history of hyperlipidemia and hypothyroidism, and she's used to having migraines. But she's not complaining of any pain or double vision, which is good. So, what's going on here?\n\nFirst off, myasthenia gravis comes to mind. It's known for causing muscle weakness that gets worse with use, but usually, you'd expect some other symptoms like muscle weakness or double vision. And hey, the antiacetylcholine receptor antibody test came back negative, so that's not really fitting.\n\nNext, let's think about Horner's syndrome. It can cause ptosis too, but you'd usually see some other stuff like a constricted pupil or drooping of the nostril on the same side. She doesn't have those, so it doesn't seem to match.\n\nChronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia could be another possibility. It's more about gradual weakness, but it usually involves the eye muscles too, and she doesn't have any issues with her eye movements. So, that's probably not it.\n\nHow about a lacrimal gland tumor? There's some fullness in the left superior sulcus, which could suggest something going on in that area. But there's no real proptosis or other signs of a mass, so it's hard to say.\n\nMaybe it's something like amyloidosis. That can cause ptosis, and it might not have other obvious symptoms right away. It's a bit of a long shot, but it could fit.\n\nOr could it be something related to her thyroid? She's got hypothyroidism, and while that's usually more about being sluggish, maybe it's playing a role here. But without more symptoms, it's tough to pin it on that.\n\nWhat about a orbital pseudotumor? That's an option when you have some resistance to retropulsion, but there's no pain or swelling, which you'd often expect.\n\nHmm, how about a carotid-cavernous fistula? That can cause some eye symptoms, but you'd usually hear a whooshing sound in the ear or see some pulsation, and she doesn't have that.\n\nLet's not forget about an orbital varix. That could cause some fullness, but it would usually change with head position, and she doesn't have that either.\n\nLastly, there's the idea of a sphenoid wing meningioma. It's a bit of a rare bird, but it could cause some localized symptoms like this. It's worth considering.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top contenders are a lacrimal gland tumor, amyloidosis, and maybe that sphenoid wing meningioma. They all have some features that line up with what she's experiencing. We should probably look into those further.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the woman's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Myasthenia Gravis** - Although the antibody test was negative, clinical presentation can sometimes precede serological evidence.\n2. **Horner's Syndrome** - Despite the lack of miosis or anhidrosis, it's worth considering due to the ptosis.\n3. **Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)** - Typically involves eye movement issues, but could present atypically.\n4. **Lacrimal Gland Tumor** - The fullness in the superior sulcus raises suspicion of a mass in that area.\n5. **Amyloidosis** - Can cause ptosis with minimal other symptoms in early stages.\n6. **Hypothyroidism-related Myopathy** - Although less common, hypothyroidism can contribute to muscle-related issues.\n7. **Orbital Pseudotumor** - Considered due to resistance on retropulsion, despite lack of pain or swelling.\n8. **Carotid-Cavernous Fistula** - Usually presents with other symptoms like a bruit, but shouldn't be entirely ruled out.\n9. **Orbital Varix** - Could cause intermittent symptoms, but typically varies with position.\n10. **Sphenoid Wing Meningioma** - A rare possibility that could cause localized symptoms without extensive neurological deficits.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are a **Lacrimal Gland Tumor**, **Amyloidosis**, and **Sphenoid Wing Meningioma**, as they best align with the clinical presentation and findings.

The lesions occurred as symmetrical white and transparent papules, white keratosis, excessive wrinkling on the dorsum of hands after water immersion and worsened in summer, and remitted in winter. He was treated with topical tretinoin ointment intermittently per a diagnosis of chronic eczema at the local clinic with little improvement. The lesions gradually aggravated, and the affected area dispersed to wrists and elbows during past the 1.5 years. He attributed these changes to the need for washing hands frequently in the period of the COVID-19 epidemic. He had no family history of similar skin problems and did not have a history of hyperhidrosis, cystic fibrosis, atopy, or trauma to the hands. Physical examination showed some changes emerged on both hands after water immersion contrasting with any other condition (Figure, A and B). We took a skin biopsy specimen from white papules on the right hand, and representative histopathologic features are shown in the Figure, C and D. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a young guy in his 20s with this weird skin issue on his hands. He's been dealing with thickening and swelling after his hands get wet, and it's been itchy and burning for three years. That's a long time to be uncomfortable! The way he describes it, these white, transparent bumps show up, and his hands get all wrinkly after being in water. It's like something out of a sci-fi movie. And it gets worse in the summer. That's interesting.\n\nSo, what could this be? My first thought is some kind of eczema, maybe dyshidrotic eczema. It's known for causing blisters and itching, especially on the hands. But wait, he's already been treated for chronic eczema with tretinoin, and it didn't really help. So, maybe it's not that.\n\nLet's think about other possibilities. Hyperkeratosis comes to mind. It's when the skin gets all thick and rough. Could be something like tylosis or another type of hyperkeratosis. But, he doesn't have a family history of this, so maybe not.\n\nWhat about something more systemic? Cystic fibrosis can cause skin changes, but he doesn't have any other symptoms like respiratory issues or digestive problems. So, that's probably not it.\n\nAquagenic keratosis is another possibility. It's this rare condition where the skin reacts to water. The timing and symptoms fit pretty well. But, is it really that rare? Maybe I should keep looking.\n\nLet's not forget about contact dermatitis. It's common, and he's been washing his hands a lot because of COVID-19. But, the symmetrical nature of the rash and the fact that it's specifically triggered by water make me think it's not just contact dermatitis.\n\nI should also consider other conditions like papular acantholytic dermatosis or even Darier's disease. They have distinct skin manifestations, but they don't quite fit the bill here.\n\nOkay, let's take a closer look at the histopathology. The biopsy might give us some clues. If it shows specific features like spongiosis or acantholysis, that could point us in the right direction.\n\nAfter thinking it through, aquagenic keratosis seems to fit the best. The way the skin changes with water exposure and the lack of response to eczema treatments make it a strong contender. But, I should still consider other possibilities like hereditary papulotranslucent acanthoma or even an unusual presentation of eczema.\n\nIn the end, I'm leaning towards aquagenic keratosis. It matches the symptoms and the water-triggered nature of the condition. But, I'll keep an open mind and consider other diagnoses if new information comes up.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the condition described:\n\n1. **Dyshidrotic Eczema** - Known for causing blisters and itching on the hands, especially in warm weather.\n2. **Aquagenic Keratosis** - A rare condition where the skin reacts to water, leading to papules and wrinkling.\n3. **Hyperkeratosis** - Characterized by thickening of the skin, which could be related to tylosis or other forms of hyperkeratosis.\n4. **Contact Dermatitis** - Could be due to frequent hand washing, especially with harsh soaps during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n5. **Papular Acantholytic Dermatosis** - A condition with distinct skin manifestations that could resemble the described papules.\n6. **Darier's Disease** - A genetic disorder that affects the skin, although it typically presents differently.\n7. **Cystic Fibrosis** - Although unlikely, it can cause skin changes; however, other systemic symptoms are typically present.\n8. **Hereditary Papulotranslucent Acanthoma** - A rare condition that could fit the description of water-triggered skin changes.\n9. **Focal Palmoplantar Keratoderma** - A type of hyperkeratosis that affects the palms and soles.\n10. **Idiopathic Gutate Hypomelanosis** - Typically involves hypopigmented spots, but could be considered given the unusual presentation.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Aquagenic Keratosis** remains the most likely diagnosis due to the specific symptoms triggered by water exposure and the lack of response to eczema treatments.

Wound cultures and blood cultures obtained during incision and drainage performed on hospital day 1 were negative for bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal organisms. The following day, her temperature was 39.4 °C (102.9 °F), blood pressure was 86/42 mm Hg, and heart rate was 131/min. She was transferred to the intensive care unit for presumed septic shock, and her antibiotics were changed to vancomycin and meropenem. Surgical debridement of the right thigh was performed on hospital day 3. On hospital day 4, a new purple dusky border developed along the wound edge, and the patent underwent a second surgical debridement. After debridement on hospital day 5, her temperature was 39.8 °C (103.6 °F), and she required vasopressor infusion with norepinephrine for shock. Her right thigh had a deep 9 × 8–cm ulcer with a dusky violaceous border extending 2 to 5 cm from the wound edge (Figure, left), with many 1- to 2-mm pustules (not visible in Figure). Laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 30 000/μL (88% neutrophils); lactate level, 77.5 mg/dL (8.6 mmol/L); and procalcitonin level, 16.1 ng/mL (reference, <0.1 ng/mL). Histologic examination of the tissue obtained during the second surgical debridement revealed ulceration with extensive neutrophilic inflammation (Figure, right).

We've got a young woman who just gave birth and now has a painful, swollen area on her thigh where she got a methergine injection. That's interesting because methergine can cause some strong reactions. \n\nFirst off, could this be a simple bacterial infection? It's possible, but she's already been on antibiotics for a few days without much improvement. That's a bit odd. \n\nMaybe it's a more aggressive type of bacteria, like necrotizing fasciitis. That's serious stuff and would explain why she's so sick. But wait, all those cultures came back negative. Hmm, that's strange for a typical bacterial infection. \n\nCould it be a viral infection? Viruses can cause some weird skin reactions, but they don't usually cause this kind of severe tissue damage and systemic inflammation. \n\nWhat about a fungal infection? Fungal infections can be nasty, but again, the cultures are negative. Plus, she's not immunocompromised as far as we know. \n\nOh, maybe it's an atypical infection, like mycobacterial? Those can be sneaky and take a while to show up in cultures. But still, the rapid progression seems off. \n\nNow, let's think about non-infectious causes. Could it be an abscess? But wouldn't that show up somehow in the cultures or respond to antibiotics? \n\nWhat if it's some kind of autoimmune reaction? That could explain the inflammation and negative cultures. But usually, those don't progress this fast. \n\nHmm, could it be a vascular issue, like a thrombosis? That might cause tissue necrosis, but it doesn't quite fit with the systemic signs of infection. \n\nOh, what about a severe drug reaction, like Stevens-Johnson syndrome? That could cause skin and mucosal damage, but it's not quite right for this scenario. \n\nLet's go back to necrotizing fasciitis. Even though the cultures are negative, maybe it's just not showing up yet. That would explain the rapid progression and severity of her condition. \n\nBut wait, let's not forget about toxic shock syndrome. That could cause a similar systemic response and skin changes. But usually, you'd expect to find some bacterial toxin involvement. \n\nAlright, let's think about Sweet's syndrome. That's a condition with neutrophilic inflammation that could fit here. It's rare, but it matches the negative cultures and systemic inflammation. \n\nSo, after going through all of this, I think Sweet's syndrome makes the most sense. It explains the symptoms, the negative cultures, and the systemic condition. Yeah, that seems to be the best fit.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, ensuring that each step presents a unique hypothesis and considering the negative cultures and systemic symptoms:\n\n1. **Necrotizing Fasciitis** - This condition is characterized by rapidly progressing inflammation and necrosis of soft tissue, which aligns with the patient's symptoms and surgical findings.\n\n2. **Toxic Shock Syndrome** - Although typically associated with bacterial toxins, this syndrome can present with severe systemic symptoms and skin changes, similar to what the patient is experiencing.\n\n3. **Sweet's Syndrome (Acute Febrile Neutrophilic Dermatosis)** - This condition involves neutrophilic inflammation and can present with systemic symptoms and negative cultures, fitting the patient's presentation.\n\n4. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum** - A skin condition that can cause severe ulcers and is often associated with systemic diseases, but usually doesn't present with such acute systemic inflammation.\n\n5. **Clostridial Myonecrosis (Gas Gangrene)** - A rapidly progressing infection that causes muscle necrosis, but would likely show positive cultures for Clostridium species.\n\n6. **Viral Hemorrhagic Fever** - Could cause systemic symptoms and skin changes, but is less likely given the negative cultures and lack of travel history.\n\n7. **Fungal Infection** - Although cultures are negative, certain fungal infections can be aggressive and cause similar symptoms, especially in immunocompromised individuals.\n\n8. **Mycobacterial Infection** - Can present with chronic symptoms, but the rapid progression here makes it less likely.\n\n9. **Warfarin-Induced Skin Necrosis** - Associated with warfarin use and can cause skin necrosis, but there's no mention of anticoagulant use.\n\n10. **Calciphylaxis** - A condition involving vascular calcification and skin necrosis, usually in patients with renal failure, which doesn't fit this patient's profile.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Necrotizing Fasciitis** remains the most likely diagnosis due to the rapid progression of symptoms and surgical findings, despite negative cultures. However, **Sweet's Syndrome** is also a strong contender given the neutrophilic inflammation and negative cultures. **Toxic Shock Syndrome** should also be considered due to the systemic symptoms and skin changes. Each of these conditions could explain the patient's presentation, but necrotizing fasciitis is the most urgent to address given its rapid progression and potential severity.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Surgery', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine']"}

She reported no history of facial trauma, recent travel, illicit drug use, or high-risk sexual behavior. The nasal deformity, which she attributed to use of her CPAP mask, had developed gradually over the past several years. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) with rapidly progressive pauci-immune glomerulonephritis (RPGN)", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 63-year-old woman who's been dealing with pain in her hands, wrists, and feet for a few months. She's got osteoarthritis and uses a CPAP for sleep apnea. The pain is in the first metacarpophalangeal joints, which is interesting. Those are the big knuckles at the base of the fingers. Hmm, that's not the usual spot for osteoarthritis, which makes me think there might be something else going on.\n\nOkay, so the X-rays from a month ago showed degenerative changes, but no bone erosions. That's good to know because it helps rule out some types of arthritis that eat away at the bones, like rheumatoid arthritis. But, it doesn't completely rule it out either, since early rheumatoid arthritis might not show up on X-rays yet.\n\nNow, let's talk about the nasal deformity. She's got a weird shape to her nasal bridge, and she says it's from her CPAP mask. But, she's had this develop over a few years, which seems odd if it's just from the mask. This makes me think of something like a saddle nose deformity. That can happen with conditions like relapsing polychondritis, which attacks cartilage, or granulomatosis with polyangiitis, formerly called Wegener's granulomatosis. Both of these can cause nasal problems and joint pain.\n\nSo, what else could it be? Well, osteoarthritis is on the table, but it doesn't explain the nasal issue. Rheumatoid arthritis is still a possibility, even without bone erosions yet. Psoriatic arthritis could fit too, especially if there are skin changes, but she doesn't have any skin problems mentioned. Hmm, maybe it's something less common like gout or pseudogout, but those usually have different joint patterns and often involve crystal deposits, which we don't have evidence of here.\n\nLet's not forget about infectious causes. Bacterial or fungal infections could cause joint and nasal symptoms, but she doesn't have any fever or systemic symptoms, which makes that less likely. And then there's the possibility of a systemic autoimmune disease like lupus, which can cause a wide range of symptoms, but again, we don't have a lot of other clues pointing that way.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Relapsing polychondritis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis are both strong contenders because they explain the nasal deformity and joint pain. But, I can't completely rule out rheumatoid arthritis yet, especially since it can start without obvious X-ray changes. Osteoarthritis is less likely to be the main issue here, given the atypical joint involvement and nasal symptoms.\n\nIn the end, I think relapsing polychondritis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis are the top suspects. They fit the symptoms best, especially with that nasal deformity. I'll keep rheumatoid arthritis on the list, but it's not my first choice right now. This is a tough one, but I feel like we're on the right track.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with a focus on explaining the joint pain and nasal deformity:\n\n1. **Relapsing Polychondritis** - This condition is characterized by cartilage inflammation and could explain both the nasal deformity and joint pain.\n2. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegener's Granulomatosis)** - This autoimmune disease can cause nasal deformities and joint pain, fitting the patient's symptoms well.\n3. **Rheumatoid Arthritis** - Although the X-rays show no erosions, early rheumatoid arthritis might not yet present with bone changes, and it can cause joint pain.\n4. **Psoriatic Arthritis** - This could be a consideration if there were skin changes, but none are mentioned; it can involve joint pain and occasionally nasal symptoms.\n5. **Osteoarthritis** - While the patient has a history of osteoarthritis, it typically doesn't involve the metacarpophalangeal joints or cause nasal deformities.\n6. **Gout** - Known for causing joint pain, but usually involves crystal deposits and more acute episodes, which aren't described here.\n7. **Pseudogout** - Similar to gout but caused by calcium pyrophosphate crystals; it's less likely without evidence of crystal deposition.\n8. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus** - A systemic autoimmune disease that can cause a wide range of symptoms, including joint pain, but usually with other systemic manifestations.\n9. **Nasal Septic Perforation** - Could cause a nasal deformity, but would typically be associated with nasal symptoms or a history of drug use or infection.\n10. **Sarcoidosis** - Can involve both joint and nasal manifestations, although it's less commonly considered without respiratory or skin involvement.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are **Relapsing Polychondritis** and **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis**, as they best explain the combination of nasal deformity and joint pain. **Rheumatoid Arthritis** remains a consideration due to the potential for early presentation without X-ray changes.", "topic": "['Nephrology', 'Rheumatology', 'Pulmonary Medicine']"}

Her ocular history included bilateral cataract surgery 5 years prior. Review of systems yielded negative results, including for ocular trauma, jaundice, and cutaneous melanoma.

On the fundus evaluation, large pockets of subretinal fluid suggested choroidal effusion based on marked fluid shifting with head position.

B-scans also exhibited a solid lesion from the 6- to 10-o’clock meridians with irregular shape and variable internal reflectivity, measuring 5.8 mm in height.

Hmm, that could mean something's going on inside the eye.\n\nNow, they found something suspicious in the back of her eye, a possible retinal detachment and a mass. That's concerning. Choroidal melanoma immediately comes to mind because it's a common primary eye tumor in adults. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet.\n\nHer past medical history shows cataract surgery five years ago, but nothing else that really stands out. No trauma, no jaundice, no skin melanoma.

Hmm, this could still be a melanoma, but let's keep an open mind.\n\nThe MRI should help us figure out if this mass is separate from any bleeding. That's crucial information. In the meantime, she's on steroids to reduce the swelling and painkillers, but there's not much improvement. That's frustrating.\n\nSo, what else could this be? Choroidal melanoma is still top of the list, but let's consider other possibilities. A choroidal hemorrhage could explain the symptoms, especially with the low intraocular pressure. But would it account for the solid mass?\n\nCentral serous chorioretinopathy is another thought, but it usually doesn't cause such a prominent mass or this level of pain. Maybe a metastatic tumor? That could mimic melanoma, especially if there's no primary site found yet.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about posterior scleritis. It can cause choroidal effusion and a mass-like appearance. The low intraocular pressure and pain fit too. This might be a strong contender.\n\nAfter thinking it through, I'd say posterior scleritis is a good fit for what's going on. It explains the effusion, the mass, the low pressure, and the pain. Choroidal melanoma is still a possibility, but posterior scleritis seems more likely given the symptoms and test results.\n\nSo, here's the revised list: \n\n1. Posterior Scleritis\n2. Choroidal Melanoma\n3. Choroidal Hemorrhage\n4. Metastatic Tumor\n5. Central Serous Chorioretinopathy\n6. Vitreous Hemorrhage\n7. Retinal Detachment\n8. Uveal Effusion Syndrome\n9. Choroidal Detachment\n10. Intraocular Inflammation\n\nYeah, that feels like a more accurate ranking given everything we know.\n\n### FINAL RESPONSE:\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnosis for the condition described is as follows:\n\n1. **Posterior Scleritis** - This condition can cause choroidal effusion, a mass-like appearance, low intraocular pressure, and pain, making it a strong contender given the symptoms and test results.\n2. **Choroidal Melanoma** - Although it's a common primary eye tumor in adults, the low intraocular pressure and lack of improvement with treatment make it less likely compared to posterior scleritis.\n3. **Choroidal Hemorrhage** - This could explain some symptoms, but it doesn't fully account for the solid mass observed.\n4. **Metastatic Tumor** - Could mimic melanoma, but there's no known primary site, making it less likely.\n5. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy** - Typically doesn't cause a prominent mass or significant pain.\n6. **Vitreous Hemorrhage** - Could contribute to vision issues, but doesn't explain the mass or effusion.\n7. **Retinal Detachment** - Observed, but likely secondary to other underlying issues.\n8. **Uveal Effusion Syndrome** - Could cause choroidal effusion, but the presence of a solid mass is atypical.\n9. **Choroidal Detachment** - Often associated with other conditions, such as scleritis or trauma.\n10. **Intraocular Inflammation** - May be present, but more likely secondary to another condition like posterior scleritis.\n\nPosterior scleritis emerges as the most likely diagnosis given the combination of symptoms and test results.", "topic": "['Oncology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Lung Cancer', 'Choroidal Disorders', 'Retinal Disorders']"}

The patient underwent right-sided ptosis repair at another hospital less than 1 year earlier without improvement. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/30 OU, and pupil examination revealed no anisocoria or afferent pupillary defect. Color vision was full in both eyes. External examination revealed a margin reflex distance 1 (MRD1) of 0 mm OD, 4 mm OS without fatigability in extended upgaze (Figure 1A). The patient had a small exotropia in primary gaze with a −2 supraduction deficit. No proptosis was observed. An ice pack was applied in the clinic to the ptotic eyelid for 2 minutes, which led to a 1.5-mm improvement (Figure 1B) in ptosis and no appreciable change in strabismus. The patient reported no associated headache, weakness, or difficulty swallowing. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Superior divisional oculomotor nerve palsy due to internal carotid artery aneurysm", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a patient in their 60s with fluctuating diplopia and worsening right upper eyelid ptosis. Hmm, fluctuating symptoms make me think of something that comes and goes, like myasthenia gravis. That's a classic one for this kind of presentation.\n\nNow, they had surgery for the ptosis less than a year ago, but it didn't help. That's interesting. If it was something like a simple anatomical issue, you'd expect surgery to fix it, right? So maybe it's something more complex or neurological.\n\nThe visual acuity is slightly off at 20/30 in both eyes, but pupils are normal, and there's no anisocoria or afferent pupillary defect. That's good to know because it rules out some of the more serious neurological issues that might affect the pupils.\n\nThe external exam shows a margin reflex distance of 0 mm on the right and 4 mm on the left. That's a big difference. And there's a supraduction deficit too. Hmm, that's pointing towards something affecting the muscles around the eye.\n\nThe ice pack test was done, and it actually helped with the ptosis a bit. That's a big clue! Myasthenia gravis often shows improvement with cold, so that's fitting.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. There are other things that could cause these symptoms. Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) comes to mind. It's a mitochondrial disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness, but it doesn't usually fluctuate like this.\n\nHorner's syndrome could cause ptosis, but we'd expect some pupil changes, like miosis, and maybe some other symptoms like lack of sweating. We're not seeing any of that here.\n\nHow about ocular myasthenia gravis? That's a strong contender. It's known for causing fluctuating muscle weakness, especially around the eyes, and it would explain the diplopia and ptosis.\n\nBut let's not forget about other myopathies, like inclusion body myositis. It's less common, but it could cause muscle weakness. However, it doesn't usually have the same kind of fluctuating symptoms.\n\nWe should also think about mechanical issues, like a dehiscence of the levator aponeurosis. That could cause ptosis, but it wouldn't explain the fluctuating symptoms or the positive ice pack test.\n\nLambert-Eaton syndrome is another neuromuscular disorder, but it usually causes more widespread muscle weakness and has a different kind of presentation.\n\nAnd what about orbital myositis? That's inflammation of the eye muscles, which could cause ptosis and diplopia. But it would likely come with some pain or swelling, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, ocular myasthenia gravis seems like the most likely cause. The fluctuating symptoms, positive ice pack test, and lack of pupil involvement all point to that. But we should keep an open mind and consider other possibilities like CPEO or orbital myositis if new information comes to light.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's symptoms, with a focus on conditions that could cause fluctuating diplopia and worsening right upper eyelid ptosis:\n\n1. **Ocular Myasthenia Gravis** - This condition is known for causing fluctuating muscle weakness around the eyes, which aligns with the patient's symptoms and the positive ice pack test.\n\n2. **Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)** - A mitochondrial disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness, although it typically does not present with fluctuating symptoms.\n\n3. **Horner's Syndrome** - Could cause ptosis, but is usually accompanied by pupil changes like miosis and other symptoms such as anhidrosis, which are not present here.\n\n4. **Inclusion Body Myositis** - A myopathy that could cause muscle weakness, but it doesn't typically present with the same kind of fluctuating symptoms.\n\n5. **Dehiscence of the Levator Aponeurosis** - A mechanical issue that could cause ptosis, but would not explain the fluctuating symptoms or the positive ice pack test.\n\n6. **Lambert-Eaton Syndrome** - A neuromuscular disorder that usually causes more widespread muscle weakness and has a different presentation.\n\n7. **Orbital Myositis** - Inflammation of the eye muscles that could cause ptosis and diplopia, but is often associated with pain or swelling, which is not mentioned.\n\n8. **Third Cranial Nerve Palsy** - Could cause ptosis and diplopia, but often involves pupil changes and more extensive muscle weakness.\n\n9. **Orbital Pseudotumor** - A condition that could cause inflammation and muscle restriction, but typically involves pain or proptosis.\n\n10. **Mitochondrial Neurogastrointestinal Encephalomyopathy (MNGIE)** - A rare condition that can cause ophthalmoplegia and ptosis, but is usually accompanied by other systemic symptoms.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Ocular Myasthenia Gravis** remains the most likely diagnosis due to the fluctuating nature of the symptoms, the positive ice pack test, and the absence of pupil involvement.

He also had asthenia and mild intermittent arthralgias. Physical examination revealed multiple millimetric erythematous to hyperpigmented monomorphic keratotic papules involving the head, trunk, and extremities. Symmetric annular brown erythematous plaques on the cheeks and temples were also seen. There were no vesicles or pustules (Figure, A and B). Laboratory investigations revealed a normal white blood cell count, mild anemia (hemoglobin level, 11.3 g/dL; normal level 12.50-15.50 g/dL; to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0), hypocomplementemia, and moderate proteinuria.

Anti-dsDNA antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, rheumatoid factor, IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibody, and anti-β2 glycoprotein 1 antibody results were negative. A biopsy specimen obtained from an erythematous papule on the trunk and stained with hematoxylin-eosin is shown in the Figure, C and D. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Nonbullous neutrophilic lupus erythematosus", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a teenage boy with these skin lesions that started on his face and then spread all over. They're not causing him any pain or discomfort, which is interesting. He's also feeling a bit tired and has some joint pain now and then. That's something to keep in mind.\n\nWhen I look at his lab results, I see that he's got a normal white blood cell count, but he's mildly anemic. That's a bit concerning. He's also got low complement levels and some protein in his urine. Hmm, that's pointing towards something systemic, maybe autoimmune.\n\nNow, let's talk about the autoimmune tests. He's got a high level of antinuclear antibodies, and that's a big clue. Plus, there are anti-Smith, SSA/Ro, SSB/La, and anti-U1RNP antibodies showing up. But, he's negative for anti-dsDNA and other antibodies like lupus anticoagulant. That's a bit of a mixed bag.\n\nOkay, so what could this be? My first thought is systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) because of the positive ANA and other antibodies. But, the negative anti-dsDNA is throwing me off a bit. Let's keep that in mind and move on.\n\nNext, I'm thinking about discoid lupus erythematosus. The skin lesions fit, but the systemic symptoms like proteinuria and anemia are making me hesitate. DLE usually doesn't have those.\n\nThen there's subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. The annular plaques on his face make me think of this, and it can have some systemic involvement. But, I'm not sure it explains everything.\n\nI should also consider mixed connective tissue disease. The presence of anti-U1RNP antibodies is a hint, and it can have features of lupus, but something feels off.\n\nMaybe I should think about dermatomyositis. The skin lesions are a bit similar, and it can have systemic involvement, but I'm not seeing the typical muscle weakness.\n\nOh, and there's also rosacea. The facial lesions could fit, but the rest of the symptoms don't match up. It's unlikely to cause proteinuria or anemia.\n\nNow, let's not forget about sarcoidosis. It can cause skin lesions and systemic symptoms, but the antibody profile doesn't quite fit.\n\nI should also think about lichen planus. The skin lesions could match, but the systemic symptoms and antibody profile are not typical.\n\nAnd then there's psoriasis. The skin lesions could fit, but the systemic symptoms and antibody profile are not matching up.\n\nLastly, I'm considering erythema multiforme. The skin lesions could fit, but it's usually more acute and doesn't explain the systemic symptoms.\n\nSo, after going through all of this, I'm leaning towards subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. It seems to fit the skin lesions and some of the systemic symptoms. But, I'm still not completely sure. I might need to dig deeper or get more information.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnoses for the teenage boy with skin lesions, systemic symptoms, and specific antibody profiles are as follows:\n\n1. **Subacute Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (SCLE)**: This condition is characterized by annular plaques and can involve some systemic symptoms, which aligns with the patient's presentation.\n\n2. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**: Although the negative anti-dsDNA is atypical, SLE can present with a wide range of symptoms and antibody profiles that match some of the patient's findings.\n\n3. **Mixed Connective Tissue Disease**: The presence of anti-U1RNP antibodies suggests this diagnosis, but it typically includes features from multiple autoimmune diseases, which aren't all present here.\n\n4. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE)**: While the skin lesions are consistent, DLE usually lacks the systemic involvement seen in this patient.\n\n5. **Dermatomyositis**: The skin findings could fit, but the absence of muscle weakness makes this less likely.\n\n6. **Sarcoidosis**: This condition can cause skin lesions and systemic symptoms, but the antibody profile doesn't align well.\n\n7. **Lichen Planus**: The skin lesions could be consistent, but the systemic symptoms and antibody profile are not typical.\n\n8. **Psoriasis**: While the skin lesions might fit, the systemic symptoms and antibody profile do not match.\n\n9. **Rosacea**: The facial lesions could be similar, but the systemic symptoms are not characteristic.\n\n10. **Erythema Multiforme**: The skin lesions could fit, but it's usually more acute and doesn't explain the systemic findings.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Subacute Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (SCLE)** seems to be the most fitting diagnosis given the skin lesions and some systemic involvement.

Her history was notable for bilateral colobomas involving the iris, optic nerve, and retina; congenital cataracts after lensectomy of the left eye; retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy of the left eye requiring a scleral buckle and silicone oil; and intractable glaucoma in the left eye requiring a superior trabeculectomy, an inferotemporal Ahmed tube implant, and multiple diode cyclophotocoagulation treatments. Because of the high risk of retinal redetachment, the silicone oil was retained throughout the glaucoma procedures. The patient presented 9 months after the last cyclophotocoagulation procedure. At presentation, she was taking dorzolamide-timolol, brimonidine, netarsudil, and latanoprost for her left eye. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/80 OD and light perception OS. Intraocular pressures (IOPs) were 11 mm Hg OD and 20 mm Hg OS. Examination of the left eye revealed a large, firm, pink subconjunctival mass inferotemporally near the Ahmed valve (Figure 1). There was a left hypertropia of more than 45° by Hirschberg test. The anterior chamber was deep with fine silicone oil bubbles superiorly. The aphakic left eye revealed a well-positioned tube. Cup-disc ratios were 0.7 OD and 0.8 OS. The retina was centrally attached under silicone oil with a stable peripheral tractional retinal detachment. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Subconjunctival silicone oil granuloma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 20-year-old woman with a pretty complex eye history. She's dealing with blurred vision and a bulging mass in her left eye. That's definitely concerning. Her history includes colobomas, cataracts, retinal detachment, and glaucoma. Wow, that's a lot going on in one eye. She's had several surgeries, including a scleral buckle and silicone oil insertion. And it looks like she's on multiple glaucoma medications. \n\nOkay, so let's focus on this mass. It's described as a large, firm, pink subconjunctival mass near the Ahmed valve. That's the glaucoma drainage device. Could it be related? Maybe. Let's think about what could cause a mass like that. \n\nFirst, I'm thinking about the possibility of a cyst. A cyst could form in response to the silicone oil or the surgical procedures she's had. It's not uncommon for cysts to develop in complex cases like this. \n\nBut wait, there's also the chance of an implant exposure or erosion. With all the hardware in her eye, there's a risk of the tube or other materials causing irritation or an inflammatory response. That could lead to a mass forming around it. \n\nOh, and let's not forget about infections. With so many interventions, there's always a risk of infection. Could this be a sign of endophthalmitis or a related abscess? That's something we can't ignore. \n\nNow, considering her history of colobomas and other congenital issues, could this be something more unusual like a teratoma? It's rare, but it could explain the complex nature of her symptoms. \n\nHmm, what about a neoplasm? Malignant or benign, something like a medulloepithelioma could be possible given her history of colobomas. That's a rare tumor, but it fits the profile. \n\nAlso, let's think about the materials used in her surgeries. Silicone oil is still in her eye, and that can cause an inflammatory reaction over time. Could this be a silicone oil granuloma? That would make sense given her history. \n\nWait, there's also the possibility of a vascular issue. With the high pressure and complex surgery history, could this be a varix or some kind of vascular anomaly? That might explain the firm, pink mass. \n\nAnd finally, let's not overlook the chance of a dermoid cyst. These can occur near the sutures of the eye and could be related to her congenital anomalies. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top differential diagnosis is a cyst related to the silicone oil or surgical hardware. But we can't rule out the possibility of an implant exposure, infection, or even a neoplasm like medulloepithelioma. It's a complex case, and we need to consider all angles.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the mass in the patient's left eye, considering her complex ocular history:\n\n1. **Cyst** - A cyst could form in response to the presence of silicone oil or as a result of her previous surgical interventions.\n\n2. **Implant Exposure/Erosion** - Given the presence of the Ahmed valve and other surgical hardware, there's a risk of the implant causing irritation or an inflammatory response leading to mass formation.\n\n3. **Infection/Endophthalmitis** - With multiple surgeries, there's always a risk of infection, which could manifest as a mass or abscess.\n\n4. **Teratoma** - Although rare, this could be considered given her history of congenital ocular anomalies like colobomas.\n\n5. **Medulloepithelioma** - A rare tumor associated with the eye, especially in cases with a history of colobomas.\n\n6. **Silicone Oil Granuloma** - The retained silicone oil could cause a chronic inflammatory reaction, leading to granuloma formation.\n\n7. **Vascular Anomaly (Varix)** - The firm, pink nature of the mass could suggest a vascular origin, especially with her history of high pressure and complex surgeries.\n\n8. **Dermoid Cyst** - These can occur near the sutures of the eye and might be related to her congenital anomalies.\n\n9. **Fibrous Tumor** - A fibrous tumor could develop in response to the chronic irritation and surgical interventions.\n\n10. **Lymphangioma** - A vascular malformation that could present as a pink, firm mass.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are a cyst related to the silicone oil or surgical hardware, followed closely by the possibility of an implant exposure or infection. A neoplasm like medulloepithelioma should also be considered given her complex history. Each of these possibilities should be evaluated further with appropriate diagnostic testing and clinical examination.", "topic": "['Ophthalmology', 'Retinal Disorders']"}

On presentation, she was afebrile with cool extremities; her blood pressure was 75/51 mm Hg, heart rate was 147 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 99% on mechanical ventilation. Her chest examination revealed bilateral coarse breath sounds and distant heart sounds. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 10% with elevated filling pressures and no significant valvular abnormalities. Owing to hemodynamic instability, the patient was given venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) with the peripheral ventricular assist device (pVAD) Impella CP (Abiomed) and was administered high-dose intravenous corticosteroids. Endomyocardial biopsy showed lymphocytic viral myocarditis. There was significant hemodynamic improvement within 48 hours; transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained and showed impressive recovery of the left ventricular function to an ejection fraction of 45%. As a result, ECMO was decannulated after 72 hours. Left pVAD support was maintained alone for another 24 hours. In the interim, her vitals remained unchanged, but the patient developed hematuria and laboratory parameters suggestive of hemolysis. Chest radiography showed pulmonary edema, and low-flow alarms sounded on the device console. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed severe mitral regurgitation (MR), and a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed to evaluate pVAD positioning (Figure and Video). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Iatrogenic mitral regurgitation", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. A young woman in her mid-20s is in cardiogenic shock. That's pretty serious. Her blood pressure is really low, and her heart rate is through the roof. She's on a ventilator, but her oxygen levels are good, so that's not the issue. Her chest sounds suggest she's got some fluid in her lungs, and her heart sounds are distant, which isn't a good sign.\n\nThe echocardiogram shows her heart's ejection fraction is only 10%. That's really bad. It means her heart is struggling to pump blood effectively. They put her on ECMO and an Impella device to help her heart out. They also gave her high-dose corticosteroids. Hmm, that makes me think they're treating something inflammatory, like myocarditis.\n\nThe biopsy confirms it's lymphocytic viral myocarditis. Okay, that's a condition where the heart muscle gets inflamed because of a virus. It can definitely cause the heart to fail suddenly like this. But, she gets better quickly with the treatment. Within 48 hours, her heart's ejection fraction jumps to 45%. That's a huge improvement!\n\nThey take her off ECMO after 72 hours, but keep the Impella going for a bit longer. Then, things start to go wrong. She develops hematuria, which means blood in the urine, and there are signs of hemolysis. That's when red blood cells break down, and it can happen with mechanical devices like the Impella. Oh, and there's pulmonary edema, which means fluid in the lungs, and the device is alarming due to low flow.\n\nThe echocardiogram now shows severe mitral regurgitation. That's a new problem. It means blood is flowing backward through the mitral valve, which could be because of the Impella's position. It might be sucking in more than just blood, like the valve leaflets or chordae tendineae, which would cause this regurgitation.\n\nSo, what's going on? The Impella could be too close to the mitral valve, causing this problem. Or maybe it's a thrombosis issue, where a clot is forming because of the device. That could explain the hemolysis and the low-flow alarm. But wait, there's also the possibility of a mechanical failure or an air embolism.\n\nLet's think about other possibilities. Could it be a ventricular septal rupture? That's when there's a tear between the heart's ventricles, causing blood to shunt from one side to the other. It could lead to hemodynamic instability and pulmonary edema. But, it doesn't quite fit with the device-related issues.\n\nWhat about papillary muscle rupture? That could cause severe mitral regurgitation too. It's when the muscles that hold the mitral valve in place break, often due to trauma or infarction. But, there's no mention of an infarction here, so it's less likely.\n\nLet's not forget about cardiac tamponade. That's when fluid builds up around the heart, compressing it. It could cause distant heart sounds and hemodynamic instability. But, they didn't mention any signs of tamponade on the echocardiogram.\n\nOh, and there's the chance of a coronary artery problem, like a thrombosis or embolism. That could cause myocardial ischemia, leading to the heart's poor function. But, the quick recovery with corticosteroids suggests a viral cause rather than a coronary one.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the most likely issue is the Impella device causing mechanical trauma to the mitral valve apparatus, leading to severe mitral regurgitation. That fits with the hemolysis, low-flow alarm, and pulmonary edema. It's probably the best explanation given the circumstances.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with a focus on the complications arising after the initial treatment:\n\n1. **Impella-Related Mechanical Trauma**: The Impella device may be causing mechanical trauma to the mitral valve apparatus, leading to severe mitral regurgitation. This fits with the development of hematuria, signs of hemolysis, low-flow alarms, and pulmonary edema.\n\n2. **Thrombosis**: The formation of a clot within the Impella device or associated with the device could lead to hemolysis and low-flow issues, contributing to the patient's deteriorating condition.\n\n3. **Papillary Muscle Rupture**: Although less likely without evidence of infarction, rupture of the papillary muscles could cause severe mitral regurgitation and align with the patient's symptoms.\n\n4. **Ventricular Septal Rupture**: This could cause shunting of blood and lead to hemodynamic instability and pulmonary edema, but it doesn't fully explain the device-related complications.\n\n5. **Cardiac Tamponade**: Fluid accumulation around the heart could cause distant heart sounds and instability, but there's no echocardiographic evidence to support this.\n\n6. **Coronary Artery Thrombosis or Embolism**: This could lead to myocardial ischemia, but the rapid improvement with corticosteroids suggests a viral rather than coronary cause.\n\n7. **Mechanical Failure of the Impella Device**: A malfunction could lead to the observed complications, including hemolysis and low-flow alarms.\n\n8. **Air Embolism**: Introduction of air into the circulation could cause device alarms and hemodynamic issues, but it's less likely given the context.\n\n9. **Valvular Vegetation**: Although unlikely without infection signs, vegetations on the mitral valve could cause regurgitation and embolic phenomena.\n\n10. **Left Atrial Thrombosis**: Clot formation in the left atrium could contribute to embolic events and valve issues, but it's not directly suggested by the information provided.\n\nUpon reviewing all the patient's information and test results, the most likely cause of the complications is **Impella-Related Mechanical Trauma** to the mitral valve apparatus, leading to severe mitral regurgitation. This diagnosis best explains the combination of hemolysis, low-flow alarms, and pulmonary edema in the context of the Impella device use.", "topic": "['Urology', 'Cardiology', 'Medical Devices and Equipment', 'Nephrology', 'Acute Coronary Syndromes']"}

The anterior segment was unremarkable in either eye, while the posterior segment examination noted 1+ vitreous cell, asteroid hyalosis, and a multilobulated, serous retinal detachment (RD) in the right eye and trace vitreous cell and a multilobulated, serous RD in the left eye. Imaging included B-scan, optical coherence tomography, and fundus autofluorescence, which revealed diffuse choroidal and ciliary body thickening, multifocal pockets of subretinal fluid, and speckled hyperautofluorescence and hypoautofluorescence in both eyes (Figure 1). No poliosis or skin changes were noted. A review of systems was unremarkable, most notably a lack of any pulmonary symptoms. A focused laboratory evaluation identified a significantly elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level and antinuclear antibody titer, but serum lysozyme, syphilis, and tuberculosis testing had negative results. To better differentiate between Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome, a lymphoproliferative disorder, or sarcoidosis as the underlying cause of the vitreous inflammation and multilobulated, serous RD in both eyes, a computed tomographic scan was performed.

That sounds like something inflammatory or maybe even an infection. But there's no pain, so that's interesting. Pain would make me think more about infection or acute inflammation.\n\nThe imaging is really telling us a lot. There's diffuse choroidal and ciliary body thickening and these pockets of subretinal fluid. That's pointing towards something systemic, maybe an autoimmune process. And the speckled hyper and hypoautofluorescence? That's a unique pattern.\n\nThe lab results are a big clue. Elevated ACE levels and positive ANA? That's making me think of sarcoidosis right away. But wait, there's no mention of lung symptoms, which are usually there in sarcoidosis. And the negative syphilis and TB tests help narrow it down a bit.\n\nThe CT scan shows lymphadenopathy and scleral thickening. Lymphadenopathy could mean sarcoidosis or maybe a lymphoma. But the radiologists are saying it's nonspecific. Hmm, that's not very helpful.\n\nSo, what could this be? Let's start with the obvious. Sarcoidosis is high on the list because of the ACE levels and lymphadenopathy. But the lack of lung issues is weird. Then there's VKH syndrome, which fits the eye findings, but there's no skin or hair involvement. That's a big part of VKH.\n\nLymphoma is another possibility. The lymphadenopathy could point to that, but usually, there are more systemic symptoms. And the eye findings aren't screaming lymphoma to me.\n\nWhat about autoimmune pancreatitis? He's got a history of that, and it can be part of a larger IgG4-related disease process. That could explain some of the lymphadenopathy and eye findings. It's a bit of a stretch, but it's worth considering.\n\nOh, and we can't forget about syphilis, even though the test was negative. Syphilis can be sneaky and cause all sorts of eye problems. But without more systemic signs, it's hard to be sure.\n\nTuberculosis? It's possible, but the test was negative, and there are no typical symptoms like coughing or weight loss.\n\nLet's not forget about benign conditions like asteroid hyalosis. It's usually harmless, but it's there in the exam findings. Could it be related to the vision loss? Probably not, but it's something to keep in mind.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Sarcoidosis is still the most likely, given the ACE levels and lymphadenopathy. But VKH and lymphoma are still in the running. Autoimmune pancreatitis is a dark horse, but it's interesting to consider. Syphilis and TB are less likely, but they can't be completely ruled out. And asteroid hyalosis is probably just a red herring.\n\nIn the end, I think sarcoidosis is the best fit, but we need to keep an open mind and consider all these possibilities.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Sarcoidosis** - Elevated ACE levels and lymphadenopathy are strongly suggestive of this condition.\n2. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) Syndrome** - The multilobulated serous retinal detachments and choroidal thickening fit this diagnosis, despite the lack of skin or hair involvement.\n3. **Lymphoma** - The presence of lymphadenopathy raises the possibility of an intraocular lymphoma.\n4. **IgG4-related Disease** - The patient's history of autoimmune pancreatitis could suggest a systemic IgG4-related disease process.\n5. **Syphilis** - Despite the negative test, syphilis can be a consideration due to its potential to cause varied ocular symptoms.\n6. **Tuberculosis** - Although the test was negative, TB can sometimes present with atypical symptoms.\n7. **Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia** - This condition can sometimes be associated with systemic manifestations and ocular involvement.\n8. **Primary Effusion Lymphoma** - A rare type of lymphoma that could present with serous retinal detachments and lymphadenopathy.\n9. **Choroidal Lymphoma** - A specific type of lymphoma affecting the choroid, which could explain the eye findings.\n10. **Asteroid Hyalosis** - While typically benign, it was noted in the exam and could be contributing to vision changes.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top three differential diagnoses are:\n1. **Sarcoidosis** - The elevated ACE levels and lymphadenopathy make this the most likely diagnosis.\n2. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) Syndrome** - The ocular findings are characteristic, but the lack of systemic involvement is atypical.\n3. **Lymphoma** - The lymphadenopathy and ocular findings suggest this as a possible diagnosis, though systemic symptoms are typically more pronounced.\n\nThese three conditions should be closely evaluated, with sarcoidosis being the leading consideration. However, it's important to keep an open mind and consider all possibilities given the complexity of the case.", "topic": "['Ophthalmology', 'Retinal Disorders']"}

Let’s think step by step.\n### INPUT:\nA patient in their 50s presented with asymptomatic keratotic papules, first noticed on the left middle and ring fingers and left toe web spaces more than 10 years earlier. The papules progressed proximally over the subsequent decade to involve the forearm, arm, scapular area, ankle, shin, and thigh, but only affected the left side of the body. The patient’s face, palms, soles, and entire right side of the body were spared. The patient has a history of rosacea being treated with topical metronidazole gel for flares but was otherwise asymptomatic. The patient did not have any alopecia, night blindness, or dry eyes or skin. There was no history of any exposure to radiation or arsenic, nutritional deficiency, inflammatory skin disease, or malignant neoplasm. There was no family history of a similar condition. Examination revealed multiple, submillimeter, skin-colored to yellowish keratotic spiny projections over the aforementioned areas, only on the left side of the body (Figure, A and B). Punch biopsy from a lesion showed orthokeratosis with parakeratotic columns emerging from an epidermal invagination. The epidermis was mildly acanthotic and with a normal granular layer. There was a sparse superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. Adjacent hair follicles were unaffected (Figure, C). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. The patient has these keratotic papules that have been around for over a decade. They're only on one side of the body, which is kind of unusual. It's not itchy or causing any other symptoms, so that's interesting. The fact that it's just on the left side makes me think it might be something that's influenced by environmental factors, but there's no history of radiation or arsenic exposure. Hmm, that's something to keep in mind.\n\nOkay, let's look at the biopsy results. There's orthokeratosis with these parakeratotic columns, and the epidermis is a bit thick, but the granular layer is normal. There's a sparse infiltrate of lymphocytes, but it's not a big deal. The hair follicles are fine, so it's not something that's affecting those. This pattern is kind of pointing towards a specific type of skin condition.\n\nNow, what could this be? The unilateral nature is really striking. I know that incontinentia pigmenti is usually more widespread and not just keratotic, plus it has other stages and usually starts in childhood. That doesn't seem to fit. How about linear porokeratosis? It's known for these column-like parakeratotic features and can be unilateral. That seems like a strong possibility.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. I should think about other conditions too. There's verruca plana, which are flat warts caused by HPV. They can be multiple, but they're usually not this extensive or longstanding without treatment. And they don't typically follow a unilateral pattern like this.\n\nWhat about discoid eczema? It can be unilateral sometimes, but it's usually more inflammatory and itchy, and the biopsy findings don't match. The lack of itchiness and specific biopsy features make this less likely.\n\nI should also consider Darier's disease. It can present with papules and has a distinctive acantholytic pattern on biopsy, but that's not what we see here. Plus, it's usually more widespread and can involve the nails and mucosa, which isn't the case here.\n\nAnd then there's actinic keratosis, but that's more related to sun exposure and would typically be more crusty and scaly, not spiny. The biopsy would show more evidence of sun damage too.\n\nOh, and I can't forget about linear verrucous epidermal nevus. It's a type of epidermal nevus that can be unilateral and follow the lines of Blaschko. The biopsy findings could fit, but it's usually present from birth or early childhood, and this developed later in life.\n\nSo, after thinking it through, linear porokeratosis seems like the best fit. It matches the unilateral and longstanding nature, and the biopsy findings align well. It's a rare condition, but it ticks all the boxes here. Yeah, I'm going with linear porokeratosis as the most likely diagnosis.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the patient's condition is linear porokeratosis. This diagnosis aligns with the unilateral and longstanding nature of the keratotic papules, as well as the specific biopsy findings showing orthokeratosis with parakeratotic columns. Linear porokeratosis is a rare skin condition that can present in a unilateral pattern, following the lines of Blaschko, which fits the description of the lesions being confined to one side of the body. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Linear Porokeratosis** - This is the most likely diagnosis given the unilateral, longstanding nature of the lesions and the specific biopsy findings.\n2. **Linear Verrucous Epidermal Nevus** - While this condition can also be unilateral and follow the lines of Blaschko, it typically presents at birth or in early childhood, which doesn't align with the patient's history.\n3. **Verruca Plana (Flat Warts)** - Caused by HPV, these are usually more limited in number and don't typically follow a unilateral pattern.\n4. **Discoid Eczema** - This condition is usually more inflammatory and itchy, with different biopsy findings.\n5. **Darier's Disease** - Presents with distinctive acantholytic dyskeratotic cells on biopsy, not seen in this case, and is usually more widespread.\n6. **Actinic Keratosis** - Associated with sun exposure, typically more crusty and scaly, with biopsy showing evidence of sun damage.\n7. **Incontinentia Pigmenti** - Usually presents in childhood with different stages and more widespread lesions.\n8. **Epidermal Nevus Syndrome** - A broader category that includes various types of epidermal nevi, but the specific findings here are more suggestive of linear porokeratosis.\n9. **Keratosis Pilaris** - Presents with rough, sandpapery texture on extensor surfaces, not in a unilateral pattern.\n10. **Focal Dermal Hypoplasia (Goltz Syndrome)** - Involves fat herniation and other systemic features not present in this case.", "topic": "['Dermatology']"}

She was found to have narrow angles in both eyes and a laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) was performed in her left eye. Two weeks later she developed flickering photopsias and a temporal scotoma progressing to a “brown tint” of her vision in her left eye. Her vision had decreased in her left eye and macular and optic nerve edema were noted and she was subsequently referred to us. In our clinic, her visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/50 OS, and she had normal intraocular pressure, a shallow anterior chamber but open angle in both eyes, a patent LPI in the left eye, and clear crystalline lenses in both eyes. The rest of her anterior segment was unremarkable. The posterior examination was notable for shifting subretinal fluid with choroidal detachments without retinal breaks, inflammation, or optic nerve edema and leopard spotting, while her right eye was unremarkable (Figure, A). Fluorescein angiography was unrevealing, while optical coherence tomography showed shallow subretinal fluid and an irregular and thickened choroid (Figure, B). Ultrasonography showed an axial length of 20.0 mm, thickened sclera, anteriorly rotated ciliary body, and 360° of ciliochoroidal detachments in both eyes but worse in the left eye. Results of a systemic laboratory evaluation for infectious and noninfectious disorders were unremarkable. Systemic corticosteroids failed to resolve the subretinal fluid and her vision declined. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Uveal effusion syndrome", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her 40s who's been having some eye issues. She had a laser procedure done on her left eye, and then things started to go downhill with her vision. She's seeing these flickering lights and has a brownish tint in her vision. That's got to be pretty unsettling.\n\nFirst off, the fact that she had a laser peripheral iridotomy might be a clue. This procedure can sometimes lead to complications. I wonder if it could have caused any trauma to her eye. Maybe something like a traumatic ciliochoroidal detachment? That could explain the fluid buildup and vision changes.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. There could be other things going on. What about uveitis? That's an inflammation of the eye that could cause some of these symptoms. It might explain the edema and the fluid. Plus, it could be related to the stress from the laser treatment.\n\nNow, thinking about the tests they did, the OCT shows this thickened choroid. That's interesting. A thickened choroid could point to something like a choroidal tumor. Maybe a choroidal melanoma? That would fit with the unilateral symptoms and the brownish vision.\n\nBut then again, the ultrasound shows ciliochoroidal detachments in both eyes. That's a bit odd if we're thinking about a tumor, which would usually be more localized. Hmm, maybe we should consider something more systemic or bilateral.\n\nCould it be a systemic issue like hypotony? That's when the pressure inside the eye is too low, and it can cause detachments. But usually, you'd expect more obvious signs of low pressure, and her intraocular pressure is normal. So, maybe not hypotony.\n\nLet's think about other possibilities. What about a vitreous problem? A posterior vitreous detachment could cause some of these symptoms, but usually, you'd see more signs of vitreous involvement on the OCT, and there's no mention of that.\n\nOh, and there's the option of an inflammatory condition like Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease. That can cause choroidal detachments and vision changes, but you'd usually see more systemic symptoms or lab findings, and hers were unremarkable.\n\nNow, considering the thickened sclera and anteriorly rotated ciliary body, maybe we're looking at something like scleral buckling. That could cause the ciliochoroidal detachments and vision issues. But it's strange that it's bilateral when the symptoms are mostly in one eye.\n\nLet's not forget about the possibility of central serous chorioretinopathy. It can cause subretinal fluid and vision changes, but it's usually more transient and responsive to treatment, and her condition didn't improve with corticosteroids.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? After thinking through all these possibilities, I'm leaning towards the idea of a traumatic ciliochoroidal detachment from the laser procedure. It fits with the timing and the symptoms, and explains the bilateral findings. Yeah, that seems like the most likely explanation.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Traumatic Ciliochoroidal Detachment** - This is a strong consideration given the recent laser peripheral iridotomy and the subsequent development of symptoms.\n\n2. **Uveitis** - Inflammation within the eye could explain the edema and fluid accumulation, potentially related to the stress from the laser procedure.\n\n3. **Choroidal Tumor (e.g., Choroidal Melanoma)** - The thickened choroid observed on OCT could suggest a tumor, which would align with the unilateral vision changes and brownish tint.\n\n4. **Hypotony** - Although intraocular pressure is normal, low pressure within the eye could cause detachments, but usually more signs would be present.\n\n5. **Posterior Vitreous Detachment** - This could cause some symptoms, but typically more vitreous involvement would be noted on OCT.\n\n6. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease** - An inflammatory condition causing choroidal detachments, but systemic symptoms or lab findings would be expected.\n\n7. **Scleral Buckling** - The thickened sclera and ciliary body rotation could suggest this, but it's unusual for it to be bilateral with unilateral symptoms.\n\n8. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy** - Causes subretinal fluid and vision changes, but typically more transient and responsive to treatment.\n\n9. **Choroidal Effusion Syndrome** - Could explain the fluid and detachments, often related to surgery or trauma.\n\n10. **Idiopathic Ciliochoroidal Detachment** - A possibility if other causes are ruled out, especially with bilateral involvement.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the most likely diagnosis is **Traumatic Ciliochoroidal Detachment** due to the recent laser procedure, explaining the timing and symptoms. However, **Choroidal Tumor** and **Scleral Buckling** are also strong contenders given the imaging findings and bilateral involvement.

The patient endorsed a history of Crohn disease, and his medication had been changed from infliximab to ustekinumab 6 weeks prior owing to persistent intestinal inflammation. Clinical examination revealed bilateral periorbital edema, diplopia with decreased abduction in the right eye and decreased adduction in the left eye, chemosis, proptosis, and conjunctival hyperemia (Figure 1A). Visual acuity and neurologic and fundus examination findings were otherwise normal with no sign of optic neuropathy. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Medication-induced orbital myositis secondary to ustekinumab", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. A 57-year-old man comes in with 3 weeks of bilateral periorbital pain and swelling. He's also got headaches and diplopia, and it hurts when he moves his eyes. That's quite a bit going on. No other symptoms like fever or skin rashes, which is interesting. He does have a history of Crohn's disease, and his medication was recently switched from infliximab to ustekinumab. That's a change in his treatment regimen that could be relevant.\n\nFirst, let's consider what's happening. The periorbital pain and swelling, along with the eye movement issues, make me think of something affecting the muscles or nerves around the eyes. Could it be myasthenia gravis? That's known for causing muscle weakness, and it could explain the diplopia and movement issues.\n\nBut wait, there's more to consider. The recent medication change is a big clue. Ustekinumab is used for Crohn's, but it's an immunosuppressant. Could this be a drug reaction or something related to his immune system? Drug-induced lupus comes to mind. It can cause a range of symptoms, including those similar to what he's experiencing.\n\nNow, let's not forget about thyroid eye disease. It's a common cause of periorbital swelling and eye muscle issues. The fact that he has proptosis and chemosis fits this diagnosis well. Plus, it often comes with a history of thyroid problems, which we should definitely check for.\n\nWhat about infections? Orbital cellulitis is a possibility, but usually, you'd expect some systemic signs like fever or a more acute presentation. There's no mention of that here, so it seems less likely.\n\nWe should also think about other inflammatory conditions. Sarcoidosis can cause eye problems and might fit if there were other systemic symptoms, but there aren't any here. Still, it's worth keeping in mind.\n\nNow, let's go back to the medication angle. Ustekinumab affects the immune system, so could it be causing some kind of immune-related reaction? This could lead to something like orbital myositis, which would explain the pain and swelling.\n\nAnother possibility is giant cell arteritis. It can cause headaches and vision problems, but it's usually seen in older patients and often comes with jaw claudication or other systemic symptoms, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nWhat about something like IgG4-related disease? It can cause orbital involvement and might fit the profile, but it's relatively rare, so maybe it's a stretch.\n\nFinally, let's not forget about carotid-cavernous fistula. It can cause eye symptoms like proptosis and diplopia due to abnormal blood flow. It's a bit of a long shot, but it could explain some of the findings.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top differential diagnosis is thyroid eye disease. It fits well with the symptoms and is a common cause of these types of eye problems. Orbital myositis related to the medication change is also high on the list. Drug-induced lupus and IgG4-related disease are possibilities, but they seem less likely given the information we have. Carotid-cavernous fistula is an outside possibility, but it would require more specific findings to move it up the list.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Thyroid Eye Disease** - This condition is a common cause of periorbital swelling, proptosis, and eye muscle issues, and should be strongly considered given the patient's symptoms.\n\n2. **Orbital Myositis** - This could be related to the recent change in medication, as ustekinumab affects the immune system and could potentially trigger an inflammatory response in the orbit.\n\n3. **Drug-induced Lupus** - The switch from infliximab to ustekinumab could have provoked a lupus-like reaction, leading to the patient's symptoms.\n\n4. **IgG4-related Disease** - Although rare, this condition can cause orbital involvement and should be considered given the presentation.\n\n5. **Carotid-cavernous Fistula** - This vascular anomaly could cause proptosis and diplopia, but typically requires more specific findings to be highly suspected.\n\n6. **Sarcoidosis** - While it can cause eye problems, the lack of systemic symptoms makes it less likely in this case.\n\n7. **Orbital Cellulitis** - Usually presents more acutely with systemic signs, which are absent here, making it less probable.\n\n8. **Giant Cell Arteritis** - Typically occurs in older patients and often includes systemic symptoms like jaw claudication, which are not present.\n\n9. **Myasthenia Gravis** - Could explain the muscle weakness and diplopia, but doesn't fully account for the periorbital swelling and proptosis.\n\n10. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome** - A diagnosis of exclusion, considered when other causes are ruled out.\n\nUpon reviewing all the information, the top differential diagnoses are **Thyroid Eye Disease** and **Orbital Myositis** related to the medication change. These two conditions best explain the combination of symptoms and the patient's recent treatment history. **Drug-induced Lupus** and **IgG4-related Disease** are also possibilities, though they are considered less likely based on the provided details. **Carotid-cavernous Fistula** remains an outside possibility that would require further investigation to confirm.", "topic": "['Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology', 'Gastroenterology', 'Inflammatory Bowel Disease', 'Adverse Drug Events', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology']"}

When the arm was abducted to 90°, the patient denied pain but described a subtle tightness sensation on the arm. An excisional biopsy from the larger lesion was performed (Figure, B-D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Axillary web syndrome", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her 40s who's just had surgery for desmoplastic melanoma. She's also dealing with multiple sclerosis and is on interferon beta 1a. Now, she's developed these two nodules near her surgical scar. That's interesting.\n\nFirst off, the timing is pretty close to her surgery. Could these be related to the surgical process? Surgical scars can sometimes lead to things like epidermoid cysts. That's a possibility.\n\nBut wait, she's on interferon beta 1a for her multiple sclerosis. I've heard that interferon can cause skin reactions or even sarcoidosis. Could these nodules be a reaction to the medication? That's something to consider.\n\nNow, let's think about the nature of these nodules. They're indurated and mobile. That's a bit unusual for an epidermoid cyst, which tends to be more superficial. Could they be lipomas? Those are usually soft and mobile, but the induration makes me hesitate.\n\nOh, and there's the fact that she had a sentinel lymph node biopsy. Could these nodules be related to that? Maybe they're some kind of reaction or even a seroma from the procedure. That's a possibility too.\n\nBut let's not forget about the melanoma. Desmoplastic melanoma can be aggressive. Could these nodules be metastases? That's a scary thought, but we can't rule it out.\n\nHmm, what about neurofibromas? She has multiple sclerosis, and while that's not directly related, neurofibromas can occur in neurocutaneous disorders. It's a bit of a stretch, but let's keep it in mind.\n\nNow, let's think about the biopsy results. If they show something like a foreign body reaction, that could point to a reaction from the surgery or even the interferon. But if it's something more sinister, we might be looking at metastatic melanoma.\n\nOh, and we can't forget about benign fibrous histiocytomas. Those can occur as a reaction to trauma or surgery. They fit the description of being indurated and mobile.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? We've got a few possibilities: epidermoid cyst, interferon-induced sarcoidosis, lipoma, seroma from the lymph node biopsy, metastatic melanoma, neurofibroma, foreign body reaction, and benign fibrous histiocytoma. Each has its merits, but we need to prioritize them.\n\nAfter considering everything, metastatic melanoma seems like the most urgent possibility. It's aggressive, and we can't ignore that. But benign fibrous histiocytoma is also a strong contender given the surgical history and nodule characteristics.

Sotalol can prolong the QT interval, which might provoke ventricular arrhythmias. We should definitely keep this in mind.\n\nOh, and there's also the chance of torsades de pointes. It's a specific type of polymorphic VT that can happen with QT prolongation. Given sotalol's effects, this is something we can't ignore.\n\nWait, let's not forget about atrial fibrillation. It's pretty common and can be unstable, especially if the medication affects his heart's electrical system. We should consider this as well.\n\nNow, what about something like Brugada syndrome? It's a long shot, but it can cause arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. The MRI showed some ventricular thickening, which could be relevant. Let's put this on the list.\n\nAnd how about arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy? It's another condition that can cause arrhythmias, but the MRI didn't show any obvious right ventricular issues. Still, it's worth considering.\n\nLet's also think about long QT syndrome. Sotalol can exacerbate this, leading to torsades de pointes. It fits with his history of cardiac arrest, so it's a strong contender.\n\nOh, and we shouldn't overlook the possibility of his arrhythmia being drug-induced. Sotalol can cause proarrhythmic effects, so this is definitely plausible.\n\nLastly, there's the chance of a random electrical storm. This is when the heart goes into multiple arrhythmias in a short time. It's rare, but could fit his situation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, here's my ranked list of possibilities: \n1. Torsades de Pointes\n2. Ventricular Tachycardia\n3. Atrial Flutter\n4. Drug-Induced Arrhythmia\n5. Atrial Fibrillation\n6. Electrical Storm\n7. Long QT Syndrome\n8. Brugada Syndrome\n9. Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy\n10. Tachycardia-Induced Cardiomyopathy\n\nI think this order makes sense given his history and the effects of sotalol. Torsades de Pointes seems like the most likely culprit, given the QT prolongation risk with sotalol.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, considering his history and the effects of sotalol:\n\n1. **Torsades de Pointes** - This is a likely possibility given the risk of QT interval prolongation associated with sotalol, which can lead to this specific type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.\n\n2. **Ventricular Tachycardia** - The patient's history of cardiac arrest and the potential for sotalol to provoke ventricular arrhythmias make this a strong contender.\n\n3. **Atrial Flutter** - Common in patients with a history of supraventricular tachycardia, and sotalol can sometimes cause it to worsen or transform.\n\n4. **Drug-Induced Arrhythmia** - Sotalol is known for its proarrhythmic effects, making a drug-induced arrhythmia a plausible diagnosis.\n\n5. **Atrial Fibrillation** - This is a common arrhythmia that can be unstable, especially with the influence of medications like sotalol affecting the heart's electrical system.\n\n6. **Electrical Storm** - Although rare, this involves multiple arrhythmias in a short period, which could fit the patient's situation given his complex history.\n\n7. **Long QT Syndrome** - Sotalol can exacerbate this condition, leading to torsades de pointes, and aligns with the patient's history of cardiac arrest.\n\n8. **Brugada Syndrome** - While less likely, this genetic disorder can cause arrhythmias and cardiac arrest, and the MRI showed some ventricular thickening.\n\n9. **Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy** - Although the MRI didn't show obvious right ventricular issues, it's still a consideration given the patient's arrhythmias.\n\n10. **Tachycardia-Induced Cardiomyopathy** - While not a new arrhythmia, his underlying condition could be contributing to the current situation.\n\nThese possibilities are ranked based on the likelihood and relevance to the patient's history and current treatment with sotalol. Torsades de Pointes is considered the most likely diagnosis due to the QT prolongation risk associated with sotalol.", "topic": "['Rhythm Disorders', 'Cardiology']"}

He had undergone trabeculectomy and 5-fluorouracil injection 1 month prior. On initial examination, his visual acuity was 20/25. He had diffuse conjunctival hyperemia without bleb purulence or leakage and more than 50 cells per high-power field of a 1 × 1-mm area of light on slitlamp biomicroscopy. He was treated for blebitis with topical fortified antibiotics but subsequently developed vitritis. He underwent vitreous tap and injection of vancomycin and amikacin followed by pars plana vitrectomy with bleb revision. Separate vitreous samples from each procedure were sent for Gram stain and bacterial and fungal culture on chocolate and Sabouraud agar with no growth. His eye pain worsened significantly, and ultrasound biomicroscopy showed scleral thickening (Figure 1A). Lab workup for autoimmune scleritis including tests for rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies was negative. He was admitted to the hospital and started intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam treatment. His vision continued to decline to counting fingers because of the development of a dense cataract with retrolenticular plaque (Figure 1B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Aspergillus fumigatus endophthalmitis and scleritis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 55-year-old guy who's dealing with some serious eye issues. He's got advanced primary open-angle glaucoma, and just recently, he had a trabeculectomy and a 5-fluorouracil injection. Now, he's come in with decreased vision and eye pain that started just a day ago. That's pretty sudden. \n\nWhen we check his eyes, his visual acuity isn't too bad at 20/25, but there's diffuse conjunctival hyperemia. No bleb purulence or leakage, which is good, but there are more than 50 cells per high-power field on slit-lamp exam. That's definitely indicating some inflammation or infection. \n\nSo, we start treating him for blebitis with some strong topical antibiotics. But things don't get better; instead, he develops vitritis. That's a sign that the infection might be spreading inside the eye. We go ahead with a vitreous tap and inject some antibiotics, vancomycin, and amikacin. We even do a pars plana vitrectomy with bleb revision. But when we culture the vitreous samples, nothing grows. That's odd. \n\nHis pain gets worse, and an ultrasound biomicroscopy shows scleral thickening. Hmm, that's pointing towards scleritis. We check for autoimmune causes, but all those tests come back negative. So, it's not an autoimmune issue. \n\nWe admit him to the hospital and start him on IV antibiotics, vancomycin, and piperacillin-tazobactam. But his vision keeps getting worse, and now he's got a dense cataract with a retrolenticular plaque. That sounds like a fungal infection to me, maybe something like candidiasis. \n\nLet's think about what's going on here. We've ruled out bacteria with those negative cultures, and it's not an autoimmune problem. The symptoms and that plaque are really pointing towards a fungal infection. \n\nSo, what could it be? Aspergillus? That's possible. It's known to cause these kinds of issues. Or could it be Candida? That's another common one in these situations. \n\nWait, let's not forget about other fungi like Fusarium or even Pseudomonas, though that's bacterial. We should keep an open mind. \n\nBut really, with the way things are progressing and the lack of bacterial growth, I'm leaning towards a fungal cause. Aspergillus or Candida seems most likely. \n\nOkay, let's wrap this up. Based on everything, fungal endophthalmitis, probably Aspergillus or Candida, seems like the best fit for what's going on here.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnoses for this patient's condition are as follows:\n\n1. **Fungal Endophthalmitis** - Given the negative bacterial cultures and the development of a retrolenticular plaque, a fungal infection is highly suspected. Organisms like Candida or Aspergillus are common culprits in such cases.\n\n2. **Bacterial Endophthalmitis** - Although cultures are negative, bacterial infections can sometimes be culture-negative, especially if the organism is difficult to grow or if antibiotics were administered prior to sampling.\n\n3. **Autoimmune Scleritis** - While tests for autoimmune markers are negative, atypical presentations can occur, and scleral thickening is a significant finding.\n\n4. **Pseudomonas Infection** - A virulent bacterial pathogen that can cause severe eye infections, though typically associated with positive cultures.\n\n5. **Fusarium Infection** - A type of fungal infection that can cause endophthalmitis, often related to trauma or post-surgical complications.\n\n6. **Aspergillus Infection** - A fungal pathogen known to cause endophthalmitis, especially in post-surgical settings with negative bacterial cultures.\n\n7. **Candida Infection** - A common fungal pathogen in endophthalmitis, particularly in cases with a retrolenticular plaque.\n\n8. **Toxic Anterior Segment Syndrome (TASS)** - A non-infectious inflammation that can occur post-surgery, though it typically responds to steroids.\n\n9. **Lens-Induced Uveitis** - An inflammatory response to lens proteins, which can mimic infection.\n\n10. **Endogenous Endophthalmitis** - An infection arising from a distant site in the body, which could present with negative cultures if not properly sampled.\n\nReranking these based on the clinical presentation and test results, the top three most likely diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Fungal Endophthalmitis (Aspergillus or Candida)**\n2. **Bacterial Endophthalmitis (culture-negative)**\n3. **Autoimmune Scleritis**\n\nThese diagnoses align with the clinical findings of worsening vision, eye pain, and the presence of a retrolenticular plaque, despite negative bacterial cultures.", "topic": "['Fungal Infections', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Ophthalmology', 'Glaucoma']"}

Physical examination was notable for oral thrush and mild epigastric tenderness. Results of a fourth-generation HIV Ab/Ag combination assay were positive, and subsequent testing showed a CD4 cell count of 16/mm3 and an HIV viral load greater than 10 million copies/mL. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis showed thickening of the walls of the stomach, duodenum, and colon as well as multiple masses in the right hepatic lobe measuring up to 6.9 cm in diameter. A core biopsy of one of the liver masses demonstrated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. He started antiretroviral therapy with bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir/alafenamide and chemotherapy with rituximab, etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (R-EPOCH). Four weeks after initiation of chemotherapy, the patient developed sudden onset of bright red blood per rectum, tachycardia, and hypotension. Mesenteric computed tomography angiography demonstrated active extravasation in the jejunum from a branch of the superior mesenteric artery. After unsuccessful coil embolization, he underwent open resection of 40 cm of distal small intestine; pathological examination of a stained section showed acute inflammation of the lamina propria, with crypt epithelial apoptosis and numerous cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusions with an “owl eye” appearance (Figure 1, left panel). Five weeks later, he developed blurred vision, and visual acuity testing revealed 20/50 vision in the left eye and 20/70 in the right eye. A dilated retinal examination revealed extensive macular hemorrhage in the left eye, with peripapillary whitening and perivascular hemorrhage with whitening along the superior vascular arcade (Figure, right panel). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis and hemorrhagic enteritis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 57-year-old man who's been dealing with epigastric pain and weight loss for a while. That's already a red flag for something serious. He's also got oral thrush, which makes me think his immune system might be compromised. And then, bam, the HIV test comes back positive. With a CD4 count that low, he's definitely immunocompromised. So, we're looking at possible opportunistic infections or something related to his HIV.\n\nNow, the CT scan shows thickening in the stomach, duodenum, and colon, plus liver masses. That's a lot going on. The biopsy says it's diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Okay, so we've got lymphoma on top of HIV. That's a tough combination.\n\nHe starts on antiretroviral therapy and chemotherapy. That's a heavy-duty treatment plan. But then, a month in, he suddenly starts bleeding from the rectum, and his heart rate is up, blood pressure down. That's scary. The scan shows bleeding in the jejunum. They try to embolize it, but it doesn't work, so they have to remove part of his intestine.\n\nThe pathology report from the intestine is interesting. It shows inflammation and these 'owl eye' inclusions. That's classic for CMV infection. So, we've got a CMV infection in the gut now.\n\nA few weeks later, he's got blurred vision. His vision is pretty bad, and the retinal exam shows macular hemorrhage and some weird whitening around the blood vessels. That sounds like CMV retinitis to me. It's another complication from his weakened immune system.\n\nSo, let's put this all together. We've got HIV with a very low CD4 count, lymphoma, CMV infection in the gut, and now CMV retinitis. It's all connected. His immune system is just not fighting off these infections and complications.\n\nIn the end, the main issue here is the HIV, which led to all these other problems like the lymphoma and CMV infections. It's a tough situation, but it all makes sense when you look at the big picture.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct hypothesis:\n\n1. **HIV Infection** - Given the positive HIV test and significantly low CD4 count, HIV is the primary condition affecting the patient's immune system.\n\n2. **Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma** - The biopsy from the liver masses confirms this type of lymphoma, which is a common complication in patients with advanced HIV.\n\n3. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection** - The 'owl eye' inclusions found in the intestinal biopsy are characteristic of CMV infection, which is an opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients.\n\n4. **CMV Retinitis** - The retinal examination findings of macular hemorrhage and perivascular whitening are indicative of CMV retinitis, another common complication in patients with low CD4 counts.\n\n5. **Gastrointestinal Bleeding** - The sudden onset of rectal bleeding and hypotension suggests a bleeding event in the gastrointestinal tract, likely related to the CMV infection causing ulceration.\n\n6. **Antiretroviral Therapy Complications** - While crucial for treatment, antiretroviral therapy can sometimes lead to complications, including immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which could exacerbate symptoms.\n\n7. **Chemotherapy-Related Complications** - The R-EPOCH chemotherapy regimen can cause significant side effects, including myelosuppression, which could increase the risk of infections or bleeding.\n\n8. **Opportunistic Infections** - Besides CMV, other opportunistic infections like Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) or Cryptosporidium could occur given the patient's low CD4 count.\n\n9. **Lymphoma Progression** - The lymphoma itself could be progressing, contributing to the patient's systemic symptoms and organ dysfunction.\n\n10. **Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS)** - As antiretroviral therapy begins, IRIS could develop, causing an inflammatory response to existing infections like CMV or lymphoma.\n\nReranking these differential diagnoses based on the patient's clinical presentation and test results, the top diagnoses would be:\n\n1. **CMV Retinitis** - Given the immediate threat to vision and the characteristic retinal findings.\n2. **CMV Infection** - Due to the 'owl eye' inclusions and gastrointestinal bleeding.\n3. **HIV Infection** - As the underlying condition leading to immunosuppression.\n4. **Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma** - Considering the biopsy results and systemic involvement.\n5. **Gastrointestinal Bleeding** - Due to the acute presentation and need for immediate management.\n\nThese diagnoses are interconnected, with HIV being the underlying cause of the immunocompromised state, leading to CMV infections and lymphoma.", "topic": "['Bleeding and Transfusion', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology', 'Ophthalmology', 'HIV']"}

His visual acuity was count fingers OD and 20/70 OS. Intraocular pressure was 20 mm Hg OD and 16 mm Hg OS. There were 1+ (10-12 cells/high-power field) anterior chamber cells in both eyes with very hazy posterior pole details in the right eye and minimal vitreous haze in the left eye. There was a hazy view to the posterior pole in the right eye with disc edema and multiple flame hemorrhages surrounding the nerve. Examination of the posterior pole in the left eye revealed partial obstruction of all vessels and a complete halo on the disc with numerous flame hemorrhages emanating from and surrounding the optic nerve, along with a few dot blot hemorrhages within the macula (Figure). His blood pressure was 173/137 mm Hg, but the rest of his vital signs were normal. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Syphilitic panuveitis and optic neuritis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 49-year-old guy who's dealing with some pretty serious vision issues. He's got painless vision loss in both eyes, and it's been going on for about 10 days. That's quite a while to be dealing with this. He's also experiencing photophobia, which is sensitivity to light. That's interesting because it often points to inflammation or irritation in the eyes.\n\nNow, let's consider his medical history. He's got diabetes and hypertension, which are both significant. Diabetes can cause all sorts of eye problems, like diabetic retinopathy. And hypertension can lead to issues like hypertensive retinopathy. He also has a history of intravenous drug use and multiple sexual partners, which raises the risk for infections. Hmm, that's something to keep in mind.\n\nLooking at his eye exam, his visual acuity is really poor in the right eye—only able to count fingers. The left eye is a bit better at 20/70. The intraocular pressure is normal, so it's not likely glaucoma. But there are anterior chamber cells in both eyes, which suggests inflammation. And the posterior pole details are hazy, especially in the right eye. That's not good.\n\nThe right eye has disc edema and multiple flame hemorrhages. That's a big clue. Flame hemorrhages often point to vascular issues. And in the left eye, there's partial obstruction of vessels and a complete halo around the disc with more flame hemorrhages. This is starting to sound like a systemic issue, maybe related to his diabetes or hypertension.\n\nOkay, let's think about what this could be. Diabetic retinopathy is a strong possibility given his diabetes. It can cause those flame hemorrhages and disc edema. But the fact that it's happening in both eyes and is painless makes me think it could be something more systemic, like hypertensive retinopathy. That fits with his high blood pressure too.\n\nBut wait, let's not forget about infections. With his history of drug use and multiple partners, we should consider infectious causes like CMV retinopathy. That can cause retinal hemorrhages and whitening, especially in someone who might be immunocompromised.\n\nNow, what about other possibilities? Eale's disease could be a contender. It's a rare condition that causes retinal inflammation and hemorrhages in young adults, but this guy is a bit older. Still, it's worth considering.\n\nOh, and there's also frosted branch angiitis. That's a condition that causes retinal vasculitis and can present with similar symptoms. It's often associated with infections, so that fits with his history.\n\nLet's not forget about papillitis. That's inflammation of the optic nerve and can cause disc edema and vision loss. It could be due to an infection or autoimmune process.\n\nAnd then there's central retinal vein occlusion. That can cause sudden vision loss and retinal hemorrhages. But it's usually unilateral, so it's less likely here since both eyes are affected.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top differential diagnosis is diabetic retinopathy. It fits with his diabetes and the bilateral nature of the symptoms. But we should also consider hypertensive retinopathy, CMV retinopathy, Eale's disease, frosted branch angiitis, papillitis, and central retinal vein occlusion. Each of these has some features that match what we're seeing.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step presenting a unique potential diagnosis:\n\n1. **Diabetic Retinopathy** - Given the patient's history of diabetes, this is a strong contender as it can cause the observed retinal changes, including disc edema and flame hemorrhages.\n\n2. **Hypertensive Retinopathy** - The patient's high blood pressure aligns with this diagnosis, which can lead to similar retinal findings, including hemorrhages and vascular changes.\n\n3. **CMV Retinopathy** - Considering the patient's history of intravenous drug use and multiple sexual partners, this infectious cause is plausible, especially if there's an underlying immunocompromised state.\n\n4. **Eale's Disease** - Although the patient is older than the typical age of onset, this condition can cause retinal inflammation and hemorrhages, making it a potential diagnosis.\n\n5. **Frosted Branch Angiitis** - This condition involves retinal vasculitis and can present with similar symptoms, often associated with infections, which fits the patient's history.\n\n6. **Papillitis** - Inflammation of the optic nerve could explain the disc edema and vision loss, potentially due to an infection or autoimmune process.\n\n7. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)** - While typically unilateral, CRVO can cause sudden vision loss and retinal hemorrhages, so it remains a consideration.\n\n8. **Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO)** - Similar to CRVO, BRVO involves retinal hemorrhages but usually in a segmental pattern, which could align with some of the findings.\n\n9. **Ocular Ischemic Syndrome** - This condition, often related to carotid artery disease, can cause retinal hemorrhages and neovascularization, which might fit the patient's vascular risk factors.\n\n10. **Autoimmune Retinopathy** - This is a less common condition that could cause bilateral vision loss and retinal changes, potentially related to an autoimmune process.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are Diabetic Retinopathy and Hypertensive Retinopathy, given the strong correlation with the patient's diabetes and hypertension. CMV Retinopathy and Frosted Branch Angiitis are also significant considerations due to the patient's risk factors and the nature of the retinal findings.

The papules and nodules appeared to grow as the boy grew, and some pedunculated lesions tended to fall off spontaneously. He had not received any prior treatment. The patient had no other significant medical history and denied having a family history of similar lesions. Clinical examination findings revealed multiple skin-colored, nontender soft papules of varying sizes protruding from the skin surface on the right cheek, forehead, and jaw, as well as on the anterior surface of the scalp, distributed along Blaschko lines, with sparse vellus hairs and multiple hair follicles on the lesions (Figure, A and B). However, no hair was observed on the lesion because the patient had shaved the hair on his face. An incisional biopsy of a pedunculated lesion above the left eyebrow was performed (Figure, B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Hair follicle nevus", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a teenage boy with these skin lesions that have been there since birth. They're papules, plaques, and nodules, and they're following these lines on his face and scalp. I've heard of these lines before - they're called Blaschko lines, right? That's a big clue because not all skin conditions follow those lines.\n\nOkay, so these lesions are soft and skin-colored, and they don't hurt. That's interesting. They've been growing as he grows, which makes me think they're not just temporary. Some of them even fall off on their own. That's pretty unique.\n\nNow, let's think about what conditions could cause this. Epidermal nevi come to mind first. They're those congenital lesions that follow Blaschko lines, just like what we're seeing here. They can be different types, like keratinocytic or verrucous, and they can be part of some syndromes, but this kid doesn't have any other symptoms, so maybe it's just a isolated finding.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions too fast. What about other conditions that could look similar? Seborrheic keratosis could be one, but those usually appear later in life, and they don't really follow Blaschko lines. Still, they're worth considering.\n\nHow about neurofibromas? They're soft and can be skin-colored, but they're associated with neurofibromatosis, which has other signs like café-au-lait spots. This kid doesn't have those, so it's probably not that.\n\nAnd then there's the possibility of a basal cell carcinoma, but that's pretty rare in someone this young, and these lesions aren't showing any worrying signs like bleeding or ulceration.\n\nLet's not forget about trichoepitheliomas. They're skin-colored and can appear in a similar pattern, but they're usually more numerous and not necessarily congenital.\n\nOh, and what about cylindromas? They're usually on the scalp and can be skin-colored, but they're not typically linear or following Blaschko lines.\n\nNow, let's think about the histology. The biopsy showed some interesting features. There were these acanthotic epidermal invaginations with a central keratinous core. That sounds like something I've read about in trichoepitheliomas. They often have these horn cysts and papillomatous structures.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the clinical presentation and the histology both point towards trichoepithelioma. It makes sense because it fits the age, appearance, and distribution of the lesions, as well as the biopsy findings.\n\nYeah, I'm feeling pretty confident that trichoepithelioma is the right diagnosis here. It all lines up.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnoses for the skin lesions in this teenage boy, in order of consideration, are as follows:\n\n1. **Epidermal Nevus** - These are congenital lesions that follow Blaschko lines, matching the distribution described.\n2. **Trichoepithelioma** - Given the histological findings of acanthotic epidermal invaginations with a central keratinous core, this becomes a strong consideration.\n3. **Seborrheic Keratosis** - While these typically appear later in life and don't follow Blaschko lines, they could be considered due to their similar appearance.\n4. **Neurofibroma** - Although these are soft and can be skin-colored, they are usually associated with other signs of neurofibromatosis, which are absent here.\n5. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** - Rare in someone this young and usually presents with more alarming features like bleeding or ulceration.\n6. **Cylindroma** - Typically found on the scalp but not usually linear or following Blaschko lines.\n7. **Fibroepithelial Polyp (Acrochordon)** - Soft, skin-colored, and pedunculated, but usually not in a linear pattern.\n8. **Pilar Cyst (Epidermoid Cyst)** - Often found on the scalp, but not typically multiple or linear.\n9. **Dermatofibroma** - Usually solitary, firm, and not following Blaschko lines.\n10. **Lipoma** - Soft but not typically skin-colored or distributed along Blaschko lines.\n\nAfter considering all the clinical and histological information, **Trichoepithelioma** emerges as the most likely diagnosis due to the characteristic histological findings and the age and distribution of the lesions.

Hmm, that's definitely pointing towards something going on in the brain, maybe the brainstem, given the symptoms.\n\nNow, she just got back from a trip to northeastern Brazil a couple of months ago. That's interesting because that region has its own set of infectious diseases. But she didn't mention any fever or other signs of infection, so maybe it's not an infection. Let's keep that in mind, though.\n\nThe MRI shows a lesion in the pons. It's hyperintense on T2 and has some funky gadolinium enhancement. No signs of bleeding or restricted diffusion, which is good to know. This kind of lesion could mean a few things. It could be inflammatory, infectious, or even a tumor. But given her age and the sudden onset, I'm leaning towards something inflammatory or demyelinating.\n\nOkay, let's think about what could cause this. Multiple sclerosis is a big one. It's known for causing lesions like this, especially in young adults. The symptoms match too, with the neurological deficits and all. But wait, MS usually has more widespread lesions, and this seems pretty localized to the brainstem. Still, it's a strong contender.\n\nAnother possibility is a brainstem abscess, but she doesn't have any fever or signs of infection, so that seems less likely. Plus, abscesses often show restricted diffusion, which isn't the case here.\n\nNeurocysticercosis could be an option, given her travel history. It's common in Brazil and can cause brain lesions. But usually, you'd expect to see more than one lesion, and they often have a nodular appearance with a scolex. This doesn't quite fit.\n\nLet's not forget about tumors. A glioma could present like this, with a heterogeneous enhancing lesion in the brainstem. But tumors usually progress more slowly, and she's pretty young for a malignant glioma. Still, it's something to consider.\n\nOh, and there's also the possibility of an inflammatory condition like sarcoidosis. It can cause brain lesions and might fit the picture, but we don't have any other systemic symptoms that typically come with sarcoidosis.\n\nNow, let's think about other inflammatory causes. Could it be something like a viral infection? Maybe. Viruses like HIV or Epstein-Barr could cause brain lesions, but we don't have any history suggesting an immunocompromised state.\n\nWait, what about acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)? It's usually post-infectious, but she didn't have any recent infections. Still, it could fit the picture with a single large lesion and her symptoms.\n\nOkay, let's wrap this up. Based on everything, multiple sclerosis seems like the most likely cause. It fits her age, the nature of the lesion, and the symptoms. But we can't completely rule out other possibilities like a glioma or ADEM without more information. We'll need to keep an eye on this and maybe do some more tests to be sure.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 25-year-old woman with neurological symptoms and a brain lesion:\n\n1. **Multiple Sclerosis** - This is a strong contender given her age, the nature of the lesion, and the neurological symptoms.\n2. **Glioma** - A brainstem glioma could present with a heterogeneous enhancing lesion, although it typically progresses more slowly.\n3. **Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM)** - This post-infectious inflammation could fit, despite the lack of a recent infection history.\n4. **Neurocysticercosis** - Considering her travel history to Brazil, this parasitic infection is a possibility, though multiple lesions are more common.\n5. **Brainstem Abscess** - Less likely due to the absence of fever and restricted diffusion on MRI.\n6. **Sarcoidosis** - Could cause brain lesions, but typically accompanied by systemic symptoms, which are absent here.\n7. **Viral Encephalitis** - Possible, especially with viruses like HIV or Epstein-Barr, but no immunocompromised state is noted.\n8. **Lymphoma** - A rare consideration, but could present with a brain lesion in an immunocompetent patient.\n9. **Tuberculoma** - Another possibility given the travel history, but usually presents with more systemic symptoms.\n10. **Fungal Infection** - Such as cryptococcosis, more common in immunocompromised individuals, but could be considered given the travel history.\n\nReranking these based on the patient's age, symptoms, and MRI findings, multiple sclerosis remains the most likely diagnosis, followed closely by glioma and ADEM. Further tests, including lumbar puncture and evoked potentials, may help differentiate these possibilities.", "topic": "['Infectious Diseases', 'Neurology', 'CNS Infections', 'Radiology', 'Neuroimaging']"}

She noted mild associated pruritus but denied burning sensation. The eruptions occurred intermittently, appearing as erythematous papules with prominent pustules, and were exacerbated by sunlight. On average, her lesions would resolve in 3 to 4 days with only mild background erythema by 5 to 7 days. Even mild sun exposure would induce the eruption, leading to frequent recurrences in summer months but long periods of remission in the fall through spring. Trials with various broad-spectrum sunscreens in combination with topical and oral antibiotics and topical ivermectin did not prevent flares or mitigate severity of eruptions when they occurred. She denied joint pain, fever, fatigue, changes in urine color, use of other topical or systemic medications, or presence of rashes elsewhere. She was otherwise healthy without other medical history. On physical examination, she was well appearing with numerous 1- to 2-mm monomorphous pustules over background erythema on the medial cheeks, chin, and nose (Figure, A). No nail fold capillary changes or mucosal lesions were observed. Serum analysis results for antinuclear, anti-SSA/Ro, and anti-SSB/La antibodies were negative. A 4-mm punch biopsy was taken from a representative lesion along the right jawline (Figure, B-D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Actinic folliculitis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a young woman with these pustular eruptions on her face. They started while she was in Florida, so maybe the sun has something to do with it. She's had this issue for four years, and it's been a real nuisance, especially in the summer. That's a big clue right there—sun exposure seems to be triggering these eruptions.\n\nOkay, so what could this be? My first thought is something like acne vulgaris. It's common and can have pustules, but usually, you'd see comedones too, and she didn't mention any. Plus, acne isn't typically worsened by the sun like this.\n\nHmm, what about rosacea? It can cause facial redness and pustules, but it's not usually so photosensitive. People with rosacea often have other symptoms like telangiectasia, and she didn't mention those.\n\nLet's think about autoimmune issues like lupus. Photosensitivity is a big deal with lupus, but she would likely have other symptoms like joint pain or a butterfly rash, and her antibody tests were negative. So, lupus seems unlikely.\n\nHow about something like dermatomyositis? It can cause facial eruptions, but we'd expect other signs like muscle weakness or specific nail changes, and she doesn't have those.\n\nOh, what about porphyria cutanea tarda? It's known for photosensitivity and can cause skin issues, but it usually involves blistering, not pustules. So that's probably not it.\n\nLet's not forget about folliculitis. It can cause pustules, but it's usually not linked to sun exposure. Plus, it would typically be more localized and not as widespread as her condition.\n\nCould it be a drug-induced photosensitivity? But she's not taking any medications that would cause this, so that's probably not it.\n\nMaybe it's something like a photodrug reaction, but she's already tried sunscreens without success, so that's unlikely.\n\nWhat about Discoid Lupus Erythematosus? It can be photosensitive, but we'd expect more discoid plaques and scaling, not just pustules. Plus, her antibody tests were negative.\n\nOh, and there's also Pityriasis Lichenoides Chronica. It can cause papules and sometimes pustules, but it's not typically photosensitive in this way.\n\nAlright, let's put it all together. Given the photosensitivity and the negative antibody tests, I'm leaning towards something like a rare photosensitive disorder. Maybe it's a form of solar urticaria or a unique presentation of a known condition. It's definitely puzzling, but that seems like the best fit for now.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the condition described, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Acne Vulgaris** - While it's common and can present with pustules, the lack of comedones and significant sun exacerbation make it less likely.\n\n2. **Rosacea** - This condition can cause facial redness and pustules but typically isn't highly photosensitive and often includes other symptoms like telangiectasia.\n\n3. **Subacute Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (SCLE)** - Photosensitivity is a key feature, but negative antibody tests and the absence of other lupus symptoms make this less probable.\n\n4. **Dermatomyositis** - Facial involvement can occur, but the lack of muscle weakness or characteristic nail changes makes this diagnosis unlikely.\n\n5. **Porphyria Cutanea Tarda** - Known for photosensitivity, but it usually presents with blistering rather than pustules.\n\n6. **Folliculitis** - Can cause pustules, but it's typically not linked to sun exposure and is more localized.\n\n7. **Drug-Induced Photosensitivity** - Unlikely, as she is not on medications known to cause photosensitivity.\n\n8. **Photodrug Reaction** - Similar to drug-induced photosensitivity, and her use of sunscreens has not prevented eruptions.\n\n9. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus** - Typically presents with discoid plaques and scaling, not just pustules, and her antibody tests were negative.\n\n10. **Pityriasis Lichenoides Chronica** - Can cause papules and sometimes pustules, but it's not typically photosensitive in this way.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the most fitting diagnosis appears to be a rare photosensitive disorder, possibly a form of solar urticaria or an atypical presentation of a known condition. The strong link to sun exposure and negative results for autoimmune antibodies point towards this conclusion. Further specialized testing or consultation with a dermatologist may be necessary to explore this possibility.", "topic": "['Dermatology']"}

Prior to delivery, she underwent diagnostic ultrasound of the right breast, which showed a possible mass in the location of the palpable lesion that was most consistent with a normal island of fibroglandular tissue. Follow-up mammogram and ultrasound of the right breast (without axillary evaluation) were performed 6 months later, which showed an irregular 17-mm mass with associated pleomorphic calcifications in the same area. Ultrasound-guided biopsy was performed. Pathology showed high-grade, estrogen receptor–positive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). On postbiopsy physical examination, the patient had a palpable 2.5-cm right breast mass at the 3-o’clock position without palpable axillary lymphadenopathy. Surgical treatment with lumpectomy was recommended, and breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed prior to surgery to evaluate the extent of disease (Figure). Axial T2-weighted MRI at the level of the axilla revealed edema surrounding 2 enlarged, morphologically abnormal right level-1 axillary lymph nodes; axial postcontrast T1 fat-saturated MRI of the right breast revealed an irregular mass with irregular margins at the site of biopsy-proven DCIS. The patient reported receiving her second dose of COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) in the right arm the day before the breast MRI. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Vaccination-associated reactive lymphadenopathy", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 39-year-old pregnant woman who found a lump in her breast. That's definitely something to pay attention to, especially during pregnancy when breast tissue is changing a lot. So, what could this be? Well, it could be something like a lactating adenoma, which is pretty common in pregnant women. They're usually benign, so that's reassuring.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. The ultrasound initially thought it was just a normal island of fibroglandular tissue. That sounds harmless, but we should keep an open mind. Six months later, there's an irregular mass with some weird calcifications. That's a red flag. Pleomorphic calcifications can be a sign of something more serious, like ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS.\n\nNow, the biopsy results are in, and it's high-grade DCIS that's estrogen receptor-positive. Okay, so we're dealing with a type of non-invasive breast cancer. That's serious, but at least it's non-invasive. We need to think about what this means for treatment and the future.\n\nThe MRI shows something interesting. There are these enlarged, abnormal lymph nodes in the axilla. That's concerning because it might mean the cancer has spread, even though DCIS isn't supposed to do that. Hmm, what's going on here?\n\nOh, and the patient just got her COVID-19 vaccine in the same arm. That's important because the vaccine can cause lymph nodes to swell. Maybe that's what's happening here. It's a common reaction and not necessarily related to the cancer.\n\nSo, what's the most likely explanation for the lymph nodes? It could be the vaccine causing a reaction, or maybe it's actually related to the DCIS. We need to consider both possibilities.\n\nLet's think about other possibilities. Could it be an infection or something else entirely? Inflammatory breast cancer is a possibility, but there's no skin involvement, so that's less likely. And what about a phyllodes tumor? They can be benign or malignant, but the biopsy didn't suggest that.\n\nAlright, let's wrap this up. The most likely explanation for the lymph nodes is the COVID-19 vaccine, but we can't rule out DCIS-related changes entirely. We should keep both on the table. And as for the mass, it's probably the DCIS, but we should also consider other possibilities like a phyllodes tumor or even an infection, just in case.\n\n## Final Response\n\nHere is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the case, considering all the information provided:\n\n1. **Lactating Adenoma** - A common benign breast tumor during pregnancy.\n2. **Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)** - High-grade, estrogen receptor-positive, as identified in the biopsy.\n3. **Fibroadenoma** - A benign breast tumor, though less likely given the calcifications and biopsy results.\n4. **Phyllodes Tumor** - Can be benign, borderline, or malignant, but not indicated in the biopsy.\n5. **Inflammatory Breast Cancer** - Unlikely due to the lack of skin involvement or typical symptoms.\n6. **Breast Abscess** - Possible during pregnancy, but not supported by the imaging or biopsy findings.\n7. **Fat Necrosis** - Can cause lumps and calcifications, but the biopsy suggests otherwise.\n8. **Pseudoangiomatous Stromal Hyperplasia (PASH)** - A benign condition, but not consistent with the biopsy results.\n9. **Lymphatic Metastasis from DCIS** - Uncommon for DCIS, but the MRI findings raise suspicion.\n10. **Vaccine-Related Lymphadenopathy** - A reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine, which can cause axillary lymph node swelling.\n\nReranking these based on all the information, the top differentials are:\n\n1. **DCIS** - Confirmed by biopsy.\n2. **Vaccine-Related Lymphadenopathy** - A likely cause of the axillary lymph node changes.\n3. **Lymphatic Metastasis from DCIS** - Less common, but possible given the MRI findings.\n4. **Phyllodes Tumor** - Though not biopsied, it remains a consideration.\n5. **Inflammatory Breast Cancer** - Unlikely, but should be kept in mind without typical symptoms.\n\nThe remaining differentials are less likely given the biopsy and imaging results.

Her subsequent workup revealed elevated inflammatory markers and subcentimeter chest and abdominal lymph nodes. Given a positive interferon-γ release assay, therapy was initiated with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol (RIPE) and corticosteroids for presumed tuberculosis. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Pediatric neurosarcoidosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 12-year-old girl with some pretty concerning symptoms. She's got an abnormal gait, which is definitely something to pay attention to. And then there's the eye issue—bilateral panuveitis with occlusive retinal periphlebitis. That's a mouthful, but it basically means there's inflammation in both eyes, and it's affecting the retina. That's serious.\n\nNow, what could be causing this? Tuberculosis is a possibility. The interferon-γ release assay came back positive, and that's a test used to detect TB. So, it makes sense they started her on RIPE therapy, which is the standard treatment for TB. But wait, she's also got elevated inflammatory markers and some lymph nodes that are a bit enlarged. That could fit with TB, but let's not jump to conclusions just yet.\n\nHmm, what else could this be? Sarcoidosis comes to mind. It's known for causing uveitis and can also lead to lymph node enlargement. Plus, it can affect the nervous system, which might explain the abnormal gait. That's a strong contender.\n\nBut let's not forget about other possibilities. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is another condition that can cause uveitis. It's more common in young girls, and it can also cause systemic inflammation. So, that's another one to consider.\n\nOh, and there's also multiple sclerosis. It can cause optic neuritis, which might lead to vision problems, and it can definitely cause issues with gait. MS is known for being unpredictable, so it's worth keeping on the list.\n\nNow, what about infections? We've already considered TB, but what about syphilis? It can cause uveitis and neurological issues too. It's a bit of a wildcard, but it's possible.\n\nAnd then there's Behçet's disease. It's a bit rare, but it can cause uveitis and has neurological manifestations. So, it's another one to think about.\n\nLet's not forget about autoimmune conditions like lupus. It can cause a wide range of symptoms, including uveitis and neurological issues. So, that's another possibility.\n\nOh, and we can't ignore the possibility of a central nervous system tumor. If there's something pressing on nerves, it could explain the gait issue. That's definitely something to consider.\n\nFinally, let's think about vitamin B12 deficiency. It can cause neurological symptoms, including issues with gait. It's not the most obvious choice, but it's worth a thought.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I'd say the top differential diagnoses are sarcoidosis, multiple sclerosis, tuberculosis, syphilis, Behçet's disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, lupus, a CNS tumor, vitamin B12 deficiency, and maybe even lymphoma.

Medical history included tertiary hyperparathyroidism related to end-stage kidney disease from chronic glomerulonephritis. The patient had successfully received an ABO-incompatible kidney transplant 1 year ago, but this was complicated by invasive fungal (Volvariella volvacea) infection of the central nervous system. Medications included tacrolimus (0.5 mg twice daily), prednisolone (10 mg daily), cinacalcet (12.5 mg daily), and voriconazole (500 mg daily). On examination, her fingers and toes were symmetrically and diffusely swollen and tender. There was no rash, enthesitis, psoriatic nail changes, clubbing, or lower limb edema. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Alkaline phosphatase level was elevated at 640 U/L (10.69 μkat/L) (reference range, 40-130 U/L [0.67-2.17 μkat/L]).

Radiography of her hands was performed (Figure). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Voriconazole-induced periostitis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 51-year-old woman who's been dealing with some pretty intense joint pain and swelling in her fingers and toes for about a month. That's quite a while to be uncomfortable like that. She hasn't mentioned any fever or weight loss, which is interesting. And there's no rash or hair loss, so we can probably rule out some of the more obvious autoimmune issues like lupus.\n\nNow, she did have a kidney transplant a year ago, and she's on medications like tacrolimus and prednisolone. Those are pretty strong drugs, so we should definitely consider any possible side effects or complications from them. Invasive fungal infections can be a big deal, especially with her history, but she seems to be on top of that with voriconazole.\n\nHer lab results show elevated alkaline phosphatase, which is a bit of a red flag. Her calcium and parathyroid hormone levels are also elevated. That's something to keep in mind, especially with her history of tertiary hyperparathyroidism. But her thyroid function tests are normal, so we can probably rule out thyroid-related issues.\n\nThe negative tests for rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibody are interesting. They make rheumatoid arthritis less likely, but we can't completely rule it out just yet. And her chest X-ray is clear, so no signs of lung disease, which is good.\n\nLet's think about what could be causing this. Given her transplant and medication history, drug-induced issues are a possibility. Tacrolimus can cause some neurological problems, but joint pain isn't typical. Voriconazole can cause some weird side effects, including photosensitivity and liver issues, but again, joint pain isn't common.\n\nCould this be related to her hyperparathyroidism? Elevated calcium and PTH might suggest that, but usually, you'd expect more bone pain or other symptoms, not just joint issues.\n\nWhat about osteoarticular tuberculosis? It's a possibility, especially with her transplant history making her more susceptible to infections. But we'd usually expect some systemic symptoms or abnormalities on her chest X-ray.\n\nGout could be another option. It can cause joint pain and swelling, and it's not uncommon in people with kidney issues. But we'd usually see elevated uric acid levels, and there's no mention of that here.\n\nLet's not forget about psoriatic arthritis. Even though we don't see any skin changes or nail abnormalities, psoriatic arthritis can sometimes present without skin involvement. And it could explain the joint swelling and pain.\n\nOkay, so what's the most likely cause? Considering everything, psoriatic arthritis seems like a strong contender. It fits the joint symptoms, and her transplant history could be a factor. But we should keep an open mind and consider other possibilities like gout or even tuberculosis, especially with her immune status.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Psoriatic Arthritis** - This condition can present with joint pain and swelling, even in the absence of skin changes, and is a plausible consideration given the patient's symptoms and transplant history.\n\n2. **Gout** - Although typically associated with elevated uric acid levels, gout could still be a possibility, especially in someone with a history of kidney issues.\n\n3. **Osteoarticular Tuberculosis** - This infectious possibility is more likely in immunocompromised individuals, such as those who have undergone a transplant, and can present with joint symptoms.\n\n4. **Rheumatoid Arthritis** - Despite negative tests for rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibody, rheumatoid arthritis cannot be completely ruled out, as it can occasionally present with negative serology.\n\n5. **Calcium Pyrophosphate Deposition Disease (Pseudogout)** - This condition can cause joint pain and swelling and is associated with abnormalities in calcium metabolism, which might be relevant given the patient's elevated calcium and parathyroid hormone levels.\n\n6. **Hyperparathyroidism-related Arthropathy** - The patient's history of tertiary hyperparathyroidism and current lab findings could contribute to joint symptoms, although this is less common.\n\n7. **Voriconazole-induced Periostitis** - Voriconazole is known to cause periostitis, which could manifest as joint pain and swelling, especially in the fingers and toes.\n\n8. **Osteonecrosis** - This condition can occur in patients on long-term corticosteroid therapy, like prednisolone, and might present with joint pain.\n\n9. **Hematologic Disorder** - Conditions like multiple myeloma can cause bone and joint pain, although other typical symptoms like anemia or kidney dysfunction are not present here.\n\n10. **Sarcoidosis** - This systemic condition can affect the joints and might be considered, although other characteristic features like lung involvement or skin changes are absent.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses would be **Psoriatic Arthritis**, **Voriconazole-induced Periostitis**, and **Gout**, as they align well with the patient's symptoms and medical history.

Posterior examination results showed a vitreous cell that precluded a clear view of the posterior pole and inferior snow banking.

We've got a 58-year-old man with a retinal detachment in his left eye. His vision is really poor in that eye, just hand motion, while the right eye is perfect at 20/20. That's quite a difference. Now, looking at the left eye, there are a lot of cells in the anterior chamber, about 30 per field, and these stellate keratic precipitates. That sounds like some inflammation going on. \n\nMoving to the back of the eye, there's a lot of haze from the vitreous cells, so it's hard to see clearly. But there's this large, white, preretinal lesion in the macula area. That's unusual. And there's a near-total retinal detachment, but no breaks in the retina. Plus, there's shifting subretinal fluid. That's a lot to take in.\n\nOkay, let's start thinking about what this could be. The first thing that comes to mind is vitreous hemorrhage. It's common with retinal detachments, but usually, there's some trauma or a tear involved, and we don't have that here. So, maybe not that.\n\nNext, let's consider proliferative vitreoretinopathy. It's known for causing tractional retinal detachments, but we don't see the typical retinal tears or membrane formation here. Hmm, not quite fitting.\n\nNow, what about infectious causes? CMV retinitis could be a contender. It causes retinal detachments and has those whitish lesions. But, it's more common in people with compromised immune systems, and we don't have any info on that. Still, it's worth keeping in mind.\n\nLet's think about autoimmune issues. Behçet's disease can cause uveitis and retinal problems, but it usually has systemic symptoms too, and we don't have any mention of those. So, maybe not that.\n\nOh, what about sarcoidosis? It can cause uveitis and retinal issues, but we'd expect more systemic signs or history of it. Not seeing that here, so let's put it aside for now.\n\nNow, primary vitreoretinal lymphoma is an interesting thought. It can cause vitreous cells and retinal detachments, and that white preretinal lesion is suspicious. This could be a strong contender.\n\nLet's not forget about central serous chorioretinopathy. It causes serous retinal detachments, but it's more common in younger people and doesn't usually have this level of inflammation. So, probably not that.\n\nAcute retinal necrosis is another possibility. It causes retinal detachments and whitish lesions, often in a more sudden onset. But, it's usually linked to viral infections, and we don't have that history here. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nNow, let's think about tuberculosis-associated intermediate uveitis. It can cause vitreous inflammation and retinal issues, but we'd expect some systemic symptoms or history. Not seeing that, so let's put it aside.\n\nFinally, there's sympathetic ophthalmia. It's a rare condition that can cause bilateral granulomatous uveitis and retinal detachments. But, it's usually after eye surgery or trauma, and we don't have that history. So, probably not that.\n\nAlright, let's rank these. Based on everything, primary vitreoretinal lymphoma seems like the strongest fit. It matches the vitreous cells, the white lesion, and the detachment. CMV retinitis is next, given the lesions and detachment, even without immune system info. Then comes acute retinal necrosis, considering the sudden nature and lesions. The others just don't fit as well with the details we have.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the condition described, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Vitreous Hemorrhage** - While common with retinal detachments, it typically involves trauma or retinal tears, which are not present here.\n\n2. **Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy (PVR)** - Known for causing tractional detachments, but the absence of retinal tears or membrane formation makes it less likely.\n\n3. **CMV Retinitis** - A strong contender due to the retinal detachment and whitish lesions, commonly seen in immunocompromised patients.\n\n4. **Behçet's Disease** - Could cause uveitis and retinal issues, but systemic symptoms are typically present, which are not mentioned here.\n\n5. **Sarcoidosis** - Can cause uveitis and retinal problems, but usually accompanied by systemic signs or history, which are absent.\n\n6. **Primary Vitreoretinal Lymphoma** - A likely possibility due to vitreous cells, retinal detachment, and the suspicious white preretinal lesion.\n\n7. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy** - Typically occurs in younger individuals and doesn't usually involve significant inflammation, making it less likely.\n\n8. **Acute Retinal Necrosis** - Causes retinal detachments and whitish lesions, often with a sudden onset, but usually linked to viral infections.\n\n9. **Tuberculosis-associated Intermediate Uveitis** - Can cause vitreous inflammation and retinal issues, but systemic symptoms or history are expected.\n\n10. **Sympathetic Ophthalmia** - A rare condition causing bilateral granulomatous uveitis and retinal detachments, usually after eye surgery or trauma, which are not present here.\n\nReranking these possibilities based on the clinical presentation, the top three differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Primary Vitreoretinal Lymphoma** - Matches the vitreous cells, white preretinal lesion, and retinal detachment.\n2. **CMV Retinitis** - Fits the retinal detachment and whitish lesions, despite the lack of information on immune status.\n3. **Acute Retinal Necrosis** - Considers the sudden onset and lesions, although typically linked to viral infections.\n\nThese three conditions align most closely with the clinical findings and should be further investigated.", "topic": "['Global Health', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Ophthalmology', 'Retinal Disorders']"}

The patient had no history of weakness, incontinence, or severe headaches. Initial presentation was notable for hand motion visual acuity with a 2+ relative afferent pupillary defect on the right; fundus examination revealed grade IV disc edema with obscuration of all major vessels on the disc (Figure, A). A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain with and without gadolinium contrast was degraded by motion and orthodontic artifact but was suggestive of optic nerve enhancement consistent with optic neuritis. Results of serology tests and cerebral spinal fluid analysis were negative for infectious and inflammatory etiologies, including syphilis, sarcoidosis, Lyme disease, viral etiologies, multiple sclerosis, and lupus. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Pilocytic astrocytoma with anaplastic transformation", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 17-year-old girl who's been dealing with vision problems in her right eye for a few months. That's quite a while to be experiencing decreased vision. And there's this throbbing pain that kicks in whenever she moves her eye. That sounds uncomfortable. \n\nFirst off, optic neuritis comes to mind. It's pretty common in young females and can definitely cause vision loss and pain with eye movement. But, the tests didn't show any signs of multiple sclerosis or other inflammatory causes. That's a bit of a twist. \n\nSo, what else could it be? Let's consider neuromyelitis optica. It's known for causing optic neuritis, but usually, there are other symptoms like transverse myelitis, which she doesn't have. Plus, the tests were negative. Hmm, that's not adding up. \n\nNext, I'm thinking about chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy, or CRION. It's a bit rare, but it fits the age and symptoms. The recurrent nature of optic neuritis without a clear systemic cause makes me consider this. \n\nBut wait, what if it's something less inflammatory and more structural? Like an optic nerve sheath meningioma. These can cause gradual vision loss and sometimes pain. The MRI was a bit iffy due to motion artifacts, so maybe something was missed. \n\nI should also think about infections, but the tests ruled those out. Sarcoidosis is another possibility, but again, the tests were negative. \n\nCould it be something like a mitochondrial disorder? They can cause optic neuropathies, but usually, there are other neurological symptoms. She seems pretty healthy otherwise. \n\nAnterior ischemic optic neuropathy is another thought, but that's more sudden and painless, so it doesn't quite fit. \n\nI'm also wondering about a compressive lesion, like a pituitary adenoma. They can cause gradual vision changes if they're pressing on the optic nerve. But, there's no mention of other symptoms like hormonal changes. \n\nLet's not forget about hereditary optic neuropathies. They often run in families, but she's young and healthy, so it's less likely. \n\nFinally, could it be something like a granulomatosis with polyangiitis? It's a bit of a stretch since the tests were negative, but it could explain the optic nerve issues. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I think CRION is still a strong contender. But, I'm also leaning towards the possibility of an optic nerve sheath meningioma. The gradual symptoms and negative tests make me suspicious of something structural that wasn't caught clearly on the MRI. \n\nIn the end, I'm going to rank CRION and optic nerve sheath meningioma as my top two possibilities. They both fit the symptoms and the test results, even if it's not a perfect match.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 17-year-old girl with decreased vision and pain in her right eye:\n\n1. **Optic Neuritis** - Common in young females, it can cause vision loss and pain with eye movement.\n2. **Neuromyelitis Optica** - Known for causing optic neuritis, but typically accompanied by transverse myelitis.\n3. **Chronic Relapsing Inflammatory Optic Neuropathy (CRION)** - Fits the age and recurrent optic neuritis without clear systemic cause.\n4. **Optic Nerve Sheath Meningioma** - Could cause gradual vision loss and sometimes pain; consider given the MRI limitations.\n5. **Sarcoidosis** - Although tests were negative, it remains a possibility due to optic nerve involvement.\n6. **Mitochondrial Disorder** - Can cause optic neuropathies, but usually with other neurological symptoms.\n7. **Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy** - Typically sudden and painless, so less likely in this case.\n8. **Pituitary Adenoma** - Could cause gradual vision changes if compressing the optic nerve, but often with hormonal symptoms.\n9. **Hereditary Optic Neuropathy** - Less likely given her age and health, but could be considered.\n10. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis** - A stretch given negative tests, but could explain optic nerve issues.\n\nReranking these possibilities based on all information, the top two differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Chronic Relapsing Inflammatory Optic Neuropathy (CRION)**\n2. **Optic Nerve Sheath Meningioma**\n\nThese two conditions best fit the symptoms and test results, considering the negative findings for infectious and inflammatory causes.

Three weeks prior, he had developed acute urinary retention. Neurological examination revealed weakness in bilateral lower limbs (Medical Research Council grade 4 on the right and grade 3 on the left), extensor plantar responses, and a sensory level at T6. Magnetic resonance imaging of his thoracic spine was performed 10 days after the onset of weakness and did not show any signal abnormalities or restricted diffusion. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis findings were remarkable for elevated protein (0.14 g/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10]) but white cell count (5 cells/mm3) and glucose levels (54.05 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555]) were normal. Cytology and flow cytometry were negative for malignancy. Antibodies to aquaporin 4 and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein were not detected. The patient developed a sudden worsening of weakness in his legs 2 weeks after initial presentation. Repeated thoracic spine imaging showed an area of T2 hyperintensity in the left posterolateral cord at T7, which did not enhance with contrast or show restricted diffusion (Figure 1A). Notably, he had a 4-year history of an asymptomatic papular skin eruption with more lesions developing in the last 4 months. These were distributed on the neck, trunk, and limbs, sparing his face, scalp, and genitalia (Figure 1B). Findings of extensive workup for malignancy, including full-body computed tomography scan, paraneoplastic antibody panel, and systemic autoimmune diseases (antinuclear antibody, antidouble stranded DNA, and myositis antibody panel), were negative. The skin papules were biopsied. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Malignant atrophic papulosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 46-year-old guy who suddenly can't move his legs well and feels numb up to his chest. That's pretty serious. And he had trouble peeing a few weeks back too. Hmm, that sounds like something neurological, maybe affecting his spinal cord.\n\nOkay, so the MRI didn't show much at first, but then later on, it did show something weird in his spine. That's interesting. And the spinal fluid had more protein than usual, but not many white blood cells. That makes me think of something like a virus or maybe an autoimmune issue, not bacteria.\n\nOh, and he's got these skin bumps that he didn't have before, or at least they're getting worse. They're all over his body except his face and scalp. That's a big clue. I should think about diseases that affect both the skin and the nervous system.\n\nLet's see, what could cause these symptoms? Multiple sclerosis comes to mind, but usually, you'd see more white blood cells in the spinal fluid, and the MRI findings aren't quite right for that. And we didn't find any of those specific antibodies for MS or another condition called NMO.\n\nWhat about infections? Viruses like HIV or HTLV-1 can cause neurologic problems and skin issues. HTLV-1 is known for causing tropical spastic paraparesis, which fits the leg weakness. And it can cause skin lesions too.\n\nBut wait, we didn't find any of the usual antibodies for those either. That's weird. Maybe it's something rare or atypical.\n\nLet's not forget about syphilis. It can affect the nervous system and skin, but usually, the spinal fluid would have more going on. And we didn't check for syphilis specifically, did we?\n\nOh, and there's sarcoidosis. It can cause skin problems and neurologic issues, but I'd expect more going on in the MRI or spinal fluid. Still, it's worth considering.\n\nNow, what about lymphoma? It can cause skin lesions and neurologic problems, especially if it's in the spinal cord. But we didn't find any cancer cells in the spinal fluid, and the scans didn't show a tumor. Hmm, that's a mystery.\n\nLet's think about autoimmune diseases like lupus. They can cause a variety of symptoms, including skin rashes and neurologic problems. But usually, you'd see more systemic symptoms or a positive ANA test.\n\nAnd then there's this idea of a paraneoplastic syndrome. It's a long shot, but it could explain the neurologic symptoms and skin changes without obvious cancer findings. Maybe it's related to a tumor we haven't found yet.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think HTLV-1-associated myelopathy is a strong contender. It fits the symptoms and the negative test results. But I shouldn't rule out syphilis, sarcoidosis, or a paraneoplastic process just yet. They're still in the running until we get more information.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **HTLV-1-associated Myelopathy (Tropical Spastic Paraparesis)**: This condition aligns with the neurological symptoms, skin lesions, and negative antibody results.\n\n2. **Syphilis**: Known for its varied presentations, syphilis can affect both the skin and nervous system, though typically the spinal fluid would show more abnormalities.\n\n3. **Sarcoidosis**: This condition can cause both skin lesions and neurological issues, but often there would be more findings on MRI or in the spinal fluid.\n\n4. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**: This could explain the neurological symptoms and skin changes, potentially related to a hidden tumor.\n\n5. **Lymphoma**: Although no cancer cells were found, lymphoma can present with skin and neurological manifestations, and sometimes tumors are not immediately detectable.\n\n6. **Multiple Sclerosis**: While the MRI and spinal fluid findings aren't classic, atypical presentations can occur, so it remains a consideration.\n\n7. **Neurosyphilis**: A form of syphilis affecting the nervous system, which could explain some symptoms, but spinal fluid findings would typically be more abnormal.\n\n8. **Primary Effusion Lymphoma**: A rare form of lymphoma that can present with skin lesions and neurological symptoms, though usually more systemic signs are present.\n\n9. **Autoimmune Encephalitis**: This can cause neurological symptoms, and some types are associated with skin manifestations, though specific antibodies are usually found.\n\n10. **Viral Myelitis**: Caused by viruses like HIV or CMV, this can result in neurological deficits, but usually, the spinal fluid shows more inflammatory signs.\n\nReranking these based on the patient's presentation and test results, HTLV-1-associated myelopathy remains the most likely diagnosis, followed closely by syphilis and sarcoidosis. The paraneoplastic syndrome and lymphoma also remain strong contenders due to the skin and neurological involvement. Further testing, including a HTLV-1 serology and syphilis serology, would be prudent to confirm the diagnosis.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Neurology', 'Spinal Cord Disorders']"}

He also reported recent-onset headache while reading. Physical examination revealed a depressed plaque measuring 6 × 4 cm in the right infraorbital region, surrounded by multiple nodules of sizes ranging from 1 × 1 cm to 5 × 1 cm (Figure, A). The nodules were firm, mobile, and nontender on palpation. Local temperature was normal. There was proptosis of the right eye with mild restriction of extraocular movements on lateral gaze. Examination of the oral cavity revealed dental caries, while gingivolabial sulcus was free on bidigital examination. Nasal mucosa was normal. Respiratory system examination revealed occasional polyphonic wheeze. Chest radiography imaging showed nodular opacities in right upper zone and bronchiectasis. Punch biopsy from 1 nodule was sent for histopathological and microbiological examination (Figure, B and C). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cutaneous aspergillosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a man in his 30s with these nodules on his cheek. They've been there for four years, and he says they're painless. That's interesting. Painless nodules could mean a lot of things, but let's start with the possibility of a lipoma. They're pretty common and usually not painful.\n\nNow, he's also got some respiratory issues. He's been dealing with breathlessness, coughing, and wheezing, and he mentions brownish sputum. That sounds like it could be related to his environment, especially since it gets worse with hay dust. Asthma comes to mind here because it's often triggered by allergens like dust.\n\nBut wait, there's more. He's got this depressed plaque and some proptosis of the right eye. Proptosis suggests something might be going on in the orbit. Could it be a neurofibroma? They can cause both skin changes and affect the eye.\n\nLet's not forget the histopathological findings. The biopsy shows some interesting features. There are epithelioid cell granulomas and giant cells. This makes me think of sarcoidosis, which can affect the skin and lungs and cause systemic symptoms.\n\nOh, and the chest X-ray. It shows nodular opacities and bronchiectasis. That's a significant finding. Bronchiectasis can be caused by chronic infection or inflammation. Cystic fibrosis is known for causing bronchiectasis, especially with these kinds of respiratory symptoms.\n\nBut what about the skin nodules? They could be related to the systemic condition. In sarcoidosis, you can get skin manifestations like lupus pernio. That would fit with the nodules and the systemic findings.\n\nNow, let's think about the occupational exposure. As a painter, he's around a lot of chemicals. Could that be causing some of these symptoms? Chemical exposure might lead to contact dermatitis, which could explain some of the skin findings.\n\nHmm, what about the eye symptoms? The proptosis and restricted eye movement could be from a orbital tumor, like a rhabdomyosarcoma. That would explain the eye findings, but not necessarily the rest.\n\nLet's not forget about infections. With the respiratory symptoms and nodular opacities, tuberculosis is a possibility. It can cause lung nodules and affect other parts of the body, including the skin.\n\nOh, and there's the possibility of a fungal infection like sporotrichosis. It can cause nodular skin lesions and might be related to his gardening activities.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top differential diagnosis is sarcoidosis. It explains the skin nodules, lung findings, and eye symptoms. But we should also consider tuberculosis and sporotrichosis as they fit some of the findings too.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Lipoma** - Given the painless nature of the nodules, lipoma is a common consideration for subcutaneous nodules.\n\n2. **Asthma** - The episodic breathlessness, cough, and wheezing, especially with exposure to hay dust, aligns with asthma.\n\n3. **Neurofibroma** - The depressed plaque and proptosis of the eye could suggest a neurofibroma, which can affect both skin and orbit.\n\n4. **Sarcoidosis** - The presence of epithelioid cell granulomas and giant cells in the biopsy is highly suggestive of sarcoidosis, which can involve skin, lungs, and eyes.\n\n5. **Cystic Fibrosis** - The combination of respiratory symptoms and bronchiectasis on chest X-ray raises the possibility of cystic fibrosis.\n\n6. **Lupus Pernio** - This is a skin manifestation of sarcoidosis and could explain the nodules on the cheek.\n\n7. **Contact Dermatitis** - Occupational exposure to chemicals as a painter could lead to contact dermatitis, affecting the skin.\n\n8. **Orbital Tumor (Rhabdomyosarcoma)** - Proptosis and restricted eye movement could be due to an orbital tumor like rhabdomyosarcoma.\n\n9. **Tuberculosis** - The lung nodules and systemic symptoms could be attributed to tuberculosis, which can affect the skin and lungs.\n\n10. **Sporotrichosis** - This fungal infection can cause nodular skin lesions and is a consideration given potential environmental exposure.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnosis is **Sarcoidosis**, as it comprehensively explains the skin nodules, lung findings, and eye symptoms. **Tuberculosis** and **Sporotrichosis** are also strong contenders that fit several aspects of the clinical presentation.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Fungal Infections', 'Infectious Diseases']"}

We've got a 69-year-old man who's been dealing with some pretty serious skin discoloration for about a month now. It's gotten progressively darker, and it's not just a little bit—it's a significant change to a blue-black color. That's quite unusual.\n\nNow, looking at his medical history, he's got a lot going on. Chronic kidney disease, hepatitis C, cirrhosis, and heart issues with an ICD. Plus, he's on anticoagulation therapy with apixaban. Oh, and he's been on minocycline for six months because of a staph infection related to his ICD lead. That's a long time to be on an antibiotic like that.\n\nThe skin discoloration is mostly on his arms and legs, and it's not just the skin—his sclerae and teeth are also discolored. That's a big clue. Usually, when you see discoloration like this, you think about medications or metabolic issues.\n\nMinocycline is known to cause bluish discoloration, especially with long-term use. It's kind of a classic case, actually. The timing fits too, since he's been on it for six months and the discoloration started getting worse about a month ago.\n\nBut let's not jump to conclusions just yet. What about other possibilities? Could it be something like argyria? That's caused by silver deposits, but there's no mention of him being exposed to silver. So that seems unlikely.\n\nWhat about hemochromatosis? That's a condition where iron builds up in the body, causing skin changes, but it usually comes with other symptoms like diabetes and liver problems. He does have cirrhosis, but there's no mention of other classic symptoms.\n\nWilson's disease is another possibility. It's a copper deposition disease that can cause skin changes and Kayser-Fleischer rings in the eyes. But he doesn't have those rings, and Wilson's typically presents in a younger person.\n\nPorphyria cutanea tarda could cause skin discoloration too, especially with his history of liver disease. But you'd usually expect blistering or other skin changes, which he doesn't have.\n\nOh, and what about alkaptonuria? That's a rare metabolic disorder where homogentisic acid builds up and causes bluish-black discoloration. It fits the description, but it's pretty rare and there's no mention of dark urine, which is a hallmark of the disease.\n\nSo, when I put it all together, minocycline-induced cutaneous pigmentation seems like the most likely cause. The timing, the nature of the discoloration, and his medication history all point to it. The other conditions don't quite fit as well, either because of his age, the symptoms, or the lack of other diagnostic clues.\n\nYeah, I'm feeling pretty confident that minocycline is the culprit here. It's a well-known side effect, and everything lines up. I think we've got our answer.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely cause of the skin discoloration is minocycline-induced cutaneous pigmentation. The patient has been on minocycline for six months, which is known to cause bluish discoloration with long-term use. The timing and nature of the discoloration, as well as the involvement of the sclerae and teeth, align well with this diagnosis. While other conditions such as argyria, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, porphyria cutanea tarda, and alkaptonuria could potentially cause skin discoloration, they are less likely given the specifics of this case. Therefore, minocycline-induced pigmentation is the most probable diagnosis. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Minocycline-induced cutaneous pigmentation**  \n2.

He noticed colors surrounding the dark area that lasted 2 to 3 minutes at a time and occurred multiple times per day. His medical history was significant for dyslipidemia for which he took rosuvastatin. He also reported feeling lethargic, with polydipsia and a dull mild holocephalic headache during this period. Ophthalmological examination revealed a visual acuity of 20/20 OU, pupils were equal and reactive to light with no relative afferent pupillary defect, and color vision was normal. Dilated fundus examination was normal. Humphrey 24-2 Swedish interactive threshold algorithm fast visual field testing revealed a right homonymous hemianopia denser inferiorly (Figure, A). An urgent noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head was obtained and was normal (Figure, B). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was initially reported as normal but revealed subtle abnormal T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity involving the left occipital cortex after further review (Figure, B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Homonymous hemianopia secondary to nonketotic hyperglycemia", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 46-year-old guy who's been dealing with this weird visual issue for a couple of weeks. He's seeing a blurry patch in his right lower visual field, and it's happening in both eyes. That's interesting because it suggests something going on beyond just the eyes themselves, maybe in the brain.\n\nHe's also seeing colors around this dark area, and it's coming and going multiple times a day. That's kind of like a visual aura, isn't it? It makes me think of migraines, especially since migraines can cause all sorts of visual disturbances.\n\nNow, let's not forget his medical history. He's got dyslipidemia and takes rosuvastatin for it. That's something to keep in mind, especially since statins can have all sorts of side effects. But in this case, it doesn't seem directly related to his visual symptoms.\n\nHe's also feeling really tired, drinking a lot of water, and has a headache. These could be related to his vision problem or something else entirely. It's like he's got a bunch of different things going on at once.\n\nThe eye exam was pretty normal, which is good. His vision is 20/20, pupils are reacting fine, and there's no problem with his color vision. The fundus exam didn't show anything either, so it's not a problem with the retina or anything obvious in the eye.\n\nThe visual field test tells us more. He's got a right homonymous hemianopia, which means he's missing the same area of the visual field in both eyes. That's a classic sign of something going on in the brain, specifically the left side, since it affects the right visual field.\n\nThe CT scan didn't show anything, but that's not too surprising. CT scans can miss things that an MRI would pick up. And speaking of MRI, initially, it was reported as normal, but then they found something. There's a subtle abnormality in the left occipital cortex. That's the area that processes vision, so it fits with his symptoms.\n\nSo, what could this be? My first thought is a migraine aura. Those can cause temporary visual symptoms like what he's experiencing. But usually, they don't last this long or happen this frequently.\n\nNext, I'm thinking about seizures, specifically occipital lobe seizures. They can cause similar visual disturbances and could explain the frequent episodes.\n\nThere's also the possibility of a structural lesion, like a small tumor or something vascular like an arteriovenous malformation. But if it was something like that, I'd expect more findings on the MRI.\n\nOh, and what about those other symptoms like lethargy and polydipsia? They could be unrelated, or maybe they're part of a larger metabolic issue. But they don't seem directly connected to the visual problem.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think occipital lobe seizures make the most sense here. They fit with the type of visual symptoms he's having and the abnormality found on the MRI. It's not just a simple migraine aura, given the duration and frequency of his episodes.\n\nYeah, I feel pretty confident about that. Occipital lobe seizures seem to be the best explanation for what's going on.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's symptoms, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Migraine Aura** - The visual disturbances could be indicative of a migraine aura, given their transient and recurrent nature.\n\n2. **Occipital Lobe Seizures** - The type and frequency of visual symptoms, along with the MRI findings, strongly suggest occipital lobe seizures as a likely cause.\n\n3. **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)** - Although less likely given the duration and recurrence, TIAs can cause temporary visual field deficits.\n\n4. **Retinal Migraine** - This could explain the visual symptoms, but typically involves monocular vision loss rather than homonymous hemianopia.\n\n5. **Vitamin Deficiency** - The lethargy and polydipsia might hint at a metabolic issue, but it's less directly linked to the visual symptoms.\n\n6. **Medication Side Effect** - Rosuvastatin and other medications can have neurological side effects, but this is less commonly associated with visual field defects.\n\n7. **Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM)** - A vascular anomaly could cause both visual and neurological symptoms, but more significant findings would be expected on MRI.\n\n8. **Brain Tumor** - A small tumor in the occipital lobe could cause visual field defects, but typically more pronounced abnormalities would be visible on MRI.\n\n9. **Multiple Sclerosis** - Demyelinating diseases can cause a variety of neurological symptoms, including visual disturbances, but usually involve other signs.\n\n10. **Metabolic Encephalopathy** - A systemic metabolic issue could cause encephalopathy with visual symptoms, but the specific pattern of homonymous hemianopia is less typical.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnosis is **Occipital Lobe Seizures**, as it best explains the frequent and specific visual disturbances along with the subtle MRI findings. Migraine aura is also a strong consideration, but the duration and frequency of episodes lean more towards a seizure disorder.", "topic": "['Neurology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Diabetes', 'Diabetes and Endocrinology', 'Neuroimaging']"}

Visual acuity was 20/20 OD and light perception OS. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 15 mm Hg OD and 54 mm Hg OS. Anterior segment examination of the left eye was remarkable for a large cystic iris stromal lesion from the 2- to 7-o’clock position with iris-cornea touch. The anterior chamber was shallow in the area of the enlarged cystic lesion with a large amount of pigmented cells. The pupil was irregular with blood at the pupillary margin. Her intraocular lens was not visible because of occlusion by a cystic lesion behind the iris (Figure 1). Her ocular history was notable for indiscriminate trauma to her left eye, primary open-angle glaucoma in both eyes treated with dorzolamide hydrochloride and brimonidine tartrate, and pseudophakia in both eyes. Four years prior, an inferior cystic iris stromal lesion was discovered in the left eye that measured approximately 5 × 2 mm in basal dimensions at the slitlamp. Fine-needle aspiration was negative for malignancy, and the lesion was managed by close follow-up. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Secondary angle-closure glaucoma due to sudden enlargement of a cystic iris stromal lesion", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 63-year-old woman who woke up with cloudy vision and some pain around her left eye. That's not good. Her visual acuity is really off in that eye, and the pressure is way higher than it should be. Hmm, that's a big red flag for something going on in the eye.\n\nNow, let's look at the front part of her eye. There's this large cystic lesion on her iris, and it's touching the cornea. That's not normal. Plus, the anterior chamber is shallow, and there are a lot of pigmented cells floating around. Her pupil is irregular, and there's blood at the edge. That's concerning.\n\nShe's had eye issues before, including glaucoma and some kind of trauma. And she's got these pseudophakic lenses in both eyes. Oh, and there was a smaller cystic lesion found a few years ago. They checked it out with a needle, and it wasn't cancerous at the time. But now it's bigger, and things are worse.\n\nSo, what could this be? Let's start with the obvious. It could be a malignant iris melanoma. Those can grow and cause exactly these kinds of symptoms. But wait, they checked for cancer before, and it was fine. Still, things change, and it could have turned malignant.\n\nAnother possibility is a cystic iris tumor, maybe a benign one like a leiomyoma. Those can grow too, but they don't usually cause this much trouble unless they get really big.\n\nThere's also the chance of iris neovascularization. That's when new blood vessels grow on the iris, often due to some underlying problem. It could explain the blood and the pressure issues.\n\nAnd then there's the idea of a hyphema, which is blood in the front chamber of the eye. That could happen from trauma or a tumor bleeding. But it seems more like a symptom here rather than the main problem.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about lens-related issues. With her history of pseudophakia, maybe the lens is causing some trouble. But it seems more like the iris lesion is the main issue here.\n\nNow, what about glaucoma? She's got a history of it, and the high pressure is a big clue. But it seems like the cyst is causing the pressure increase, rather than the other way around.\n\nCould it be uveitis? That's inflammation of the middle layer of the eye, and it can cause pain and vision issues. But it doesn't quite fit with the cystic lesion and the blood.\n\nAnd then there's the possibility of a spontaneous hyphema from the cystic lesion. If it's bleeding, that could explain the blood and the sudden vision change.\n\nFinally, let's consider a secondary hemorrhage from the previous trauma. If the old injury is acting up, it could cause bleeding and these symptoms.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top possibility is still a malignant iris melanoma. It fits with the growth of the lesion and the symptoms. But we shouldn't rule out the other options yet. A cystic iris tumor or a spontaneous hyphema could also be the culprit. We need to keep an open mind and maybe do some more tests to be sure.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the condition described:\n\n1. **Malignant Iris Melanoma** - This is a strong consideration given the growth of the cystic lesion and associated symptoms like increased intraocular pressure and irregular pupil with blood at the margin.\n\n2. **Cystic Iris Tumor (Benign)** - This could be a leiomyoma or another type of benign tumor that has grown, causing the observed changes.\n\n3. **Iris Neovascularization** - This involves the growth of new blood vessels on the iris, which could lead to increased pressure and bleeding.\n\n4. **Spontaneous Hyphema** - Bleeding from the cystic lesion could cause sudden vision changes and blood in the anterior chamber.\n\n5. **Secondary Hemorrhage from Trauma** - Past trauma could be contributing to the current bleeding and symptoms.\n\n6. **Lens-Related Complications** - Issues with the pseudophakic lens could be causing or exacerbating the symptoms, though it seems less likely given the iris lesion.\n\n7. **Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma** - While she has a history of glaucoma, the cystic lesion seems to be the primary issue causing the pressure increase.\n\n8. **Iritis or Uveitis** - Inflammation of the iris could cause pain and vision issues, but it doesn't fully explain the cystic lesion and blood.\n\n9. **Iris Cyst** - A benign cyst could have grown, causing the observed changes, but the presence of blood is atypical.\n\n10. **Vascular Tumor of the Iris** - A tumor with a vascular component could explain the bleeding and pressure issues.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnosis is **Malignant Iris Melanoma**, given the lesion's growth and associated symptoms. However, **Cystic Iris Tumor (Benign)** and **Spontaneous Hyphema** are also strong possibilities and should be further investigated. It's important to conduct additional tests, like ultrasound biomicroscopy or a repeat fine-needle aspiration, to determine the exact nature of the lesion.", "topic": "['Glaucoma', 'Ophthalmology']"}

Her ocular history included pseudoexfoliation syndrome and glaucomatous optic neuropathy in the right eye. Past ocular surgery included uncomplicated trabeculectomy in the right eye treated with mitomycin C (3 months prior) and no ocular surgery history in the left eye. Her medical history included pulmonary Mycobacterium avium infection secondary to hypogammaglobulinemia. Computed tomography scan 2 months prior exhibited reactivation and she started treatment with clarithromycin (1000 mg/d), ethambutol (15 mg/kg/d), and rifabutin (300 mg/d). Best-corrected visual acuity was hand motions OD and 20/20 OS. Intraocular pressures were 4 mm Hg ODand 13 mm Hg OS. Anterior segment examination of the right eye showed substantial conjunctival hyperemia and substantial cellular response in the anterior chamber (2 to 3+) along with a 1-mm hypopyon. There was no leak at the trabeculectomy bleb (negative Seidel test). B-scan ultrasonography showed no retinal detachment or mass. Presumed diagnosis of bleb-related infectious endophthalmitis was made and she was referred for treatment. Pars plana vitrectomy was performed, including vitreous sampling, and showed very light growth of Staphylococcus aureus in 1 colony on 1 plate, which was highly suspicious for contaminant. Intravitreal amikacin and vancomycin were administered after vitreous sampling was performed. Postoperatively, the patient initiated treatment with topical antibiotics and corticosteroids. Her visual acuity returned to 20/30. Two months later, she presented again with a similar acute vision loss in the left eye (counting fingers). Anterior segment examination showed conjunctival hyperemia, cellular reaction, and a small hypopyon (Figure). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Rifabutin-associated uveitis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 72-year-old woman who's suddenly having trouble seeing out of her right eye. She's had some eye issues before, like pseudoexfoliation syndrome and glaucoma, and she had surgery on that eye not too long ago. Oh, and she's on meds for a lung infection, which is a bit unusual. \n\nFirst off, the symptoms in her right eye are pretty serious: vision is down to just hand motions, there's redness, and there's stuff floating around in the front part of her eye. Plus, the pressure in that eye is really low. That's not good. \n\nGiven all this, infectious endophthalmitis jumps to mind right away. It's a known risk after eye surgery, especially with a bleb like she has from her trabeculectomy. \n\nBut wait, the test results from the vitrectomy are a bit of a head-scratcher. They only found one colony of Staphylococcus aureus, and it's just on one plate. That really sounds like a contaminant to me, not a real infection. \n\nSo, if it's not a bacterial infection, what else could it be? The fact that she's on rifabutin for her lung infection makes me think about possible side effects. I've heard that rifabutin can cause eye issues, like uveitis. That could explain the inflammation we're seeing. \n\nAnd then, there's her immune system to consider. She's got hypogammaglobulinemia, which means her immune system isn't working properly. That could make her more prone to infections, but it could also lead to other problems, like unusual inflammatory responses. \n\nNow, let's think about the left eye. It's having similar problems just a couple of months later. That's suspicious. If it was just a one-off infection in the right eye, you'd think the left would be fine. But no, it's got the same symptoms. \n\nThis makes me think it's something systemic, maybe related to her medication or her immune system. Like, could the rifabutin be causing this? Or is her immune system just acting up? \n\nSo, putting it all together, I'm leaning towards this being a case of drug-induced uveitis, probably from the rifabutin. It fits with the bilateral nature of the symptoms and the lack of clear infection in the tests. \n\nYeah, that makes sense. The timeline, the symptoms, the test results – they all point towards a drug reaction rather than an infection.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, considering the complexities of her symptoms and treatment history:\n\n1. **Bleb-Related Infectious Endophthalmitis** - Given the history of recent trabeculectomy and symptoms like hypopyon and low intraocular pressure, this is a primary concern.\n\n2. **Rifabutin-Induced Uveitis** - The patient's use of rifabutin for her lung infection could potentially cause uveitis, which aligns with the bilateral nature of her symptoms.\n\n3. **Non-Infectious Endophthalmitis** - This could be related to her immune system dysfunction or a reaction to her medications.\n\n4. **Sterile Hypopyon** - Possibly due to an immune response rather than an infection, especially given her hypogammaglobulinemia.\n\n5. **Toxic Anterior Segment Syndrome (TASS)** - A non-infectious inflammation that can occur after eye surgery.\n\n6. **Lens-Induced Uveitis** - Although less likely, this could be a consideration if the lens is involved.\n\n7. **Intermediate Uveitis** - Often related to systemic diseases or immune system dysregulation.\n\n8. **Vitreous Hemorrhage** - Could cause decreased vision, but the ultrasound didn't show this.\n\n9. **Cystoid Macular Edema** - Might cause vision changes, but doesn't explain the hypopyon.\n\n10. **Autoimmune-Related Uveitis** - Given her hypogammaglobulinemia, an autoimmune process could be contributing.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnosis is **Rifabutin-Induced Uveitis**, given the bilateral nature of the symptoms and the suspicious timing with her medication use. This diagnosis aligns well with the lack of significant infectious findings in the vitreous culture. It's important to review her medication regimen and consider alternative treatments for her lung infection to prevent further ocular complications.", "topic": "['Infectious Diseases', 'Ophthalmology', 'Adverse Drug Events', 'Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology', 'Glaucoma']"}

They're not itchy or painful, which is a bit unusual. So, what could this be?\n\nFirst off, lichen planus comes to mind. It's known for those purple, itchy plaques, but this guy says they're not itchy. Hmm, okay, let's keep it in mind but maybe it's not the top contender.\n\nNext, I'm thinking about psoriasis. It can show up with these red, scaly plaques, but they're usually more silvery. Plus, psoriasis often itches, and this guy's plaques don't. So, probably not psoriasis.\n\nNow, Kaposi's sarcoma is popping up in my head. Those lesions are typically purple and can appear on the lower legs. But wait, this guy is healthy, no HIV, so that's probably not it. Let's move on.\n\nWhat about eczema? It's pretty common, but eczema usually comes with some itching, and these plaques aren't itchy. So, eczema seems unlikely.\n\nOh, lupus! It can cause skin lesions, but they're usually more like a butterfly rash on the face. This doesn't quite fit, so lupus is probably not our answer.\n\nNow, let's think about dermatofibroma. These are usually firm bumps on the skin, but they're not typically purple or in just one area like this. So, probably not dermatofibroma.\n\nHmm, what about erythema nodosum? That's more like red, painful bumps, usually on the shins. These plaques aren't painful, so that's not it.\n\nOkay, how about sarcoidosis? It can cause skin changes, but usually, there are other symptoms too, like lung issues. This guy seems healthy otherwise, so probably not sarcoidosis.\n\nLet's not forget about lymphoma. It can cause strange skin changes, and this guy has had these plaques for years with recent changes. That's a bit concerning. Lymphoma could be a possibility.\n\nFinally, there's angiosarcoma. It's a long shot, but it can cause purple lesions. This guy's plaques have been changing, which is a red flag. Angiosarcoma might be worth considering.\n\nSo, after thinking it all through, I'm leaning towards lymphoma or angiosarcoma.

Extraocular movements, confrontational visual fields, and Ishihara color plates were full. An anterior segment examination had normal results.

We've got a 57-year-old guy with chronic myelogenous leukemia, and he's having some trouble with his vision. He's seeing things a bit blurry and has floaters, but no flashes or pain. That's interesting. \n\nFirst off, the fact that he has CML is a big deal. It's a type of blood cancer, and it can cause all sorts of issues, especially if it's not responding to treatment. So, I'm thinking about how CML could be affecting his eyes. \n\nLeukemia can lead to something called leukostasis, where there are too many white blood cells, and they start to clog up small blood vessels. That could definitely cause vision problems. So, leukostasis is my first thought. \n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. There are other things that could cause these symptoms. What about something like central retinal vein occlusion? That can cause sudden vision changes and hemorrhages in the retina. It's definitely something to consider. \n\nNow, let's think about vitreous hemorrhage. It's another possibility. Floaters and blurry vision could be from blood in the vitreal cavity. But usually, that's from some kind of trauma or tear in the retina. I don't see any mention of trauma here, so maybe it's less likely. \n\nHmm, what about a retinal artery occlusion? That can cause sudden vision loss too, but it usually presents with a pale retina and a cherry-red spot, which isn't mentioned here. So, I'm thinking that's probably not it. \n\nOh, and there's also ischemic optic neuropathy. That can cause sudden vision loss and hemorrhages. It's often related to blood flow issues, which could tie into his CML. That's another strong possibility. \n\nLet's not forget about papillitis, which is inflammation of the optic disc. It can cause vision problems and is sometimes associated with blood disorders. But usually, there's pain or other symptoms, which he doesn't have. So, maybe that's less likely. \n\nNow, considering his CML, I should think about how the cancer itself could be affecting his eyes. Could there be leukemic infiltration in the retina? That's when the cancer cells actually get into the eye, causing problems. It's rare, but it's possible. \n\nAlso, what about a brain tumor? He's got a headache and vision issues, which could point to something going on in the brain. But that seems like a stretch without more neurological symptoms. \n\nOkay, let's wrap this up. Based on everything, I think leukostasis is still a strong contender because of the CML and the retinal hemorrhages. But I shouldn't ignore central retinal vein occlusion or ischemic optic neuropathy. They both fit the symptoms pretty well too. \n\nIn the end, I'm going with leukostasis as the most likely cause, followed closely by central retinal vein occlusion and ischemic optic neuropathy. It's a complex case, but those seem to be the best fits.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's symptoms, with a focus on conditions related to his chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and the observed retinal hemorrhages:\n\n1. **Leukostasis** - This condition involves the sludging of excessive white blood cells, which can obstruct small blood vessels, including those in the retina, leading to hemorrhages and vision changes.\n\n2. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)** - This is a vascular condition that can cause sudden vision changes and retinal hemorrhages, which aligns with the patient's symptoms.\n\n3. **Vitreous Hemorrhage** - Although typically associated with trauma or retinal tears, it can also occur due to other causes like CML, leading to floaters and blurry vision.\n\n4. **Ischemic Optic Neuropathy** - This condition involves sudden vision loss and can be associated with blood flow issues, which might be relevant given the patient's CML.\n\n5. **Retinal Artery Occlusion** - While it usually presents with a pale retina and a cherry-red spot, it's still a consideration for sudden vision changes.\n\n6. **Papillitis** - Inflammation of the optic disc that can cause vision problems, sometimes associated with systemic conditions like blood disorders.\n\n7. **Leukemic Retinal Infiltration** - Direct infiltration of leukemic cells into the retina, a rare but possible complication of CML.\n\n8. **Hyperviscosity Syndrome** - Associated with increased blood viscosity, which can lead to retinal hemorrhages and vision changes.\n\n9. **Cancer-Associated Thrombosis** - CML increases the risk of thrombotic events, which could lead to retinal vein occlusions or other vascular issues.\n\n10. **Brain Tumor** - Although less likely, a brain tumor could cause both headaches and vision changes, especially if it affects the optic pathways.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top three differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Leukostasis** - Given the patient's CML and the presence of retinal hemorrhages, this remains a strong contender.\n2. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)** - This condition fits well with the symptoms of sudden vision changes and retinal hemorrhages.\n3. **Ischemic Optic Neuropathy** - This could be related to the blood flow issues associated with CML and the observed retinal findings.\n\nThese three conditions are the most likely explanations for the patient's symptoms, considering his underlying CML and the specific retinal findings.", "topic": "['Neuro-oncology', 'Neuro-ophthalmology', 'Neurology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Hematology']"}

Dilated-fundus examination of the right eye showed a single cotton-wool spot (indicating local retinal ischemia), with intraretinal hemorrhage in the inferotemporal quadrant. Ultrawide-field imaging showed a cotton-wool spot on the left fundus (Figure 1A, right) and a peripheral arterial occlusion in the right eye (Figure 1A, left), and fluorescein angiographic study of the right eye demonstrated an area of blockage corresponding to intraretinal hemorrhage and venous hyperfluorescence (Figure 1B). The patient was afebrile, with pulse 110 beats/min and blood pressure of 188/99 mm Hg. Auscultation over the heart apex revealed a holosystolic ejection murmur (grade 2/6). Laboratory testing showed normal complete blood cell count and thyrotropin level and negative results for autoantibodies against Sm, SSA, SSB, Scl-70, Jo-1, centromere, chromatin, ribonucleoprotein, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was mildly elevated (30 mm/h). Results of testing for antinuclear antibodies were positive at low titer (1:40, homogenous pattern) with positive dsDNA (5.0 IU/mL; negative if <4.0 IU/mL). Blood cultures were negative for bacterial or fungal growth after 5 days. An echocardiogram revealed pedunculated and mobile aortic valve vegetations. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) associated with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 42-year-old woman who's been dealing with blurry vision in her right eye for about a month. She's got a history of high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and migraines. Her meds include atorvastatin, carvedilol, and norethindrone. Now, the eye exam shows a cotton-wool spot and some bleeding in the retina. That's a sign of retinal ischemia, which means something's blocking blood flow.\n\nOkay, let's see what else is going on. The wide-field imaging shows another cotton-wool spot in the left eye and a blocked artery in the right. The angiography shows a blockage and some weird fluorescence in the veins. Hmm, that's interesting. She's also got a fast pulse and high blood pressure. And there's a heart murmur. That's definitely something to consider.\n\nThe lab tests are a mixed bag. Her blood counts are normal, and her thyroid is fine. Most of the autoimmune tests are negative, but she's got a low-titer ANA and a positive dsDNA. That's a bit of a red flag for something like lupus. Her ESR is a bit up, but not crazy high. And the blood cultures are negative, so it's not a straightforward infection.\n\nNow, the echocardiogram is really telling. It shows mobile vegetations on the aortic valve. That's a big deal. It could be infective endocarditis, but the negative blood cultures throw a wrench in that. So, maybe it's not infectious. Could it be related to lupus? Libman-Sacks endocarditis could fit here.\n\nLet's think about the differentials. Initially, I thought about central retinal artery occlusion because of the sudden vision change. But the angiography suggests something more complex. Then, I considered branch retinal artery occlusion because of the localized ischemia. But the heart murmur and valve vegetations point to something more systemic.\n\nNext, I wondered about infective endocarditis. The vegetations make sense, but the negative blood cultures don't. So, that's probably not it. I also thought about non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis, which could tie into the lupus-like symptoms. The positive dsDNA and ANA are leaning that way.\n\nOh, and I can't forget about lupus retinal vasculitis. The positive dsDNA and ANA, along with the retinal findings, make it a strong contender. But the lack of other lupus symptoms is a bit odd.\n\nNow, let's not overlook carotid artery disease. The retinal issues could be from emboli, but there's no direct evidence of carotid problems. And the valve vegetations don't quite fit.\n\nI also considered antiphospholipid syndrome because it can cause clotting issues and retinal problems. But there's no clear evidence of that here.\n\nHmm, what about rheumatic heart disease? The valve issues could fit, but there's no clear link to the retinal problems.\n\nOkay, let's put it all together. The most likely explanation is Libman-Sacks endocarditis related to lupus. The positive dsDNA, ANA, and valve vegetations fit well. The retinal findings make sense with lupus retinal vasculitis. It all ties together with the systemic nature of lupus.\n\nSo, after going through everything, I'm confident that we're looking at Libman-Sacks endocarditis associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. It explains the heart and eye issues, and the lab results back it up.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is Libman-Sacks endocarditis associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The presence of mobile aortic valve vegetations, positive dsDNA, and low-titer ANA, along with the retinal findings, strongly suggests this condition. Libman-Sacks endocarditis is a form of non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis commonly seen in patients with SLE, and it can lead to embolic phenomena such as retinal artery occlusion, which aligns with the patient's symptoms and examination findings. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Libman-Sacks Endocarditis associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**\n2. Lupus Retinal Vasculitis\n3. Non-bacterial Thrombotic Endocarditis\n4. Infective Endocarditis\n5. Central Retinal Artery Occlusion\n6. Branch Retinal Artery Occlusion\n7. Antiphospholipid Syndrome\n8. Carotid Artery Disease\n9. Rheumatic Heart Disease\n10. Migraine-related Retinal Vasculitis\n\nEach of these conditions was considered based on the combination of the patient's symptoms, examination findings, and laboratory results. However, Libman-Sacks endocarditis associated with SLE is the most comprehensive explanation for the systemic and ocular findings in this case.", "topic": "['Coagulation Disorders', 'Hematology', 'Valvular Heart Disease', 'Cardiology', 'Ophthalmology']"}

He had a history of dry eye disease for which he was treated with preservative-free artificial tears. He also noted a medical history of well-controlled HIV with highly active antiretroviral therapy. His last CD 4 lymphocyte count was 750 cells/mm3 with an undetectable viral load. A review of system produced negative results, including absence of weight loss, fevers, headache, joint pain, respiratory symptoms, or skin rash. The patient reported having unprotected sexual contact with multiple male partners in the past few years. On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Intraocular pressure was 12 mm Hg OD and 14 mm Hg OS. Slitlamp examination demonstrated diffuse scleral injection in both eyes without any scleral thinning. The redness did not blanch after administration of phenylephrine, 10% (Figure 1). Both eyes appeared to be moderately tender to touch. The rest of the anterior segment examination was within normal limits without any evidence of intraocular inflammation. Dilated fundus examination was also unremarkable in both eyes. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Bilateral syphilitic scleritis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 68-year-old man who's been dealing with redness and pain in both eyes for six months. That's quite a while to be uncomfortable. He's got a history of dry eye disease, so maybe that's playing a role here. But wait, he's been using preservative-free artificial tears, which should help with dry eyes. So, maybe it's not just dryness.\n\nHe's also living with HIV, but it's well-controlled with medication. His CD4 count is good, and his viral load is undetectable, so his immune system is likely in decent shape. That's a relief because it means we're less likely dealing with something like CMV retinitis, which is more common when the immune system is really weak.\n\nNow, he's had unprotected sex with multiple partners, which could mean an STI. Syphilis comes to mind because it can cause all sorts of eye problems. But, there's no mention of any systemic symptoms like rashes or sores, so maybe not.\n\nThe redness in his eyes doesn't go away with phenylephrine. That's interesting because phenylephrine usually makes blood vessels constrict. If the redness stays, it might be due to inflammation rather than just dilated blood vessels.\n\nHis eyes are tender, but his vision is perfect, and the pressure in his eyes is normal. That's good because it rules out glaucoma. The slit-lamp exam shows no thinning of the sclera, which is a relief because that would suggest something more severe like scleritis.\n\nSo, what could it be? Let's start with the basics. Dry eye disease is still a possibility, even if the artificial tears aren't helping much. Maybe he needs a different treatment approach.\n\nThen there's conjunctivitis, which can be viral, bacterial, or allergic. But usually, it comes with discharge or itching, and he doesn't have those symptoms.\n\nScleritis is a concern because it can be really painful and persistent, but there's no scleral thinning, so maybe not.\n\nEpiscleritis is another possibility. It's less severe than scleritis and can cause redness and tenderness without thinning the sclera. That fits his symptoms pretty well.\n\nWhat about autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis? They can cause eye problems, but he doesn't have any joint pain or systemic symptoms, so that's less likely.\n\nInfectious causes like herpes zoster ophthalmicus? But there's no rash or neuralgia, so probably not.\n\nSyphilis could still be a player here, especially with his sexual history. It can cause eye inflammation, but usually, there are other symptoms too.\n\nLyme disease is another infection to consider, especially if he's been outdoors. But again, no systemic symptoms like fever or joint pain.\n\nAnd then there's masquerade syndromes, like intraocular lymphoma. They can mimic other conditions, but he doesn't have any other symptoms like weight loss or fatigue.\n\nSo, after thinking it all through, episcleritis seems like the most likely cause of his symptoms. It matches the persistent redness and tenderness without more severe signs like scleral thinning. But, we should keep syphilis and other possibilities in mind, just in case.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Episcleritis** - This condition fits well with the patient's symptoms of persistent redness and tenderness without scleral thinning.\n\n2. **Dry Eye Disease** - Although the patient is using preservative-free artificial tears, his symptoms could still be exacerbated by underlying dry eye issues.\n\n3. **Conjunctivitis** - Viral, bacterial, or allergic conjunctivitis could be considered, but the absence of discharge or itching makes this less likely.\n\n4. **Scleritis** - While this is a concern due to the pain and persistence of symptoms, the lack of scleral thinning makes it less probable.\n\n5. **Syphilis** - Given the patient's sexual history, ocular syphilis is a possibility, though typically accompanied by other systemic symptoms.\n\n6. **Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus** - Unlikely without a rash or neuralgia, but should be considered due to the potential for atypical presentations.\n\n7. **Lyme Disease** - Could be a consideration if the patient has outdoor exposure, but the absence of systemic symptoms like fever or joint pain makes it less likely.\n\n8. **Rheumatoid Arthritis** - Associated with eye inflammation, but the lack of joint pain or systemic symptoms reduces this possibility.\n\n9. **Intraocular Lymphoma** - A masquerade syndrome that could mimic other conditions, but usually accompanied by systemic symptoms like weight loss.\n\n10. **Autoimmune-related Uveitis** - Could be related to an underlying autoimmune process, but the normal intraocular pressure and lack of intraocular inflammation make this less likely.\n\nAfter considering all the information, episcleritis emerges as the most likely diagnosis due to the characteristic symptoms of persistent redness and tenderness without more severe signs. However, syphilis and other possibilities should remain on the differential diagnosis list to ensure a comprehensive approach.", "topic": "['External Eye Disease', 'HIV', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Ophthalmology', 'Sexually Transmitted Infections']"}

Three months prior, pembrolizumab treatment was stopped because of a widespread morbilliform reaction, which had resolved completely 6 to 8 weeks before admission. The new widespread, asymptomatic skin eruption had been ongoing for 1 to 2 weeks and appeared different from her pembrolizumab reaction. A complete blood cell count was notable for a normal white blood cell count of 4100/μL, normal absolute neutrophil count of 2940/μL, chronic normocytic anemia (hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL), and chronic thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 62 ×103/μL). Blood culture results showed no growth at 1 week. Serum β-D-glucan, galactomannan, Coccidioides antibody by complement fixation, and immunodiffusion results were negative. Respiratory viral panel and SARS-CoV-2 test results were negative. Total body skin examination findings were notable for widespread, nontender, erythematous patches and thin plaques, some with prominent overlying telangiectases and hyperpigmentation (Figure, A). A punch biopsy of a representative lesion was performed (Figure, B-D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Intravascular involvement by NK/T-cell lymphoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her 50s who's been through a lot with her health. She's had nasal-type NK/T-cell lymphoma, and it's been a couple of years since her diagnosis. She's also dealing with chronic pulmonary coccidiomycosis and has been on fluconazole for that. Now, she's back in the hospital with fever, low blood pressure, and a rash. That's a lot to unpack.\n\nFirst off, the rash. It's widespread and she says it doesn't hurt, which is interesting. It's different from the reaction she had to pembrolizumab before, which was more like a measles rash and cleared up a while ago. This one's been around for a week or two, and it's got these red patches and thin plaques with some funny-looking blood vessels on top. Hmm, that's unique.\n\nNow, let's look at her blood work. Her white blood cell count is normal, which is good, but she's got anemia and low platelets. That's been going on for a while, so it might be linked to her previous treatments or something chronic. No bacteria grew in her blood cultures after a week, so it's probably not a straightforward bacterial infection.\n\nWe've also got a bunch of negative test results. No fungi like candida or aspergillus showing up, and her coccidiomycosis tests are negative too. No viruses like the flu or COVID either. So, it's not looking like an infection, at least not one that's easy to catch with these tests.\n\nThe skin biopsy is going to be key here. It might show something that explains these strange skin findings. Could it be a drug reaction? Maybe, but it feels off since it's so different from her previous reaction. Could it be her lymphoma coming back? That's possible, but the appearance is kind of different from what I'd expect.\n\nLet's think about other possibilities. Vasculitis could cause a rash and systemic symptoms, but usually, there's more organ involvement. And the biopsy would show more inflammation in the blood vessels if that were the case.\n\nWhat about an autoimmune process? That could explain the rash and maybe the fever, but the blood abnormalities are a bit of a stretch for that.\n\nCould it be a paraneoplastic syndrome? That's a kind of syndrome that can happen with cancers, where the cancer causes symptoms elsewhere in the body. That might fit, especially if her lymphoma is acting up again.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about drug reactions. Even though it's different from her last reaction, could pembrolizumab still be causing issues? It's been known to cause all sorts of immune-related problems.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? I think we should consider paraneoplastic syndrome as a strong possibility. It ties together the skin findings, the systemic symptoms, and her history of lymphoma. But we can't completely rule out a weird drug reaction or even a rare infection that's not showing up on tests. We'll need to keep an eye on her and see how things develop.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Relapsed Nasal NK/T-cell Lymphoma**: Given her history, the possibility of her lymphoma relapsing is a strong consideration, especially with the new skin manifestations.\n\n2. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**: This could explain the systemic symptoms and skin changes in the context of her previous lymphoma.\n\n3. **Pembrolizumab-induced Dermatitis**: Although the rash is different from her previous reaction, pembrolizumab can cause a variety of immune-related skin reactions.\n\n4. **Vasculitis**: This could account for the rash and systemic symptoms, but typically involves more organ systems and specific biopsy findings.\n\n5. **Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD)**: If she had a stem cell transplant as part of her previous treatment, GVHD could manifest with skin changes and systemic symptoms.\n\n6. **Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia**: This could explain her anemia, but not the full spectrum of her symptoms.\n\n7. **Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)**: Similar to AIHA, ITP could account for her low platelets but not the rash or fever.\n\n8. **Drug-induced Lupus Erythematosus**: Fluconazole or other medications could potentially induce a lupus-like syndrome with skin and systemic involvement.\n\n9. **Coccidioidomycosis Reactivation**: Despite negative serologies, reactivation could present atypically, especially in an immunocompromised host.\n\n10. **Rare Infection**: An atypical infection not detected by routine tests could present with fever, rash, and systemic symptoms in someone with a complex medical history.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses would be:\n\n1. **Relapsed Nasal NK/T-cell Lymphoma**\n2. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**\n3. **Pembrolizumab-induced Dermatitis**\n4. **Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease (if applicable)**\n5. **Drug-induced Lupus Erythematosus**\n\nThese possibilities best explain the combination of her skin findings, systemic symptoms, and history of lymphoma.

Fifteen months previously, he had undergone allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) with a matched related donor for treatment of fms-like tyrosine kinase (FLT3) internal tandem duplication–mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The patient had been diagnosed with chronic gastrointestinal graft-vs-host disease after a workup for diarrhea. Results of a restaging bone marrow biopsy 2 weeks prior to presentation showed no evidence of leukemia. Physical examination findings revealed no neck masses or abnormalities, but the patient was noted to be severely dysphonic and stridulous. Flexible laryngoscopy findings demonstrated a right vocal fold neoplasm crossing the posterior commissure with associated bilateral vocal fold motion impairment and obstruction of the glottic airway (Figure, A). Awake tracheostomy was performed for airway protection, and biopsy of the neoplasm was obtained via operative microlaryngoscopy (Figure, B). Histologic findings demonstrated diffuse infiltrate of large cells with irregular nuclear contours, vesicular chromatin, and prominent nucleoli (Figure, C). Immunohistochemical stains showed CD33, CD43, and CD117 positivity, with a subset positive for CD7 and myeloperoxidase. Stains were negative for CD3, CD20, and cytokeratin expression. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Extramedullary myeloid sarcoma of the larynx", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 59-year-old man who's been dealing with hoarseness and trouble breathing for a couple of months. That's quite a while to be experiencing these symptoms, so it's definitely something that needs attention. He's had a pretty big medical history too, having undergone a stem cell transplant about 15 months ago for acute myeloid leukemia. That's a big deal, and it makes me think about possible complications or relapses.\n\nNow, he's also got chronic graft-vs-host disease, which can cause all sorts of issues. But the main thing here is this vocal fold neoplasm that's causing his symptoms. It's interesting that it's crossing the posterior commissure and affecting his vocal fold motion. That sounds pretty serious.\n\nThe biopsy results are really telling. We've got large cells with irregular nuclear contours and prominent nucleoli. That's definitely raising some flags for something aggressive. And the immunohistochemical stains are positive for CD33, CD43, CD117, CD7, and myeloperoxidase. Hmm, those markers are typically associated with myeloid lineage. So, we're likely dealing with something related to his AML history.\n\nGiven his history of AML and the marker profile, my first thought is that this could be a myeloid sarcoma. It's a solid tumor form of AML, and it would fit with the aggressive nature of the neoplasm and the immunohistochemical findings.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions too quickly. We should consider other possibilities. Could it be a lymphoma? The absence of CD3 and CD20 makes that less likely, but we can't rule it out entirely without more information. What about a carcinoma? The lack of cytokeratin expression makes that unlikely, but it's worth keeping in the back of our minds.\n\nLet's also think about the possibility of a benign condition, like a vocal fold polyp or a granuloma. But the aggressive nature of this neoplasm and the biopsy results make those options seem less probable.\n\nOkay, so where does that leave us? Myeloid sarcoma is still top of the list, given the context and the biopsy results. But we should also consider other myeloid malignancies, like acute myelomonocytic leukemia or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. They could present similarly and fit the immunophenotype.\n\nIn the end, after weighing all the evidence, myeloid sarcoma seems like the most likely diagnosis. But it's always important to keep an open mind and consider other possibilities, especially with complex cases like this.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the provided information, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Myeloid Sarcoma** - Given the patient's history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and the immunohistochemical findings, this is a strong contender.\n\n2. **Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia** - The presence of CD33, CD43, CD117, CD7, and myeloperoxidase suggests a myeloid lineage, which aligns with AML.\n\n3. **Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia** - This could present with similar immunophenotypic features and should be considered.\n\n4. **Acute Myelomonocytic Leukemia** - Another myeloid malignancy that could fit the clinical and laboratory findings.\n\n5. **Lymphoma** - Although less likely due to the absence of CD3 and CD20, it's important to keep in the differential.\n\n6. **Poorly Differentiated Carcinoma** - Despite the lack of cytokeratin expression, this remains a consideration.\n\n7. **Vocal Fold Polyp** - A benign condition, but the aggressive nature of the neoplasm makes this less likely.\n\n8. **Laryngeal Granuloma** - Another benign possibility, though the biopsy results suggest otherwise.\n\n9. **Plasmacytoma** - Could be considered due to the presence of a monoclonal proliferation, but the immunophenotype doesn't strongly support this.\n\n10. **Graft-vs-Host Disease** - While the patient has a history of chronic graft-vs-host disease, the biopsy findings are more suggestive of a neoplastic process.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Myeloid Sarcoma** remains the most likely diagnosis, given the patient's history and the specific immunohistochemical profile.

He was treated with a right radical orchiectomy and 4 cycles of etoposide, ifosfamide, and cisplatin (VIP) chemotherapy with resulting reduction in metastatic tumor burden and normalization of α-fetoprotein and β-human chorionic gonadotropin. The patient’s neck swelling, which initially decreased in size while undergoing chemotherapy, progressively enlarged shortly after concluding treatment. He underwent magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography of the neck that showed a clearly defined, bulky supraclavicular mass confined to left neck levels 3, 4, and 5 (Figure). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Growing teratoma syndrome", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 40-year-old guy who just finished treatment for a mixed nonseminomatous germ cell tumor in his testicle. He had metastases in the retroperitoneal and mediastinal areas, but after surgery and chemo, those seemed to get better. Now, he's got this big lump in his left neck. That's a bit concerning.\n\nFirst off, germ cell tumors can be tricky. They can come back, even after successful treatment. So, I'm thinking, could this be a recurrence of his testicular cancer? It's definitely possible, especially since the neck mass was smaller during chemo but grew again after he stopped treatment.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. There are other things that could cause a neck mass. How about a metastasis from a different primary cancer? I mean, the supraclavicular area is a common spot for metastatic disease from other cancers, like lung cancer. That's something to consider.\n\nOh, and there's also the chance of a new primary tumor in the neck. Maybe something like a squamous cell carcinoma from the head and neck region? Those can show up as a neck mass too.\n\nHmm, what about lymphoma? It can cause lymphadenopathy and is known to appear in the neck. Given this guy's age and the fact that he's just been through chemo, maybe his immune system is a bit compromised, making lymphoma more likely.\n\nNow, let's think about the imaging. The mass is well-defined and bulky, sitting in the supraclavicular area. That could fit with a recurrence of his germ cell tumor, but it could also be something else, like a sarcoma. Sarcomas can appear pretty aggressive on imaging.\n\nAlso, we shouldn't forget about infections. After chemo, he might be more prone to infections, and something like tuberculosis could cause lymphadenopathy. It's not the most likely cause, but it's worth considering.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? We've got a few possibilities: recurrence of the testicular germ cell tumor, a new primary cancer like lung or head and neck cancer, lymphoma, a sarcoma, or even an infection like tuberculosis.\n\nLet's rank these. Given his history, I'd say a recurrence of his germ cell tumor is the most likely. But we can't ignore the chance of a new primary cancer, especially lung cancer, which often metastasizes to the supraclavicular area. Lymphoma and sarcoma are also up there on the list. And finally, there's the outside chance of an infection like tuberculosis.\n\nSo, in order, I'd go with: 1) recurrence of testicular germ cell tumor, 2) metastatic lung cancer, 3) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, 4) lymphoma, 5) sarcoma, 6) tuberculosis, 7) other metastatic cancers, 8) paraganglioma, 9) carotid body tumor, and 10) branchial cleft cyst.

Intraocular pressure was 15 mm Hg OU. Pupillary light responses were normal.

Routine blood tests, including full blood cell count, plasma glucose levels, liver function test, and kidney function test, were performed on the same day and showed a serum creatinine level of 1.57 mg/dL (reference range: 0.5-1.0 mg/dL; to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4). Antibodies anti–Treponema pallidum were tested and the results were negative. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 14-year-old boy with pain around his right eye, and he's sensitive to light. That's been going on for about 5 days. He's got a history of atopic dermatitis, but otherwise, he's been healthy. His vision is perfect, which is a good sign. But when we look at his eye with a slit lamp, there's some redness and inflammation. We see some flare in the anterior chamber and a few keratic precipitates. The left eye is fine. His eye pressure is normal, and his pupils are responding normally too. Now, when we dilate his eyes to look at the back, there's some vitritis in the right eye, and his optic discs are swollen, more so in the right one. That's interesting.\n\nOkay, let's start thinking about what's going on. The first thing that comes to mind with these symptoms is anterior uveitis. It's pretty common in young people and can be linked to things like HLA-B27 associated conditions. But let's not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nNext, I'm thinking about the optic disc swelling. This could be optic neuritis, especially with the pain and the vitritis. Optic neuritis is often linked to multiple sclerosis, but he's pretty young for that, and there's no mention of other neurological symptoms. Still, it's something to keep in mind.\n\nNow, the elevated creatinine level is a bit of a red flag. That's not something you'd expect with typical uveitis or optic neuritis. It makes me think about kidney issues. Could this be related to something systemic, like a metabolic disorder or even a vascular issue? I should consider conditions that affect both the eyes and the kidneys.\n\nLet's think about infections. The negative syphilis test is good, but what about other infections like toxoplasmosis or tuberculosis? They can cause uveitis and might explain some of the other symptoms. Toxoplasmosis often causes posterior segment issues, but the anterior chamber findings don't quite fit.\n\nI should also think about autoimmune diseases. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis can cause uveitis, and it's common in young people. But would it explain the elevated creatinine? Maybe if there's some kidney involvement.\n\nWhat about sarcoidosis? It can cause uveitis, vitritis, and optic disc swelling. It's a systemic condition, so it might affect the kidneys too. That's a strong possibility.\n\nOh, and I shouldn't forget about papillitis. It's inflammation of the optic nerve head and could explain the disc swelling. It's often associated with conditions like multiple sclerosis, but could also be idiopathic.\n\nNow, let's consider Behçet's disease. It can cause uveitis and optic neuritis, and it's a systemic condition that might affect the kidneys. It's rare in kids, but not impossible.\n\nI should also think about Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease. It's a rare condition that affects the eyes and can have systemic manifestations, including kidney issues. It could explain the optic disc swelling and the vitritis.\n\nFinally, let's not forget about idiopathic causes. Sometimes, these conditions just happen without a clear systemic link. It's possible that the elevated creatinine is unrelated to the eye issues.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top differential diagnosis is sarcoidosis. It explains the eye findings and could account for the elevated creatinine. Next is Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, given its systemic nature and the eye findings. Then there's Behçet's disease, which is a bit rare for his age but still possible. Anterior uveitis and optic neuritis are still in the running, especially if they're idiopathic. And finally, I'll keep juvenile idiopathic arthritis and papillitis on the list, as they could explain some of the symptoms. That's my final ranking.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 14-year-old boy's condition, with a focus on the ocular and systemic findings:\n\n1. **Anterior Uveitis** - This is a common condition in young individuals and can be associated with HLA-B27 related diseases, which could explain the ocular findings.\n\n2. **Optic Neuritis** - The presence of optic disc swelling and pain suggests optic neuritis, often linked to multiple sclerosis, although the patient's young age makes this less likely.\n\n3. **Sarcoidosis** - This systemic condition can cause uveitis, vitritis, and optic disc swelling, and may also affect the kidneys, potentially explaining the elevated creatinine level.\n\n4. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease** - A rare condition that can involve the eyes and have systemic manifestations, including possible kidney involvement, which aligns with the elevated creatinine and ocular findings.\n\n5. **Behçet's Disease** - Although rare in children, it can cause uveitis and optic neuritis, and is a systemic condition that might affect the kidneys.\n\n6. **Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis** - This can cause uveitis and, if there is kidney involvement, might explain the elevated creatinine, although this is less common.\n\n7. **Papillitis** - Inflammation of the optic nerve head could explain the optic disc swelling and is often associated with conditions like multiple sclerosis or can be idiopathic.\n\n8. **Toxoplasmosis** - An infectious cause of uveitis, although the anterior chamber findings are not typical for this condition.\n\n9. **Tuberculosis** - A systemic infection that can cause uveitis and potentially affect the kidneys, although there are no specific indications of this in the provided information.\n\n10. **Idiopathic Causes** - It's possible that the ocular findings are idiopathic, with the elevated creatinine being unrelated to the eye condition.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are **Sarcoidosis** and **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease**, as they both provide a systemic link between the ocular findings and the elevated creatinine level. **Behçet's Disease** and **Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis** are also considered due to their potential to involve both the eyes and the kidneys. **Anterior Uveitis** and **Optic Neuritis** remain as possibilities, particularly if they are idiopathic.", "topic": "['Nephrology', 'Pediatrics', 'Intraocular Inflammation', 'Ophthalmology']"}

On examination, she was normotensive, afebrile, and clinically euvolemic. Laboratory testing showed a hemoglobin level of 12.1 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10), white blood cell count of 9900/µL (to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001), erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 76 mm/h, lactate dehydrogenase level of 139 U/L (to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167), and normal coagulation profile.

Blood culture findings were negative. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography (Figure 1 and Video) showed a large echogenic mass on the inferior aspect of the interatrial septum with infiltration of the coronary sinus, anterior mitral valve annulus, and aortic root. The mass protruded into the left ventricular outflow tract without causing valve obstruction. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a bilobed interatrial mass measuring 5.6 × 3.1 × 3.8 cm with patchy late gadolinium enhancement of the lesion. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a left hilar mass encasing the left upper lobe bronchus with extension into the left main pulmonary artery, a nodular soft tissue lesion along the anterior nasal septum, and no abdominal or pelvic disease. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a left paraclinoid mass lesion consistent with a meningioma and right Meckel cave lesions. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Biatrial intracardiac mass and multiple systemic lesions secondary to IgG4-related disease", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her 60s who's been doing well after treatment for Burkitt lymphoma. But now she's back with some troubling symptoms like shortness of breath, fatigue, and feeling faint. That's definitely concerning.\n\nFirst, let's consider what's going on with her heart. The echocardiogram shows a big mass in her heart, and it's in a tricky spot near the interatrial septum. It's also affecting the coronary sinus and even reaching out to the mitral valve and aortic root. That's pretty serious.\n\nGiven her history with Burkitt lymphoma, my first thought is lymphoma coming back. It's aggressive and can show up in unexpected places, so that's a strong possibility.\n\nBut wait, there's more to consider. The mass has some unusual features on the MRI with patchy late gadolinium enhancement. That could mean it's not just a simple relapse of her lymphoma. Maybe it's something new.\n\nLet's think about other possibilities. Cardiac sarcomas are rare, but they can look like this. Angiosarcoma could be an option since it's known to be aggressive and can have a similar appearance.\n\nNow, there's also a mass in her lung. It's encasing the left upper lobe bronchus and extending into the pulmonary artery. That sounds like it could be a separate issue or maybe something that's spread from the heart.\n\nCould this be metastatic disease? Possibly, but the different locations and types of masses make me think it might be multiple primary tumors.\n\nOh, and there's a lesion in her nasal septum too. That's an unusual spot. Could it be something like an olfactory neuroblastoma? Those can occur there and might explain some of her symptoms.\n\nAnd then there's the brain. She's got a paraclinoid mass that looks like a meningioma and some lesions in the Meckel cave. Meningiomas are usually benign, but having multiple tumors at once is definitely unusual.\n\nSo, what's going on here? It looks like we might be dealing with multiple unrelated tumors. Maybe she has a genetic syndrome that predisposes her to these kinds of growths.\n\nLet's put it all together. We've got a cardiac mass that could be a sarcoma, a lung mass that might be a separate primary tumor, a nasal lesion that could be an olfactory neuroblastoma, and a meningioma in the brain. It's a complex picture, but it seems like the most likely explanation.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, considering her complex presentation and history:\n\n1. **Lymphoma Relapse**: Given her history of Burkitt lymphoma, a relapse with cardiac involvement is a strong initial consideration.\n\n2. **Cardiac Angiosarcoma**: The aggressive nature and location of the cardiac mass raise the possibility of a primary cardiac sarcoma like angiosarcoma.\n\n3. **Metastatic Disease**: The presence of multiple masses in different locations could suggest a metastatic process from an unknown primary site.\n\n4. **Olfactory Neuroblastoma**: The nasal septum lesion is suggestive of this rare tumor, which could explain some of her symptoms.\n\n5. **Meningioma**: The paraclinoid mass in the brain is consistent with a meningioma, which is usually benign but can be part of a multiple tumor picture.\n\n6. **Lung Cancer**: The left hilar mass could represent a primary lung carcinoma, especially given its extension into the pulmonary artery.\n\n7. **Cardiac Myxoma**: Although less likely given the aggressive features, a myxoma could present as a cardiac mass, though typically less invasive.\n\n8. **Neurofibroma**: The Meckel cave lesions could be neurofibromas, raising the possibility of a neurocutaneous syndrome like neurofibromatosis.\n\n9. **Germ Cell Tumor**: The midline masses and her age could suggest a germ cell tumor, which can present with multiple lesions.\n\n10. **Li-Fraumeni Syndrome**: This genetic syndrome predisposes to multiple primary tumors and could explain the diverse range of masses seen in this patient.\n\nUpon reviewing all the information, the most likely scenario is that the patient has developed multiple unrelated primary tumors, possibly due to a genetic predisposition like Li-Fraumeni syndrome. This would account for the cardiac mass, lung mass, nasal lesion, and brain masses. However, the exact nature of each mass would require histological confirmation.", "topic": "['Cardiology', 'Oncology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Lymphomas']"}

Anterior segment, tonometry, and pupillary light reflex were unremarkable. Ophthalmoscopy of the right eye showed discretely blurred optic disc margins, tortuous and dilated retinal veins, and intraretinal hemorrhages in all quadrants; the left eye was unremarkable. An optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan showed a cystoid macular edema (CME) in the right eye; the left was unremarkable. Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness was 133 μm OD and 82 μm OS (reference value, 95.4 ± 10.48 μm).1 A fluorescein angiography was scheduled. One week later, the patient returned to our department due to multiple episodes of amaurosis fugax in left eye. By that time, ophthalmoscopy disclosed a mild optic disc swelling, tortuous venous vessels, and retinal hemorrhages bilaterally (Figure 1). The OCT scan showed a CME spontaneous resolution in the right eye while the left eye was unremarkable. Fluorescein angiography revealed a slight delay in venous filling but no capillary nonperfusion areas. These features were compatible with bilateral nonischemic central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), with spontaneous reperfusion in the right eye. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Occult tumor presenting with bilateral CRVO", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 47-year-old woman who suddenly can't see well out of her right eye. That's pretty alarming. Her vision is 20/40 in that eye, but her left eye is fine at 20/20. So, what's going on here?\n\nFirst, I'm thinking about the optic disc. It's a bit blurry, and the veins look really twisted and full. Plus, there are hemorrhages in the retina. That sounds like something is blocking or affecting the blood flow in the eye. Could it be a central retinal vein occlusion? That's a strong possibility.\n\nBut wait, there's more. The OCT scan shows cystoid macular edema in the right eye. That's often caused by fluid buildup, which can happen with vein occlusions. So, CRVO is still on my mind.\n\nNow, let's not forget about the left eye. Initially, it was fine, but then she starts having these transient blackouts of vision, called amaurosis fugax. That's a sign that something is temporarily blocking blood flow. Could it be carotid artery disease causing these episodes? It's definitely something to consider.\n\nHmm, what about other possibilities? Retinal detachment could cause sudden vision loss, but I don't see any mention of that classic detached appearance. So, probably not that.\n\nOh, and there's papillitis, which is inflammation of the optic nerve. It could cause vision loss and disc swelling, but usually, there's more pain and other symptoms. So, I'm not leaning towards that.\n\nLet's not forget about ischemic optic neuropathy. It can cause sudden vision loss too, but the veinous dilation and hemorrhages don't quite fit. So, I'm putting that lower on the list.\n\nAlso, diabetic retinopathy could cause similar symptoms, but she doesn't have diabetes, so that's unlikely.\n\nAnd what about hypertensive retinopathy? It can cause hemorrhages and swelling, but there's no mention of high blood pressure issues here. So, probably not that either.\n\nOkay, so back to the CRVO. The fluorescein angiography shows a delay in venous filling without any non-perfusion areas. That fits with a non-ischemic CRVO. And the fact that the macular edema resolved spontaneously in the right eye suggests some reperfusion happened. That's a good sign.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the most likely diagnosis is bilateral non-ischemic central retinal vein occlusion. The symptoms, test results, and spontaneous resolution of the macular edema all point to that. Yeah, that makes the most sense.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is bilateral non-ischemic central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). The symptoms, including sudden vision loss, optic disc swelling, tortuous and dilated retinal veins, intraretinal hemorrhages, and cystoid macular edema, along with the fluorescein angiography findings, support this diagnosis. The spontaneous resolution of macular edema in the right eye further suggests reperfusion, which is consistent with non-ischemic CRVO. \n\nHere is a 10-step differential diagnosis list, considering the symptoms and test results:\n\n1. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)**\n2. Carotid Artery Disease\n3. Retinal Detachment\n4. Papillitis\n5. Ischemic Optic Neuropathy\n6. Diabetic Retinopathy\n7. Hypertensive Retinopathy\n8. Vitreous Hemorrhage\n9. Macular Degeneration\n10.

He denied any associated symptoms of pain, fevers, chills, malaise, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, prior history of neck masses, recent upper respiratory tract infections, or skin lesions. He was the product of a full-term pregnancy with up-to-date immunizations. Physical examination revealed a 2.5-cm firm, ovoid, mobile, and nontender mass at the apex of the posterior triangle of the right neck without any associated overlying skin changes. The remainder of the head and neck examination was unremarkable. Doppler ultrasonography revealed a 1.9 × 1.8 × 0.9-cm hypoechoic mass, and subsequent fine-needle aspirates demonstrated cells with elongated nuclei and eccentric blue cytoplasm in a background of myxoid stroma. The mass was excised in entirety without issue. At the time of surgery, the deep surface of the mass was found to be adherent to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The lesion was resected with a cuff of muscle and sent for permanent histopathological examination. This revealed proliferation of bland spindle cells with plump nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged as loose fascicles in a background of myxoid stroma (Figure 1). These cells were positive for mucin 4 (MUC4), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and transducing-like enhancer of split 1 (TLE1) immunohistochemical stains. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed a positive FUS (16p11) gene rearrangement. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 13-year-old boy with a neck mass that's been hanging around for a couple of years. It's slowly getting bigger, but he's not in any pain, and there are no other weird symptoms like fevers or weight loss. That's interesting because it suggests this might not be something super aggressive or malignant. \n\nNow, where is this mass exactly? It's at the apex of the posterior triangle of the neck. That's a spot where you can find lymph nodes, but this doesn't sound like a typical lymphadenopathy because it's not tender and hasn't changed recently. So, maybe we're looking at something like a congenital or benign neoplastic process. \n\nLet's see what the ultrasound tells us. It's hypoechoic, which means it's not as dense as muscle, possibly something cystic or soft tissue-related. The fact that it's well-defined and mobile makes me think it's not too scary, maybe something benign. \n\nThe fine-needle aspirate shows cells with elongated nuclei and myxoid stroma. Hmm, that sounds like something soft tissue-related, maybe a spindle cell lesion. My mind goes to things like a fibroblastic or myofibroblastic tumor. \n\nNow, let's look at the surgical and histological findings. The mass was stuck to the sternocleidomastoid muscle, which is curious. The histology shows bland spindle cells in a myxoid background. This is really pointing towards a soft tissue tumor, maybe something like a spindle cell lipoma or a fibroma. \n\nThe immunohistochemistry is positive for MUC4, EMA, and TLE1. That's a bit of a mixed bag, but it's giving us some clues. These markers can be seen in various tumors, but let's not jump to conclusions yet. \n\nOh, and there's a FUS gene rearrangement. That's a big deal. FUS rearrangements are pretty specific for certain tumors, like low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma. That fits with what we're seeing histologically. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the most likely diagnosis is a low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma. It matches the clinical presentation, the histology, the immunohistochemistry, and the genetics. \n\nBut wait, let's not forget to consider other possibilities. We should think about other spindle cell tumors like spindle cell lipoma or fibroma. They can look similar but usually don't have this genetic rearrangement. \n\nAlso, we should consider the age and location. This is a young patient, so we should think about tumors that are more common in children, like rhabdomyosarcoma or neuroblastoma. But those usually have different histological features and genetic markers. \n\nIn the end, after considering all the possibilities, low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma still seems like the best fit. But it's good to have a broad differential to make sure we're not missing anything.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis for the neck mass in this 13-year-old boy is a low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma. This diagnosis is supported by the clinical presentation, histological findings, immunohistochemical staining, and the presence of a FUS gene rearrangement, which is characteristic of this type of tumor.\n\nHowever, it's important to consider a broad differential diagnosis. Here's a 10-step differential diagnosis list, ensuring each step provides a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma** - This is the most likely diagnosis given the FUS gene rearrangement and histological features.\n2. **Spindle cell lipoma** - A benign tumor that can present similarly but typically lacks the FUS rearrangement.\n3. **Fibroma** - A benign fibrous tissue tumor, but it usually doesn't have the myxoid stroma or specific genetic rearrangements seen here.\n4. **Rhabdomyosarcoma** - A common soft tissue sarcoma in children, but it typically shows different histological and immunohistochemical features.\n5. **Neuroblastoma** - Although common in children, it usually presents with different clinical and histological characteristics.\n6. **Lipoblastoma** - A rare tumor that can have myxoid features, but it's more common in younger children and lacks the FUS rearrangement.\n7. **Desmoid fibromatosis** - An aggressive fibromatosis that can occur in young patients, but it typically doesn't have the myxoid stroma or FUS rearrangement.\n8. **Solitary fibrous tumor** - A tumor that can occur in various sites, including the neck, but it usually shows different immunohistochemical profiles.\n9. **Schwannoma** - A nerve sheath tumor that can present as a neck mass, but it typically has different histological and immunohistochemical features.\n10. **Plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumor** - A rare tumor that can occur in children, but it usually has a distinct histological appearance and lacks the FUS rearrangement.\n\nEach of these possibilities should be considered in the context of the patient's age, clinical presentation, and diagnostic findings to ensure a comprehensive evaluation.", "topic": "['Adolescent Medicine', 'Otolaryngology', 'Pediatrics', 'Surgery', 'Head and Neck Surgery']"}

She had no history of longer-term use of medications. There was no family history of hearing and vision loss in all immediate family members. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/63 OS. Her pupils were round and reactive. The anterior segment was unremarkable. Fundus examination confirmed the presence of bilateral macular atrophy. Fundus autofluorescence revealed a fairly symmetric loss of autofluorescence in the macula and in the regions surrounding the optic disc (Figure). In proximity of these areas of reduced autofluorescence, a speckled fundus autofluorescence pattern of alternating spots of increased and decreased autofluorescence was also noted.

We've got a 45-year-old woman who's having some trouble with her vision. She's been referred because of this macular atrophy in both eyes. That's a big deal. And she's also dealing with hearing loss, which is interesting. It's sensorineural and cochlear in nature. Hmm, that's a specific type of hearing loss. She's had headaches too, since she was 35. That's quite a while. No long-term meds, so we can probably rule out drug-induced issues. And no family history of these problems, which is curious.\n\nOkay, let's look at her eye exam. Her visual acuity is 20/20 in one eye and 20/63 in the other. That's a noticeable difference. Pupils are round and reactive, so that's normal. The front part of the eyes looks fine, but the fundus exam shows macular atrophy in both eyes. That's significant. And the fundus autofluorescence shows a symmetric loss of autofluorescence in the macula and around the optic disc. There's also this speckled pattern of increased and decreased autofluorescence. That's a pretty unique finding.\n\nThe OCT scans show atrophy of the outer retina and retinal pigment epithelium. That's pretty specific. So, we've got these bilateral retinal issues and hearing loss. Hmm, what conditions tie these together? Usher syndrome comes to mind, but that usually starts earlier and has other symptoms like night blindness. And it's typically inherited, but her family didn't show any issues. That's strange.\n\nLet's think about other possibilities. Could it be cone-rod dystrophy? That can cause vision problems, but it doesn't usually come with hearing loss. What about retinitis pigmentosa? It affects the retina, but again, not typically linked with hearing loss. Hmm, maybe something like Alström syndrome? That can involve both hearing and vision, but it's quite rare and usually has more systemic symptoms.\n\nOh, and there's the headaches. They've been going on for a long time. Could they be related? Maybe it's a neurodegenerative thing. But then, her family didn't have any symptoms, which makes me think it might not be genetic. Hmm, what about something like a mitochondrial disorder? Those can be sporadic and affect different systems, including vision and hearing.\n\nLet's see, what else? We could consider conditions like Kearns-Sayre syndrome or MELAS. They're mitochondrial and can have a mix of symptoms, but they often have more widespread issues. Hmm, it's tricky. The lack of family history makes me think it might be something non-genetic or a new mutation.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Based on everything, I'm leaning towards a mitochondrial disorder like Kearns-Sayre syndrome. It fits the bilateral vision and hearing issues, and the headaches could be related too. It's not perfect, but it seems to tie everything together best. Yeah, that's what I'm going with.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Usher Syndrome** - This condition is known for combining retinitis pigmentosa with sensorineural hearing loss, but it typically presents earlier in life and often includes night blindness.\n\n2. **Cone-Rod Dystrophy** - This could explain the visual issues, but it doesn't typically involve hearing loss.\n\n3. **Retinitis Pigmentosa** - Affects the retina but is not usually associated with hearing loss.\n\n4. **Alström Syndrome** - Involves both hearing and vision loss, but it's rare and often includes more systemic symptoms.\n\n5. **Kearns-Sayre Syndrome** - A mitochondrial disorder that can cause progressive external ophthalmoplegia, pigmentary retinopathy, and hearing loss, fitting some of the symptoms.\n\n6. **MELAS Syndrome** - Another mitochondrial disorder with varied symptoms, including vision and hearing issues, but often more widespread neurological problems.\n\n7. **Wolfram Syndrome** - Characterized by diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness, but the absence of diabetes makes it less likely.\n\n8. **Perrault Syndrome** - Involves sensorineural hearing loss and progressive ataxia, but not typically the specific retinal findings.\n\n9. **Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like Episodes (MELAS)** - Could explain some symptoms, but usually involves more acute neurological episodes.\n\n10. **Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)** - A mitochondrial disorder affecting the eyes, but not typically associated with hearing loss.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Kearns-Sayre Syndrome** seems to be the most fitting diagnosis. It's a mitochondrial disorder that can account for the combination of bilateral macular atrophy, sensorineural hearing loss, and chronic headaches, without requiring a family history of the condition. This diagnosis aligns well with the patient's symptoms and the nature of mitochondrial disorders, which can present sporadically.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Pediatrics', 'Otolaryngology', 'Audiology and Hearing', 'Retinal Disorders']"}

That's interesting because not all skin conditions come with joint problems. The fact that it's in the distal and proximal interphalangeal joints is pretty specific. And he can't clench his fists?

It's not something you see with every skin condition, so it's definitely worth considering.\n\nOkay, so what could this be? Atopic dermatitis is common in kids, but it usually responds well to topical steroids, and this didn't.

It's a complex case, and we need to consider all the angles.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the condition described:\n\n1. **Psoriatic Arthritis** - This condition can account for the chronic skin rashes, joint pain, and uveitis.\n2. **Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris** - Characterized by skin changes, but typically does not involve joint or eye symptoms.\n3. **Mycosis Fungoides** - A form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that could explain some skin findings, but less likely to involve joints and eyes.\n4. **Atopic Dermatitis** - Common in children, but usually responds to topical treatments and doesn't typically involve joint pain or uveitis.\n5. **Netherton Syndrome** - Unlikely due to the absence of trichorrhexis invaginata in hair examination.\n6. **Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis** - Could explain joint pain and uveitis, but skin findings are atypical.\n7. **Doughnut-shaped Papules with Uveitis and Joint Pain** - A rare condition that might fit the symptoms, but not well documented.\n8. **Tuberculosis** - Could cause systemic symptoms, but less likely without other characteristic signs.\n9. **Keratosis Pilaris** - A skin condition that doesn't typically involve joints or eyes.\n10. **Lichen Planus** - Can affect skin and mucous membranes, but joint involvement and uveitis are uncommon.\n\nAfter considering all the symptoms and test results, **Psoriatic Arthritis** remains the most likely diagnosis as it best explains the combination of chronic skin rashes, joint pain, and uveitis. However, it's important to keep an open mind and consider the possibility of rare conditions or atypical presentations. Further evaluation and possibly a biopsy would be essential in confirming the diagnosis.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Rheumatology', 'Pediatrics']"}

Findings of Amsler grid testing were notable for a small area of distortion inferiorly in the left eye. Intraocular pressures (IOPs) were 13 mm Hg in both eyes. Findings of anterior segment examination were unremarkable. Findings of dilated fundus examination were notable for cup-disc ratio of 0.9 in the right eye and 0.85 in the left eye with temporal thinning, stable from prior, and new intraretinal thickening in the left eye.

We've got a 70-year-old woman who's been dealing with some vision issues in her left eye for a few months. Her vision isn't as sharp as it used to be, and she's noticing some distortion. That's definitely something to pay attention to.\n\nFirst off, she's got a history of glaucoma, and she's had some surgeries for it. Her eye pressures are currently stable, though, so that's good. But, glaucoma can be tricky, and sometimes the optic nerve can still be affected even if the pressure is okay. So, glaucoma could still be playing a role here.\n\nNow, let's talk about that distortion she's seeing. It's showing up on the Amsler grid test, which makes me think about the macula. Distortion often points to something going on in the retina, like macular degeneration or a macular hole. Those are common in older adults, so they're definitely on my radar.\n\nThe OCT scan is really interesting. It shows this schiticlike separation in the retina. That sounds like a macular issue, maybe a macular hole or some kind of macular edema. It's not the typical finding you'd expect with glaucoma, which usually affects the optic nerve more directly.\n\nBut wait, there's more to consider. The separation on the OCT extends from the optic nerve to the fovea. That's a bit unusual for a straightforward macular hole. It makes me think about the peripapillary area and how glaucoma could be involved, maybe causing some traction or changes around the optic nerve.\n\nSo, what else could this be? Well, vitreomacular traction is another possibility. That's when the vitreous gel in the eye pulls on the retina, which can cause distortion and vision problems. It could definitely explain the OCT findings.\n\nI should also think about other conditions like central serous chorioretinopathy or even a choroidal neovascular membrane. These can cause fluid buildup and distortion, but they usually have other signs, like fluid under the retina or new blood vessels, which I don't see here.\n\nOkay, let's put it all together. The most likely explanation is vitreomacular traction. It fits the OCT findings and the patient's symptoms. But I can't completely rule out glaucoma or age-related macular degeneration, as they could be contributing factors. I'll keep them on the list, but they're not at the top.\n\nIn the end, vitreomacular traction seems like the best fit for what's going on. It's consistent with the schiticlike separation and the patient's age. I feel pretty confident about that.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Vitreomacular Traction** - This condition involves the vitreous gel pulling on the retina, which can cause the distortion and vision changes described.\n\n2. **Glaucoma** - Although the intraocular pressures are currently stable, glaucoma can still cause progressive optic nerve damage that might contribute to the patient's symptoms.\n\n3. **Age-related Macular Degeneration** - This common condition in older adults can lead to distortion and changes in vision, often related to fluid or drusen under the retina.\n\n4. **Macular Hole** - A macular hole could explain the distortion and decreased vision, especially if it's associated with vitreomacular traction.\n\n5. **Cystoid Macular Edema** - This condition involves fluid accumulation in the macula, which can cause vision distortion and is sometimes related to prior eye surgeries.\n\n6. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy** - This condition involves fluid buildup under the retina, leading to vision distortion, but typically affects a different age group and has distinct findings.\n\n7. **Choroidal Neovascular Membrane** - Abnormal blood vessel growth under the retina can cause vision distortion, often associated with age-related macular degeneration.\n\n8. **Epiretinal Membrane** - This condition involves a layer of scar tissue forming on the retina, causing distortion and vision changes.\n\n9. **Retinal Detachment** - Although less likely given the OCT findings, a retinal detachment could cause sudden changes in vision and distortion.\n\n10. **Optic Disc Pit** - A congenital condition that can cause macular edema and vision changes, though it's less common in this age group.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnosis is **Vitreomacular Traction**, as it best explains the OCT findings and the patient's symptoms. Glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration remain relevant considerations due to the patient's history and age, but they are secondary to vitreomacular traction in this context.", "topic": "['Macular Diseases', 'Ophthalmology', 'Retinal Disorders', 'Glaucoma', 'Ophthalmic Imaging']"}

She had no history of eye trauma, did not sleep in her CLs, and stopped using CLs at symptom onset. Of note, she had recently been swimming in a freshwater lake prior to the onset of the ulcer. She was initially treated with topical besifloxacin and followed up daily. She appeared to improve clinically with resolution of her epithelial defect after 3 days, and topical loteprednol was added. Results of initial corneal cultures were negative. One week later, she presented with worsening pain and vision, which prompted referral to our cornea clinic where, 2 weeks after her initial presentation, her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/150 OS. Left-eye examination demonstrated diffuse microcystic corneal edema and stromal thickening with no Descemet membrane folds (Figure 1A). A 2 × 2-mm stromal opacity was noted paracentrally with no epithelial defects. The anterior chamber demonstrated 1+ cell. Intraocular pressure was 17 mm Hg OS. Corneal cultures for bacteria, fungi, and acanthamoeba were repeated, and in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) was performed on the stromal infiltrate (Figure 1B). After reviewing the IVCM images, what empirical treatment would you recommend while awaiting the results of the repeated corneal cultures? \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Purpureocillium lilacinum keratitis confirmed by culture growth 21 days later", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a young woman with a stubborn corneal ulcer. She's been wearing contact lenses daily, which can be a bit risky for the eyes. But she didn't have any trauma, and she stopped using the lenses as soon as symptoms started. That's good, but let's not forget she went swimming in a freshwater lake before this all began. That's an interesting detail.\n\nSo, she was initially treated with besifloxacin, an antibiotic, and seemed to get better. But then, things took a turn for the worse after they added loteprednol, a steroid. That's a red flag because steroids can sometimes make infections worse if they're not bacterial.\n\nWhen we examine her eye, there's this stromal opacity and some corneal edema. No epithelial defect, though, which is curious. And the cultures? Negative so far. Hmm, that's not giving us much to go on.\n\nNow, let's think about what could be causing this. Bacterial keratitis is always a suspect with contact lens use, but the negative cultures make that less likely. Fungal keratitis could be an option, especially after swimming in a lake. Freshwater lakes can have all sorts of organisms. Acanthamoeba is another possibility since it's associated with contact lens wear and swimming in lakes. And then there's the fact that steroids can exacerbate these types of infections.\n\nThe in vivo confocal microscopy could give us more clues. If we see anything like double-walled cysts, that would scream Acanthamoeba. But if there are dendritic patterns, we might be looking at something like herpes simplex virus. And if there are fungal elements, that would point us in another direction.\n\nSo, what's the best move while we wait for more culture results? Considering the history and symptoms, starting treatment for Acanthamoeba seems wise. We could use something like chlorhexidine and propamidine. But we shouldn't ignore other possibilities. If the IVCM shows something else, we might need to adjust our treatment.\n\nIn the end, it's a bit of a balancing act. We need to treat what seems most likely based on the evidence we have while keeping an open mind and being ready to change course if new information comes to light.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely cause of the corneal ulcer is Acanthamoeba keratitis, given the patient's history of contact lens wear and swimming in a freshwater lake. The initial improvement with antibiotic treatment followed by worsening after the addition of a steroid is consistent with Acanthamoeba, as steroids can exacerbate this type of infection. The negative cultures for bacteria and fungi also support this diagnosis, as Acanthamoeba can be difficult to culture.\n\nTherefore, while awaiting the results of the repeated corneal cultures, empirical treatment for Acanthamoeba keratitis is recommended. This typically includes the use of antiprotozoal agents such as chlorhexidine and propamidine. It's important to continue monitoring the patient's response to treatment and be prepared to adjust it if new information becomes available from the cultures or in vivo confocal microscopy results.", "topic": "['Cornea', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Ophthalmology', 'Emergency Medicine']"}

Four weeks following receipt of immunotherapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab, he developed acute abdominal pain in the setting of a rapidly rising lactic acid dehydrogenase levels, prompting hospital admission. Imaging results showed mild disease progression (new ascites and periportal metabolic lymph node). Splenic infarct and portal/splenic vein thrombi were identified as etiologies of his acute pain and were presumed to be secondary to hypercoagulable state of malignancy. Over the next 3 days, he had rising serum creatinine (sCr) levels (baseline, approximately 1 mg/dL [to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4]). The initial workup included ultrasonography and urinalysis. Ultrasonography results showed abnormal intraparenchymal flow to both kidneys without evidence of kidney artery stenosis. Urine studies were consistent with prerenal etiology, while the presence of casts suggested acute tubular necrosis. Nephrotoxic medications (omeprazole/pantoprazole) were discontinued. The top differential diagnoses at this juncture included contrast-induced nephropathy or immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)–induced acute interstitial nephritis, and empirical high dose steroids were prescribed. Despite observation and steroid treatment, his sCr levels continued to increase over the next 5 days, peaking at 5.8 mg/dL, and the patient progressed into anuric kidney failure, requiring hemodialysis. This prompted a kidney biopsy for definitive diagnosis (Figure). One week later, he received encorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor.1 Two weeks later, the patient’s kidney function began to improve, and hemodialysis was discontinued. He continued to show gradual improvement, with a return to near baseline kidney function (sCr level, 1.3 mg/dL) approximately 6 weeks after treatment initiation. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Acute tubular necrosis secondary to kidney melanoma metastasis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 53-year-old guy with stage IV melanoma. He's been through a lot, including treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab. Now, he's dealing with some pretty intense abdominal pain and his lactic acid dehydrogenase levels are through the roof. That's a red flag.\n\nThe imaging shows some progression of his disease, new ascites, and these pesky periportal metabolic lymph nodes. Oh, and there's a splenic infarct and some thrombi in the portal and splenic veins. That's likely due to a hypercoagulable state from the cancer. Yikes.\n\nNow, his kidney function is going downhill fast. His creatinine levels are rising, and it's not looking good. The ultrasound doesn't show any artery stenosis, so that's not the issue. The urinalysis suggests a prerenal cause, but there are also casts, which point to acute tubular necrosis. Hmm, that's tricky.\n\nWe stopped any nephrotoxic meds like omeprazole or pantoprazole, just in case. But we're still left with a few possibilities. Could it be contrast-induced nephropathy? Or maybe it's acute interstitial nephritis from the immunotherapy? We started him on high-dose steroids, but that didn't seem to help. His creatinine kept climbing, and now he's in anuric kidney failure. That's serious.\n\nSo, we did a kidney biopsy to get some answers. And then, a week later, he started on encorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor. Interesting timing. Two weeks after that, his kidney function starts to improve, and he's off hemodialysis. That's a pretty quick turnaround.\n\nOver the next six weeks, his kidney function almost goes back to normal. That's a huge relief. So, what's going on here? Let's think about the possibilities.\n\nFirst, there's contrast-induced nephropathy. But that usually happens after contrast exposure, and we didn't have any of that here. So, probably not that.\n\nThen, there's acute interstitial nephritis from the immunotherapy. That's possible, but the steroids didn't help, so maybe not.\n\nWhat about tumor lysis syndrome? It could explain the rising LDH and kidney issues, but we didn't see any other signs like high uric acid or electrolyte imbalances. So, that's unlikely.\n\nMaybe it's thrombotic microangiopathy? That could fit with the cancer and kidney failure, but we didn't see any schistocytes or signs of hemolysis. So, probably not.\n\nCould it be renal vein thrombosis? That could cause kidney problems, but the ultrasound didn't show anything like that. So, not likely.\n\nWhat about drug-induced acute kidney injury from the BRAF inhibitor? Encorafenib did seem to coincide with his improvement. But usually, drug-induced injury doesn't improve that quickly without stopping the drug. So, that's a bit odd.\n\nOh, and there's always the possibility of a paraneoplastic syndrome. Sometimes, the body's response to cancer can cause all sorts of systemic issues, including kidney problems. That could fit with the timing and his cancer.\n\nSo, after thinking it through, I'm leaning towards a paraneoplastic syndrome. It explains the kidney issues and the improvement after starting encorafenib, which might have affected the tumor and, in turn, the paraneoplastic process. Yeah, that seems to make the most sense.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's acute kidney injury, considering the context of stage IV melanoma and recent immunotherapy treatment:\n\n1. **Contrast-induced Nephropathy** - Although there's no mention of recent contrast exposure, it's important to consider given the imaging studies.\n   \n2. **Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-induced Acute Interstitial Nephritis** - A known side effect of ipilimumab and nivolumab, which could explain the kidney dysfunction.\n   \n3. **Tumor Lysis Syndrome** - Could be considered due to rising LDH, but lacks other characteristic findings like hyperuricemia or electrolyte imbalances.\n   \n4. **Thrombotic Microangiopathy** - Possible in the context of malignancy, but absence of schistocytes or hemolysis makes it less likely.\n   \n5. **Renal Vein Thrombosis** - Could cause acute kidney injury, but not supported by ultrasound findings.\n   \n6. **Drug-induced Acute Kidney Injury** - Specifically from encorafenib, although the timing of improvement is atypical for a drug-induced injury.\n   \n7. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - A possible cause given the systemic effects of melanoma, potentially influencing kidney function.\n   \n8. **Hypercalcemia of Malignancy** - Could cause kidney dysfunction, but no information on calcium levels is provided.\n   \n9. **Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome** - Similar to thrombotic microangiopathy, but lacks supporting laboratory evidence.\n   \n10. **Cancer-related Hypercoagulable State** - Could contribute to renal complications, but more systemic evidence would be expected.\n\nReranking these differentials based on the patient's improvement after starting encorafenib and the overall clinical picture, a **paraneoplastic syndrome** emerges as the most likely cause. This could involve a complex interaction between the melanoma and the immune system affecting kidney function, with encorafenib potentially modifying this process, leading to the observed improvement.", "topic": "['Nephrology', 'Melanoma', 'Oncology']"}

He was a nonsmoker and consumed very little alcohol. Clinical examination including flexible nasendoscopy revealed multiple shallow ulcers on the posterior wall of the nasopharynx. There was a large defect involving the entire soft palate on the left. There was no obvious mass or any exophytic lesion. The edges of the soft palate defect were smooth and clean (Figure 1). There were no cranial nerve palsies. There was no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Findings of the remaining head and neck examinations were normal. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 71-year-old man who's been dealing with some pretty uncomfortable symptoms in his pharynx for the past six weeks. He's got pain and ulcers, and he's also experiencing nasal regurgitation. That's got to be annoying. He's got a history of rheumatoid arthritis and type 2 diabetes, and he's taking methotrexate, which is interesting. Methotrexate is known to suppress the immune system, so that could be a factor here.\n\nFirst off, let's consider infections. Given his immunosuppressed state from the methotrexate, he's more vulnerable to infections that wouldn't normally affect someone with a fully functioning immune system. So, something like a fungal infection, maybe histoplasmosis, could be a possibility. Histoplasmosis can cause ulcers, especially in someone who's immunocompromised.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. What about other infections? Viral infections like herpes simplex virus or cytomegalovirus could also cause ulcers. These viruses can take advantage of a weakened immune system and cause the kind of symptoms he's experiencing.\n\nNow, let's think about non-infectious causes. Methotrexate itself can cause mucositis, which could lead to ulcers. So, maybe it's not an infection at all, but rather a side effect of his medication. That's definitely something to consider.\n\nOh, and what about trauma? The smooth edges of the defect in his soft palate make me think it could be some kind of structural issue. Maybe it's not an active disease process but something that's happened due to mechanical stress or trauma. Traumatic neuromuscular imbalance could cause this kind of defect.\n\nBut then again, we can't rule out neoplastic processes entirely. Even though there's no obvious mass, something like a minor salivary gland tumor could be lurking beneath the surface. These tumors can be sneaky and might not always present with a big mass.\n\nHmm, let's not forget about autoimmune disorders. Rheumatoid arthritis can sometimes cause issues in the ear, nose, and throat region. Maybe this is an extension of his autoimmune disease causing inflammation and ulcers in the pharynx.\n\nNow, let's think about other possibilities. What about something like Wegener's granulomatosis? It's a type of vasculitis that can cause ulcers and defects in the nasal and pharyngeal areas. That could fit with what we're seeing here.\n\nOh, and let's not overlook the possibility of a neurological cause. A condition like bulbar palsy could cause weakness in the muscles of the soft palate, leading to the kind of defect we're seeing. That would explain the smooth edges and the lack of other neurological symptoms.\n\nSo, putting it all together, here's what I'm thinking. The top differential diagnosis is probably a fungal infection like histoplasmosis, given his immunocompromised state. But we should also consider viral infections like herpes simplex virus or cytomegalovirus. Methotrexate-induced mucositis is another strong contender. Traumatic neuromuscular imbalance could explain the smooth defect in the soft palate. We should also keep neoplastic processes like a minor salivary gland tumor in mind. Rheumatoid arthritis-related inflammation is a possibility, as well as Wegener's granulomatosis. And finally, bulbar palsy could be causing the soft palate defect. That's a lot to consider, but it covers all the bases.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, considering his symptoms, medical history, and medication:\n\n1. **Histoplasmosis** - Given the patient's immunocompromised state due to methotrexate, a fungal infection like histoplasmosis is a strong possibility.\n\n2. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection** - HSV can cause ulcers, especially in immunocompromised individuals, and should be considered.\n\n3. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection** - Similar to HSV, CMV can take advantage of a weakened immune system and cause ulcers in the pharynx.\n\n4. **Methotrexate-induced Mucositis** - As a side effect of methotrexate, mucositis could lead to the ulcers observed in the patient.\n\n5. **Traumatic Neuromuscular Imbalance** - The smooth edges of the soft palate defect suggest a possible structural or traumatic cause.\n\n6. **Minor Salivary Gland Tumor** - Although there's no obvious mass, a neoplastic process like a minor salivary gland tumor could be present.\n\n7. **Rheumatoid Arthritis-related Inflammation** - The patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis could contribute to inflammation and ulcers in the pharynx.\n\n8. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)** - This vasculitis can cause ulcers and defects in the nasal and pharyngeal areas.\n\n9. **Bulbar Palsy** - A neurological condition affecting the muscles of the soft palate could result in the observed defect.\n\n10. **Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma** - Although less likely without a visible mass, nasopharyngeal carcinoma could present with these symptoms.\n\nThese differential diagnoses cover infectious, neoplastic, autoimmune, and neurological possibilities, providing a comprehensive approach to understanding the patient's condition.", "topic": "['Diabetes', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Dental Medicine', 'Otolaryngology', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis']"}

The lumbar puncture shows a lot of lymphocytes. That's pointing towards some kind of inflammation or infection, maybe viral meningitis, but we need to consider other possibilities too.\n\nThe eye exam shows these creamy-yellow lesions in the retina. That sounds like some kind of retinal inflammation or infection. Could it be related to the headaches and the CSF findings? Maybe. Let's think about conditions that could cause both.\n\nOkay, so what are we dealing with? It could be something like APMPPE, which is known for these kinds of retinal lesions and can cause neurological symptoms. That's a strong contender. But let's not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nWe should also think about other possibilities like syphilis, but the tests were negative, so that's probably not it. What about tuberculosis or sarcoidosis?

There's Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, which can cause ocular and neurological symptoms, but it often comes with other systemic signs. And then there's lupus, which can cause a wide range of symptoms, but again, we'd expect more findings.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? APMPPE is still a strong possibility, but we can't rule out Susac's syndrome or multiple sclerosis yet. We need to think about the whole picture, including the negative MRI and the specific retinal findings.\n\nAfter going through everything, I think APMPPE is the most likely diagnosis.

She had been healthy until 6 years earlier when she had suddenly developed peripheral neuropathy, with subsequent workup revealing a diagnosis of immunoglobulin M (IgM) monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Her symptoms had rapidly progressed during the past few months. In addition to worsening neuropathy, she had developed fatigue, weight loss, and sudden altered mental status. An ischemic stroke was identified. The patient was hospitalized, and extensive diagnostic examinations and procedures were completed. A lymphoproliferative disorder with plasmocytic differentiation was detected in a bone marrow biopsy specimen, which together with the monoclonal IgM paraproteinemia was consistent with Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM). Weeks later, the patient developed an asymptomatic rash of her lower legs. A physical examination revealed several bright red, nonblanchable, pinpoint macules of the bilateral lower legs (Figure, A). An antinuclear antibody test result was positive (titer 1:320, diffuse pattern). Other laboratory testing procedures (ie, complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, anti-Sjogren syndrome [SS]-A and SS-B, anti–double-stranded DNA, complement [C]3 and C4, homocysteine, β-2-glycoprotein, anticardiolipin, lupus anticoagulant, and vitamin C) returned normal. A punch biopsy of the right lower leg was performed for further diagnostic evaluation (Figure, B-D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cutaneous macroglobulinosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her 70s who's been dealing with some pretty serious health issues. She was doing fine until about six years ago when she suddenly developed peripheral neuropathy. That's when they found out she had IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Fast forward to now, and things have taken a turn for the worse. She's got worsening neuropathy, fatigue, weight loss, and even had a stroke. That's a lot going on.\n\nNow, they've found a lymphoproliferative disorder with plasmocytic differentiation in her bone marrow. That, along with the IgM paraproteinemia, points towards Waldenström macroglobulinemia. It's a mouthful, but basically, it's a type of cancer where the blood gets thick with abnormal proteins.\n\nThen, she develops this rash on her lower legs. It's made up of bright red, pinpoint spots that don't fade when you press on them. That sounds like petechiae or purpura to me, which usually means there's some kind of bleeding or clotting issue going on.\n\nThe positive antinuclear antibody test is interesting, but everything else in her lab work is normal. That's a bit puzzling because you'd expect more abnormalities if it were something like lupus.\n\nSo, what could be causing these skin findings? With her history, I'm thinking it could be related to her Waldenström macroglobulinemia. Maybe the hyperviscosity of her blood is leading to these vascular changes. But I shouldn't jump to conclusions just yet.\n\nLet's consider other possibilities. Vasculitis could be a contender, given the referral from rheumatology. But usually, you'd see more systemic symptoms or abnormal lab results pointing towards inflammation.\n\nWhat about thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura? It can cause neurological symptoms and rash, but her platelet count would likely be low, and it wasn't mentioned.\n\nHmm, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis is another option. It can cause similar skin findings, but I'd expect to see more abnormal liver function tests or complement levels.\n\nAlright, let's not forget about antiphospholipid syndrome. It can cause strokes and rashes, but the tests for anticardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant were normal, so that's unlikely.\n\nOh, and there's also the possibility of a hypercoagulable state. With her stroke history and these skin findings, it's worth considering. But again, the normal coagulation tests throw a wrench in that theory.\n\nNow, what about a vasculitis related to her monoclonal gammopathy? That could fit, given her underlying condition. The IgM could be causing some kind of immune complex deposition.\n\nLet's see, what else? We could think about polyarteritis nodosa, but that usually involves medium-sized vessels and would likely have more systemic manifestations.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered the bases. Given everything, the most likely explanation for her rash is still related to her Waldenström macroglobulinemia, probably due to the blood hyperviscosity. But I'm keeping vasculitis related to her IgM paraproteinemia as a close second.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with a focus on the skin findings and her underlying medical history:\n\n1. **Waldenström Macroglobulinemia with Hyperviscosity**: The patient's IgM paraproteinemia and associated symptoms, including the rash, are consistent with hyperviscosity syndrome, a known complication of Waldenström macroglobulinemia.\n\n2. **Vasculitis related to IgM Paraproteinemia**: The skin findings could be due to vasculitis caused by immune complex deposition from the IgM paraproteinemia.\n\n3. **Cryoglobulinemic Vasculitis**: Although complement levels were normal, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis could still be considered, especially with the skin manifestations and underlying lymphoproliferative disorder.\n\n4. **Antiphospholipid Syndrome**: Despite normal tests for anticardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant, antiphospholipid syndrome could be considered due to the stroke and rash.\n\n5. **Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)**: TTP can cause neurological symptoms and rash, but typically presents with low platelet counts, which were not mentioned.\n\n6. **Hypercoagulable State**: The patient's stroke history and skin findings could suggest a hypercoagulable state, although coagulation tests were normal.\n\n7. **Polyarteritis Nodosa**: This medium-vessel vasculitis could be considered, but usually involves more systemic manifestations.\n\n8. **Immune Complex-mediated Vasculitis**: This could result from the monoclonal gammopathy, leading to skin and systemic symptoms.\n\n9. **Livedoid Vasculopathy**: Characterized by skin findings similar to those described, often associated with coagulation disorders.\n\n10. **Cutaneous Small Vessel Vasculitis**: A more generalized term for vasculitis affecting small vessels, which could be secondary to the patient's underlying condition.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are Waldenström macroglobulinemia with hyperviscosity and vasculitis related to IgM paraproteinemia. These are most consistent with the patient's symptoms and underlying medical conditions.", "topic": "['Rheumatology', 'Neurology', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neuropathy', 'Dermatology']"}

His history was notable for nonischemic cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 40% and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, for which he underwent single-lung transplant 9 years prior. Following diuresis and medical optimization, repeated echocardiogram showed a newly depressed ejection fraction (30%). His electrocardiogram (ECG) was notable for alternating QRS morphologies (Figure 1A). The left ventricular (LV) pacing vector was programmed from LV tip to right ventricular (RV) lead ring. During pacemaker threshold testing, a change in QRS morphology was observed as the output was reduced (Figure 1B). Chest radiography revealed severe right pulmonary fibrosis leading to ipsilateral mediastinal shift and pacemaker lead position unchanged from implantation. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Anodal capture", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a man in his 70s who's been dealing with some serious heart issues. He's got permanent atrial fibrillation, and he's had a procedure done to help with that, plus a pacemaker to keep things in check. But now, he's in the hospital because his heart failure has gotten worse, and his kidneys aren't happy either. That's a lot to take in.\n\nOkay, so he's also got nonischemic cardiomyopathy, which means his heart's not pumping as well as it should. His ejection fraction has dropped to 30%, which is a big deal. And oh, he had a lung transplant about 9 years ago because of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. That's a pretty big piece of his medical history.\n\nNow, let's talk about this ECG. It's showing something weird—alternating QRS morphologies. That's not something you see every day. And when they did some testing on his pacemaker, the QRS morphology changed again when they reduced the output. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nThe chest X-ray shows some severe right pulmonary fibrosis, which has caused his mediastinal structures to shift. But the pacemaker leads? They're still in the same position as they were when they were implanted. So, the shift didn't physically move the leads, but it might be affecting how things are working.\n\nLet's think about what could be going on here. The change in QRS morphologies could mean there's an issue with the pacemaker, like maybe a lead is not where it's supposed to be or not working right. It could be something like a microdisplacement or maybe an issue with the pacing threshold.\n\nBut wait, there's more. The patient's ejection fraction has dropped, and that's a big deal. It could be that the pacemaker isn't pacing the heart effectively, which could be due to a lead issue or maybe the heart's just not responding well to the pacing.\n\nAnd let's not forget about the lung transplant and the pulmonary fibrosis. That could be causing some strain on the heart, contributing to the decreased ejection fraction. It's all connected.\n\nSo, what's the most likely explanation? It seems like the pacemaker lead could be the culprit, maybe it's not in the right spot or there's an issue with the connection. But we can't ignore the impact of the pulmonary fibrosis and the heart's condition.\n\nAlright, let's wrap this up. The top differential diagnosis is pacemaker lead microdisplacement. It fits with the changes in the ECG and the drop in ejection fraction. But we should also consider pacing threshold issues, right ventricular pacing pseudomalfunction, and the effects of pulmonary fibrosis on the heart. It's a complex situation, and we need to look at it from all angles.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with a focus on the changes in ECG, pacemaker function, and the impact of pulmonary fibrosis:\n\n1. **Pacemaker Lead Microdisplacement** - This could explain the changes in QRS morphology and the decreased ejection fraction if the lead is not in optimal position.\n\n2. **Pacing Threshold Issue** - A change in the pacing threshold could affect how the pacemaker stimulates the heart, leading to altered QRS morphologies.\n\n3. **Right Ventricular Pacing Pseudomalfunction** - This might occur if the pacemaker is not effectively capturing the ventricle due to a threshold issue or lead problem.\n\n4. **Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) Non-Response** - The patient's decreased ejection fraction could indicate that the heart is not responding well to CRT, possibly due to lead placement or underlying cardiac changes.\n\n5. **Pulmonary Fibrosis Exacerbation** - The severe pulmonary fibrosis could be placing additional strain on the heart, contributing to the decreased ejection fraction and heart failure exacerbation.\n\n6. **Pacemaker Lead Dislodgement** - Although the chest X-ray shows no physical dislodgement, a functional dislodgement could still cause pacing issues.\n\n7. **Myocardial Infarction** - Although less likely given the nonischemic cardiomyopathy, a silent myocardial infarction could cause a drop in ejection fraction and ECG changes.\n\n8. **Cardiac Tamponade** - This could result from the mediastinal shift or other factors, leading to impaired cardiac function and ECG changes.\n\n9. **Arrhythmia** - The ECG changes could also be due to an arrhythmia, which might be related to the pacemaker or underlying cardiac disease.\n\n10. **Post-Transplant Cardiac Complications** - Long-term post-transplant complications, such as chronic rejection or cardiac remodeling, could contribute to the patient's heart failure and decreased ejection fraction.\n\nUpon reviewing all the information, the top differential diagnosis is **Pacemaker Lead Microdisplacement**, as it aligns with the changes in QRS morphology and the decreased cardiac function. However, the impact of **Pulmonary Fibrosis Exacerbation** and potential **Pacing Threshold Issues** should also be strongly considered, given their possible contributions to the patient's condition.", "topic": "['Rhythm Disorders', 'Cardiology', 'Heart Failure', 'Medical Devices and Equipment']"}

Three months earlier, he underwent digital amputation of his right third finger and began adjuvant nivolumab treatment for stage IIIC acral-lentiginous melanoma. One week later, he developed fevers, myalgias, dark urine, weakness, and difficulty walking. He had no palpitations, chest pain, or shortness of breath. On examination, his blood pressure was 135/86 mm Hg, pulse 78/min, and he was afebrile. He had reduced strength in bilateral proximal shoulders (3/5), elbow flexors/extensors (3/5), and forearm flexors/extensors (4+/5). No rashes were noted. Laboratory studies demonstrated a creatine kinase (CK) level of 111 859 U/L (reference range, 30-220 U/L), CK-MB of 270 ng/mL (reference, <8 ng/mL), and aldolase above 500 U/L (reference, <7.7 U/L).

The patient’s electrocardiogram (ECG) is also shown in the Figure. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Nivolumab-induced myositis with myocarditis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 47-year-old guy who's been dealing with melanoma and had his thyroid removed. He's been on nivolumab, which is an immunotherapy drug, for a few months now. Suddenly, he's got these low-grade fevers, muscle aches, and he's feeling pretty weak, especially in his shoulders and arms. That's not good.\n\nOkay, so what's going on with his labs? His creatine kinase is through the roof, which makes me think of muscle damage right away. And his CK-MB is also really high, which is interesting because that's more specific to heart muscle, but let's not jump to conclusions yet. His liver enzymes are elevated too, which could be related to muscle breakdown since muscles and liver are connected in some metabolic pathways.\n\nOh, and his kidneys aren't happy either. His creatinine is up, and he's got myoglobin in his urine, which is a big red flag for rhabdomyolysis. That's when muscle tissue breaks down and releases its contents into the blood, which can harm the kidneys. Plus, his potassium is high, which can happen when cells get damaged and release their contents.\n\nNow, let's think about what could be causing all of this. Nivolumab is known to cause some weird immune-related side effects. Could it be triggering something like an inflammatory myopathy? That would fit with the muscle weakness and high CK levels. Polymyositis or dermatomyositis could be possibilities, but there's no skin rash, so maybe not dermatomyositis.\n\nBut wait, let's not forget about other potential causes. High CK levels and muscle weakness could also point to something like muscular dystrophy. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy maybe? It's a bit of a stretch given the acute nature of his symptoms, but it's worth considering.\n\nAnd what about infections? Viral infections like influenza or HIV can cause myositis, which would fit the muscle pain and weakness. But we don't have any respiratory symptoms or other signs of a viral infection, so maybe that's less likely.\n\nOh, and there's the MRI showing muscle inflammation. That's a strong clue pointing towards some kind of myositis or inflammation in the muscles. It's not just muscle weakness; there's actual inflammation going on.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the most likely explanation is an inflammatory myopathy induced by nivolumab. It's a known side effect, and everything lines up: the symptoms, the lab results, the MRI findings. But I should also keep limb-girdle muscular dystrophy in mind as a possible alternative, even if it's less likely. And just to be thorough, I'll consider viral myositis, although it seems less probable without respiratory symptoms.\n\nIn the end, I'm pretty confident that nivolumab-induced inflammatory myopathy is the main culprit here. It fits the whole picture, and the other possibilities just don't align as well with all the evidence.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is nivolumab-induced inflammatory myopathy. This condition aligns with the patient's symptoms of muscle weakness, elevated creatine kinase levels, and MRI findings of muscle inflammation, as well as his recent treatment with nivolumab, which is known to cause immune-related side effects including myopathies.\n\nHere is a 10-step differential diagnosis with one condition per step, ensuring no repetition:\n\n1. **Nivolumab-induced inflammatory myopathy** - Given the patient's treatment with nivolumab and symptoms.\n2. **Polymyositis** - Characterized by muscle weakness and elevated CK levels.\n3. **Dermatomyositis** - Similar to polymyositis but typically includes a skin rash, which is absent here.\n4. **Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy** - A genetic disorder causing progressive muscle weakness.\n5. **Viral myositis** - Caused by viral infections like influenza, but usually accompanied by respiratory symptoms.\n6. **Rhabdomyolysis** - Suggested by high CK and myoglobin in urine, but more a symptom than a diagnosis.\n7. **Hypothyroidism** - Can cause muscle weakness, but less likely given the patient's thyroidectomy and lack of specific symptoms.\n8. **Hyperthyroidism** - Though less common post-thyroidectomy, can cause muscle weakness and elevated CK.\n9. **McArdle disease (Glycogen storage disease type V)** - A metabolic myopathy causing exercise-induced muscle pain.\n10. **Toxic myopathy** - Could result from drug or toxin exposure, but less likely given the context.\n\nReranking these based on all available information, the top three most likely diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Nivolumab-induced inflammatory myopathy**\n2. **Polymyositis**\n3. **Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy**\n\nThese conditions best fit the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, with nivolumab-induced inflammatory myopathy being the most probable cause.", "topic": "['Cardiology', 'Dermatology', 'Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology', 'Melanoma', 'Oncology']"}

His extraocular movements were full, and he had no other neurologic deficits. His visual acuity was 20/400 OD and 20/30 OS, respectively, and his fundi were notable for bilateral optic nerve edema. Results of recent computed tomography and angiography of the head and neck and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits were reportedly normal, and lumbar puncture revealed an opening pressure of 26 cm H2O (normal range, 6 to 25 cm H2O) with elevated protein. The patient was given acetazolamide and referred to neuro-ophthalmology. On examination by neuro-ophthalmology 4 months later, his visual acuity was 20/50 OD and 20/20 OS. He had an afferent pupillary defect in the right eye, and Humphrey visual fields (24-2) showed binasal inferior defects with a superior defect in the right eye that was considered an artifact of testing. According to the Ishihara color plates test, color vision was full in both eyes. Fundus examination was remarkable for pallor of both optic nerves, more notably in the right eye, without edema (Figure 1). Findings of screening for antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, angiotensin-converting enzyme, Bartonella, HIV, tuberculosis (Quantiferon), Treponema pallidum, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and a complete blood cell count were normal. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Primary angiitis of the central nervous system", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 58-year-old man who suddenly can't see well out of his right eye, and it's not painful. That's interesting because pain often points to certain types of issues, but we don't have that here. He's also got tinnitus and these bad headaches that come and go. Hmm, that's a lot to take in. His eye movements are fine, and he doesn't have any other neurological problems, which is good. But his vision is really bad in that right eye, 20/400, compared to 20/30 in the left. That's a big difference. And both of his optic nerves are swollen. That's a red flag for something going on with the optic nerve or the pressure in his head.\n\nNow, the tests they did—CT, angiography, MRI—they all came back normal. That's surprising because with symptoms like these, you'd expect to see something. But the lumbar puncture shows elevated opening pressure and protein. Ah, that's a clue. This could be idiopathic intracranial hypertension, or pseudotumor cerebri, where there's too much pressure in the skull. But wait, he's a 58-year-old man, and IIH is more common in younger, overweight women. So, maybe something else is going on.\n\nLet's think about other possibilities. Optic neuritis could cause sudden vision loss, but it's usually painful, and he's not reporting pain. Plus, it doesn't explain the tinnitus or the high opening pressure. What about a pituitary adenoma? It could cause vision problems if it's pressing on the optic nerve, but the scans didn't show anything. Hmm, maybe the tumor is too small or in a weird position that the scans missed.\n\nThere's also the possibility of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. That could cause high intracranial pressure and vision issues, but again, the scans were normal. Maybe the thrombosis is tiny or in a place that's hard to see. Let's not forget about chronic meningitis. It could explain the high protein in the CSF, but the other tests would probably show something abnormal. And what about a dural arteriovenous fistula? That could cause these symptoms, but we'd likely see something on the angiography.\n\nOkay, let's put it all together. Given the sudden vision loss, tinnitus, headaches, and the lumbar puncture results, idiopathic intracranial hypertension is still a strong contender. But we can't ignore the possibility of a small pituitary adenoma or a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis that the scans missed. And that dural arteriovenous fistula idea is still lingering in my mind. It's a tough case, but those seem like the most likely explanations.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (Pseudotumor Cerebri)**: This condition is characterized by elevated intracranial pressure, which aligns with the patient's high opening pressure on lumbar puncture and symptoms like headaches and tinnitus.\n\n2. **Pituitary Adenoma**: Although the scans were normal, a small adenoma could potentially be missed, especially if it's positioned in a way that's not easily detectable. This could explain the vision loss and optic nerve pallor.\n\n3. **Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis**: This could cause elevated intracranial pressure and vision issues, but might not be visible on all scans, particularly if the thrombosis is small or in a location that's difficult to image.\n\n4. **Chronic Meningitis**: This could explain the elevated protein in the CSF, but typically other abnormalities would be expected in test results.\n\n5. **Dural Arteriovenous Fistula**: This might cause the symptoms of tinnitus and headaches, and could potentially lead to elevated intracranial pressure, although it's surprising that nothing was seen on angiography.\n\n6. **Optic Neuritis**: Although typically painful, a painless variant could be considered, especially with the optic nerve involvement.\n\n7. **Ischemic Optic Neuropathy**: This could cause sudden vision loss and optic nerve pallor, but usually doesn't involve elevated intracranial pressure.\n\n8. **Neurosyphilis**: This can present with a range of neurological symptoms, including vision changes, but the normal Treponema pallidum test makes this less likely.\n\n9. **Vitamin B12 Deficiency**: This can cause neurological symptoms and vision changes, but is less likely given the normal blood work.\n\n10. **Cryptococcal Meningitis**: Although rare in non-immunocompromised patients, it could present with elevated intracranial pressure and vision changes, but would likely show other abnormalities in CSF analysis.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top three most likely diagnoses remain **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension**, **Pituitary Adenoma**, and **Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis**, as they best explain the combination of symptoms and test results. Further investigation, potentially including more targeted imaging or CSF analysis, would be needed to confirm the diagnosis.", "topic": "['Ophthalmology', 'Retinal Disorders', 'Headache', 'Neurology', 'Neuro-ophthalmology']"}

We've got a 36-year-old guy who's been feeling really weak and has had a dry cough for a few weeks. He's also losing hair, which is kind of unusual. He's got a history of opioid and alcohol use, and he's been living with HIV. But he stopped his HIV meds a couple of years ago, so that's something to keep in mind.\n\nFirst off, the hair loss and rash make me think of syphilis. It's known for causing these kinds of skin issues, especially in someone with HIV. So, that's my first guess.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. The dry cough is sticking out to me. With his HIV status, he's at risk for lung infections. Could this be something like Pneumocystis pneumonia? It's common in people with untreated HIV and can cause respiratory symptoms.\n\nNow, about that rash. It's maculopapular, which could mean a lot of things. HIV itself can cause a rash, especially when it's not well-controlled. So, maybe this is just a manifestation of his underlying HIV.\n\nOh, and the hair loss. That could be from stress or even nutritional deficiencies, which can happen if his HIV is not managed properly. So, maybe it's tied to his overall health condition rather than a new infection.\n\nBut what about other infections? With his history of injection drug use, he's at risk for something like infective endocarditis. That can cause systemic symptoms, including rashes. Hmm, that's a possibility.\n\nThen there's the possibility of a viral infection like COVID-19. It can cause all sorts of symptoms, including a dry cough and fatigue. But usually, there's a fever, so maybe that's less likely.\n\nLet's not forget about fungal infections. Someone with untreated HIV could develop something like histoplasmosis, which affects the lungs and can cause similar symptoms.\n\nOh, and there's also the possibility of a psychiatric component. His substance use history makes me wonder if something like cocaine use could be causing his symptoms, including the hair loss from poor nutrition or stress.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the most likely explanation is that his symptoms are due to untreated HIV with a possible opportunistic infection like Pneumocystis pneumonia. The rash and hair loss could be related to this. But I'm also keeping infective endocarditis and histoplasmosis in mind as possibilities.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's symptoms, with a focus on one potential condition per step, without repetition:\n\n1. **Syphilis** - The combination of hair loss and a maculopapular rash in an HIV-positive patient raises the possibility of syphilis, which can present with these symptoms.\n\n2. **Pneumocystis Pneumonia** - Given the patient's history of untreated HIV, a dry cough could indicate this opportunistic lung infection common in individuals with low CD4 counts.\n\n3. **HIV-Related Rash** - The rash could be directly related to HIV itself, especially if the virus is not well-controlled, leading to various skin manifestations.\n\n4. **Infective Endocarditis** - The patient's history of injection drug use increases the risk of infective endocarditis, which can cause systemic symptoms, including rashes.\n\n5. **COVID-19** - Although typically accompanied by fever, COVID-19 can present with dry cough and fatigue, making it a consideration despite the absence of fever.\n\n6. **Histoplasmosis** - This fungal infection can affect the lungs and is more common in people with untreated HIV, potentially causing respiratory and systemic symptoms.\n\n7. **Nutritional Deficiencies** - Poor nutrition due to untreated HIV or substance use could lead to hair loss and weakness.\n\n8. **Cocaine Use** - The patient's substance use history raises the possibility that cocaine use could contribute to his symptoms, including hair loss and systemic effects.\n\n9. **Disseminated Mycobacterial Infection** - In someone with untreated HIV, mycobacterial infections can disseminate and cause a range of symptoms, including skin rashes and systemic illness.\n\n10. **Kaposi's Sarcoma** - Although typically presenting with more distinctive lesions, Kaposi's sarcoma is a possibility in an HIV-positive patient and can cause skin changes.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Untreated HIV with Possible Opportunistic Infection (Pneumocystis Pneumonia)**\n2. **Infective Endocarditis**\n3. **Histoplasmosis**\n4. **Syphilis**\n5. **Disseminated Mycobacterial Infection**\n\nThese conditions take into account the patient's HIV status, substance use history, and presenting symptoms, and should be prioritized for further investigation and management.", "topic": "['Hair Disorders', 'Sexually Transmitted Infections', 'HIV', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Dermatology']"}

Beginning 5 months after her reconstruction, the patient reported point tenderness on the left jaw, facial swelling, and electric pain with severity of 7 out of 10 in the left neck that occurred with talking or eating. Her postoperative course was complicated by osteoradionecrosis post-tracheostomy, plate removal, and left segmental mandibulectomy. She received regular physical therapy and lymphedema therapy and was seen by Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, who treated her with onabotulinum toxin A injections; neither provided significant resolution of her symptoms. Review of a computed tomography scan of the head and neck (Figure 1) performed on follow-up 5 years after initial reconstruction demonstrated a long, hyperdense structure in the left submental, submandibular region with accompanying soft-tissue thickening. On further review of prior imaging, this calcification appeared as a new finding in various scans dating back to 5 months after FFF reconstruction compared with preoperative imaging. There was no fluorodeoxyglucose avidity in the area of question on multiple positron emission tomography scans done during this follow-up window. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Ossification of the free flap pedicle", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 64-year-old woman who's been through quite a bit. She's had surgery for squamous cell carcinoma, and it sounds like her recovery wasn't exactly smooth. She's dealing with some pretty intense pain in her neck, and it's been going on for a while. It's sharp and shooting, and it gets worse when she talks or eats. That's got to be really tough.\n\nNow, she's got a history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, HIV, and coronary artery disease. That's a lot to consider. And then there's the surgery and the radiotherapy. I bet all of that could be playing a role in her current symptoms.\n\nLet's see, the CT scan shows a long, hyperdense structure in her neck. That sounds like calcification. And it's new, compared to her preoperative scans. But there's no sign of cancer on the PET scans, so that's a relief. It's not showing any metabolic activity, which is good.\n\nSo, what could be causing this pain? My first thought is neuroma. It's possible that the surgery caused some nerve damage, and now there's a neuroma causing her pain. That would make sense, given her symptoms and history.\n\nBut wait, there's also the possibility of osteoradionecrosis. She did have that issue before, and it can cause a lot of pain and tissue damage. But usually, you'd expect some signs of necrosis on the scans, and I don't think that's mentioned here.\n\nWhat about a vascular issue, like a carotid artery problem? That could cause neck pain, especially if there's any kind of narrowing or blockage. But would that explain the calcification? I'm not so sure.\n\nAnd then there's the idea of a sialolith, a salivary stone. That could definitely cause pain, especially if it's in the submandibular gland. The calcification on the scan could fit with that. It's worth considering.\n\nBut let's not forget about the possibility of a benign tumor, like a pleomorphic adenoma. Those can occur in the salivary glands and might explain the calcification. They can also cause pain, especially if they're pressing on nerves.\n\nNow, what about a branchial cleft cyst? Those can cause pain and swelling in the neck, and they might show up as a calcified structure on a scan. It's a possibility, but it seems a bit less likely given her age and history.\n\nOh, and there's the chance of a calcified lymph node. That could happen after surgery and radiation, and it might explain the calcification. But would it cause this level of pain? I'm not convinced.\n\nLet's not forget about the possibility of a nerve entrapment syndrome. After surgery, nerves can get trapped or compressed, leading to pain. That could definitely be what's happening here.\n\nFinally, there's the idea of heterotopic ossification. That's when bone forms in soft tissue, and it can happen after trauma or surgery. It might explain the calcification and the pain. It's a bit unusual, but it fits the situation.\n\nSo, after thinking through all of this, I'm leaning towards a neuroma as the most likely cause of her pain. It fits her symptoms and history well. But I'm also considering heterotopic ossification as a strong possibility. The calcification and her surgical history make it a plausible explanation. I think these two are the most likely options.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's symptoms, with each step presenting a unique potential diagnosis:\n\n1. **Neuroma** - Given the patient's surgical history and the nature of her pain, a neuroma could have developed, causing the sharp, shooting pain in her neck.\n\n2. **Osteoradionecrosis** - Although previously addressed, this condition could still be contributing to her pain, especially given her history of radiation treatment.\n\n3. **Carotid Artery Disease** - A vascular issue, such as carotid artery stenosis, could cause neck pain, but it's less likely to explain the calcification seen on the CT scan.\n\n4. **Sialolithiasis** - A salivary stone could cause pain, especially if located in the submandibular gland, and could correspond to the calcification observed.\n\n5. **Pleomorphic Adenoma** - A benign tumor in the salivary gland could explain the calcification and contribute to her pain if it's pressing on nerves.\n\n6. **Branchial Cleft Cyst** - While less likely given her age and history, a branchial cleft cyst could cause pain and swelling in the neck and appear as a calcified structure.\n\n7. **Calcified Lymph Node** - Post-surgical and post-radiation changes could lead to a calcified lymph node, but it's less likely to cause significant pain.\n\n8. **Nerve Entrapment Syndrome** - After surgery, nerve entrapment could lead to the pain she's experiencing, especially if nerves are compressed or irritated.\n\n9. **Heterotopic Ossification** - This condition, where bone forms in soft tissue, could explain the calcification and her symptoms, especially given her surgical history.\n\n10. **Chronic Infection** - A chronic infection in the surgical site could cause ongoing pain and might lead to calcification over time.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top two most likely diagnoses are **Neuroma** and **Heterotopic Ossification**, as they both align well with the patient's symptoms, history, and imaging findings.", "topic": "['Facial Plastic Surgery', 'Otolaryngology', 'Head and Neck Reconstruction', 'Pain Medicine', 'Radiation Oncology']"}

The patient had received 4 cycles of chemotherapy with carboplatin, pemetrexed, and pembrolizumab for progressive disease and was currently in maintenance with pemetrexed-pembrolizumab. The edema appeared 5 days after the patient’s 8th cycle of chemotherapy and evolved into sclerotic plaques. Physical examination revealed ill-defined, erythematoedematous plaques symmetrically distributed along the shins, with areas of induration (Figure, A). The patient remained afebrile and systemically well. Results of laboratory tests showed no elevation of inflammatory markers (normal white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level), with kidney, liver, and heart functions within the normal ranges. Results of venous Doppler ultrasonography imaging of the patient’s legs did not show evidence of deep vein thrombosis. A biopsy specimen was obtained for histopathologic analysis (Figure, B and C). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Pemetrexed-induced inflammatory and sclerotic edema", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a man in his late 70s with lung cancer, and he's been through quite a bit of chemotherapy. Now, he's dealing with redness, pain, and swelling in both of his lower legs. That sounds pretty uncomfortable. The fact that it showed up 5 days after his last chemo session is interesting. Could it be related to the treatment?\n\nFirst, I should consider what's common with these symptoms. Bilateral leg swelling could be from something like deep vein thrombosis, but the ultrasound didn't show any clots. That's a relief, but it means we need to look elsewhere.\n\nThe timing is a big clue. It started after chemotherapy, so maybe it's a reaction to the drugs. Pembrolizumab is an immunotherapy, and it can cause all sorts of immune-related side effects. Could this be one of them?\n\nThe lack of fever or systemic illness is intriguing. If it were an infection, I'd expect some inflammatory markers to be high, but they're not. So, infection seems unlikely.\n\nThe skin changes are pretty distinct—red, painful, and then turning into hard plaques. That's not typical for most conditions. I should think about what could cause this kind of skin reaction.\n\nErythema nodosum comes to mind. It's known for painful red nodules, often on the shins, and can be triggered by medications or infections. But usually, there's some sign of systemic inflammation, which is missing here.\n\nWhat about panniculitis? That's an inflammation of the fat under the skin, which could explain the induration. It can be caused by medications too. This might fit, especially since there's no fever or elevated inflammatory markers.\n\nI should also consider other skin reactions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome, but that usually involves more widespread skin detachment and systemic symptoms, which aren't present here.\n\nThe biopsy will be key. If it shows septal panniculitis, that would point towards erythema nodosum. But if it's lobular, that might suggest something else, like a reaction to pembrolizumab.\n\nGiven the chemotherapy connection, I should think about other drug-related possibilities. Pembrolizumab could cause an immune-related reaction, maybe even something like Sweet's syndrome, which involves painful skin lesions.\n\nSweet's syndrome often has systemic symptoms, but there are cases without. The timing after chemotherapy fits, and it could explain the skin findings.\n\nNow, let's not forget about other potential causes. Could it be a paraneoplastic syndrome related to the lung cancer? Those can cause all sorts of skin changes.\n\nOr maybe it's a vascular issue, like livedo reticularis. That's more of a blood vessel problem and could cause similar skin appearances.\n\nBut wait, the biopsy is crucial. If it shows a specific pattern, that could steer us towards the right diagnosis.\n\nAfter considering everything, I think Sweet's syndrome makes sense. It's related to the chemotherapy, matches the timing, and explains the symptoms without needing systemic inflammation.\n\nSo, my final response is: Sweet's syndrome.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnoses for the man's symptoms are as follows:\n\n1. **Erythema Nodosum** - Characterized by painful red nodules, often on the shins, and can be triggered by medications or infections.\n2. **Panniculitis** - Inflammation of the subcutaneous fat, which can be caused by medications and fits the description of indurated plaques without systemic inflammation.\n3. **Sweet's Syndrome** - An immune-related reaction that can cause painful skin lesions, especially in the context of chemotherapy.\n4. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome** - Although typically involves more widespread skin detachment and systemic symptoms, it's a consideration in severe skin reactions.\n5. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - Skin changes related to underlying malignancy, which could explain the symptoms in a patient with lung cancer.\n6. **Livedo Reticularis** - A vascular issue causing a mottled, purplish discoloration of the skin, which might resemble the described plaques.\n7. **Drug-Induced Vasculitis** - A reaction to chemotherapy causing inflammation of blood vessels and skin changes.\n8. **Cellulitis** - A bacterial skin infection, although the lack of systemic symptoms and negative inflammatory markers make this less likely.\n9. **Deep Vein Thrombosis** - Although ruled out by ultrasound, it's a common cause of leg swelling and pain.\n10. **Lipodermatosclerosis** - Chronic inflammation of the subcutaneous fat, leading to skin induration and changes.\n\nAfter considering all the information, including the timing after chemotherapy and the biopsy results, Sweet's syndrome emerges as the most likely diagnosis.

He had also experienced a burning sensation on the right side of his face, but denied headache, shoulder, or jaw pain and visual disturbance. Neurological examination revealed hypoesthesia of the right side of the face, while cold-warm sensation and motor function were intact. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 82 mm per hour (normal value, less than 15 mm per hour) and the serum C–reactive protein concentration was 107 mg/L (normal value, less than 5 mg/L). Chest radiography showed bilateral perihilar infiltrates consistent with pneumonia. About 2 weeks before the ulcerations developed, the patient had been admitted to the hospital for unstable angina, and coronary angiography was performed. Immediately after the angiography, the patient developed left-sided hemiplegia and hemianopsia. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed an extensive ischemic posterior circulation stroke involving the right occipital lobe, lower cerebellar peduncle, and pontomedullary boundary (Figure, B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Trigeminal trophic syndrome", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 66-year-old man with these progressive ulcers on the right side of his face. That's been going on for a few months now. He's also feeling a burning sensation there, but no headaches or any pain in the shoulders or jaw. That's interesting. And he's got some numbness on that side of his face, but he can still move and feel temperature normally. \n\nNow, let's look at those lab results. His ESR is really high at 82, and CRP is also up at 107. Those are big red flags for inflammation. And the chest X-ray shows bilateral perihilar infiltrates, which could mean pneumonia. \n\nOh, and there's that recent hospital stay for unstable angina. He had a coronary angiography, and then boom, he developed left-sided weakness and vision problems. That's a big clue. The MRI shows a stroke in the posterior circulation, affecting the right occipital lobe and other areas. \n\nSo, what could be going on here? Let's start with the skin issues. With those ulcers and the burning, I'm thinking about conditions like erythema multiforme or maybe even Sweet's syndrome. They can cause skin reactions like this. \n\nBut wait, there's more. The high ESR and CRP point to something inflammatory. Could it be temporal arteritis? That's known for causing inflammation and can lead to strokes. \n\nAnd the pneumonia is a twist. It could be related to the stroke, maybe due to aspiration. But it also makes me think about infections like tuberculosis, which can cause systemic symptoms. \n\nNow, let's not forget the neurological angle. The stroke and the skin symptoms could be linked. CNS vasculitis comes to mind. It can cause both strokes and skin issues. \n\nBut what about the recent angiography? That's a procedure that can cause embolic events. Could this be a case of procedure-related complications? \n\nHmm, let's think about other inflammatory conditions. Polyarteritis nodosa could fit, with its systemic inflammation and potential for skin and neurological involvement. \n\nOh, and there's also the possibility of a paraneoplastic syndrome. Sometimes, cancers can cause strange neurological and skin symptoms. \n\nNow, let's put it all together. Considering the skin ulcers, inflammation, stroke, and pneumonia, I'm leaning towards CNS vasculitis. It ties everything together. \n\nBut wait, let's not rule out other possibilities. Temporal arteritis is still on the table, given the inflammation and stroke. \n\nAnd what about Sweet's syndrome? It could explain the skin lesions and systemic inflammation. \n\nIn the end, after thinking it through, I'm going with CNS vasculitis as the top diagnosis. It just fits best with all the symptoms and test results.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Erythema Multiforme** - This condition can cause skin ulcers and is often associated with infections or other triggers.\n\n2. **Temporal Arteritis** - Given the high ESR and CRP levels, along with the neurological symptoms, temporal arteritis is a strong contender.\n\n3. **Sweet's Syndrome** - This could explain the skin lesions and systemic inflammation.\n\n4. **Central Nervous System (CNS) Vasculitis** - This diagnosis could account for the stroke and skin symptoms, tying the neurological and dermatological findings together.\n\n5. **Polyarteritis Nodosa** - A systemic vasculitis that could involve both skin and neurological systems.\n\n6. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - This could be a consideration given the unusual combination of symptoms.\n\n7. **Tuberculosis** - The pneumonia and systemic symptoms might suggest an infectious process like tuberculosis.\n\n8. **Lupus** - A systemic autoimmune condition that can affect multiple systems, including the skin and nervous system.\n\n9. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis** - This condition can cause a variety of systemic symptoms, including skin lesions and neurological involvement.\n\n10. **Post-Streptococcal Syndrome** - Although less likely, this could be considered if there was a recent streptococcal infection.\n\nAfter considering all the symptoms and test results, **CNS Vasculitis** emerges as the most likely diagnosis, as it effectively links the skin ulcers, high inflammatory markers, stroke, and pneumonia. However, **Temporal Arteritis** and **Sweet's Syndrome** remain strong differential diagnoses due to the inflammation and skin involvement.

There are some endocrine disorders that can affect the eyes.\n\nAnd then there's the hypertension and obesity. Those can contribute to vascular issues, which might lead to something like diabetic retinopathy or even macular degeneration. But the angiography doesn't really support those.\n\nOh, and what about uveitis? That can cause CME too. But there's no sign of inflammation in the exam. Hmm, probably not uveitis then.\n\nLet's not forget about Irvine-Gass syndrome. It's a type of CME that happens after cataract surgery, but he hasn't had that. So, that's not it.\n\nCould it be a vitreomacular issue? Like vitreomacular traction or a macular hole? Those can cause metamorphopsia. But the angiography doesn't show the typical patterns for those.\n\nMaybe it's something more systemic. Like a vascular or hematologic disorder. Those can affect the retina and cause CME.

Considering everything, the most likely cause of his symptoms is cystoid macular edema, probably related to his pterygium surgery. But we can't completely rule out other factors like his endocrine history or vascular issues. It's a complex case, and we should keep an open mind.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with a focus on the key findings and potential causes:\n\n1. **Cystoid Macular Edema (CME)**\n2. **Pseudophakic Cystoid Macular Edema (Irvine-Gass Syndrome)**\n3. **Uveitis**\n4. **Diabetic Retinopathy**\n5. **Age-related Macular Degeneration**\n6. **Vitreomacular Traction**\n7. **Macular Hole**\n8. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy**\n9. **Hypertensive Retinopathy**\n10. **Endocrine-related Macular Edema**\n\nAfter considering all the patient's symptoms, history, and test results, the most likely diagnosis is **Cystoid Macular Edema (CME)**, potentially related to his previous pterygium surgery.

While other conditions like uveitis and diabetic retinopathy could cause similar symptoms, the absence of inflammatory signs and other specific angiographic patterns makes them less likely.

And the pressure in his eyes is a bit high. Hmm, that's something to keep in mind.\n\nHe's got a history of hypertension and obesity, and he's had surgery on his left adrenal gland. That's interesting. Plus, he's had pterygium surgery in his left eye. But he's not using corticosteroids and doesn't have sleep apnea. Okay, let's see what else we've got.\n\nThe Amsler grid test showed some metamorphopsia, which means there's something going on with the macula. But his eye movements and pupil reactions are normal, and he's not reporting any field defects. That's good to know.\n\nNow, the slitlamp exam didn't show anything unusual, and gonioscopy was normal too. So, it's not likely a problem with the anterior segment or the drainage angle.\n\nThe fluorescein angiography is really telling. It shows late pinpoint leakage and mottled hyperfluorescence.

Additionally, 18 months prior to presentation, he also developed arm weakness and hand atrophy followed by leg weakness 1 year later. On examination, dysarthria, bilateral peripheral facial paralysis (Figure, A), reduced facial touch and vibration sensitivity in the mandible, temporal muscle atrophy (Figure, B), and poor soft palate motility were observed. Corneal reflexes were bilaterally absent. Deltoid, calf, and distal muscle atrophy (Figure, C) and weakness (right extensor carpi, Medical Research Council [MRC] grade 0; neck flexion, MRC grade 4; proximal muscles, MRC grade 3; other arm distal muscles, MRC grade 2-3; leg distal muscles, MRC grades 2-4) were observed. Absence of the bilateral biceps and triceps reflexes, right patellar tendon hyperreflexia, discontinuous clonus in the left knee, a Babinski sign present on the right side, and an unstable and steppage gait were also observed. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Facial onset sensory and motor neuronopathy", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 19-year-old guy who's been dealing with some pretty tough symptoms for a few years now. He's had facial numbness for four years, and then things started getting worse with dysarthria and dysphagia kicking in about three years ago. That's a lot to handle. Then, a year and a half ago, he started having weakness in his arms, and now his hands are wasting away. And if that wasn't enough, his legs started getting weak too, about a year after the arm issues began. That's quite a progression.\n\nWhen we examine him, there's a lot going on. He's got trouble speaking, and both sides of his face are paralyzed. He can't feel much sensation in his face, especially around the jaw, and his temporal muscles are wasting away. His soft palate isn't moving well, and he's lost his corneal reflexes. That's a big deal. Plus, his muscles are wasting in his shoulders, calves, and hands, and he's really weak. His neck flexion is pretty weak, and his arm and leg muscles aren't doing much better. He's missing some reflexes in his arms, but his knee reflex on one side is over the top, and he's got this weird clonus thing going on. The Babinski sign is present on one side, which isn't normal, and he's walking with a steppage gait. Wow, that's a lot.\n\nSo, what could be going on here? Let's start with the facial issues. Facial numbness and paralysis make me think of something affecting the cranial nerves, maybe a brainstem problem or a nerve disorder. ALS comes to mind because it can affect both upper and lower motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness and atrophy. But wait, there's also the possibility of a structural issue, like a brain tumor or something in the brainstem.\n\nBut ALS doesn't usually cause facial sensory loss, so maybe we should consider other options. How about Moebius syndrome? It's known for causing facial paralysis, but it usually starts earlier in life and doesn't explain the muscle weakness and atrophy. Hmm, maybe not that.\n\nLet's think about the muscle issues. The atrophy and weakness, combined with absent reflexes in some places and exaggerated ones in others, point to a mixed upper and lower motor neuron problem. That's classic ALS, but we can't ignore other possibilities like spinobulbar muscular atrophy or even a foramen magnum tumor pressing on the brainstem and spinal cord.\n\nOh, and the sensory loss! We can't forget about that. The loss of corneal reflex and facial sensation suggests trigeminal nerve involvement. That could mean a pontine lesion or even a syringomyelia, which is a fluid-filled cavity in the spinal cord that can affect sensation and motor control.\n\nSo, what's the best fit here? ALS is still a strong contender because it explains the mixed motor neuron signs and some of the bulbar symptoms. But the sensory loss is a puzzle piece that doesn't quite fit. Maybe we should think about a brainstem tumor or a structural lesion like syringomyelia that could cause both sensory and motor issues.\n\nIn the end, considering all the symptoms and their progression, I'm leaning towards ALS as the most likely diagnosis. It's not perfect, but it covers most of the symptoms. However, we should definitely keep syringomyelia and a brainstem tumor on our radar because they could also explain what's going on.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the symptoms and examination findings, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 19-year-old man:\n\n1. **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)**: This condition is characterized by mixed upper and lower motor neuron signs, which aligns with the muscle weakness, atrophy, and reflex abnormalities observed.\n\n2. **Syringomyelia**: This could explain the sensory loss, particularly the loss of facial sensation and the absence of corneal reflexes, as well as some motor symptoms due to spinal cord involvement.\n\n3. **Brainstem Tumor**: A tumor in the brainstem could account for the cranial nerve involvement, sensory deficits, and both upper and lower motor neuron signs.\n\n4. **Spinobulbar Muscular Atrophy**: This is another condition that affects motor neurons and could explain some of the bulbar and limb weakness.\n\n5. **Foramen Magnum Tumor**: A tumor at the foramen magnum could compress the brainstem and upper spinal cord, leading to a mix of sensory and motor symptoms.\n\n6. **Moebius Syndrome**: Although it primarily causes facial paralysis, it's worth considering due to the bilateral facial paralysis, though it doesn't explain the full range of symptoms.\n\n7. **Multiple Sclerosis**: This condition can cause a wide range of neurological symptoms, including sensory loss and motor dysfunction, but typically presents with more relapsing-remitting episodes.\n\n8. **Pontine Lesion**: A lesion in the pons could affect the cranial nerves and lead to sensory and motor deficits, but might not fully explain the limb weakness and atrophy.\n\n9. **Basilar Artery Migraine**: This could cause neurological symptoms, but it's less likely to result in the chronic and progressive symptoms seen here.\n\n10. **Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation (NBIA)**: This is a group of disorders that can cause progressive neurological impairment, but it often includes other symptoms like dystonia.\n\nAfter considering all the symptoms and their progression, ALS remains the most likely diagnosis due to the combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs and bulbar involvement. However, syringomyelia and a brainstem tumor are also strong contenders given the sensory loss and cranial nerve involvement. Further diagnostic testing, such as imaging and electrophysiological studies, would be essential to confirm the diagnosis.", "topic": "['Neurology', 'Swallowing and Dysphagia', 'Facial Nerve']"}

She had a history of high myopia (approximately 9 diopters [D] OD; 8 D OS). Examination revealed an otherwise normal left eye with 20/20 best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). The right eye demonstrated a BCVA of 20/25 and normal anterior segment, including lenticular examination. Dilated fundus examination showed wrinkling of the neurosensory retina at the fovea (Figure 1A) without posterior vitreous detachment. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography revealed hyperreflective layering on the foveal surface consistent with epiretinal membrane, as well as splitting of the outer plexiform layer with hyporeflective cavities (Figure 1B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Foveal retinoschisis with epiretinal membrane in the setting of pathologic myopia", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her 50s who's dealing with some blurred vision and a bit of metamorphopsia in her right eye. She's got a history of high myopia, which is pretty significant, about 9 diopters in the right eye and 8 in the left. That's something to keep in mind.\n\nFirst off, the blurred vision and metamorphopsia make me think of something going on with the retina. Epiretinal membrane is a common culprit here, especially with the wrinkling of the retina that was seen during the exam.\n\nBut wait, there's more to consider. The OCT shows some interesting things. There's this hyperreflective layer on the foveal surface, which really points towards an epiretinal membrane. But there's also this splitting of the outer plexiform layer with these hyporeflective cavities. That's a bit unusual and could mean something else is happening too.\n\nHigh myopia can lead to a bunch of retinal issues. Myopic traction maculopathy comes to mind. It's when the retina gets pulled and distorted because of the shape of the eye. That could explain some of the OCT findings.\n\nBut let's not jump to conclusions. The lack of posterior vitreous detachment is interesting. Usually, with epiretinal membrane, you'd expect the vitreous to be detached, but it's not here. So, maybe we're looking at something a bit different.\n\nCould it be vitreomacular traction? That's when the vitreous is still attached and pulling on the retina. It could cause some of the symptoms and findings we're seeing.\n\nOh, and what about macular hole? That's another possibility with the distorted vision and OCT findings. But usually, a macular hole would have more pronounced symptoms and a distinctive appearance on OCT.\n\nLet's not forget about myopic foveoschisis. That's when the retina splits in highly myopic eyes. It could explain the splitting seen in the outer plexiform layer on the OCT.\n\nAlso, central serous chorioretinopathy could be a contender. It causes fluid buildup under the retina, leading to blurred vision. But we don't see any significant fluid on the OCT, so maybe that's less likely.\n\nAnd then there's age-related macular degeneration. It's a common cause of vision changes in this age group, but we don't see the typical drusen or fluid that you'd expect with AMD.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Initially, epiretinal membrane seemed like the top suspect, but the more I think about it, myopic traction maculopathy fits the picture better. The high myopia and OCT findings align well with this diagnosis.\n\nBut wait, let's reconsider vitreomacular traction. The attached vitreous and the traction could explain the wrinkling and the hyporeflective cavities on OCT. It's a strong contender.\n\nAfter going back and forth, I think vitreomacular traction is the most likely diagnosis. It ties together the symptoms, the exam findings, and the OCT results in a way that makes sense.\n\nSo, in the end, I'm going with vitreomacular traction as the top differential diagnosis.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Epiretinal Membrane** - This is a common cause of metamorphopsia and blurred vision, especially with the observed retinal wrinkling.\n\n2. **Vitreomacular Traction** - The attached vitreous and resulting traction could explain the retinal changes and symptoms.\n\n3. **Myopic Traction Maculopathy** - High myopia can lead to retinal distortion and changes seen on OCT.\n\n4. **Myopic Foveoschisis** - Retinal splitting in highly myopic eyes could explain the outer plexiform layer changes.\n\n5. **Macular Hole** - Although less likely, it's a possibility given the distorted vision and OCT findings.\n\n6. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy** - Fluid buildup under the retina could cause blurred vision, but significant fluid is absent on OCT.\n\n7. **Age-related Macular Degeneration** - A common cause of vision changes, but typical features like drusen are not present.\n\n8. **Cystoid Macular Edema** - Could cause vision changes, but would typically show more fluid on OCT.\n\n9. **Posterior Vitreous Detachment** - Although not present, it's often associated with these symptoms and should be considered.\n\n10. **Lattice Degeneration** - Associated with myopia and can lead to retinal changes, but less directly linked to symptoms.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Vitreomacular Traction** emerges as the most likely diagnosis, as it accounts for the attached vitreous, retinal wrinkling, and OCT findings in a cohesive manner.", "topic": "['Ophthalmology', 'Macular Diseases', 'Retinal Disorders']"}

Results of a slitlamp examination showed iris neovascularization and posterior subcapsular cataract in the right eye and no anterior segment abnormalities, including no iris neovascularization, in the left eye. Intraocular pressure was 60 mm Hg in the right eye and 14 mm Hg in the left eye. The fundus in the right eye (Figure, A) showed a total retinal detachment with hemorrhagic prepapillary fibrosis reaching up to the posterior capsule; the left eye (Figure, B) showed peripapillary tractional retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy, retinal neovascularization, and vitreous hemorrhage. Fluorescein angiography showed extensive retinal capillary and arteriolar nonperfusion and peripapillary neovascularization in both eyes. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy–associated proliferative retinal vasculopathy", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 28-year-old guy with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and he's having some serious vision problems. Both eyes are affected, but not in the same way. The right eye is really bad, with vision reduced to just light perception, while the left is a bit better, but still not great. \n\nFirst off, the right eye has a high intraocular pressure of 60 mm Hg. That's really high and suggests something like neovascular glaucoma. This condition often happens when there's a lot of abnormal blood vessel growth on the iris, which fits with the iris neovascularization we're seeing. \n\nNow, let's think about what could be causing this. Diabetic retinopathy jumps to mind because it's known for causing neovascularization and retinal detachment. But wait, there's no mention of diabetes here. Still, the pattern of retinal capillary nonperfusion and neovascularization is pretty similar. \n\nThe left eye is different. It has a normal intraocular pressure, so no glaucoma there, but it does have a tractional retinal detachment. This kind of detachment is often due to proliferative vitreoretinopathy, which can happen after chronic retinal detachment. \n\nOkay, so what's the common thread here? Both eyes have retinal neovascularization and nonperfusion. This suggests a severe underlying retinal vascular issue. \n\nConsidering the patient's Duchenne muscular dystrophy, could this be related? DMD is known to cause myopia and some retinal issues, but not typically this kind of severe retinal vascular disease. \n\nHmm, let's think about other conditions that could cause these symptoms. Sickle cell disease can cause similar retinal problems, including neovascularization and detachment. But there's no mention of sickle cell here, so it's a stretch. \n\nEale's disease is another possibility. It's a rare condition that causes retinal neovascularization and vitreous hemorrhage in young adults. It fits the age and symptoms pretty well. \n\nBut wait, let's not forget about diabetic retinopathy. Even without a history of diabetes, it could still be a factor, especially with the severe retinal changes we're seeing. \n\nSo, where does that leave us? We've got a few possibilities. Diabetic retinopathy is still high on the list, given the retinal findings. Eale's disease is a strong contender too, given the patient's age and symptoms. \n\nAnd then there's the possibility of a genetic retinal vascular disorder, considering the patient's DMD. This could be something rare that's linked to his muscular dystrophy. \n\nIn the end, I think we're looking at a combination of factors. The retinal vascular disease is likely related to his DMD, with features similar to diabetic retinopathy. But Eale's disease can't be ruled out either. It's a complex situation, and we need to consider all these possibilities.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, considering the symptoms and test results:\n\n1. **Neovascular Glaucoma** - This is suggested by the high intraocular pressure and iris neovascularization in the right eye.\n\n2. **Diabetic Retinopathy** - Although there's no mention of diabetes, the retinal neovascularization and nonperfusion are characteristic of this condition.\n\n3. **Eale's Disease** - A rare condition causing retinal neovascularization and vitreous hemorrhage in young adults, fitting the patient's age and symptoms.\n\n4. **Sickle Cell Retinopathy** - Could cause similar retinal issues, including neovascularization and detachment, but there's no mention of sickle cell disease.\n\n5. **Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy** - Seen in the left eye with tractional retinal detachment, often secondary to chronic retinal issues.\n\n6. **Retinal Detachment** - Total in the right eye and tractional in the left, likely secondary to underlying vascular changes.\n\n7. **Genetic Retinal Vascular Disorder** - Considering the patient's Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a possible underlying genetic factor contributing to retinal vascular disease.\n\n8. **Ocular Ischemic Syndrome** - Could cause neovascularization and retinal vascular occlusion, but typically associated with carotid artery disease.\n\n9. **Incontinentia Pigmenti** - A genetic disorder that can cause retinal neovascularization and detachment, though other systemic features are usually present.\n\n10. **Familial Exudative Vitreoretinopathy** - An inherited disorder causing retinal neovascularization and detachment, which could fit the bilateral nature of the condition.\n\nReranking these based on the patient's information and test results, the top three differential diagnoses would be:\n\n1. **Diabetic Retinopathy** - Despite no diabetes history, the retinal findings are highly suggestive of this condition.\n\n2. **Eale's Disease** - Fits the patient's age and symptoms of retinal neovascularization and vitreous hemorrhage.\n\n3. **Genetic Retinal Vascular Disorder** - Considering the patient's Duchenne muscular dystrophy and the possibility of an underlying genetic contribution to the retinal vascular disease.", "topic": "['Ophthalmology', 'Muscular Dystrophy', 'Neurology', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Retinal Disorders']"}

Oral administration of aspirin and limaprost alfadex was ineffective, and the purpura spread on the palms and feet, followed by onset of left hemiplegia with dysarthria. The patient had no history of arterial or coronary catheterization, hyperlipidemia, hepatitis, nor endocrine neoplasia. The patient’s body temperature and laboratory test results, including inflammatory markers, were slightly elevated. Autoimmune blood tests, including antinuclear antibody, anticardiolipin antibody, and lupus anticoagulant, were not detected. Lentiginosis was not evident. A skin biopsy of the purpura of the left plantar area was conducted (Figure, B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cutaneous embolization of cardiac myxoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a man in his 50s with these painful purpura on his palms and soles. That's pretty unusual, right? And they've been there for a couple of months. Hmm, that's quite persistent. The fact that they're painful makes me think of something inflammatory or vascular-related. \n\nOkay, so the lesions started on his hand and then moved to his foot before spreading. That's interesting. And then, he developed left-sided weakness and difficulty speaking. That's definitely concerning for something neurological. Could there be a link between the skin and neurological symptoms? \n\nLet's see, he's tried aspirin and limaprost, but no luck. Those are for pain and inflammation, so maybe this is something more complex. He doesn't have a history of heart problems or anything that would suggest an embolic source. And no hepatitis or endocrine tumors, which rules out some other possibilities. \n\nHis lab tests show slightly elevated inflammatory markers, but nothing too crazy. And the autoimmune tests are negative, so it's probably not something like lupus. No lentiginosis either, which is good to know. \n\nNow, let's think about the skin biopsy. It's not described here, but in cases like this, we often look for vasculitis or thrombotic patterns. Could it be a type of vasculitis like IgA vasculitis or even something like Degos disease? \n\nGiven the neurological symptoms, I'm also thinking about conditions that affect both the skin and brain. Maybe something like MELAS syndrome, which is a mitochondrial disorder. Or could it be a type of vasculitis that affects the central nervous system, like granulomatosis with polyangiitis? \n\nBut wait, let's not forget about other possibilities. What about infective endocarditis? It can cause embolic phenomena that might explain the neurological symptoms. And those painful purpura could be Janeway lesions or something similar. \n\nOh, and we shouldn't overlook the possibility of a paraneoplastic syndrome. These can present with strange skin and neurological symptoms. Could there be an underlying cancer we haven't found yet? \n\nSo, putting it all together, I think we have a few strong contenders. Infective endocarditis is definitely up there, given the embolic risk and skin findings. Then there's Degos disease, which could explain the skin and neurological symptoms. And let's not forget about vasculitis, like IgA vasculitis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis. \n\nIn the end, I think infective endocarditis makes the most sense, followed closely by Degos disease. Both fit the symptoms, and the lack of clear biopsy findings doesn't rule them out. Yeah, that seems like a reasonable conclusion.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with a focus on painful palmar and plantar purpura and neurological symptoms:\n\n1. **Infective Endocarditis** - This condition can cause embolic phenomena leading to neurological symptoms and painful purpura, such as Janeway lesions.\n\n2. **Degos Disease (Malignant Atrophic Papulosis)** - A rare condition characterized by skin lesions and potential neurological involvement.\n\n3. **IgA Vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein Purpura)** - A type of vasculitis that can cause purpura, neurological symptoms, and elevated inflammatory markers.\n\n4. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegener's Granulomatosis)** - A form of vasculitis that can affect the skin and central nervous system.\n\n5. **MELAS Syndrome (Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes)** - A mitochondrial disorder that can cause stroke-like episodes and skin manifestations.\n\n6. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - A condition related to underlying malignancy that can present with skin and neurological symptoms.\n\n7. **Thromboangiitis Obliterans (Buerger's Disease)** - A condition causing inflammation and thrombosis in small and medium-sized vessels, potentially leading to skin and neurological symptoms.\n\n8. **Polyarteritis Nodosa** - A type of vasculitis affecting medium-sized vessels, which can present with skin lesions and neurological involvement.\n\n9. **Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)** - A condition causing both thrombosis and bleeding, which can lead to purpura and neurological symptoms.\n\n10. **Antiphospholipid Syndrome** - An autoimmune disorder that can cause thrombosis and skin manifestations, including purpura.\n\nAfter considering all the patient's symptoms and test results, the top differential diagnoses are **Infective Endocarditis** and **Degos Disease**, as they both align well with the painful purpura and neurological symptoms. These conditions should be further investigated through appropriate diagnostic tests.", "topic": "['Cardiology', 'Dermatology']"}

She reported recent physical and emotional stress from work and dizziness 2 days prior to presentation. She denied fever or palpitations. Her blood pressure was 84/59 mm Hg. A harmonic, musical systolic murmur was heard at the left third intercostal space. An electrocardiogram (ECG; Figure 1A) showed diffuse ST-segment elevation, most prominently in the anterior precordial leads. Laboratory evaluation revealed elevated levels of troponin (1.33 ng/mL; normal range: ≤0.016 ng/mL [to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1.0]), brain natriuretic peptide (376.5 pg/mL; normal range: ≤18.4 pg/mL [to convert to nanograms per liter, multiply by 1.0]), creatinine phosphokinase (96 U/L; normal range: 41-153 U/L), and D-dimer (0.68 μg/mL; normal range: ≤1.00 μg/mL [to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 5.476]). Echocardiography showed left ventricular (LV) wall-motion abnormalities involving the mid and apical segments and an LV apical mass with protruding features. Noncontrast computed tomography confirmed the high-density LV mass (Figure 1B). Coronary angiography revealed mild to moderate coronary atherosclerosis without obstructive coronary artery disease. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Takotsubo cardiomyopathy complicated by hypotension secondary to LV outflow tract obstruction and LV thrombus", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her early 70s who's come to the emergency room because she's been having trouble breathing when she exerts herself. That's definitely something to pay attention to. She's also been under a lot of stress at work and felt dizzy a couple of days ago. No fever or palpitations, though, which is interesting.\n\nHer blood pressure is quite low at 84/59 mm Hg. That's a red flag. And there's a musical systolic murmur at the left third intercostal space. Hmm, that's not something you hear every day. It makes me think of something like mitral valve prolapse or maybe even aortic stenosis, but let's not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nThe ECG shows diffuse ST-segment elevation, especially in the anterior leads. That's concerning and could mean myocardial ischemia or maybe pericarditis. But wait, the troponin level is really high, which usually points to some kind of heart muscle damage.\n\nNow, let's look at the echocardiogram. It shows wall-motion abnormalities in the mid and apical segments of the left ventricle, and there's an apical mass. That's a big deal. It could be a thrombus or something else. The noncontrast CT confirms this high-density mass, so it's not just an echo artifact.\n\nThe coronary angiography shows mild to moderate atherosclerosis but no obstructive disease. So, it's not your typical coronary artery blockage causing a heart attack. That's a bit puzzling.\n\nOkay, let's think about what this could be. Initially, I thought about acute coronary syndrome, but the lack of obstructive disease makes that less likely. Prinzmetal's angina could be a possibility, but it doesn't quite fit with the mass on the echo.\n\nCould it be a myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries? That's possible, especially with the high troponin. But what about the mass? That's unusual for a typical MI.\n\nMaybe it's Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. That could explain the stress, the wall-motion abnormalities, and the fact that there's no obstructive coronary disease. But the mass is still a mystery.\n\nWhat if it's a left ventricular thrombus? That would explain the mass. It could have formed due to the wall-motion abnormalities from some kind of stress-induced cardiomyopathy.\n\nBut wait, let's not forget about the musical murmur. That could be related to the mitral valve, maybe mitral valve prolapse or even papillary muscle dysfunction causing mitral regurgitation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the most likely diagnosis is Takotsubo cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular thrombus. The stress at work could have triggered the cardiomyopathy, leading to the wall-motion abnormalities and the formation of a thrombus. The musical murmur might be from mitral regurgitation due to papillary muscle dysfunction. Yeah, that seems to fit all the pieces of the puzzle.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Acute Coronary Syndrome** - Given the exertional dyspnea, low blood pressure, and elevated troponin levels, this is an initial consideration despite the non-obstructive coronary arteries found in angiography.\n\n2. **Prinzmetal's Angina** - This condition involves coronary vasospasm, which could explain the symptoms and ECG findings without obstructive disease.\n\n3. **Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy** - The recent emotional and physical stress, along with the wall-motion abnormalities and absence of obstructive coronary disease, make this a strong contender.\n\n4. **Myocardial Infarction with Non-Obstructive Coronary Arteries (MINOCA)** - This could explain the elevated troponin and ECG changes, even without significant blockages.\n\n5. **Left Ventricular Thrombus** - The echocardiogram and CT findings of an apical mass suggest a thrombus, possibly secondary to wall-motion abnormalities.\n\n6. **Mitral Valve Prolapse** - The musical systolic murmur could be related to mitral valve issues, potentially causing mitral regurgitation.\n\n7. **Papillary Muscle Dysfunction** - This could lead to mitral regurgitation and the characteristic murmur, especially if related to ischemic events.\n\n8. **Apical Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy** - The location and nature of the mass could suggest a hypertrophic variant, though typically this would have different ECG findings.\n\n9. **Cardiac Tumor (e.g., Fibroma or Rhabdomyoma)** - Although less likely, the mass could be a primary cardiac tumor, which might explain the imaging findings.\n\n10. **Stress-Induced Cardiomyopathy with Thrombus Formation** - This combines the ideas of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy with the development of a thrombus due to wall-motion abnormalities.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the most likely diagnosis is **Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy with Left Ventricular Thrombus Formation**. The recent stress, wall-motion abnormalities, and absence of obstructive coronary disease align well with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, while the apical mass is likely a thrombus formed secondary to the cardiomyopathy. The musical murmur could be due to mitral regurgitation from papillary muscle dysfunction. This diagnosis integrates the key findings and provides a coherent explanation for the patient's symptoms and test results.", "topic": "['Cardiology']"}

He had been well until 1 month prior, when he developed lower limb weakness after eating a vegetarian diet for 15 days. His medical and family histories were unremarkable. His walking had become unsteady, and he was less talkative. On examination, he scored 24 on a Mini-Mental State Examination, with impairments in temporal and spatial orientation, calculation, and short-term memory. Horizontal nystagmus was observed. His lower limb strength was 4 of 5 proximally and 5− of 5 distally, with increased muscle tone. Patellar reflexes were brisk. Ankle clonus and Babinski signs were present bilaterally. His gait was spastic (Video). Blood test results indicated normocytic anemia (hemoglobin level, 126 g/L; reference, >130 g/L [to convert to grams per deciliter, multiply by 0.1]), borderline folate elevation (2.15 ng/mL; reference, >2 μg/L [to convert nanomoles per liter, multiply by 2.266]), and an increased homocysteine level (8.85 mg/L; reference, <2.03 mg/L [to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 7.397]). Results of stool analysis; liver and kidney function tests; myocardial enzyme, electrolyte, ammonia, trace element, and B12 levels; thyroid function, arterial blood gas, antinuclear antibodies, and intrinsic factor antibody tests; and an infection panel test were unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging showed mild cerebral atrophy and a hyperintense T2-weighted signal in the cervical spinal cord. Electromyography results were normal. Electroencephalography showed diffuse background slowing with scattered epileptiform discharges. Urine organic acid analysis indicated methylmalonic acidemia. A serum amino acid analysis was nondiagnostic (Figure 1). Cerebrospinal fluid was normal. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cobalamin C deficiency", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 13-year-old boy who's suddenly having trouble walking and seems less chatty than usual. That's a bit concerning. He's also got some cognitive issues, like problems with orientation and memory. And there's this nystagmus thing going on, which is unusual. \n\nNow, his blood tests show normocytic anemia and a high homocysteine level. Hmm, that's interesting. Elevated homocysteine can point to a few things, like vitamin B12 deficiency or some metabolic issue. \n\nThe MRI shows some cerebral atrophy and a signal change in the spinal cord. That's definitely something to consider. It suggests there's something neurological going on. \n\nOh, and the urine test shows methylmalonic acidemia. That's a big clue. Methylmalonic acidemia usually means there's a problem with vitamin B12 metabolism. \n\nSo, what could be causing this? Vitamin B12 deficiency jumps out as a possibility. It can cause neurological symptoms and the lab findings we're seeing. \n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. Could it be something else, like folate deficiency? That can cause anemia and neurological issues too. But the methylmalonic acidemia doesn't quite fit with folate deficiency. \n\nHow about a metabolic disorder, like homocystinuria? That can cause elevated homocysteine levels and neurological problems. But usually, there are other signs, like marfanoid features, which aren't mentioned here. \n\nThere's also the possibility of a hereditary spastic paraplegia. That could explain the spastic gait and neurological findings. But it doesn't explain the methylmalonic acidemia. \n\nHmm, what about a diet-related issue? The boy had been on a vegetarian diet for a while. That could lead to vitamin B12 deficiency, which matches the symptoms and test results. \n\nLet's think about other possibilities, like multiple sclerosis or another demyelinating disease. They can cause similar neurological symptoms. But the methylmalonic acidemia doesn't really fit. \n\nOh, and there's adrenoleukodystrophy. It can cause neurological symptoms and changes on MRI. But it doesn't explain the methylmalonic acidemia. \n\nSo, after considering all of this, vitamin B12 deficiency seems like the most likely cause. It ties together the neurological symptoms, the blood test abnormalities, and the methylmalonic acidemia. \n\nBut wait, let's not forget about the possibility of an inherited disorder, like a transport issue with vitamin B12. That could explain the symptoms and test results too. \n\nIn the end, I think vitamin B12 deficiency, likely from the vegetarian diet, is the best fit. But we should also consider inherited vitamin B12 transport disorders as a possibility.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 13-year-old boy's condition, with a focus on one new hypothesis per step:\n\n1. **Vitamin B12 Deficiency** - This is a strong contender given the neurological symptoms, normocytic anemia, elevated homocysteine levels, and methylmalonic acidemia.\n\n2. **Folate Deficiency** - Although it can cause anemia and neurological issues, it doesn't typically result in methylmalonic acidemia, making it less likely.\n\n3. **Homocystinuria** - This metabolic disorder can cause elevated homocysteine and neurological problems, but it usually presents with other features like marfanoid habitus, which are not mentioned.\n\n4. **Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia** - This could explain the spastic gait and neurological findings but doesn't account for the methylmalonic acidemia.\n\n5. **Diet-Related Vitamin B12 Deficiency** - The recent vegetarian diet could have led to vitamin B12 deficiency, aligning with the symptoms and test results.\n\n6. **Multiple Sclerosis** - This demyelinating disease can cause similar neurological symptoms but doesn't typically cause methylmalonic acidemia.\n\n7. **Adrenoleukodystrophy** - It can cause neurological symptoms and MRI changes but doesn't explain the methylmalonic acidemia.\n\n8. **Inherited Vitamin B12 Transport Disorder** - This could explain the symptoms and test results, including methylmalonic acidemia, due to a problem with vitamin B12 metabolism.\n\n9. **Cobalamin A or B Defect** - These are specific defects in vitamin B12 metabolism that could lead to methylmalonic acidemia and neurological symptoms.\n\n10. **Nitrous Oxide-Induced Vitamin B12 Deficiency** - Although less likely without a history of nitrous oxide exposure, it can inactivate vitamin B12 and lead to similar symptoms.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Vitamin B12 Deficiency** (likely due to dietary factors)\n2. **Inherited Vitamin B12 Transport Disorder**\n3. **Cobalamin A or B Defect**\n\nThese options best explain the combination of neurological symptoms, blood test abnormalities, and methylmalonic acidemia.", "topic": "['Neurology', 'Pediatrics']"}

The patient had been evaluated by his primary care clinician and was referred to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation. On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/70 OD and 20/20 OS. Test results of intraocular pressures, ocular motility, and pupillary reactions were normal. Confrontation visual fields showed inferonasal and central defects in the right eye. External examination revealed a macular rash of the scalp and all 4 extremities, including the soles and palms (Figure 1A). Anterior segment examination was normal. Posterior segment examination revealed irregular, gray-white pigmentation of the temporal macula of the right eye without vitritis, optic nerve edema, or vasculitis (Figure 1B).

We've got a 37-year-old guy who's suddenly having trouble seeing out of his right eye. It's been going on for about a week, and he's noticing a blind spot that's getting worse. That's pretty concerning.\n\nNow, he mentioned that he and his kids were feeling under the weather a couple of weeks ago. They all had some kind of rash, along with a bit of fever and just feeling meh. That's interesting. Could be something viral?\n\nHe works in the military, so maybe he's been exposed to something unusual. But he says he hasn't traveled anywhere exotic or gotten any new vaccines, and no tick bites either. So, probably not something like Lyme disease.\n\nWhen the doctor checked his eyes, his right eye's vision was pretty bad, 20/70, while the left was perfect. The eye movements and pupil reactions were normal, which is good. But the visual field test showed some defects in the right eye.\n\nOh, and there's a rash. It's on his scalp and all over his limbs, even the palms and soles. That's a bit unusual. Makes me think of something systemic, maybe a viral infection or an autoimmune issue.\n\nLooking at the back of the eye, there's this weird gray-white pigmentation in the macula. No vitritis or swelling of the optic nerve, which is a relief. The OCT scan shows some disruption in the retina, and the angiography highlights some late staining. All signs are pointing to something affecting the retinal pigment epithelium.\n\nSo, what could this be? Let's start with the obvious. Acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN) comes to mind. It fits the sudden vision loss and the changes seen on the OCT.\n\nBut wait, there's also that rash. AMN doesn't usually come with a rash, so maybe we should consider something else. Viral infections can cause a rash and eye problems. How about rubella? It's known for causing a rash and can lead to eye issues like this.\n\nThen there's syphilis. It can cause all sorts of skin and eye problems, and it's not uncommon in certain populations. The rash on the palms and soles is a big hint towards syphilis.\n\nBut syphilis usually has more widespread retinal changes. What we're seeing is more localized. Hmm, maybe it's not syphilis after all.\n\nAPMPPE is another possibility. It can cause sudden vision changes and has a distinctive appearance on exam. But it usually involves both eyes, and this guy's left eye is fine.\n\nLet's not forget about West Nile virus. It can cause eye problems and a rash, but it's more common in certain areas and usually comes with more systemic symptoms.\n\nOh, and there's also this condition called MEWDS. It causes sudden vision loss and has specific OCT findings. But it's more common in young women, so maybe it's not the best fit here.\n\nNow, let's think about sarcoidosis. It can cause skin and eye issues, but we'd usually see more signs like vitritis or optic nerve problems, which aren't present here.\n\nWhat about tuberculosis? It can cause eye problems and a rash, but it's usually more chronic and comes with other symptoms like coughing.\n\nIn the end, considering the rash and the specific eye findings, syphilis seems like a strong contender. Even though the retinal changes aren't exactly what we'd expect, the skin findings are a big clue.\n\nSo, after going through everything, syphilis is still at the top of the list. But we shouldn't completely rule out the other possibilities without doing some tests to confirm.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with a focus on the key symptoms and findings:\n\n1. **Acute Macular Neuroretinopathy (AMN)** - This condition is characterized by sudden vision loss and specific OCT findings, which align with the patient's symptoms.\n\n2. **Syphilis** - The presence of a rash on the palms and soles, along with ocular involvement, makes syphilis a strong consideration.\n\n3. **Rubella** - Given the history of a rash and ocular symptoms, rubella is a possible viral infection that could explain the findings.\n\n4. **APMPPE (Acute Posterior Multifocal Placoid Pigment Epitheliopathy)** - This condition can cause sudden vision changes and has distinctive retinal findings, although it typically affects both eyes.\n\n5. **West Nile Virus** - This viral infection can cause a rash and ocular symptoms, but is more common in specific geographic areas and often presents with more systemic symptoms.\n\n6. **MEWDS (Multiple Evanescent White Dot Syndrome)** - Characterized by sudden vision loss and specific OCT findings, MEWDS is a possibility, although it's more common in young women.\n\n7. **Sarcoidosis** - This condition can cause skin and eye issues, but usually presents with additional signs like vitritis or optic nerve involvement.\n\n8. **Tuberculosis** - While it can cause ocular and skin manifestations, tuberculosis typically presents with a more chronic course and respiratory symptoms.\n\n9. **Lyme Disease** - Although the patient denies tick bites, Lyme disease can cause a rash and ocular symptoms, especially in endemic areas.\n\n10. **Viral Retinitis** - Various viral infections can cause retinal changes and a rash, and should be considered in the differential diagnosis.\n\nAfter considering all the information, syphilis remains a strong contender due to the characteristic rash and ocular findings.

She did not report any other immediate postoperative complications. For 4 weeks before presentation, she had blurred vision of the right eye. Her visual acuity was 20/50 OD and 20/25 OS. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 31 mm Hg in the right eye and 17 mm Hg in the left. The pupillary reflex could not be visualized secondary to the iris implants. Slitlamp examination revealed trace anterior chamber cell bilaterally with pigmented keratic precipitates. The implants were overlying the iris structures (Figure 1A).

We've got a 34-year-old woman who's been dealing with photophobia in both eyes. That's quite uncomfortable. She had these cosmetic iris implants put in six months ago while she was abroad. Hmm, that's interesting. Those implants are supposed to change the appearance of the iris, but they can cause issues. \n\nNow, she's experiencing blurred vision in her right eye for the past four weeks. That's a significant change. Her visual acuity is 20/50 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left. That's a noticeable difference between the two eyes. And the intraocular pressure is 31 mm Hg in the right eye, which is pretty high, while the left eye is at 17 mm Hg, a more normal range. High IOP can be a sign of glaucoma, so that's something to consider. \n\nDuring the slit-lamp exam, there's trace anterior chamber cell and pigmented keratic precipitates in both eyes. That suggests some inflammation going on. The implants are covering the iris structures, which makes it hard to see what's going on in the back of the eye. That's a bit concerning because it limits our ability to check for other issues. \n\nOkay, so what could be going on here? Let's start with the obvious. The high IOP and blurred vision make me think of glaucoma. It's a common issue with high pressure like that. But wait, there's also the inflammation. That could be uveitis, especially with the keratic precipitates. Uveitis can cause photophobia and blurred vision too. \n\nBut we can't ignore the implants. They could be causing mechanical irritation, leading to the inflammation we're seeing. That might explain the anterior chamber cells and the pressure issues. \n\nOh, and there's the possibility of an infection. The inflammation could be due to an infectious process, like endophthalmitis. That's serious and needs to be considered, especially with a foreign body like an implant. \n\nAlso, let's not forget about lens-related issues. The implants might be causing some kind of lens damage or displacement. That could lead to the symptoms she's experiencing. \n\nAnd what about vitreous problems? The implants could be affecting the vitreous body, leading to traction or detachment. That would explain some of the vision issues. \n\nNow, considering the implants again, they might be causing pupil block. That could lead to angle-closure glaucoma, which fits with the high IOP and vision changes. \n\nThere's also the chance of retinal detachment. The implants could be causing traction on the retina, leading to a detachment. That's serious and would explain the sudden change in vision. \n\nFinally, let's think about chronic inflammation. The implants could be causing ongoing inflammation, leading to chronic uveitis. That would explain the persistent photophobia and vision issues. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top differential diagnosis is glaucoma, given the high IOP and vision changes. But we can't ignore the possibility of uveitis, mechanical irritation from the implants, and the risk of infection or lens damage. Those are all strong contenders based on what we're seeing.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Glaucoma** - The high intraocular pressure in the right eye is a significant indicator of glaucoma, which can lead to vision changes and photophobia.\n\n2. **Uveitis** - The presence of anterior chamber cells and pigmented keratic precipitates suggests inflammation, which is characteristic of uveitis and can cause photophobia and blurred vision.\n\n3. **Mechanical Irritation from Implants** - The cosmetic iris implants could be causing physical irritation, leading to inflammation and pressure changes in the eye.\n\n4. **Endophthalmitis** - The inflammation and presence of a foreign body (the implant) raise the possibility of an infectious process like endophthalmitis.\n\n5. **Lens Damage or Displacement** - The implants may have affected the lens, causing vision changes and inflammation.\n\n6. **Vitreous Traction or Detachment** - The implants could be exerting traction on the vitreous body, leading to detachment and vision issues.\n\n7. **Pupil Block and Angle-Closure Glaucoma** - The implants might be causing a pupil block, resulting in angle-closure glaucoma, which aligns with the high IOP and vision changes.\n\n8. **Retinal Detachment** - Traction from the implants could lead to retinal detachment, causing sudden changes in vision.\n\n9. **Chronic Uveitis** - Ongoing inflammation from the implants could result in chronic uveitis, explaining persistent symptoms.\n\n10. **Cystoid Macular Edema** - This condition could be secondary to the inflammation or surgical process, leading to vision changes.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnosis is **Glaucoma**, due to the significantly elevated intraocular pressure and associated vision changes. However, **Uveitis** and **Mechanical Irritation from Implants** are also strong contenders, given the inflammatory signs and the presence of the implants.

She underwent surgical resection, and results of pathologic evaluation were consistent with the original tumor. Follow-up CT imaging revealed a 1.2-cm left upper lobe lung nodule and a 0.8-cm right upper lobe lung nodule, as well as a pulmonary embolism and a left 6th rib fracture. These lesions were fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography avid. The patient denied constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, fever, chills, and night sweats. She underwent bilateral video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery wedge resections of the lung lesions, which were also consistent with the primary tumor.

That's 8 by 6 by 5 cm, which is quite significant. So, what could this be? My first thought is renal cell carcinoma. It's a common type of kidney tumor, and it can definitely cause hematuria.\n\nBut wait, the pathology report says it's an angiomyolipoma.

Xanthomas are typically benign, so it seems like we're dealing with a pattern of benign tumors. Could this be part of a larger syndrome? Tuberous sclerosis complex comes to mind because it's known for causing benign tumors like angiomyolipomas.\n\nBut then, three years later, she's back with abdominal pain, and there's a new mass near her kidney. It's described as a retrocaval mass, which is a bit concerning. Could this be a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor? They can occur in the retroperitoneal space and might explain the location of this mass.\n\nThe pathology, however, says it's consistent with the original tumor, which was an angiomyolipoma. So, it seems like we're still dealing with benign growths. But why are they recurring and showing up in different places?\n\nThen there are the lung nodules. They're small, but they're fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography avid, which means they're metabolically active. This could mean something malignant like metastatic cancer, but the pathology again shows they're consistent with the primary tumor, which was benign.\n\nHmm, what about lymphangioleiomyomatosis? It's a condition associated with tuberous sclerosis that affects the lungs and can cause lung nodules. This could explain the pulmonary findings.\n\nThe patient also has a pulmonary embolism and a rib fracture. The embolism could be related to the lung lesions or surgery, but the rib fracture is interesting. Could this be related to a bone condition like fibrous dysplasia? It's a possibility, but it doesn't quite fit with the rest of the findings.\n\nNow, let's think about the pleural-based lung lesions she developed later. They're resected, and the pathology is positive for HMB45 and Melan-A. These markers are typically associated with melanocytic tumors. Could this be a case of clear cell sarcoma? It's a rare tumor that can express these markers.\n\nBut wait, clear cell sarcoma is malignant, and she's had multiple surgeries with benign findings. It doesn't quite add up. Maybe we're dealing with something like a PEComa, a perivascular epithelioid cell tumor. These tumors can express HMB45 and Melan-A and are related to angiomyolipomas.\n\nSo, putting it all together, it seems like we're dealing with a case of tuberous sclerosis complex with multiple angiomyolipomas and possibly a PEComa. This would explain the kidney and lung findings, as well as the bone lesion. It's a complex case, but this diagnosis ties everything together.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnoses for the patient's condition can be considered as follows:\n\n1. **Renal Cell Carcinoma** - Given the initial presentation of a large kidney lesion and hematuria, renal cell carcinoma is a plausible consideration.\n\n2. **Angiomyolipoma** - The pathology report confirms this benign tumor, which aligns with the kidney lesion and subsequent similar findings in other locations.\n\n3. **Tuberous Sclerosis Complex** - The pattern of benign tumors, including angiomyolipomas and the bone lesion, suggests this genetic syndrome.\n\n4. **Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor** - The retrocaval mass raises the possibility of this type of tumor, although pathology indicates otherwise.\n\n5. **Lymphangioleiomyomatosis** - This lung condition, associated with tuberous sclerosis, could explain the pulmonary nodules.\n\n6. **Fibrous Dysplasia** - The rib fracture and bone lesion could be linked to this bone disorder, but it doesn't fully align with other findings.\n\n7. **Clear Cell Sarcoma** - The pleural-based lesions positive for HMB45 and Melan-A suggest this rare tumor, but the benign history contradicts this.\n\n8. **PEComa (Perivascular Epithelioid Cell Tumor)** - This tumor type aligns with the expression of HMB45 and Melan-A and is related to angiomyolipomas.\n\n9. **Metastatic Cancer** - The fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography avidity of lung nodules raises concern for malignancy, but pathology shows benignancy.\n\n10. **Multifocal Fibrosarcoma** - Although less likely, this could explain the multiple lesions, but it doesn't account for the specific markers found.\n\nUpon reviewing all the information, the most comprehensive explanation for the patient's condition is **Tuberous Sclerosis Complex** with multiple **Angiomyolipomas** and possibly a **PEComa**, which aligns with the kidney, lung, and bone findings, as well as the immunohistochemical markers. This diagnosis ties together the various benign tumors and lesions observed throughout the patient's medical history.", "topic": "['Nephrology', 'Urology', 'Urologic Cancer', 'Oncology']"}

Let’s think step by step.\n### INPUT:\nA woman in her 70s was referred to our centralized heart failure management program because of New York Heart Association functional class III heart failure with preserved left ventricular systolic function and recurrent hospitalizations for heart failure. Her medical history was remarkable for coronary artery disease after coronary artery bypass grafting, chronic stable angina, severe tricuspid regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, and obesity with a body mass index of 39 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). After screening and medication optimization, she underwent successful implantation of a small sensor-pressure device (CardioMEMS; Abbott) into her pulmonary artery without complication. Her home medications included torsemide, metolazone, metoprolol succinate, spironolactone, isosorbide mononitrate, diltiazem, and ranolazine. Her initial postimplantation sensor readings and waveforms are shown in Figure 1A. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Migration of CardioMEMS sensor", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her 70s dealing with heart failure, and it's the type where the heart's squeezing ability is fine, but it's having trouble relaxing. That's heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF. She's been in and out of the hospital, so her condition is pretty serious.\n\nNow, she's got a history of coronary artery disease and had bypass surgery. That's a big deal and can definitely affect the heart's function. Plus, she's got chronic stable angina, which means her heart isn't getting all the blood it needs at times. And then there's severe tricuspid regurgitation, which is when the tricuspid valve isn't closing properly, causing blood to flow back into the right atrium. That can really mess with the heart's efficiency.\n\nShe's also got atrial fibrillation, which is an irregular heartbeat that can worsen heart failure. And let's not forget her obesity, with a BMI of 39. That's severe and can put extra strain on the heart. So, all these factors combined are likely contributing to her heart failure.\n\nOkay, so what could be causing her symptoms right now? Initially, I'm thinking about hypertensive heart disease. High blood pressure can lead to thickened heart muscles, making it hard for the heart to relax, which fits with HFpEF.\n\nBut wait, her severe tricuspid regurgitation could be playing a big role too. It can lead to right-sided heart failure, which might be why she's having so much trouble. So, maybe tricuspid regurgitation is a bigger deal here than I first thought.\n\nOh, and let's not ignore the possibility of coronary artery disease causing ischemic cardiomyopathy. Even if her angina is stable, the underlying artery disease could still be affecting her heart's function.\n\nAtrial fibrillation is another piece of the puzzle. It can lead to a rapid or irregular heartbeat, reducing the heart's efficiency and worsening heart failure symptoms. So, it's definitely something to consider.\n\nThere's also the possibility of obesity-related cardiomyopathy. Her high BMI is likely putting extra strain on her heart, which could contribute to her condition.\n\nHmm, what about diastolic dysfunction? It's closely related to HFpEF and involves the heart having trouble relaxing. That could be a key player here.\n\nOh, and we can't forget about right ventricular failure. Her severe tricuspid regurgitation could be causing problems in the right side of the heart, leading to those heart failure symptoms.\n\nNow, let's think about pulmonary hypertension. If the pressure in her pulmonary arteries is high, it could be straining the right side of her heart, contributing to her symptoms.\n\nAnd finally, there's constrictive pericarditis, where the heart is constrained by a stiff pericardium, affecting its ability to fill properly. That could mimic some of her symptoms too.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I'd rank hypertensive heart disease as the top possibility, followed closely by severe tricuspid regurgitation, and then ischemic cardiomyopathy. Atrial fibrillation, obesity-related cardiomyopathy, diastolic dysfunction, right ventricular failure, pulmonary hypertension, and constrictive pericarditis follow in that order. Each of these conditions could be contributing to her heart failure in different ways.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Hypertensive Heart Disease**  \n2. **Severe Tricuspid Regurgitation**  \n3. **Ischemic Cardiomyopathy**  \n4. **Atrial Fibrillation**  \n5. **Obesity-related Cardiomyopathy**  \n6. **Diastolic Dysfunction**  \n7. **Right Ventricular Failure**  \n8. **Pulmonary Hypertension**  \n9. **Constrictive Pericarditis**  \n10. **Coronary Artery Disease**\n\nAfter considering all the patient's symptoms and medical history, the top differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Severe Tricuspid Regurgitation**  \n2. **Hypertensive Heart Disease**  \n3. **Ischemic Cardiomyopathy**  \n4. **Atrial Fibrillation**  \n5. **Obesity-related Cardiomyopathy**  \n6. **Diastolic Dysfunction**  \n7. **Right Ventricular Failure**  \n8. **Pulmonary Hypertension**  \n9. **Constrictive Pericarditis**  \n10. **Coronary Artery Disease**\n\nThese conditions, particularly severe tricuspid regurgitation and hypertensive heart disease, are likely contributing significantly to her heart failure symptoms, given her complex medical history and the presence of multiple comorbidities.", "topic": "['Medical Devices and Equipment', 'Cardiology', 'Heart Failure']"}

She had consulted other physicians, but the cause could not be identified. The symptoms gradually exacerbated, seriously deteriorating her quality of life and causing a 5-kg weight loss. She also experienced insomnia and depression. Antidepressants and psychotherapy, prescribed under the suspicion of a psychogenic cause, did not alleviate her symptoms. She had no relevant medical history and no smoking or drinking history. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological findings were unremarkable. A careful physical examination, with palpation of the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage region on swallowing, revealed a clear clicking movement and right-sided friction with accompanying pain. However, results of laryngoscopy and other common imaging studies showed no pathology. Hence, to assess the dynamic structural changes during swallowing, we performed swallowing dynamic computed tomography (SD-CT), which can reveal moving structures by creating a dynamic-volume data set during swallowing.1,2 Comparison of the reconstructed SD-CT images at rest (Figure 1A) and on swallowing (Figure 1B) revealed that the superior thyroid notch and the right superior border of the thyroid cartilage contacted the hyoid bone internally during maximum laryngeal elevation on swallowing. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Clicking larynx", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. A 42-year-old woman is having a tough time with this clicking sensation and pain when swallowing. It's been going on for a few months, and it's really getting to her. She's lost weight and isn't sleeping well, which is making her feel depressed. That's rough. She's tried antidepressants, but they haven't helped. So, it's probably not just in her head. \n\nFirst, I'm thinking about something like Eagle syndrome. That's when the styloid process is too long and can cause pain and issues with swallowing. It fits the bill with the clicking and pain. \n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. What if it's something like a thyroid nodule? Those can cause swallowing problems too. But would it cause a clicking sound? Hmm, maybe not. \n\nOkay, let's think about esophageal issues. Diffuse esophageal spasm could cause some weird sensations when swallowing. But would it cause a clicking sound? That's a bit of a stretch. \n\nNow, what about something psychological, like a somatic symptom disorder? She's been feeling down, and stress can do weird things to the body. But the physical click is hard to ignore. \n\nMaybe it's something simpler, like a ligament issue. The stylohyoid ligament could be the culprit. If it's too tight or inflamed, it could cause these symptoms. \n\nBut let's not forget about the possibility of a foreign body. Could something be stuck, causing this click? It's possible, but she would have mentioned other symptoms, right? \n\nOh, and there's the chance of a laryngeal prominence. That could cause some friction and clicking. It's worth considering. \n\nNow, let's think about neurological causes. Something like a vagal nerve paralysis could affect swallowing. But would it cause a click? That's not typical. \n\nHmm, what about osteophytes? If there are bone spurs around the cervical spine, they could be causing some irritation. That might explain the clicking. \n\nAnd finally, let's not rule out a pharyngeal diverticulum. That's when there's a little pouch that forms, and it can cause swallowing issues. But would it click? It's possible. \n\nSo, after thinking it all through, I'm leaning towards Eagle syndrome. It just fits too well with the symptoms. But I'm keeping stylohyoid ligament inflammation in mind too, just in case.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the symptoms and the findings from the swallowing dynamic computed tomography (SD-CT), the most likely diagnosis is Eagle syndrome. This condition is characterized by an elongated styloid process, which can cause pain and a clicking sensation during swallowing, aligning well with the patient's symptoms. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Eagle Syndrome** - The symptoms of a clicking sensation and pain during swallowing, along with the SD-CT findings, strongly suggest this diagnosis.\n2. **Stylohyoid Ligament Inflammation** - This could cause similar symptoms if the ligament is inflamed or too tight, leading to discomfort and clicking during swallowing.\n3. **Thyroid Nodule** - While thyroid nodules can cause swallowing difficulties, they are less likely to cause a distinct clicking sound.\n4. **Diffuse Esophageal Spasm** - This condition could cause swallowing difficulties, but it typically does not result in a clicking sensation.\n5. **Somatic Symptom Disorder** - Although the patient has psychological symptoms, the physical nature of the clicking sound makes this less likely.\n6. **Foreign Body** - The absence of other symptoms makes this possibility less likely.\n7. **Laryngeal Prominence** - Could potentially cause friction and clicking, but it's less directly linked to the symptoms than Eagle syndrome.\n8. **Vagal Nerve Paralysis** - Unlikely to cause a clicking sound; more commonly associated with vocal changes or swallowing difficulties without a distinct click.\n9. **Cervical Osteophytes** - While bone spurs could cause irritation, they are less likely to cause the specific clicking sensation during swallowing.\n10. **Pharyngeal Diverticulum** - Could cause swallowing issues, but the clicking sound is not a typical symptom.\n\nEagle syndrome remains the most fitting diagnosis given the specific symptoms and imaging findings.", "topic": "['Otolaryngology', 'Swallowing and Dysphagia']"}

His parents and brother had normal stature. His medical history was significant for frequent upper respiratory tract infections since infancy. He had no intellectual disability, neurologic symptoms, or hearing impairment. There was no family history of visual impairment or neurologic disorders. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/80 OD and 20/50 OS. Intraocular pressure was normal. He could not identify any Ishihara color plate. Slitlamp examination was unremarkable. Dilated fundus examination results showed diffuse optic atrophy (OA) and fine pigmentary mottling changes at the fovea in both eyes (Figure 1A). Electroretinography (ERG) showed normal dark-adapted responses and severely reduced light-adapted responses. Optical coherence tomography showed thinning of retinal nerve fiber layers and disruption of outer nuclear layers and the ellipsoid zone at the center of the fovea (Figure 1B). Leber hereditary optic neuropathy sequencing was negative for 3 hot spot mutations. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Short stature, OA, Pelger-Huët anomaly syndrome", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 26-year-old guy who's had trouble seeing out of both eyes since he was a kid. That's a pretty long time to deal with vision issues, so it's likely something that's been there from the start. He's also pretty short for his age, and he's got this progeroid look going on, which is kind of unusual. His family doesn't seem to have these issues, so it's probably not something he got directly from his parents. \n\nNow, he's had frequent respiratory infections since he was a baby. That's a lot of sickness for someone so young, and it makes me think there might be something more systemic going on, maybe something affecting his immune system or metabolism. \n\nHis vision problems are pretty specific. He can't see colors well, which points to some kind of cone cell issue in the retina. And the tests show that his optic nerves are not in great shape, with some pigment changes at the back of his eyes. The ERG results are interesting too; they show his rods are working fine, but his cones are not. That's a big clue. \n\nSo, what could this be? Initially, I thought about Bardet-Biedl syndrome because it fits with the vision problems and short stature. But wait, he doesn't have any of the other typical symptoms like polydactyly or obesity. \n\nThen I considered Alström syndrome. It matches the cone-rod dystrophy and the hearing loss isn't there, which is a plus. But, he doesn't have the typical features like obesity or insulin resistance. Hmm, not a perfect fit. \n\nUsher syndrome was next on my list. It's known for causing vision and hearing problems, but this guy doesn't have any hearing issues. So, that's not it. \n\nI also thought about Leber congenital amaurosis, but it usually causes more severe vision loss early on, and he doesn't have that. \n\nThen there's this idea of a mitochondrial disorder. They can cause optic atrophy and short stature, and the frequent infections could be related to some kind of metabolic issue. But, I'm not sure it fully explains the cone-rod dystrophy. \n\nOh, and I can't forget about spinocerebellar ataxia type 7. It can cause vision problems, but he doesn't have any neurological symptoms, so that's probably not it. \n\nNow, let's think about systemic conditions. Could this be some kind of systemic infection or immune issue? Chronic granulomatous disease came to mind because it can cause frequent infections, but it doesn't usually affect the eyes like this. \n\nI also considered Langerhans cell histiocytosis. It can cause a range of symptoms including skin and bone issues, but it doesn't quite fit with what we're seeing here. \n\nSo, where does that leave us? After going through all of this, I think Alström syndrome is still the best fit, even if it's not perfect. It explains the vision problems and the short stature, and the absence of hearing loss doesn't completely rule it out. \n\nBut wait, let's not forget about those mitochondrial disorders. They can be tricky and might explain the optic atrophy and frequent infections. \n\nIn the end, I think Alström syndrome and mitochondrial disorder are the top contenders. They both explain parts of the picture, and we might need more tests to figure out which one it really is.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, ensuring each step presents a unique hypothesis:\n\n1. **Alström Syndrome** - This condition is characterized by cone-rod dystrophy, short stature, and can include hearing loss, although the absence of hearing impairment in this patient does not rule it out entirely.\n\n2. **Bardet-Biedl Syndrome** - While it shares some features like vision problems and short stature, the absence of polydactyly and obesity makes it less likely.\n\n3. **Usher Syndrome** - Primarily involves both vision and hearing impairments; however, this patient does not have hearing loss, making this diagnosis unlikely.\n\n4. **Leber Congenital Amaurosis** - Typically causes more severe early-onset vision loss, which doesn't align perfectly with this patient's symptoms.\n\n5. **Mitochondrial Disorder** - Could explain the optic atrophy, short stature, and frequent infections due to metabolic dysfunction, but may not fully account for the specific cone-rod dystrophy.\n\n6. **Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 7** - Involves vision problems but is typically accompanied by neurological symptoms, which are absent in this case.\n\n7. **Chronic Granulomatous Disease** - Known for causing frequent infections, but it doesn't typically involve the specific ocular findings seen here.\n\n8. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis** - Can present with a range of symptoms including skin and bone lesions, but doesn't typically match the ocular and growth abnormalities.\n\n9. **Cockayne Syndrome** - Features growth and developmental issues with sensitivity to sunlight, but doesn't typically include the specific vision problems seen here.\n\n10. **Mucopolysaccharidosis** - Involves systemic issues and sometimes ocular abnormalities, but the specific symptoms don't align perfectly with this patient's presentation.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are **Alström Syndrome** and **Mitochondrial Disorder**, as they both explain significant aspects of the patient's symptoms.

That's interesting.\n\nNow, he mentioned that his family members, like his dad, brother, and cousin, have similar skin issues. That's a big clue. It makes me think this might be something genetic. Familial conditions can be tricky, but they often have distinct patterns.\n\nLet's think about what conditions run in families and involve the skin. One that comes to mind is Hailey-Hailey disease. It's known for causing blisters, and it's genetic. But wait, Hailey-Hailey usually shows up in more flexural areas like the armpits or groin, not the shins. So, maybe that's not it.\n\nOkay, what about other genetic skin conditions? Epidermolysis bullosa simplex could be a contender. It's a genetic disorder that causes blisters, and it can show up in various spots, including the legs. But, it's usually more widespread and not necessarily lichenified like this.\n\nOh, and there's the biopsy results to consider. They might give us more clues. If it shows certain patterns like acantholysis or dyskeratosis, that could point us in a specific direction. For example, acantholysis could suggest Darier's disease, but that's more of a generalized condition, not usually limited to the legs.\n\nLet's not forget about autoimmune conditions. Bullous pemphigoid could fit, especially since it can cause tense blisters. But, it's not typically genetic or lichenified, and it's more common in older adults.\n\nHmm, what about lichen planus? It can cause lichenified papules and sometimes blisters. Plus, it can involve the nails, which matches the toenail dystrophy. But, it's not usually genetic, so that's a strike against it.\n\nLet's think about the family history again. If it's genetic, maybe we're looking at something like porphyria cutanea tarda. It can cause blistering and skin changes, and it has a genetic component. But, it usually involves sun-exposed skin, not the shins.\n\nOh, and there's the possibility of a rare genetic syndrome. Maybe something like Kindler syndrome, which involves skin blistering and other abnormalities. But, it's pretty rare and usually has other systemic features.\n\nAfter going through all this, I'm leaning towards Hailey-Hailey disease. It's genetic, involves blistering, and while the location is a bit off, it seems to fit the best with the family history and blistering. But, I'm not completely sure.

At an outside hospital, cultures were obtained, and treatment was initiated with ofloxacin eye drops, 0.3%, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride ointment, 0.3%, and oral moxifloxacin hydrochloride, 400 mg daily. His symptoms worsened, and he was referred 3 days later for further evaluation. On examination, visual acuity in the right eye was hand motions. The left eye examination results were unremarkable. Slitlamp examination was limited by patient discomfort but revealed purulent discharge, a markedly inflamed conjunctiva, diffuse cornea opacification and thinning, and a flat anterior chamber. Given the history of tree branch trauma, the patient was brought to the operating room. Intraoperatively, a 0.5-mm corneal perforation was identified within an area of thinning (Figure, A). Microbial cultures were repeated, and corneal glue was applied. Gram stain of the purulent discharge demonstrated numerous polymorphonuclear leukocytes only. All subsequent microbiology cultures were negative. Despite treatment with topical fortified vancomycin, 25 mg/mL, tobramycin, 13.3 mg/mL, intravenous levofloxacin, 750 mg daily, and doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily, the purulent conjunctivitis and corneal stromal necrosis did not improve (Figure, B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Gonococcal keratoconjunctivitis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 65-year-old man with a pretty bad case of right eye pain and some nasty purulent discharge. He mentioned getting hit by a tree branch a few days ago. That's a pretty significant detail. Oh, and he's got HIV with a low CD4 count, which means his immune system isn't great. He's been on antibiotics, but things are getting worse. That's concerning.\n\nFirst off, with that kind of trauma and his immune status, I'm thinking bacterial infection is a strong possibility. Bacterial keratitis seems like a good starting point. It's common with eye trauma and can get pretty severe quickly.\n\nBut wait, the cultures are negative, and the Gram stain only shows polymorphonuclear leukocytes. No bacteria in sight. That's odd. Could it be that the antibiotics he was on already wiped out the bacteria, or maybe it's a fastidious organism that's not growing in culture?\n\nHmm, let's consider fungi. Fungal keratitis is known to happen after trauma with vegetative material. It's not uncommon in people with compromised immune systems either. The lack of bacterial growth could point us in this direction.\n\nThen again, the negative cultures could also mean we're dealing with something atypical, like Mycobacterium or Nocardia. These guys can be tricky to culture and might not show up on a regular Gram stain.\n\nOh, and there's Acanthamoeba keratitis too. That's another one that's hard to detect with standard methods. It's associated with trauma and can cause pretty severe symptoms.\n\nBut wait, let's not forget about syphilis. Ocular syphilis can present in all sorts of ways, and it might not be the first thing that comes to mind, but it's worth considering, especially with his HIV status.\n\nNow, let's think about herpes. Herpes simplex keratitis is pretty common and can cause corneal necrosis. It might not show up in bacterial or fungal cultures, and the presentation fits.\n\nThere's also the possibility of a foreign body. Even if it's not obvious, a small piece of the tree branch could be lodged in there, causing ongoing inflammation and infection.\n\nOh, and what about Pseudomonas aeruginosa? It's a notorious cause of bacterial keratitis, especially in contact lens wearers, but it could also happen post-trauma. It's aggressive and could explain the rapid progression.\n\nFinally, let's not rule out mucormycosis. It's a fungal infection that can be really aggressive, especially in immunocompromised patients. It could explain the tissue necrosis and lack of culture growth.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top differential diagnoses, in order, are: Bacterial keratitis, Fungal keratitis, Mycobacterial keratitis, Acanthamoeba keratitis, Ocular syphilis, Herpes simplex keratitis, Foreign body, Pseudomonas keratitis, and Mucormycosis. Each of these fits with some part of the clinical picture, and they all warrant consideration given the circumstances.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, considering the trauma, symptoms, and negative cultures:\n\n1. **Bacterial Keratitis** - This is a common and aggressive infection following eye trauma, especially in immunocompromised patients.\n2. **Fungal Keratitis** - Given the trauma with vegetative material and the patient's HIV status, fungal infection is a strong possibility.\n3. **Mycobacterial Keratitis** - Atypical infections like Mycobacterium can be difficult to detect with standard cultures and Gram stains.\n4. **Acanthamoeba Keratitis** - This is associated with trauma and can cause severe symptoms, often not detectable with routine methods.\n5. **Ocular Syphilis** - With the patient's HIV status, syphilis could present with atypical ocular symptoms.\n6. **Herpes Simplex Keratitis** - A common viral infection that can cause corneal necrosis and may not appear in bacterial or fungal cultures.\n7. **Foreign Body** - A small piece of the tree branch could be causing ongoing inflammation and infection.\n8. **Pseudomonas Keratitis** - An aggressive bacterial infection that can occur post-trauma, especially in compromised patients.\n9. **Nocardia Keratitis** - Similar to Mycobacterium, Nocardia can be difficult to culture and may present with similar symptoms.\n10. **Mucormycosis** - A fungal infection that can be aggressive in immunocompromised individuals, leading to tissue necrosis.\n\nEach of these diagnoses aligns with aspects of the clinical presentation and should be considered given the patient's condition and history.", "topic": "['Cornea', 'Sexually Transmitted Infections', 'External Eye Disease', 'Ophthalmology', 'HIV']"}

Vision decreased suddenly in the right eye 3 to 4 weeks prior and in the left eye 5 days prior. She reported left-sided scalp tenderness; jaw claudication; neck, shoulder, and low back pain; and a recent 6.8-kilogram weight loss. Visual acuity was 20/200 in the right eye (OD) and hand motion in the left eye (OS). She had a left relative afferent pupillary defect, moderate dry-eye syndrome, and mild cataracts. The right optic nerve had a cup-disc ratio of 0.55 with temporal pallor and mild optic disc edema, and the left nerve had a cup-disc ratio of 0.50 with mild edema without pallor. Bilateral arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy was suspected. Expedited evaluation and treatment of giant cell arteritis (GCA) was pursued. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated at 61 mm/h, whereas C-reactive protein (CRP), hemoglobin, and platelet levels were normal. She was hospitalized for empirical treatment with 1 g of intravenous methylprednisolone sodium succinate daily for 5 days. Results of a left temporal artery biopsy (TAB) were negative for GCA. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits showed abnormal signal and contrast enhancement within the intraorbital midportion of both optic nerves (Figure 1A and B) as well as incidental parotid gland cysts bilaterally (Figure 1C). She was discharged and was taking oral prednisone anhydrous, 60 mg daily. One month later the patient had improvement in visual acuity to 20/50 OD and 20/25 OS. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder associated with Sjögren syndrome", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 67-year-old woman who's suddenly losing vision in both eyes. That's pretty alarming. She's also got some other symptoms like scalp tenderness and jaw claudication. Hmm, those are classic signs of giant cell arteritis, right? That's definitely something to consider seriously.\n\nNow, her vision loss is sequential, which is interesting. It started in one eye and then the other a few weeks later. That kind of pattern can be seen in conditions like ischemic optic neuropathy. And with her age and these symptoms, arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is a strong possibility.\n\nOh, and let's not forget the lab results. Her ESR is elevated, which fits with inflammation like in giant cell arteritis. But CRP is normal, which is a bit odd. Usually, both are elevated in GCA. Hmm, that's something to think about.\n\nThe biopsy didn't show GCA, which is surprising. But we know that biopsies can sometimes be negative even when GCA is present. So, we can't completely rule it out based on that.\n\nThe MRI shows some abnormal signals in the optic nerves. That could indicate inflammation or ischemia. It's not specific, but it does support the idea of something like GCA or another inflammatory process affecting the optic nerves.\n\nSo, what else could this be? Well, there's also the possibility of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. It's more common in older adults and can cause sudden vision loss. But it doesn't usually come with systemic symptoms like scalp tenderness.\n\nAnother thought is optic neuritis. It can cause sudden vision loss and sometimes has pain, but it's usually seen in younger people and often associated with multiple sclerosis. That doesn't quite fit here.\n\nThere's also the consideration of something like systemic lupus erythematosus. It's a systemic autoimmune condition that can cause a variety of symptoms, including vision problems. But we don't have any other symptoms or lab findings that strongly point to lupus.\n\nAnd then there are the parotid gland cysts found on MRI. They're incidental, but could they be related to something like IgG4-related disease? That's a bit of a stretch, but IgG4 can cause systemic inflammation and affect various organs.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the most likely diagnosis is still giant cell arteritis, even with the negative biopsy. The clinical presentation is just too strong. But we should also consider non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and keep an open mind about other possibilities like IgG4-related disease.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA)**: The patient's age, symptoms of scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, and vision loss are classic for GCA.\n\n2. **Non-arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION)**: Sudden vision loss in an older adult could be due to NAION, although it typically lacks systemic symptoms.\n\n3. **Optic Neuritis**: Characterized by sudden vision loss and possible pain, but more common in younger individuals and often associated with multiple sclerosis.\n\n4. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**: A systemic autoimmune condition that can cause various symptoms, including vision problems, but lacks specific supporting evidence here.\n\n5. **IgG4-Related Disease**: Could be considered due to incidental parotid gland cysts and potential for systemic inflammation, though it's a less common diagnosis.\n\n6. **Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)**: Sudden vision loss could suggest CRAO, but it typically doesn't involve systemic symptoms like scalp tenderness.\n\n7. **Vasculitis**: Other forms of vasculitis could present with similar symptoms, but GCA is more likely given the clinical picture.\n\n8. **Temporal Arteritis with Atypical Presentation**: Despite the negative biopsy, GCA can have skip lesions, so it remains a strong consideration.\n\n9. **Autoimmune Optic Neuropathy**: A rare condition that could cause bilateral vision loss, but more commonly associated with other systemic autoimmune symptoms.\n\n10. **Sarcoidosis**: Could cause optic nerve involvement and systemic symptoms, but usually presents with more respiratory or skin findings.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses, in order of likelihood, are:\n\n1. **Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA)**: Despite the negative biopsy, the clinical presentation is highly suggestive.\n2. **Non-arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION)**: A plausible cause of sudden vision loss in this age group.\n3. **IgG4-Related Disease**: Considered due to incidental findings and potential systemic involvement.\n\nThese diagnoses align with the patient's symptoms, test results, and the nature of her vision loss.", "topic": "['Demyelinating Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Neuromyelitis Optica', 'Ophthalmology', 'Rheumatology']"}

She reported no blurry vision, metamorphopsia, photopsias, floaters, or nyctalopia, and she had no history of refractive surgical procedures, ocular surgical procedures, or trauma. Her family history was negative for ocular conditions, and there was no consanguinity in her family. Her visual acuity was 20/20 OU with correction (plano +0.25 × 153 OD and −0.50 + 0.25 × 009 OS).

Results of a dilated ophthalmoscopic examination showed radial spokelike striae of the fovea, with a central cyst in the right eye and macular edema of the left eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of the right macula showed cystlike changes in the outer retina in the foveal and parafoveal regions and in the inner retina in the temporal macula. Optical coherence tomography imaging of the left macula showed cystlike changes in the outer retina in the inferior macula (Figure). Of note, OCT scans of the optic nerves did not reveal an optic disc pit. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Stellate nonhereditary idiopathic foveomacular retinoschisis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 64-year-old woman who's in great health overall. She's not on any meds, which is good. She's been referred because of an epiretinal membrane in her right eye. But she's not complaining about any vision problems like blurriness or metamorphopsia. That's interesting. And no floaters or night vision issues either. Plus, no history of eye surgeries or injuries. Her family history is clean too, no hereditary eye conditions. Her vision is pretty sharp, 20/20 in both eyes with some correction. The front part of her eyes look fine, just some mild cataracts. But when we look at the back of her eyes, there are these radial striae on the fovea in the right eye, and some macular edema in the left. Hmm, that's something.\n\nNow, let's check out the OCT scans. In the right eye, there are cyst-like changes in the outer and inner retina. And in the left eye, there are changes in the outer retina too. But there's no optic disc pit, so we can rule that out. \n\nOkay, so what could be going on here? Epiretinal membrane is a possibility. It's common in older adults and can cause those striae on the retina. But there's no significant vision loss, so maybe it's not the main issue. \n\nLet's think about vitreomacular traction. It can cause cyst-like changes and macular edema. It's a strong contender given the OCT findings. \n\nWhat about central serous chorioretinopathy? It can cause macular edema, but usually, there's a serous detachment, and we don't see that here. So, probably not. \n\nMacular hole could be another option, but there's no full-thickness defect, so that's unlikely. \n\nCould it be diabetic retinopathy? There's no history of diabetes, and we don't see typical signs like microaneurysms. So, probably not. \n\nInflammatory or infectious causes? There's no history or signs of that, so let's put that aside for now. \n\nWhat about age-related macular degeneration? It's common at her age, but we don't see drusen or advanced signs. So, maybe not. \n\nOh, and we should consider lamellar macular hole. The cyst-like changes could fit, and it's a possibility without a full-thickness defect. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I'd say vitreomacular traction is the top possibility. It matches the OCT findings well. Lamellar macular hole is a close second. Epiretinal membrane is there, but it's not causing significant issues. The others, like central serous chorioretinopathy and macular hole, are less likely based on what we see. Diabetic retinopathy and inflammatory causes are unlikely without more evidence. And age-related macular degeneration doesn't quite fit the findings. Yeah, that seems to make sense.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the condition described, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Vitreomacular Traction** - This condition can cause the cyst-like changes and macular edema observed in the OCT scans and is a strong contender given the findings.\n\n2. **Lamellar Macular Hole** - The presence of cyst-like changes without a full-thickness defect makes this a plausible diagnosis.\n\n3. **Epiretinal Membrane** - While present, it's not causing significant vision issues, but it's still a relevant consideration.\n\n4. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy** - Typically involves a serous detachment, which is not evident here, making it less likely.\n\n5. **Macular Hole** - Unlikely due to the absence of a full-thickness retinal defect.\n\n6. **Diabetic Retinopathy** - There's no history of diabetes or typical signs like microaneurysms, so this is improbable.\n\n7. **Inflammatory or Infectious Causes** - No history or signs of inflammation or infection, making this unlikely.\n\n8. **Age-related Macular Degeneration** - Common at her age, but the absence of drusen or advanced signs makes it less likely.\n\n9. **Optic Disc Pit-Related Maculopathy** - Ruled out since no optic disc pit is observed in the OCT scans.\n\n10. **Cystoid Macular Edema of Unknown Etiology** - Could be considered if other causes are excluded, but less likely given the specific OCT findings.\n\nReranking these based on the patient's information and test results, the top three possibilities are:\n\n1. **Vitreomacular Traction**\n2. **Lamellar Macular Hole**\n3. **Epiretinal Membrane**\n\nThese three conditions best align with the clinical and OCT findings, with vitreomacular traction being the most likely diagnosis.", "topic": "['Ophthalmology', 'Retinal Disorders', 'Macular Diseases']"}

She denied a history of fever, otorrhea, prior ear infections, vertigo, or otologic surgery. The patient first saw her primary care physician, who visualized a mass in the right ear canal and attempted needle aspiration, which led to self-resolved bleeding. She was given ciprofloxacin ear drops and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, which did not improve her symptoms. On examination, her right external auditory canal (EAC) was completely obstructed by a fleshy, pulsatile mass with a red hue (Figure 1A). Results of Weber tuning fork examination lateralized to the right ear and a Rinne examination suggested a conductive hearing loss. Formal audiogram results confirmed conductive hearing loss in the right ear and type B tympanometry, which was indicative of poor eardrum mobility. Computed tomography (CT) of the temporal bone without contrast showed a well-circumscribed 9-mm lesion in the EAC with bony erosion along the junction of the anterior wall and floor (Figure 1, B and C). Magnetic resonance imaging results showed a well-circumscribed, contrast-enhancing mass that was confined to the EAC (Figure 1D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Lobular capillary hemangioma of the EAC", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 54-year-old woman who's been dealing with some pretty uncomfortable symptoms. She's had right ear pain for three months, and more recently, she's developed pulsatile tinnitus and hearing loss. That's quite a combination. She's tried antibiotics, but they didn't help, which makes me think this might not be your run-of-the-mill ear infection.\n\nNow, when I hear about a mass in the ear canal that's fleshy and pulsatile, my first thought is something vascular. A glomus tumor comes to mind. They're known for being highly vascular and can cause these exact symptoms. Plus, the fact that it's red and pulsatile is a big hint.\n\nBut let's not jump to conclusions just yet. There are other possibilities. Could it be a schwannoma? They're not typically pulsatile, but they can cause hearing loss. Or maybe it's a meningioma? They can be slow-growing and might present with these symptoms, although they're not usually in the ear canal.\n\nThe imaging is really helpful here. The CT shows a well-circumscribed lesion with bony erosion. That's interesting because it suggests the mass is doing something aggressive with the bone. And the MRI shows it's contrast-enhancing, which means it's likely vascular. This fits with a glomus tumor, but we should still consider other options.\n\nWhat about a cholesteatoma? They can cause hearing loss and are known for erosive behavior, but they're not typically vascular or pulsatile. And an osteoma? They're usually slow-growing and benign, not likely to cause these acute symptoms.\n\nHmm, let's think about the patient's history. She has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Could these play a role? Maybe. They could contribute to vascular issues, but they don't directly explain the mass.\n\nOkay, let's put it all together. Based on the symptoms, the appearance of the mass, and the imaging, a glomus tumor seems like the most likely diagnosis. But we shouldn't completely rule out other possibilities like a schwannoma or even a metastatic lesion, given the bony erosion.\n\nIn the end, I think a glomus tumor is the best fit, but it's always good to keep an open mind and consider other diagnoses. Let's make sure to monitor and follow up to confirm.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Glomus Tumor** - Given the pulsatile nature and red hue of the mass, along with the patient's symptoms, this is a strong contender.\n2. **Schwannoma** - While not typically pulsatile, schwannomas can cause hearing loss and should be considered.\n3. **Meningioma** - Although not common in the ear canal, meningiomas can present with slow-growing masses and related symptoms.\n4. **Cholesteatoma** - Known for erosive behavior, but usually not vascular or pulsatile.\n5. **Osteoma** - Typically slow-growing and benign, making it less likely given the acute symptoms.\n6. **Hemangioma** - A vascular tumor that could explain the pulsatile mass.\n7. **Metastatic Lesion** - The bony erosion raises the possibility of a metastatic process.\n8. **Lipoma** - Although less likely, lipomas can present as soft tissue masses.\n9. **Nerve Sheath Tumor** - Similar to schwannomas, these can cause hearing loss.\n10. **Vascular Malformation** - Could explain the pulsatile nature of the mass.\n\nAfter considering all the patient's symptoms and imaging results, the top differential diagnosis is a **Glomus Tumor**, given its characteristic presentation and the patient's symptomatology.

We've got a 14-month-old boy with a sudden, rapidly growing lesion in his right eye. That's pretty concerning. The parents noticed it just two weeks ago, so it's definitely something that's come on quickly. \n\nFirst, I'm thinking about the common causes of these kinds of eye issues in kids. Medulloepithelioma comes to mind. It's a rare tumor, but it's known to occur in young children and can cause a grayish-white mass in the iris. \n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. What else could it be? I should consider other possibilities. Juvenile xanthogranuloma is another condition that can cause iris lesions in children. It's not as rare as medulloepithelioma, and it can present with similar symptoms. \n\nNow, let's think about the details. The mass is translucent and gray-white with these lacy cystic structures. That's interesting. Medulloepithelioma can have a cystic appearance, but I shouldn't rule out other conditions just yet. \n\nHmm, what about Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis? It can cause ocular lesions, but it's usually part of a systemic condition. I don't see any mention of systemic symptoms here, so maybe it's less likely. \n\nOh, and there's the ultrasound results. No calcifications were found. That's a big clue. Medulloepithelioma often has calcifications, so this finding makes me think twice about that diagnosis. \n\nLet's go back to juvenile xanthogranuloma. It fits the age and presentation, and it doesn't typically have calcifications. That seems to align well with what we're seeing here. \n\nBut I shouldn't stop there. What about other conditions like iris melanocytoma or even a congenital iris cyst? They might not be as common, but they could explain some of the features we're seeing. \n\nIris melanocytoma is usually a stable lesion, though, and this one is growing rapidly. So, that's probably not it. \n\nAnd congenital iris cysts are typically present from birth and don't suddenly enlarge. So, that doesn't seem to fit either. \n\nLet's not forget about other rare tumors like leiomyoma or even metastatic disease, though the latter is unlikely in a child this age without known primary cancer. \n\nAfter considering all of this, I think juvenile xanthogranuloma is the most likely diagnosis. It matches the age, the rapid growth, and the lack of calcifications. \n\nBut I should keep an open mind. Medulloepithelioma is still a possibility, even without calcifications. It's rare, but it fits some of the features. \n\nIn the end, I'm leaning towards juvenile xanthogranuloma, but I'm also considering medulloepithelioma as a close second.

He's got dyspnea and swelling in his right arm, which sounds uncomfortable. And there's tenderness too, hmm, that's concerning.\n\nNow, let's look at the physical exam findings. There's edema in his right arm, hand, and fingers, and he's got these violaceous nonblanching nodules. Those sound like some kind of skin issue, maybe even a vascular problem. Oh, and there are purpuric plaques on his face and chest too. That's a lot of skin findings.\n\nOkay, now the lab results. His hemoglobin is low, which means he's anemic. That could be due to a lot of things, but let's not jump to conclusions yet. And then there's the blood culture result from the outside hospital showing 'yeast.' That's a big clue. Yeast in the blood isn't normal, so we're likely dealing with a fungal infection.\n\nGiven his immunosuppressed state, he's definitely at risk for opportunistic infections. Candidemia comes to mind because it's a common fungal infection in people who are immunocompromised. But let's not stop there.\n\nThe skin findings are interesting. Violaceous nodules and purpuric plaques could be signs of a systemic issue, maybe even a vasculitis. Hmm, could this be related to the fungal infection? Fungal infections can sometimes cause skin manifestations.\n\nLet's think about other possibilities. Aspergillosis is another fungal infection that can affect immunocompromised individuals, and it can cause skin lesions too. But would it show up as yeast in blood cultures? Maybe not, so let's keep that in mind.\n\nOh, and what about bacterial infections? Staphylococcus aureus can cause skin and soft tissue infections, but would it explain the yeast in the blood culture? Probably not, so that seems less likely.\n\nNow, let's not forget about his underlying conditions. He's got a history of cerebrovascular accident, atrial flutter, and aortic stenosis. These could complicate things, especially if we're thinking about embolic phenomena or vascular issues.\n\nHmm, could this be some kind of embolic event causing the arm swelling and skin changes? Maybe, but the yeast in the blood culture pulls me back to a fungal infection.\n\nLet's consider cryptococcosis. It's another fungal infection that can occur in immunocompromised patients, but it usually affects the CNS or lungs. Would it explain the skin findings? Not typically, so maybe that's not it.\n\nOh, and there's mucormycosis, a nasty fungal infection that can be aggressive in immunocompromised individuals. It can cause skin necrosis, but would it show up as yeast in blood cultures? That's unlikely, so let's put that aside for now.\n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa is another possibility. It's a bacterium that can cause skin and soft tissue infections, and it's known for causing ecthyma gangrenosum, which can look like what we're seeing here. But again, would it explain the yeast in the blood culture? Probably not, so that's a puzzle.\n\nLet's think about the big picture. We've got an immunocompromised patient with dyspnea, arm swelling, skin nodules, and purpuric plaques, along with a blood culture showing yeast. Candidemia seems like a strong contender because it fits the immunocompromised state and the blood culture result.\n\nBut wait, let's not ignore the skin findings. They could be embolic phenomena or vasculitis related to an infection. Could this be related to Aspergillus? It can cause skin lesions and is common in immunocompromised patients, but the yeast in the blood culture doesn't quite fit.\n\nAlright, let's wrap this up. Based on everything, I think the top differential diagnosis is candidemia. It explains the yeast in the blood and fits with his immunosuppressed state. The skin findings could be related to embolic phenomena or a candidal infection spreading to the skin. That seems to tie everything together.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with a focus on the key details of immunosuppression, skin findings, and the presence of yeast in the blood culture:\n\n1. **Candidemia** - This is a likely diagnosis given the patient's immunosuppressed state and the blood culture showing yeast.\n\n2. **Aspergillosis** - A possible fungal infection in immunocompromised individuals that can cause skin lesions, although it typically doesn't present as yeast in blood cultures.\n\n3. **Cryptococcosis** - Another fungal infection common in immunocompromised patients, but it usually affects the CNS or lungs and doesn't typically present with the described skin findings.\n\n4. **Mucormycosis** - A serious fungal infection that can cause skin necrosis in immunocompromised individuals, but it's unlikely to present as yeast in blood cultures.\n\n5. **Pseudomonas aeruginosa Infection** - A bacterial infection that can cause skin and soft tissue infections, including ecthyma gangrenosum, but it doesn't explain the yeast in the blood culture.\n\n6. **Staphylococcus aureus Infection** - A bacterial infection that can cause skin and soft tissue infections, but it's unlikely to result in a blood culture showing yeast.\n\n7. **Endocarditis** - Given the patient's history of aortic stenosis and atrial flutter, endocarditis with embolic phenomena could explain some findings, but not the yeast in the blood culture.\n\n8. **Vasculitis** - A condition that could explain the skin findings, but it doesn't account for the yeast in the blood culture.\n\n9. **Hematological Malignancy** - Conditions like leukemia could cause immunosuppression and anemia, but they don't directly explain the yeast in the blood culture.\n\n10. **Disseminated Histoplasmosis** - A fungal infection that can disseminate in immunocompromised individuals, potentially causing skin findings and appearing as yeast in blood cultures.\n\nAfter considering all the information, candidemia remains the most likely diagnosis due to the combination of immunosuppression, yeast in the blood culture, and skin findings that could be related to embolic phenomena or direct infection. Aspergillosis and other fungal infections remain possibilities, but the yeast in the blood culture strongly points towards candidemia.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Geriatrics', 'Infectious Diseases']"}

The patient reported difficulty in performing essential daily tasks, such as driving and walking without assistance. She denied photopsias. Her previous ocular and medical history were unremarkable. She denied any systemic symptoms as well as any family history of inherited ocular diseases. On examination, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/32 OU. Fundus examination results showed attenuated arterial and venous retinal vessels and slight retinal pigmented epithelium changes at the posterior pole, consisting of atrophy and pigment migration in both eyes, associated with vitreous opacities in the left eye. Fluorescein angiography examination results showed a mild leakage of arterial and venous retinal vasculature (Figure). Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography exhibited disruption at the photoreceptor level and multifocal hyperreflective material depositions at the retinal pigmented epithelium level. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Paraneoplastic autoimmune retinopathy", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 65-year-old woman who's been losing her vision in both eyes over the past six months. It's painless, and she's also seeing floaters in her left eye. That's a bit concerning. She's having trouble with daily tasks like driving and walking, which makes sense given her vision issues. But she's not experiencing any flashes of light, so that's something to note.\n\nNow, let's think about what's going on in her eyes. The fundus exam shows that her retinal vessels are narrowed, and there are some changes in the retinal pigment epithelium. There's atrophy and some pigment migration, and she's got these vitreous opacities in her left eye. Hmm, that sounds like something's definitely going on at the level of the retina.\n\nThe fluorescein angiography shows some leakage from the retinal vessels. That could mean there's some abnormality in the blood-retinal barrier. And the OCT scan shows disruption at the photoreceptor level and some hyperreflective material deposited at the RPE level. This is starting to sound like a retinal issue, maybe something degenerative.\n\nSo, what could this be? Let's start with age-related macular degeneration. It's common in older adults and can cause vision loss and changes in the retina. But usually, AMD has more distinct features like drusen, which I don't see mentioned here.\n\nHow about vitreomacular adhesion or traction? That could cause some vision issues, but it usually has more pronounced tractional changes on OCT, which aren't highlighted here.\n\nMaybe it's a form of retinal dystrophy, like retinitis pigmentosa. That can cause progressive vision loss and those RPE changes. But RP often starts earlier in life and has more distinct bone spicule pigments.\n\nCould it be uveitis? That can cause floaters and retinal issues, but there's no history of inflammation or other uveitis symptoms.\n\nLet's not forget about central retinal vein occlusion. That can cause vision loss and retinal hemorrhages, but there's no mention of those here.\n\nWhat about a macular hole? That can cause vision loss, but it would have more specific OCT findings, which aren't mentioned.\n\nMaybe it's a form of choroidal disease, like central serous chorioretinopathy. That can cause vision changes, but it's usually more sudden and has more distinct fluid accumulation on OCT.\n\nCould it be a retinal detachment? That would cause vision loss, but there's no mention of a detachment on exam.\n\nLet's consider posterior vitreous detachment. That can cause floaters, but it wouldn't cause the retinal changes seen here.\n\nFinally, what about asteroid hyalosis? That can cause floaters, but it's usually unilateral and doesn't cause the retinal changes we're seeing.\n\nOkay, let's rank these. Based on the information, age-related macular degeneration seems like a strong possibility, even without the classic drusen. Retinitis pigmentosa is also a contender, given the RPE changes and progressive vision loss. Vitreomacular adhesion could be possible, but the lack of tractional changes makes it less likely. Uveitis and CRVO are less likely due to the lack of inflammatory or hemorrhagic findings. Macular hole and choroidal disease seem unlikely without specific OCT findings. Retinal detachment and posterior vitreous detachment don't fit the exam findings. Asteroid hyalosis is unlikely due to the bilateral nature and retinal changes. So, I'd say AMD, then RP, then VMA, and so on.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step presenting a unique potential diagnosis:\n\n1. **Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**: This is a common cause of progressive vision loss in older adults and can lead to changes in the retinal pigment epithelium and retinal vessels.\n\n2. **Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP)**: This condition can cause progressive vision loss and characteristic changes in the retinal pigment epithelium, such as atrophy and pigment migration.\n\n3. **Vitreomacular Adhesion (VMA)**: Although typically associated with more pronounced tractional changes on OCT, VMA could contribute to vision issues and retinal changes.\n\n4. **Uveitis**: This inflammatory condition can cause floaters and retinal issues, but usually presents with other symptoms of inflammation.\n\n5. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)**: This condition can cause vision loss and retinal changes, but is typically associated with retinal hemorrhages, which are not mentioned.\n\n6. **Macular Hole**: This would cause vision loss, but specific OCT findings indicating a hole are not present.\n\n7. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy**: This condition can cause sudden vision changes and has distinct fluid accumulation on OCT, which is not noted here.\n\n8. **Retinal Detachment**: This would cause vision loss, but there is no mention of a detachment on examination.\n\n9. **Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD)**: This can cause floaters, but does not typically lead to the retinal changes observed.\n\n10. **Asteroid Hyalosis**: This condition can cause floaters, but is usually unilateral and does not cause the bilateral retinal changes seen here.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top three differential diagnoses, in order of likelihood, are:\n\n1. **Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**\n2. **Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP)**\n3. **Vitreomacular Adhesion (VMA)**\n\nThese conditions align most closely with the patient's symptoms and examination findings.

Physical examination revealed a polymorphous cutaneous eruption characterized by nodular vegetating lesions on the lower lip and right nasal ala (Figure 1A); papulovesicular lesions, either umbilicated or with an erosive center, clustered on the left cheek (Figure 1B); and 2 papulovesicular lesions with an erythematous-to-violaceous halo at the cannula insertion sites on the back of the right hand and the inner side of the wrist. The patient reported that the lesions were painful, with the ones in the oral mucosa impairing feeding. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Iododerma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her 30s who's on peritoneal dialysis. That's a big clue because it means her kidneys aren't working well, and she's probably got some other health issues related to that. Now, she's also being checked for severe hyperparathyroidism. That's interesting because it can cause all sorts of problems, especially with calcium levels. \n\nNow, she just had a CT scan with iodinated contrast, and the next day, she's got these skin lesions. That's pretty quick, so it makes me think the contrast might have triggered something. \n\nThe lesions are all over the place in terms of what they look like. There are nodular, vegetating spots on her lip and nose. Then, on her cheek, there are these papulovesicular lesions, some of which are umbilicated or have erosive centers. And on her hand and wrist, near where the cannula was, there are more papulovesicular lesions with a distinctive halo around them. \n\nShe says they're painful, and the ones in her mouth are making it hard for her to eat. That's rough. \n\nGiven the sudden appearance right after the contrast, I'm thinking this could be a reaction to that. Maybe something like contrast-induced pseudolymphoma? That's a possibility. \n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. The mix of lesion types is pretty unique. It's like a combination of different things. \n\nThe nodular lesions on the lip and nose make me think of something more vegetative, like a viral infection. Maybe something like human papillomavirus? That's known for causing vegetating lesions. \n\nThe papulovesicular ones, especially with the umbilicated centers, remind me of something viral too, like molluscum contagiosum or even eczema vaccinatum. Those can look like that. \n\nAnd the halos around the lesions at the cannula sites? That's a bit of a red flag for a more serious reaction, maybe a type of vasculitis or even Sweet's syndrome. \n\nOh, and let's not forget her kidney issues. Being on dialysis can mess with the immune system, making her more prone to infections or unusual reactions. \n\nSo, what's the deal with the hyperparathyroidism? That can cause calcium problems, which might lead to something like calciphylaxis. But that usually looks different, more like necrotic lesions. \n\nOkay, let's put it all together. The sudden onset after contrast, the variety of lesions, and her health background make me think of a few things. \n\nCould it be a contrast reaction? Maybe, but the lesions are so varied. \n\nWhat about an infection, like HPV or molluscum? Those fit some of the lesions, but not all. \n\nSweet's syndrome or vasculitis could explain the halos, but not the vegetating lesions. \n\nAnd then there's calciphylaxis, but the lesions don't quite match. \n\nI'm leaning towards this being a complex reaction, maybe a hypersensitivity reaction to the contrast, but with her immune system being on dialysis, it's all gotten a bit mixed up. \n\nYeah, that seems to fit. A hypersensitivity reaction with a mix of features due to her health conditions. That's my best guess.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the skin lesions in the patient:\n\n1. **Contrast-induced Pseudolymphoma** - Given the timing of the lesions' appearance after the CT scan with iodinated contrast, this is a plausible initial consideration.\n\n2. **Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Infection** - The nodular, vegetating lesions on the lip and nose could suggest a viral infection like HPV.\n\n3. **Molluscum Contagiosum** - The papulovesicular lesions, especially those with umbilicated centers, are characteristic of molluscum contagiosum.\n\n4. **Eczema Vaccinatum** - This condition can present with similar papulovesicular lesions and is worth considering given the patient's immunocompromised state.\n\n5. **Sweet's Syndrome** - The presence of lesions with erythematous-to-violaceous halos, particularly at the cannula sites, raises the possibility of Sweet's syndrome.\n\n6. **Vasculitis** - The halos around the lesions could also indicate a form of vasculitis, which can be associated with systemic inflammation.\n\n7. **Calciphylaxis** - Although the lesions don't perfectly match, the patient's kidney issues and severe hyperparathyroidism make calciphylaxis a consideration.\n\n8. **Contact Dermatitis** - An allergic reaction to the cannula or other medical materials could have contributed to the skin manifestations.\n\n9. **Kaposi Varicelliform Eruption** - This is a widespread vesicular eruption that can occur in immunocompromised individuals, often due to viral infections.\n\n10. **Hypersensitivity Reaction** - A complex hypersensitivity reaction to the contrast material, influenced by the patient's compromised immune system due to dialysis, could explain the varied lesion types.\n\nUpon reviewing all the information, the most likely diagnosis is a **Hypersensitivity Reaction** to the iodinated contrast, complicated by the patient's immunocompromised state due to peritoneal dialysis. This reaction could manifest with a variety of lesion types, as observed in this case. However, it's important to continue monitoring and investigating, as the exact nature of such reactions can be complex and multifactorial.", "topic": "['Nephrology', 'Dermatology']"}

The pain was present at rest, 7 of 10 in severity, and worse with inspiration. He experienced concomitant exertional shortness of breath, dry cough, and lightheadedness. His cardiac history was otherwise unremarkable. Family history was notable for breast cancer in his mother and his sister, but no known inherited hypercoagulable disorders. In the emergency department, his vital signs were as follows: temperature 37.0 °C, blood pressure 130/76 mm Hg, heart rate 97/min, respiratory rate 16/min, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. Physical examination results were unremarkable, with no cardiac murmurs, rubs, pulmonary crackles, jugular venous distention, or lower extremity edema. Laboratory test results were remarkable for an elevated D-dimer level, an elevated C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a mildly elevated pro-BNP level, but normal levels of troponin and procalcitonin. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with evidence of right heart strain, and a computed tomography angiogram of the chest demonstrated an occlusive pulmonary embolism of the left main pulmonary artery and several peripheral consolidations in the left lower lung field consistent with infarction. The patient started anticoagulation therapy with intravenous heparin. A subsequent echocardiogram revealed bowing of the interventricular septum into the left ventricle and a very large (6.6 × 4.1-cm), mobile, nonhomogeneous, pedunculated mass straddling the tricuspid valve and moving between the right atrium and right ventricle (Figure 1 and Video). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Right atrial myxoma with partial myxomatous embolism to the pulmonary artery", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a man in his mid-50s who's been dealing with some pretty concerning symptoms for the past 10 days. He's got sharp chest pain that's not going away, and it's actually getting worse. It's a 7 out of 10 in terms of pain, and it's worse when he takes a deep breath. That's definitely something to pay attention to. Plus, he's experiencing shortness of breath when he's exerting himself, a dry cough, and even some lightheadedness. That's a lot going on.\n\nNow, let's dig into his medical history a bit. He had a pulmonary embolism about 10 years ago. That's significant because it means he's had issues with blood clots before. He was on anticoagulation therapy back then, so he's familiar with that. But it looks like he doesn't have any ongoing cardiac issues otherwise. His family history doesn't raise any red flags for inherited clotting disorders, which is good. Although, there is a history of breast cancer in his family, but that's not directly related to what's happening now.\n\nOkay, let's check out his vital signs from the emergency department. His temperature is normal, blood pressure is fine, heart rate is a bit elevated at 97 beats per minute, and his oxygen saturation is at 95% on room air. That's a little on the low side, but not too alarming. His respiratory rate is normal. So, nothing too crazy here, but the elevated heart rate and lower oxygen saturation are worth noting.\n\nThe physical exam didn't show much. No heart murmurs, rubs, or any signs of fluid buildup in his lungs or legs. That's actually a good sign because it rules out some other potential issues.\n\nNow, let's look at the lab results. The D-dimer is elevated, which immediately makes me think of a clotting issue. The C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are also elevated, indicating some inflammation going on. Pro-BNP is mildly elevated, which can point towards some heart strain. But troponin and procalcitonin are normal, so we're not looking at a heart attack or a bacterial infection.\n\nThe ECG shows normal sinus rhythm, but there's evidence of right heart strain. That's important because it suggests the heart is working harder than it should, likely because of the clot.\n\nThe CT angiogram is really telling. It shows an occlusive pulmonary embolism in the left main pulmonary artery. That's a big deal. There are also some peripheral consolidations in the left lower lung, which could mean there's been an infarction.\n\nThey started him on anticoagulation with heparin, which is standard for a PE. But then the echocardiogram reveals something unexpected. There's a large, mobile mass straddling the tricuspid valve. It's moving between the right atrium and ventricle. That sounds like a thrombus, and it's definitely not something you see every day.\n\nSo, what could this be? Initially, I thought about pulmonary embolism, which makes sense given his history and symptoms. But that mass on the echocardiogram is throwing me for a loop. It could be a right atrial thrombus, which is pretty serious. But could it be something else, like a cardiac tumor? Maybe a myxoma? That's possible, but less likely given the context.\n\nLet's think about other possibilities. Could it be an aortic dissection? The chest pain and shortness of breath could fit, but the echocardiogram doesn't support that. What about pericardial effusion? That could cause chest pain and breathing issues, but again, the mass doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe it's an arrhythmia, like atrial fibrillation? That could cause the lightheadedness and shortness of breath, but the ECG shows normal sinus rhythm, so that's unlikely.\n\nCould it be a lung issue, like pneumonia or a pneumothorax? The dry cough and chest pain could fit, but the CT angiogram doesn't show anything like that.\n\nLet's not forget about the inflammatory markers. They're elevated, which could point to something like endocarditis. But there are no heart murmurs, and the echocardiogram doesn't show any vegetations.\n\nSo, what's the most likely explanation? Given everything, the mass is probably a right atrial thrombus. It's mobile and straddling the tricuspid valve, which is a classic sign. The pulmonary embolism and his history of clots make this the most plausible diagnosis.\n\nBut wait, let's think about this again. Could it be a cardiac tumor, like a myxoma? They can be mobile and cause obstructive symptoms. But usually, they're not associated with such a clear history of clotting issues.\n\nLet's consider other cardiac issues, like ventricular aneurysm or cardiac sarcoidosis. These could cause some of the symptoms, but they don't explain the mass or the clotting history.\n\nWhat about aortic root disease or an aortic thrombus? These could cause chest pain and shortness of breath, but the echocardiogram and CT findings don't support that.\n\nCould it be something infectious, like septic emboli? That would explain the inflammatory markers, but there's no sign of infection elsewhere.\n\nLet's not forget about non-cardiac causes, like a pulmonary artery sarcoma. That's rare, but it could explain the mass and the symptoms. Or maybe it's a congenital heart defect that's gone unnoticed until now.\n\nAfter thinking it through, the right atrial thrombus is still the most likely diagnosis. It fits with the pulmonary embolism and his history. But I can't completely rule out the possibility of a cardiac tumor or a sarcoma. Those would require further investigation.\n\nIn the end, I'm going with right atrial thrombus as the top diagnosis, followed by pulmonary embolism, and then cardiac tumor as a close third. The other possibilities, like aortic disease or infection, just don't fit the evidence as well.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Pulmonary Embolism** - Given the patient's history and current symptoms, this is a strong contender.\n2. **Right Atrial Thrombus** - The echocardiogram showing a large, mobile mass straddling the tricuspid valve supports this diagnosis.\n3. **Cardiac Tumor (Myxoma)** - Although less likely, cardiac tumors can be mobile and cause obstructive symptoms.\n4. **Aortic Dissection** - Chest pain and shortness of breath could fit, but the echocardiogram does not support this.\n5. **Pericardial Effusion** - Could cause chest pain and breathing issues, but the mass on the echocardiogram doesn't align with this.\n6. **Arrhythmia (Atrial Fibrillation)** - Could cause lightheadedness and shortness of breath, but the ECG shows normal sinus rhythm.\n7. **Pneumonia** - Dry cough and chest pain could fit, but the CT angiogram doesn't show signs of pneumonia.\n8. **Pneumothorax** - Could cause chest pain and shortness of breath, but the CT findings don't indicate this.\n9. **Infective Endocarditis** - Elevated inflammatory markers could suggest this, but no heart murmurs or vegetations are present.\n10. **Pulmonary Artery Sarcoma** - A rare possibility that could explain the mass and symptoms, but would require further investigation.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top three differential diagnoses, in order of likelihood, are:\n\n1. **Right Atrial Thrombus** - The mobile mass on the echocardiogram and the patient's history of pulmonary embolism make this the most likely diagnosis.\n2. **Pulmonary Embolism** - The CT angiogram confirms an occlusive pulmonary embolism, which aligns with the patient's symptoms and history.\n3. **Cardiac Tumor (Myxoma)** - Although less likely, it remains a possibility due to the mass's characteristics and the patient's symptoms.\n\nThe other possibilities, such as aortic disease or infection, are less likely given the evidence presented.

He reported experiencing light sensitivity and mild eye pain. He was in otherwise good health without any chronic medical problems. He reported receiving anticoagulation therapy in the past for a mitral valve problem. His visual acuity was 20/200 OD and 20/20 OS. The examination of the left eye was unremarkable. Slitlamp examination of his right eye revealed 3+ anterior chamber inflammation with vitreous cells. An examination of the dilated fundus showed optic nerve edema with an overlying white infiltrate. In addition, there was inferior retinal whitening consistent with an artery occlusion (Figure 1A). The whitening was attributable to inner retina ischemia, with sparing in the distribution of the cilioretinal artery. An inferior hemicentral retinal artery occlusion was confirmed on intravenous fluorescein angiography (Figure 1B). No embolus was noted at any retinal artery branch points.

That's inflammation in the eye, so something's definitely going on there.\n\nNow, he's got a history of anticoagulation for a mitral valve issue. That's interesting. Anticoagulation can lead to bleeding, but it can also make you more vulnerable to certain types of infections or complications. Hmm, something to keep in mind.\n\nHis visual acuity is really poor in that eye, 20/200, whereas the other eye is perfect. That's a big difference. And the exam shows a lot of inflammation in the front part of the eye and some weird stuff in the back with the optic nerve and retina.\n\nThere's this white infiltrate over the optic nerve and some retinal whitening. That sounds like an artery occlusion. The sparing of certain areas suggests it's not a full occlusion, maybe just a branch. And the fluorescein angiography confirms it's an inferior hemicentral retinal artery occlusion. No embolus is seen, which is curious.\n\nNow, let's not forget the dog bite. That was 2 months ago, and since then, he's had a cough, night sweats, and fevers. Those symptoms are lingering and weren't resolved with antibiotics. That's a red flag for something more than a simple infection.\n\nOkay, let's think about what could be going on. The sudden vision loss and artery occlusion make me think of something like giant cell arteritis. It's known for causing vision problems and has systemic symptoms like fevers and weight loss. But, he's not reporting jaw claudication or headaches, which are common with GCA.\n\nThe dog bite and systemic symptoms could point towards an infection like Capnocytophaga canimorsus. It's a bacteria from dog mouths and can cause some serious issues. But, it usually causes more of a septic picture, not just a cough and night sweats.\n\nOh, what about Bartonella henselae? It's associated with cat scratch disease, but dogs can carry it too. It can cause neuroretinal serous detachment and systemic symptoms like fever. That might fit, but it's not a perfect match.\n\nLet's not forget about other possibilities like sarcoidosis. It can cause uveitis and systemic symptoms, but it doesn't usually cause sudden vision loss like this.\n\nHmm, maybe it's something like Eales disease. It's a rare condition that affects the retina and can cause occlusions. But, it's more common in young adults, so it's a stretch.\n\nWhat about syphilis? It can cause a range of eye problems, including uveitis and retinal issues. And it can have systemic symptoms too. That might be worth considering.\n\nOh, and there's also the possibility of a central nervous system lymphoma. It can cause eye problems and systemic symptoms, but it's pretty rare.\n\nLet's see, what else? Ah, tuberculosis. It can cause uveitis and systemic symptoms like night sweats. And it can be associated with retinal problems too. That's another possibility.\n\nFinally, let's think about autoimmune conditions like lupus. It can cause a wide range of symptoms, including eye problems and systemic issues. But, there's no other systemic involvement mentioned, so it's a bit of a reach.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top differential diagnosis is Bartonella henselae.

She was initially diagnosed with metastatic involvement of the liver, bone, and intra-abdominal lymph nodes in 2015 and received 3 treatments with peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) in 2017. After 2 years of disease stability she was retreated with PRRT in November 2019 because of radiographic progression of disease and worsening symptoms. A third dose of PRRT was given in March 2020; a fourth was deferred owing to persistent thrombocytopenia after treatment. Gallium 68 dotatate positron emission tomography–computed tomography in July 2020 revealed stable disease (Figure, A). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Neuroendocrine tumor infiltration of bone marrow", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 72-year-old woman dealing with a neuroendocrine tumor that's spread to her liver, bones, and lymph nodes. She's been through quite a bit with her treatments, including some PRRT, and now she's feeling more fatigued and having these flushing episodes. That's got to be tough.\n\nFirst off, the fatigue could be from anemia. It's pretty common, especially with cancer patients who have been through multiple treatments. I mean, anemia can definitely cause that kind of tiredness.\n\nBut then, there's the flushing. That's interesting because it makes me think of carcinoid syndrome. It's something that can happen with neuroendocrine tumors when they release certain chemicals. So, maybe her tumor is acting up more.\n\nNow, about the thrombocytopenia. That's a low platelet count, and it's a bit concerning. It could be a side effect from her PRRT treatments. I've heard that can happen, especially after multiple doses.\n\nHmm, what about the possibility of a bleeding disorder? If her platelets are low, that could explain some of the fatigue too, right? Maybe she's having some bleeding somewhere that we're not seeing.\n\nOh, and there's the stable disease on her scan. That's good news, but it doesn't necessarily mean everything's okay. The tumor could still be causing problems without growing in size.\n\nLet's not forget about the liver. Since it's involved, there could be liver dysfunction. That can definitely cause fatigue and maybe even some flushing.\n\nPheochromocytoma crossed my mind too. It's a tumor that secretes stuff like catecholamines, which could cause flushing and fatigue. But it's not as common, so maybe it's a stretch.\n\nHow about hypogonadism? It's a long shot, but hormonal changes can cause fatigue. And with all the treatments she's had, who knows?\n\nNutritional deficiencies could be playing a role too. If her gut's not absorbing nutrients properly because of the tumor or treatments, that could lead to fatigue.\n\nAnd finally, there's the possibility of a hematological disorder, like myelodysplastic syndrome. It's a condition where the bone marrow doesn't work right, leading to things like anemia and low platelets. That would fit with her symptoms and treatment history.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think my top suspects are anemia, carcinoid syndrome, and myelodysplastic syndrome. They all seem to fit with what's going on. But I should keep an open mind about the others too, just in case.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's symptoms, along with a final ranking of the most likely conditions:\n\n1. **Anemia** - Given the patient's history of cancer and multiple treatments, anemia is a common cause of fatigue.\n2. **Carcinoid Syndrome** - The flushing episodes are characteristic of this syndrome, which can occur with neuroendocrine tumors.\n3. **Thrombocytopenia** - A known side effect of PRRT, which could contribute to fatigue and bleeding risks.\n4. **Bleeding Disorder** - Low platelet counts could lead to bleeding, exacerbating fatigue.\n5. **Liver Dysfunction** - With liver involvement, dysfunction could cause fatigue and flushing.\n6. **Pheochromocytoma** - Although less common, it could cause flushing and fatigue due to catecholamine secretion.\n7. **Hypogonadism** - Hormonal changes from treatment could contribute to fatigue.\n8. **Nutritional Deficiencies** - Malabsorption due to tumor or treatment effects could lead to fatigue.\n9. **Myelodysplastic Syndrome** - A condition where bone marrow doesn't function properly, leading to anemia and low platelets.\n10. **Hematological Malignancy** - A broader category including myelodysplastic syndrome, considering her treatment history.\n\nRanking these based on the patient's symptoms and history, the top three differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Myelodysplastic Syndrome** - This condition aligns with the patient's symptoms of fatigue, thrombocytopenia, and treatment history.\n2. **Carcinoid Syndrome** - The flushing is a strong indicator of this syndrome, commonly associated with neuroendocrine tumors.\n3. **Anemia** - A likely contributor to fatigue, given the patient's cancer and treatment background.\n\nThese three conditions best explain the combination of symptoms and the patient's medical history. However, it's important to consider all possibilities in a clinical setting.", "topic": "['Oncology', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine', 'Hematology']"}

He was otherwise healthy, with no family history of a similar condition. Physical examination results showed multiple dome-shaped, skin-colored, firm papules on his right lower back, arranged in a blaschkoid distribution (Figure 1A). The lesions varied in size, with some coalescing into irregular-shaped, larger papules. Telangiectasis could be seen on some of the lesions. A skin biopsy was performed on his back and submitted for further histopathologic analysis (Figure 1B and C). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Mucinous nevus", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a man in his 60s with these itchy bumps on his lower back. They're on one side, which is kind of interesting. And they're dome-shaped and skin-colored, so that's something to note. They're firm too, which might mean something. Oh, and they follow a sort of line, like a stripe, which reminds me of something called a Blaschko's line. That's a bit of a clue.\n\nNow, what could cause this kind of pattern? I know that certain skin conditions like lichen planus or eczema can follow these lines, but let's not jump to conclusions yet. The fact that these papules are on one side and have telangiectasia, those little blood vessels on the surface, makes me think of something more specific. Hmm, could it be a vascular issue?\n\nLet's think about the biopsy. If it shows certain features like interface dermatitis, that might point towards something like lichen planus. But if there are a lot of blood vessels or something unusual, maybe it's a vascular condition. I should keep that in mind.\n\nOkay, so what are the possibilities? At first glance, lichen planus seems like a strong contender. It fits the description pretty well. But wait, the telangiectasia is making me second guess that. Maybe it's something like discoid lupus erythematosus? That can have telangiectasia too.\n\nBut discoid lupus usually has more disc-shaped lesions and might be more scaly. So, maybe that's not it. What about follicular lichen planus? That could explain the papular nature, but does it explain the telangiectasia? Hmm, not really.\n\nLet's think outside the box. Could it be a type of lymphoma, like mycosis fungoides? That can have strange presentations and might follow Blaschko's lines. But usually, it has more plaques or patches, not just papules.\n\nWhat about benign lichenoid keratosis? That can look similar and might explain the telangiectasia. It's a possibility, but it's usually more of a solitary lesion, not multiple like this.\n\nMaybe it's a vascular tumor, like cherry angiomas? Those are small and papular, and they can be multiple. But they don't usually follow Blaschko's lines. Hmm, that's a puzzle.\n\nLet's not forget about porokeratosis. It can have a similar distribution and might explain the papular nature. But it usually has a distinctive cornoid lamella on biopsy, so I'd need to check for that.\n\nOh, and what about Darier's disease? It can have papular lesions and follow Blaschko's lines. But it usually has more of a greasy, warty appearance, and acantholytic cells on biopsy. That doesn't quite match what we have here.\n\nSo, after thinking it all through, I'm leaning towards lichen planus as the most likely diagnosis. It fits the clinical presentation and the histological features. But I'm keeping porokeratosis and benign lichenoid keratosis as possibilities too, just in case something unexpected shows up in the biopsy.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the man's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Lichen Planus** - This condition is known for its pruritic, flat-topped papules that often follow Blaschko's lines, making it a strong initial consideration.\n\n2. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus** - While it typically presents with more disc-shaped, scaly lesions, the presence of telangiectasia could align with this diagnosis.\n\n3. **Follicular Lichen Planus** - A variant of lichen planus that could explain the papular nature, though it less commonly features telangiectasia.\n\n4. **Mycosis Fungoides** - A form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that can present with varied skin lesions, including papules, and may follow Blaschko's lines.\n\n5. **Benign Lichenoid Keratosis** - Usually presents as a solitary lesion, but can appear in multiples and may explain the telangiectasia.\n\n6. **Cherry Angiomas** - Vascular tumors that are small and papular, though they typically do not follow Blaschko's lines.\n\n7. **Porokeratosis** - Can present with a similar distribution and papular lesions, often featuring a cornoid lamella on biopsy.\n\n8. **Darier's Disease** - Characterized by papular lesions following Blaschko's lines, but usually has a greasy, warty appearance and distinct histological features.\n\n9. **Lichen Nitidus** - Presents with tiny, shiny papules that can be scattered or follow Blaschko's lines, though it's less likely given the size and telangiectasia.\n\n10. **Papular Eczema** - A possibility if the lesions are more inflammatory and itchy, though it less commonly follows a clear Blaschko's line pattern.\n\nAfter considering all the clinical and histological information, the top three differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Lichen Planus** - Best fits the clinical presentation and histological features.\n2. **Porokeratosis** - A strong contender if the biopsy shows a cornoid lamella.\n3. **Benign Lichenoid Keratosis** - Possible if the biopsy shows lichenoid dermatitis without distinctive features of lichen planus.\n\nThese diagnoses take into account the unique distribution of the lesions, their appearance, and the presence of telangiectasia.

She denied ocular disease, trauma, or surgery. She had no medical problems aside from chronic back pain due to a herniated disc. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/25 OS. Intraocular pressure, extraocular motility, and pupillary examination results were normal. The right eye was unremarkable. Examination of the left eye showed 2 temporal scleral nodules with surrounding hyperemia and no scleromalacia. She experienced substantial pain with palpation. Posterior examination results were unremarkable. The results of the following laboratory tests were all unremarkable: tuberculosis interferon-γ release assay, rapid plasma reagin, fluorescent treponemal antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and angiotensin-converting enzyme. The rheumatoid factor level (18 IU/mL [normal range, <14 IU/mL]) and C-reactive protein level (26 mg/L [normal range, 0-5 mg/L]) were elevated. In addition, Lyme IgG, IgM, and reflex Western blot assays were positive for antibodies. The patient denied travel to Lyme-endemic regions, tick bites, or rashes. The patient started oral prednisone therapy for possible rheumatoid arthritis (RA)–associated nodular scleritis, doxycycline therapy for positive Lyme studies, and was referred to a rheumatologist for further RA evaluation. Two weeks after presentation and initiation of oral prednisone therapy, the patient noted improvement in pain, but the scleral nodules and hyperemia persisted. Therefore, subconjunctival triamcinolone acetonide (0.5 mL of 40 mg/mL) was administered to the left eye. Further confirmatory RA workup by rheumatology did not reveal other systemic findings thought to be associated with RA on review of symptoms or clinical examination. The patient's back pain was associated with her herniated disc. Subsequently, the patient’s examination results showed new scleral thinning of the left eye with persistence of the scleral nodules (Figure 1). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Mycobacterium infectious scleritis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 50-year-old woman with redness and headaches in her left eye for a couple of months. That's quite a while to be dealing with that. Her CT scan didn't show anything unusual, so it's probably not something going on in the brain. She doesn't have any history of eye problems or injuries, which is good to know. Her vision is pretty good, and her eye pressures and movements are normal, so that's not the issue either. But she does have these two nodules on the white part of her left eye, and they're really tender. That sounds like it could be nodular scleritis.\n\nNow, let's see what the tests tell us. Her rheumatoid factor and CRP are elevated. That's interesting because it could point towards something like rheumatoid arthritis. But then, she also has positive Lyme tests. That's a bit confusing because she doesn't have any history of tick bites or rashes, and she hasn't been to any Lyme disease-prone areas. Hmm, that's something to think about.\n\nSo, she started on prednisone for possible RA-related scleritis and doxycycline for the Lyme disease. But two weeks later, while her pain improved, those nodules and redness are still there. That's not the response we'd expect if it was just inflammation from RA. So, they tried a steroid injection, but now there's scleral thinning. That's not good.\n\nLet's go through some possibilities. First off, rheumatoid arthritis is still on the table because of the elevated rheumatoid factor. But the lack of systemic symptoms is making me doubt it a bit. Then there's Lyme disease, but without the typical history or symptoms, it feels like a stretch. What about syphilis? The tests were negative, so that's probably not it. Tuberculosis? The test for that was negative too. Hmm, what else?\n\nRelapsing polychondritis could be a contender. It can cause scleritis and doesn't always have obvious systemic symptoms right away. And systemic lupus erythematosus? It can cause all sorts of inflammation, but usually, there are more systemic signs. Polyarteritis nodosa is another one, but it typically involves other symptoms too.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about infections like herpes zoster. But she didn't have a rash, so that's unlikely. What about autoimmune disorders like ANCA-associated vasculitis? The tests didn't show that, but maybe it's worth reconsidering.\n\nOkay, so after thinking it through, here's where I'm landing. The top possibility is relapsing polychondritis. It fits the eye symptoms, and the lack of systemic involvement isn't unheard of. Then comes rheumatoid arthritis, even though it's not perfect. Lyme disease is still on the list, but it feels less likely. And then there's polyarteritis nodosa, systemic lupus erythematosus, and ANCA-associated vasculitis. They all have their pros and cons, but they're a bit further down the list.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Relapsing Polychondritis** - This condition can cause scleritis and may not present with immediate systemic symptoms, making it a strong contender.\n\n2. **Rheumatoid Arthritis** - Elevated rheumatoid factor and response to prednisone suggest RA, but the lack of systemic symptoms is noteworthy.\n\n3. **Lyme Disease** - Positive Lyme tests are present, but without typical history or symptoms, it's less convincing.\n\n4. **Polyarteritis Nodosa** - This vasculitis can cause various symptoms, but it typically involves more systemic manifestations.\n\n5. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus** - SLE can cause widespread inflammation, but usually, there are more systemic signs present.\n\n6. **ANCA-associated Vasculitis** - Although tests were negative, it might be worth reconsidering due to the eye involvement.\n\n7. **Herpes Zoster** - Unlikely due to the absence of a rash, but could be considered if other symptoms arise.\n\n8. **Syphilis** - Negative tests make this less likely, but atypical presentations can occur.\n\n9. **Tuberculosis** - Negative test result lowers its likelihood, but it could be considered in endemic areas or with specific exposure history.\n\n10. **Idiopathic Scleritis** - If no systemic cause is found, idiopathic scleritis remains a possibility.\n\nThese differential diagnoses are ranked based on the combination of clinical presentation, test results, and response to treatment, with relapsing polychondritis being the most likely given the current information.", "topic": "['Ophthalmology', 'Intraocular Inflammation', 'Infectious Diseases']"}

The patient had persistent hypotension. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Kounis syndrome (acute coronary vasospasm associated with anaphylactoid response)", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. The patient is in their 20s and came in with presyncope, hives, and nausea after being out in the cold. That's interesting. Cold exposure leading to these symptoms makes me think of cold urticaria or maybe cold-induced anaphylaxis right off the bat. \n\nBut wait, there's more. Their vital signs are a bit alarming—rapid pulse, low blood pressure, and they're in respiratory distress with bilateral wheezing. This really sounds like some kind of severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis. \n\nThey were given epinephrine, which is standard for anaphylaxis, but then things got complicated. Right after the epinephrine, they developed a headache, nausea, and chest pain. Hmm, that's not what you expect to see. \n\nCould this be related to the epinephrine? Maybe. Epinephrine can cause some intense side effects, like headaches or chest pain, due to its stimulant effects. But let's not jump to conclusions yet. \n\nThe ECG was done 5 minutes after the epinephrine. I wonder if it shows anything unusual. Could it be an arrhythmia or ischemia? That would be concerning. \n\nOkay, let's think about other possibilities. The symptoms started after cold exposure. Could it be a cold-induced issue like cold urticaria or even cold agglutinin disease? Those can cause some systemic responses, but the severity here seems more acute. \n\nWhat about hereditary angioedema? It can cause swelling and respiratory issues, but usually not with hives. And it doesn't quite fit the rapid onset after cold exposure. \n\nLet's not forget about other potential allergic reactions, like those to something they might have eaten or come into contact with. Could there be another allergen at play? \n\nOh, and there's the possibility of mastocytosis. That's a condition where there are too many mast cells, which can lead to episodes of anaphylaxis. It might explain the severity and the response to epinephrine. \n\nNow, considering the persistent hypotension, could this be septic shock? It's a bit of a stretch given the context, but we can't rule out everything. \n\nAnd what about an anxiety-related reaction? Could this be panic attack symptoms triggered by the cold? It's possible, but the severity of the physiological response seems too great for just anxiety. \n\nFinally, let's think about a cardiogenic issue, like a cardiac tamponade. That could explain the hypotension and chest pain, but it doesn't quite fit with the hives and response to cold. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top differential diagnosis here is anaphylaxis, likely triggered by cold exposure. The response to epinephrine and the symptoms fit well. Mastocytosis is also a strong contender given the severity and the symptoms. Cold urticaria is possible, but it doesn't explain everything. And we can't completely rule out hereditary angioedema or a cardiogenic issue, but they seem less likely. \n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Anaphylaxis** - The symptoms of presyncope, hives, nausea, rapid pulse, low blood pressure, and respiratory distress after cold exposure strongly suggest anaphylaxis, especially given the response to epinephrine.\n\n2. **Cold Urticaria** - This condition involves hives triggered by cold exposure and could explain some of the symptoms, but typically doesn't involve such severe systemic reactions.\n\n3. **Mastocytosis** - This is a condition where excessive mast cells could lead to severe allergic reactions, which aligns with the patient's symptoms and their severe response to epinephrine.\n\n4. **Hereditary Angioedema** - Although it can cause swelling and respiratory issues, it usually doesn't present with hives, making it less likely in this scenario.\n\n5. **Cold Agglutinin Disease** - This condition involves the agglutination of red blood cells in cold temperatures, leading to hemolytic anemia, but doesn't typically cause acute allergic reactions.\n\n6. **Epinephrine-Induced Complications** - The headache, nausea, and chest pain following epinephrine administration could be side effects of the medication itself, but don't explain the initial symptoms.\n\n7. **Other Allergic Reactions** - The possibility of an allergic reaction to an ingested or environmental allergen should be considered, but the specific trigger of cold exposure makes this less likely.\n\n8. **Septic Shock** - Although persistent hypotension could suggest septic shock, the context and acute onset after cold exposure make this less plausible.\n\n9. **Anxiety-Related Reaction** - A panic attack could cause some similar symptoms, but the physiological response seems too severe for this diagnosis alone.\n\n10. **Cardiogenic Issue (e.g., Cardiac Tamponade)** - This could explain hypotension and chest pain but doesn't account for the hives and response to cold exposure.\n\nUpon reviewing all the information, the top differential diagnoses are anaphylaxis and mastocytosis, as they best explain the severity of the symptoms and the response to treatment. Cold urticaria is also a consideration, but it doesn't fully capture the systemic nature of the reaction. Hereditary angioedema and cardiogenic issues are less likely given the presentation.", "topic": "['Cardiology', 'Pain Medicine', 'Allergy and Clinical Immunology', 'Dermatology']"}

Choroidal nevus is pretty common too, and it's usually benign. It's like a mole in the eye, and most of the time, it doesn't cause any problems. So, that's another possibility.\n\nNow, what about metastatic tumors? They can show up in the choroid too, especially in older people. If she's had cancer elsewhere, that would make this more likely. But we don't have any information about her having cancer before, so it's hard to say how likely this is.\n\nOh, and there's choroidal hemangioma. That's another one to think about. It's a benign vascular tumor, and it can look similar on an ultrasound. But it's not as common as melanoma or nevus.\n\nLet's not forget about congenital conditions like congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium, or CHRPE. It's usually found when people are younger, but it's possible for it to be found later in life too. It's benign, so it's not something that would cause symptoms, but it could be what we're seeing here.\n\nOkay, so we've got a few possibilities. But let's think about the details. The mass is variably pigmented and elevated, and it's got that dome shape with posterior shadowing on ultrasound. That sounds a lot like choroidal melanoma. But, it doesn't have any subretinal fluid or orange pigment, which are things we often see with melanoma.\n\nHmm, what about the history? She had retinal detachment surgery a long time ago. Could this be related? It's possible that the mass is a consequence of that, maybe a fibrotic scar or something like that. But it seems unlikely to be the cause of a new mass all these years later.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Choroidal melanoma is still top of the list because of the characteristics of the mass. But we can't completely rule out other things like a choroidal nevus or even a metastatic tumor if there's some unknown history of cancer. CHRPE is a possibility too, given the benign nature and the fact that it doesn't cause symptoms.\n\nIn the end, we need to keep a broad differential. Choroidal melanoma is the most likely, but we should also consider choroidal nevus, metastatic tumor, choroidal hemangioma, and CHRPE. Each of these has some features that fit what we're seeing, and we can't ignore that.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the choroidal mass in the 89-year-old woman's left eye, considering the characteristics and history:\n\n1. **Choroidal Melanoma** - This is the most likely diagnosis given the age of the patient and the characteristics of the mass, such as its size, shape, and ultrasound features.\n\n2. **Choroidal Nevus** - A common benign pigmented lesion that could appear similar but is usually stable over time.\n\n3. **Metastatic Tumor** - Possible, especially in older adults with a history of cancer, but there's no known cancer history provided.\n\n4. **Choroidal Hemangioma** - A benign vascular tumor that can present similarly on imaging.\n\n5. **Congenital Hypertrophy of the Retinal Pigment Epithelium (CHRPE)** - A benign condition that could be found incidentally and fits the description of a pigmented lesion.\n\n6. **Fibrotic Scar** - A possible consequence of her previous retinal detachment surgery, but less likely to present as a new mass.\n\n7. **Choroidal Osteoma** - A benign bony tumor that can appear as a choroidal mass, often in younger patients.\n\n8. **Choroidal Lymphoma** - A rare condition that can present with a choroidal mass, often associated with systemic disease.\n\n9. **Hemangiopericytoma** - A rare vascular tumor that can occur in the choroid.\n\n10. **Leiomyoma** - A rare smooth muscle tumor that can present as a choroidal mass.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses, in order of likelihood, are:\n\n1. **Choroidal Melanoma**\n2. **Choroidal Nevus**\n3. **Metastatic Tumor**\n4. **Choroidal Hemangioma**\n5. **CHRPE**\n\nThese diagnoses take into account the patient's age, the mass's characteristics, and the lack of symptoms or fluid, which are important factors in narrowing down the possibilities.", "topic": "['Retinal Disorders', 'Ophthalmology', 'Geriatrics', 'Ophthalmic Imaging', 'Choroidal Disorders']"}

She reported no known trauma, and no motor or sensory deficits were noted during clinical examination. She had no fever. After the initial sarcoma diagnosis in September 2018, the patient received 8 cycles of doxorubicin hydrochloride and ifosfamide along with regional hyperthermia, followed by good tumor response. The patient had a history of a pathological fracture of L4, which had been treated with radiotherapy and vertebroplasty in November 2019 and remained unchanged on imaging obtained in April 2020. The treatment regimen recently had been switched to gemcitabine hydrochloride and docetaxel in January 2020 following osseous progression during maintenance chemotherapy with trofosfamide, idarubicin hydrochloride, and etoposide. On restaging computed tomography, symmetrical enlargement of both psoas muscles was observed with intramuscular hypodensity (Figure, A). The patient reported lower back pain but no motor or sensory deficits. Further workup with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed extensive, nearly symmetrical swelling in both psoas muscles and sharply delineated, peripheral contrast enhancement of the fascia with strict horizontal bounds (Figure, B and C). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Radiation recall myositis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 39-year-old woman with a history of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and bone metastases. She's been through quite a bit already, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Now she's dealing with lower back pain that gets worse when she's standing or walking. That's got to be tough.\n\nFirst off, the pain could be from a musculoskeletal issue. Maybe something like a muscle strain? That's pretty common, but let's not jump to conclusions just yet.\n\nNow, considering her cancer history, metastatic disease is definitely on the table. Cancer can spread to bones and cause a lot of pain, so that's a strong possibility. Bone metastases could be making things worse, especially with that history of a pathological fracture in her L4 vertebra.\n\nBut wait, there's also the recent change in her chemo regimen. She switched to gemcitabine and docetaxel in January. Could this be a reaction to the new meds? Some drugs can cause muscle pain or weakness. It's worth thinking about.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about the imaging. The CT and MRI show symmetrical enlargement of both psoas muscles with some weird hypodensity. That's not your run-of-the-mill finding. It could be something like a myositis or maybe even a recurrence of her sarcoma in the muscles.\n\nHmm, what about infections? An abscess could cause pain and muscle changes, but she doesn't have a fever or any signs of infection. Still, we shouldn't completely rule it out yet.\n\nNow, considering the symmetrical muscle changes, could this be some kind of paraneoplastic syndrome? Those can cause muscle issues too, even if it's not a direct tumor invasion.\n\nLet's also think about the possibility of radiation fibrosis. She had radiotherapy in the past, and that can cause changes in the tissues that might lead to pain and muscle stiffness.\n\nAnd then there's the idea of a benign condition like fibromyalgia. It's not directly related to her cancer, but chronic pain conditions can develop in anyone, especially under stress.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? We've got a few strong contenders. Metastatic disease and a local recurrence of sarcoma are high on the list. Chemotherapy-induced myopathy is possible too. And we can't completely rule out an abscess or paraneoplastic syndrome yet.\n\nAfter going through everything, I think metastatic disease is the most likely cause of her pain, given her history. But we should keep an eye on the other possibilities too, just in case.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's lower back pain, considering her history of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and recent changes in her treatment regimen:\n\n1. **Metastatic Disease** - Given her history of bone metastases, this is a strong possibility for her lower back pain.\n2. **Local Recurrence of Sarcoma** - The symmetrical enlargement of the psoas muscles could indicate a recurrence of her sarcoma in the muscle tissue.\n3. **Chemotherapy-induced Myopathy** - The recent change in her chemotherapy regimen could be causing muscle pain or weakness.\n4. **Muscle Strain** - A common musculoskeletal issue that could be contributing to her pain.\n5. **Abscess** - Although she has no fever, an abscess could still be a consideration given the muscle changes observed in imaging.\n6. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - This could be causing muscle issues even without direct tumor invasion.\n7. **Radiation Fibrosis** - Previous radiotherapy could have led to tissue changes resulting in pain and stiffness.\n8. **Fibromyalgia** - A chronic pain condition that could have developed under the stress of her ongoing health issues.\n9. **Myositis** - Inflammation of the muscles could be causing the pain and changes seen on imaging.\n10. **Osteonecrosis** - A possibility due to her history of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which can affect bone health.\n\nAfter considering all the information, metastatic disease and local recurrence of sarcoma remain the most likely causes of her pain.

They denied headache, scalp tenderness, and jaw claudication. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 103 mm/h and a magnetic resonance angiographic examination of the brain was negative for mass, infarction, and hemorrhage. Examination results of a right, superficial, temporal artery biopsy specimen showed chronic, nongranulomatous inflammation surrounding adventitial vessels and extensive subintimal fibrosis, without giant cells or segmental loss of the internal elastic lamina, which was interpreted as compatible with temporal arteritis. High-dose corticosteroid therapy was initiated (1 g methylprednisolone intravenously for 3 days followed by 60 mg/d of oral prednisone). A neuro-ophthalmologic examination performed 1 week later showed an unreactive left pupil with an obvious relative afferent pupillary defect. Optic nerve pallor concomitant with edema and a single flame-shaped hemorrhage at the 4-o’clock position on the disc margin was also observed. Two weeks later, persistent elevation of the ESR and C-reactive protein levels, despite continued oral prednisone therapy, prompted a review of the temporal artery biopsy findings. This disclosed abundant transmural deposits of amorphous eosinophilic acellular material that was congophilic and exhibited apple-green birefringence under polarized light, consistent with amyloid deposits (Figure). Immunohistochemical staining showed IgM and λ light chain restriction. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Systemic amyloidosis in the setting of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (Waldenström macroglobulinemia)", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a patient in their late 70s who suddenly can't see out of their left eye. That's pretty alarming, and it's painless too. Hmm, sudden and painless vision loss in someone older makes me think of a few things right away. Giant cell arteritis is definitely on the list because it's known for causing vision problems in this age group. But wait, there's more to consider.\n\nThe patient has a history of Crohn's disease, coronary artery disease, and high cholesterol. Plus, they've had a transient ischemic attack before. That's quite a mix of vascular issues. So, I'm thinking vascular problems could be at play here too. Maybe something like a central retinal artery occlusion? That can cause sudden vision loss as well.\n\nNow, let's look at the test results. The ESR is really high at 103 mm/h. That's a big red flag for inflammation, which fits with something like giant cell arteritis. But the biopsy of the temporal artery is interesting. It shows chronic inflammation but no giant cells. That's a bit odd for giant cell arteritis, isn't it?\n\nOh, and there's more. The biopsy also shows amyloid deposits and IgM with λ light chain restriction. That's a curveball. Amyloid deposits make me think of amyloidosis, and the IgM and λ light chain restriction point towards something like Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. This is getting complex.\n\nSo, let's put it all together. We've got sudden vision loss, high ESR, and biopsy findings that suggest both inflammation and amyloid deposits. Giant cell arteritis was my first thought, but the biopsy doesn't fully support that. Maybe it's more like amyloidosis or Waldenström's macroglobulinemia causing these symptoms.\n\nBut wait, let's not forget about the vascular issues. With the patient's history, a vascular event like a central retinal artery occlusion is still possible. And what about the Crohn's disease? Could that be linked to some sort of vasculitis?\n\nAlright, let's rank our possibilities. Giant cell arteritis is still on the list, but it's not the top suspect anymore. Amyloidosis and Waldenström's macroglobulinemia are moving up because of the biopsy findings. And let's not ignore the vascular causes like central retinal artery occlusion. We should also consider if Crohn's disease is playing a role here.\n\nIn the end, I think we're looking at a combination of issues. The amyloid deposits and λ light chain restriction are strong clues pointing towards amyloidosis or Waldenström's. But we can't ignore the vascular history and the possibility of a central retinal artery occlusion. It's a complex case, and we need to consider all these factors.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, considering all the symptoms, history, and test results:\n\n1. **Giant Cell Arteritis** - Initially considered due to the patient's age and symptoms, but the biopsy findings do not fully support this diagnosis.\n\n2. **Amyloidosis** - The presence of amyloid deposits in the biopsy is a strong indicator of amyloidosis, which could be contributing to the vision loss and elevated ESR.\n\n3. **Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia** - The IgM and λ light chain restriction suggest this condition, which can cause hyperviscosity and lead to vascular issues like vision loss.\n\n4. **Central Retinal Artery Occlusion** - Given the patient's vascular history, this is a plausible cause of the sudden vision loss.\n\n5. **Vasculitis** - The chronic inflammation in the biopsy could indicate a type of vasculitis, potentially related to the Crohn's disease.\n\n6. **Temporal Arteritis** - Although the biopsy doesn't show giant cells, the inflammation and patient's age keep this in consideration.\n\n7. **Ischemic Optic Neuropathy** - This could result from the vascular issues and fits with the sudden vision loss.\n\n8. **Cancer-associated Vasculitis** - The patient's age and biopsy findings raise the possibility of a paraneoplastic syndrome.\n\n9. **IgM-related Disease** - The λ light chain restriction could indicate an IgM-related disorder affecting blood vessels and vision.\n\n10. **Mixed Cryoglobulinemia** - This condition involves cryoglobulins that can cause vascular symptoms and vision changes.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are **Amyloidosis** and **Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia**, given the biopsy findings and the patient's symptoms. **Central Retinal Artery Occlusion** and **Vasculitis** are also strong contenders due to the vascular history and biopsy results.

They're reddish-brown, smooth, and dome-shaped. Okay, so what could this be?\n\nFirst off, dermatofibromas come to mind. They're pretty common and can show up as firm, reddish-brown papules. But usually, they're not in multiples like this, so maybe that's not it.\n\nNext, let's consider lupus vulgaris. It's a type of skin tuberculosis, and it can cause reddish-brown lesions. But, it often has a more granular appearance and might be more of a plaque than a papule. Plus, it's not typically on the hands. Hmm, maybe not lupus vulgaris.\n\nHow about lichen planus? It can cause flat-topped papules, but they're usually purplish, not reddish-brown. And they often involve the wrists and ankles, not so much the hands and forearms. So, probably not lichen planus.\n\nLet's think about xanthomas. They're lipid deposits that can appear as yellowish papules, but these papules aren't yellow, so that doesn't quite fit.\n\nWhat about cherry angiomas? They're common and appear as reddish spots, but they're usually more of a macule than a papule. Plus, they tend to appear in older adults. So, maybe not cherry angiomas.\n\nCould it be discoid lupus erythematosus? It can cause red, inflammatory lesions, but they're usually more disc-shaped and scaly. And they often involve the face, not the hands. So, probably not discoid lupus.\n\nLet's not forget about sarcoidosis. It can cause papules, especially in African American women, but they're often more of a plaque and can involve other organs. There's no systemic involvement here, so maybe not sarcoidosis.\n\nHow about granuloma annulare? It can cause papules that form rings, but these papules aren't really forming rings. So, probably not granuloma annulare.\n\nLet's think about eruptive xanthomas. They're caused by lipid metabolism issues and can appear suddenly, but these papules have been there since childhood. So, not eruptive xanthomas.\n\nLastly, could it be tuberous sclerosis? It can cause skin findings like shagreen patches and periungual fibromas, but not really reddish-brown papules on the hands. So, probably not tuberous sclerosis.\n\nOkay, let's put it all together. The most likely diagnosis, considering the chronic, asymptomatic nature and the appearance of these papules, is probably dermatofibromas. They fit the description pretty well, even if they're a bit atypical in number. Yeah, dermatofibromas seem like the best fit here.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the woman's condition is dermatofibromas. These are common, benign skin lesions that can appear as firm, reddish-brown papules, which aligns with the description of the lesions on her hands and forearms. While the multiplicity of the papules is somewhat atypical for dermatofibromas, their chronic and asymptomatic nature, along with their appearance, makes this the most fitting diagnosis among the considered options. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Dermatofibromas** - The most likely diagnosis given the chronic, asymptomatic, reddish-brown, dome-shaped papules.\n2. **Lupus Vulgaris** - Considered due to the reddish-brown color, but less likely because of the papular rather than granular appearance and atypical location.\n3. **Lichen Planus** - Unlikely due to the difference in color and typical location.\n4. **Xanthomas** - Unlikely as the papules are not yellowish.\n5. **Cherry Angiomas** - Unlikely due to the macular nature and typical appearance in older adults.\n6. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus** - Unlikely due to the lack of disc-shaped, scaly lesions and typical facial involvement.\n7. **Sarcoidosis** - Unlikely due to the absence of systemic involvement and typical plaque formation.\n8. **Granuloma Annulare** - Unlikely as the papules do not form rings.\n9. **Eruptive Xanthomas** - Unlikely due to the chronic nature of the papules and lack of sudden onset.\n10. **Tuberous Sclerosis** - Unlikely as the papules do not match the typical skin findings associated with this condition.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Hematology']"}

Progressive hypoxia refractory to mechanical ventilation necessitated venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) using the ProtekDuo dual-lumen cannula (LivaNova). In its standard configuration, deoxygenated blood is drained from the right atrium while oxygenated blood is ejected into the main pulmonary artery, and the device serves as both a right ventricular support and an ECMO (RVS-ECMO) cannula. End-stage lung disease was established and, as part of a lung transplant evaluation, the patient underwent catheterization of the left side of the heart and coronary angiography. The left coronary artery angiogram revealed mild luminal irregularities. The right coronary artery (RCA) angiogram is shown in Figure 1 and Video 1. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Right coronary artery compression by the right ventricular angulation of the RVS-ECMO cannula", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. The patient is experiencing rapidly worsening shortness of breath, and it's not getting better with antibiotics. That's a big red flag that this might not be a simple pneumonia. So, what else could it be? Hmm, maybe something like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) since it's known for causing similar symptoms.\n\nNow, let's consider the chest CT scan. It shows diffuse ground-glass opacities. That's interesting because it's a hallmark of certain conditions. ARDS could definitely cause this, but we should also think about other possibilities like pneumocystis pneumonia, especially since it can look similar on a scan.\n\nThe fact that the infectious disease workup didn't show anything is a bit surprising. If it's not an infection, then what? Could it be an autoimmune issue like dermatomyositis-associated interstitial lung disease? That would fit with the CT findings and the lack of infection evidence.\n\nOh, and the patient has been diagnosed with acute-on-chronic respiratory failure due to dermatomyositis-associated interstitial lung disease. That makes sense given the information we have. But let's not stop there. We should also consider other conditions that could cause these symptoms and scan results, like diffuse alveolar hemorrhage or even something like acute interstitial pneumonia.\n\nThe patient's condition is so severe that they needed to be put on venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO). That's a pretty big deal and suggests the lungs are really not functioning well. This could happen in cases of severe ARDS or other serious lung diseases.\n\nNow, let's talk about the heart catheterization and coronary angiography. The left coronary artery looks mostly okay, just some mild irregularities. But the right coronary artery (RCA) angiogram is where things get interesting. There's something unusual there, but what could it mean?\n\nCould the RCA finding be related to coronary artery disease? That's possible, but it seems a bit off given the context. Maybe it's something more like coronary artery vasospasm or even an anomaly in the coronary circulation.\n\nWait, let's not forget about the possibility of a pulmonary embolism. It could cause acute respiratory distress and might explain some of the findings, especially if there's something unusual in the RCA.\n\nSo, putting it all together, here's what we're thinking. The top differential diagnoses, in order, are: ARDS, pneumocystis pneumonia, dermatomyositis-associated interstitial lung disease, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, acute interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, coronary artery disease, coronary artery vasospasm, and finally, coronary circulation anomaly. Each of these fits with some part of the clinical picture, and they all need to be considered.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, ensuring that each step introduces a new hypothesis without repetition:\n\n1. **Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)** - This condition is characterized by rapid onset of widespread inflammation in the lungs, leading to diffuse ground-glass opacities on imaging, which matches the patient's presentation.\n\n2. **Pneumocystis Pneumonia** - This infection can cause similar findings on a chest CT scan and is worth considering, especially with the lack of response to empirical antibiotics.\n\n3. **Dermatomyositis-associated Interstitial Lung Disease** - Given the patient's diagnosis of acute-on-chronic respiratory failure due to this condition, it remains a strong contender.\n\n4. **Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage** - This could explain the ground-glass opacities and the severity of the patient's respiratory distress.\n\n5. **Acute Interstitial Pneumonia** - A possible cause of the rapid deterioration and CT findings, often without an infectious trigger.\n\n6. **Pulmonary Embolism** - Could cause acute respiratory distress and might relate to unusual findings in the right coronary artery angiogram.\n\n7. **Coronary Artery Disease** - Although the left coronary artery shows only mild irregularities, coronary artery disease could still contribute to the patient's overall condition.\n\n8. **Coronary Artery Vasospasm** - A possible explanation for the unusual RCA angiogram findings, which might affect cardiac function and indirectly influence respiratory status.\n\n9. **Coronary Circulation Anomaly** - Anomalies in coronary circulation could lead to atypical presentations and complicate the clinical picture.\n\n10. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** - An autoimmune condition that can cause a wide range of symptoms, including lung involvement and coronary issues, which might tie together the various findings.\n\nThese differential diagnoses cover a range of possibilities from pulmonary to cardiac issues, reflecting the complexity and severity of the patient's condition.", "topic": "['Cardiology', 'Critical Care Medicine', 'Respiratory Failure and Ventilation']"}

She was a smoker with hypertension and kidney dysfunction, with a history of left-sided paresthesia. Coronary angiography demonstrated unobstructed coronary arteries. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging revealed subendocardial midinferolateral late gadolinium enhancement with corresponding hypokinesis consistent with a partial-thickness myocardial infarction. Prolonged Holter monitoring showed no evidence of atrial fibrillation. Two years later, she had a similar presentation consistent with a non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Repeated coronary angiography again demonstrated unobstructed coronary arteries. The CMR revealed the same midinferolateral late gadolinium enhancement as at the initial examination (Figure, A) but with focal enhancement on T2 short tau inversion recovery sequences (Figure, B), with increased T1 and T2 values suggestive of associated edema from an acute infarction in the same territory. A mobile interatrial septum was noted on 4-chamber cine imaging. A transthoracic echocardiogram bubble study demonstrated color flow at rest across the interatrial septum and a large shunt on Valsalva maneuver consistent with a grade 3 patent foramen ovale (PFO) (Video). Coincidentally, a brain MR scan to investigate the recurrent paresthesia revealed bilateral white matter lesions thought to be secondary to small-vessel disease greater in number than expected for the patient’s age, raising suspicion for microemboli. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Paradoxical embolism through PFO causing recurrent systemic embolism", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. A middle-aged woman comes in with chest pain and her troponin levels are through the roof. That's a big red flag for something going on with the heart. And then there's the T-wave inversion on the ECG. That's definitely pointing towards some kind of myocardial issue.\n\nNow, she's a smoker and has hypertension and kidney problems. All of these are risk factors for coronary artery disease, so initially, I'm thinking this could be a typical heart attack. But wait, the coronary angiography shows no blockages. That's unexpected. So, it's not your run-of-the-mill coronary artery disease.\n\nThe CMR shows subendocardial late gadolinium enhancement. That suggests some kind of myocardial damage, but it's not full-thickness, so maybe not a full-blown transmural infarction. And there's no atrial fibrillation on the Holter monitor, so we can rule that out as a cause for embolic events.\n\nTwo years later, she's back with the same kind of chest pain. Again, no blockages in the coronary arteries. But the CMR shows the same area of damage and some new edema, suggesting another infarct in the same region. That's strange. What's causing these recurrent infarcts without blockages?\n\nOh, and there's a mobile interatrial septum on the imaging. The bubble study shows a patent foramen ovale (PFO). That's a possible route for blood clots to bypass the lungs and cause paradoxical embolism. This could explain the recurrent infarcts and maybe even her neurological symptoms.\n\nThe brain MRI shows a lot of white matter lesions, more than you'd expect for her age. That could be from small emboli. The PFO could be letting venous thrombi pass into the arterial circulation, causing these issues.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the most likely cause of her symptoms is paradoxical embolism through the PFO. That's leading to recurrent myocardial infarctions and possibly her neurological symptoms too.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. The PFO is a key finding here, explaining both the cardiac and neurological issues. It's all fitting together now.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely cause of the recurrent myocardial infarctions in this patient is paradoxical embolism through a patent foramen ovale (PFO). The presence of a PFO allows venous thrombi to bypass the pulmonary circulation and enter the arterial system, potentially causing embolic events such as myocardial infarctions and neurological symptoms. This explanation aligns with the findings of unobstructed coronary arteries, recurrent infarcts in the same region, and the presence of numerous white matter lesions on the brain MRI, which could be due to microemboli. \n\nHere is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with a focus on the cardiac and neurological symptoms:\n\n1. **Acute Coronary Syndrome** - Initially considered due to elevated troponin and ECG changes.\n2. **Prinzmetal's Angina** - Spasm of coronary arteries could cause chest pain and ECG changes.\n3. **Myocardial Infarction with Normal Coronary Arteries** - Considered due to elevated troponin and CMR findings.\n4. **Cardiac Syndrome X** - Chest pain with normal coronary arteries, but usually without troponin elevation.\n5. **Aortic Dissection** - Can cause chest pain and ECG changes, but not supported by imaging.\n6. **Pulmonary Embolism** - Could cause chest pain and ECG changes, but not consistent with CMR findings.\n7. **Paradoxical Embolism via PFO** - Explains recurrent infarcts and neurological symptoms.\n8. **Vasculitis** - Could cause myocardial infarction and neurological symptoms, but less likely.\n9. **Embolic Events from Atrial Septal Aneurysm** - Possible, but less likely than PFO.\n10. **Hypercoagulable State** - Could contribute to recurrent thromboembolic events.\n\nReranking these differentials based on all available information, the top diagnosis is **Paradoxical Embolism via PFO**, as it comprehensively explains the cardiac and neurological findings in this patient.", "topic": "['Acute Coronary Syndromes', 'Congenital Defects', 'Cardiology', 'Cerebrovascular Disease', 'Neurology']"}

He had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. He denied tobacco, alcohol, or drug use. A neurological examination was notable for disorientation to the month, deficits in short-term memory, and an upward drift of the left arm. Cranial nerve, sensory, coordination, and deep tendon reflex examinations were normal. He walked with a slightly wide but steady gait. His serum red and white blood cell counts, coagulation profile, and electrolyte levels were within normal limits. Blood cultures had negative results. A 24-hour electroencephalogram showed right hemispheric slowing and multiple right centroparietal seizures of 1 minute each, without noticeable clinical correlates. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain was remarkable for a large T2-hyperintense lesion in the right temporoparietal region, with an increased diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) signal (low apparent diffusion coefficient), a low signal on susceptibility-weighted imaging, increased T1 signal intensity in and around the lesion, and a contrast-enhancing rim with leptomeningeal enhancement (Figure 1). A smaller satellite lesion with a similar MRI profile was noted inferiorly in the right anterior temporal lobe. A computed tomography scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis did not show any metastatic disease. A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile showed a normal red blood cell count and protein and glucose levels and a mildly elevated white blood cell count of 11 cells/μL (to convert to cells × 109/L, multiply by 0.001). The fluid was absent oligoclonal bands and had negative bacterial and fungal culture results, a meningitis-encephalitis polymerase chain reaction panel, and a paraneoplastic panel. Cytology and flow cytometry had negative results. The patient then underwent surgical biopsy of the temporoparietal lesion. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy–related inflammation", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 75-year-old man who's been dealing with headaches for a while, and now they're getting worse. He's also got some pain around his right eye. That's not good. He's got a history of hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. So, he's got a few things going on already. But he doesn't smoke or drink, which is a plus.\n\nNow, when we check his neurological function, he's a bit out of it - he doesn't know what month it is, and his short-term memory is off. That's concerning. His left arm seems to be drifting upward, which is odd. But everything else in the neurological exam seems normal, which is a bit puzzling.\n\nHis blood work is all normal, which is good. No signs of infection or anything like that. But the EEG shows some slowing in the right hemisphere and some seizures that aren't showing obvious symptoms. That's definitely something to consider.\n\nThe MRI is really telling. There's a big lesion in the right temporoparietal area. It's showing up bright on T2 and DWI, which suggests it's restricted diffusion. That's interesting. It's not showing up on susceptibility, which means it's not bleeding. There's a rim that's enhancing with contrast, and the leptomeningeal area is lit up too. Plus, there's a smaller lesion in the temporal lobe that looks similar. Hmm, that's suspicious.\n\nWe did a CT scan of his chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and there are no signs of metastatic disease. That's a relief, but it also makes things a bit more confusing.\n\nThe CSF is pretty normal, which is surprising. A little elevated white cell count, but no oligoclonal bands, and all the cultures and panels came back negative. That rules out a lot of infections and autoimmune issues.\n\nSo, what could this be? Initially, I thought about glioblastoma because of the ring-enhancing lesion and his age. But the CSF is normal, and there's no sign of metastasis elsewhere, which makes me question that.\n\nNext, I considered cerebral lymphoma. It can show up with these kinds of lesions and restricted diffusion. But usually, you'd expect more abnormalities in the CSF, like elevated protein or something.\n\nThen, I thought about abscesses. They can have a similar appearance on MRI, but again, the CSF is pretty normal, and we'd expect more signs of infection.\n\nI also wondered about metastatic disease, but the CT scan didn't show anything, and usually, you'd have multiple lesions.\n\nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) crossed my mind, but that's more common in immunocompromised patients, and the CSF would likely show JC virus.\n\nI considered a subdural hematoma, but the MRI doesn't really support that, and there's no history of trauma.\n\nEncephalitis was another thought, but the CSF is too normal, and we'd expect more symptoms.\n\nA meningioma could be possible, but they usually don't show restricted diffusion, and the patient's symptoms seem too acute.\n\nI also thought about a brain tumor like an oligodendroglioma. They can have calcifications, but we didn't see any on the MRI.\n\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is another option. It can cause rapid neurological decline and has characteristic MRI findings, but we didn't see the typical cortical ribboning.\n\nAutoimmune encephalitis was considered, but the CSF is too normal, and we'd expect more systemic symptoms.\n\nFinally, I thought about a cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related inflammation. It can cause leukocortical symptoms and has characteristic MRI findings, but it's not a perfect fit.\n\nAfter going through all this, I think cerebral lymphoma is the most likely diagnosis. It fits the MRI findings and the patient's age, even if the CSF is normal. But I'm not entirely convinced, and we might need more information to be sure.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Glioblastoma** - Given the patient's age and the MRI findings of a ring-enhancing lesion with restricted diffusion, glioblastoma is a strong initial consideration.\n\n2. **Cerebral Lymphoma** - This is another possibility due to the MRI characteristics and the patient's age, despite the normal CSF findings.\n\n3. **Brain Abscess** - Although the CSF is normal, the MRI findings could also suggest an abscess, especially with the ring-enhancing lesion.\n\n4. **Metastatic Disease** - Despite the lack of findings on the CT scan, metastatic disease remains a consideration, especially given the patient's age and multiple risk factors.\n\n5. **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)** - This is less likely due to the lack of immunocompromise and normal CSF, but it should be considered.\n\n6. **Subdural Hematoma** - The MRI doesn't strongly support this, but it's a possibility if there was an unwitnessed trauma.\n\n7. **Encephalitis** - Viral or autoimmune encephalitis could present with these symptoms, although the CSF is surprisingly normal.\n\n8. **Meningioma** - While meningiomas are usually more chronic, the MRI findings could fit, especially with the dural involvement.\n\n9. **Oligodendroglioma** - This type of tumor can have similar MRI characteristics, but calcifications are typically present.\n\n10. **Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD)** - This is a consideration due to the rapid neurological decline, but the MRI doesn't show the classic cortical ribboning.\n\nAfter considering all the information, cerebral lymphoma emerges as the most likely diagnosis, given the MRI findings and the patient's age, despite the normal CSF.

The surgical procedure was a 2-staged Baerveldt implantation after which he developed fluctuating but progressive visual decline. The patient’s ocular history was significant for Sturge-Weber syndrome with bilateral cutaneous port-wine stains, secondary glaucoma in the right eye, and an irregular globe with a white cataract and chronic retinal detachment (RD) in the left eye. At presentation, visual acuity was hand motion OD and a long-standing history of no light perception OS. Intraocular pressures by Goldmann applanation tonometry were 16 mm Hg OD and 28 mm Hg OS. Anterior segment examination of the right eye revealed a properly positioned plate and tube, and dilated fundus examination revealed a red glow of the fundus with shifting subretinal fluid and RD extending from the 2- to 11-o’clock position (Figure 1A). B-scan ultrasonography of the right eye confirmed the RD and demonstrated homogeneous diffuse choroidal thickening (Figure 1B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Diffuse choroidal hemangioma with exudative retinal detachments", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 40-year-old guy who's having trouble seeing out of his right eye. He had glaucoma surgery a few weeks ago, and now his vision is getting worse. That's not good. He's got a history of Sturge-Weber syndrome, which complicates things. This syndrome can cause all sorts of eye issues, like glaucoma and those port-wine stains. \n\nOkay, so his right eye has a red glow and there's fluid under the retina. That sounds like a retinal detachment, which is pretty serious. The ultrasound shows the choroid is thickened too. That's interesting. \n\nFirst, let's think about what could be causing this. Retinal detachment is a big one. It's definitely something to consider, especially with the symptoms and the ultrasound findings. \n\nBut wait, there's more to this. The choroidal thickening could mean something else is going on. Choroidal effusion or choroidal detachment might be possibilities. These can happen after eye surgery, so that's something to keep in mind. \n\nNow, let's not forget about the Sturge-Weber syndrome. It can cause choroidal hemangiomas, which could explain the thickening and the detachment. That's another angle. \n\nHmm, what about vitreous hemorrhage? That could cause a red glow too. But there's no mention of blood in the vitreous, so maybe that's not it. \n\nAlso, central serous chorioretinopathy could cause fluid under the retina, but it's not common in this context, especially with the history of Sturge-Weber. \n\nOh, and there's the surgery itself. Sometimes after glaucoma surgery, you can get suprachoroidal hemorrhage. That's a serious complication and could definitely cause these symptoms. \n\nSo, let's put it all together. We've got retinal detachment, choroidal effusion, choroidal hemangioma, and suprachoroidal hemorrhage as our top suspects. \n\nBut wait, let's rethink this. The red glow and the choroidal thickening are key here. Suprachoroidal hemorrhage could definitely cause these findings. It's a known complication after this type of surgery. \n\nSo, after going through everything, I think suprachoroidal hemorrhage is the most likely cause of his symptoms. It fits the clinical picture and the timing after surgery. That's our best bet.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Retinal Detachment** - Given the red glow and fluid under the retina, retinal detachment is a primary consideration.\n\n2. **Choroidal Effusion** - This can occur post-surgery and is consistent with the findings of choroidal thickening.\n\n3. **Choroidal Hemangioma** - Associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome, this could explain the choroidal thickening and detachment.\n\n4. **Suprachoroidal Hemorrhage** - A known complication after glaucoma surgery, it fits the symptoms and timing.\n\n5. **Vitreous Hemorrhage** - Could cause a red glow, but there's no mention of blood in the vitreous.\n\n6. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy** - Less likely given the patient's history and context.\n\n7. **Choroidal Detachment** - Similar to effusion, this can happen post-surgery and contributes to the red glow.\n\n8. **Cystoid Macular Edema** - Could cause vision changes, but doesn't fully explain the choroidal findings.\n\n9. **Uveitis** - Inflammation could lead to some of these symptoms, but it's not strongly indicated here.\n\n10. **Tractional Retinal Detachment** - Possible due to the complex history, but less likely than other mechanical causes.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Suprachoroidal Hemorrhage** emerges as the most likely diagnosis.

His active medical problems included atrial flutter on anticoagulation, antisynthetase syndrome (which was diagnosed based on the presence of autoantibodies against aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase), fever with negative infectious workup results, and interstitial lung disease that was managed with azathioprine. Two weeks before the onset of sudden vision loss, the patient developed a rapidly evolving purpuric rash on his hands and feet that progressed to digital ischemia (Figure 1A). He was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone, which was completed 3 days before the onset of loss of vision and transitioned to treatment with azathioprine, 150 mg, and prednisone, 80 mg, that he was taking at the time of his vision loss. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Frosted branch angiitis due to retinal vasculitis that was associated with antisynthetase syndrome", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 49-year-old African American man who suddenly can't see out of one eye, and it's not painful. That's pretty alarming. Usually, when vision loss isn't painful, we're thinking about something happening with the blood flow to the eye. So, maybe something like central retinal artery occlusion or non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy could be the culprit. \n\nBut wait, there's more to consider. He's got a history of atrial flutter and is on anticoagulation therapy. That's a big deal because it can lead to blood clots. Could a clot have traveled and caused the vision loss? That's definitely something to keep in mind. \n\nNow, let's not forget about his skin. He had this purpuric rash that turned into digital ischemia. That sounds like some sort of vasculitis, maybe related to his antisynthetase syndrome. If the blood vessels in his skin are involved, could the ones in his eye be affected too? That's a possibility. \n\nOh, and he was on high-dose steroids recently. They can have all sorts of effects, including changing how the body handles blood clots. Could the steroids have played a role here? Maybe they made him more prone to clotting. \n\nSo, putting it all together, we've got a few different avenues. There's the possibility of a clot from his heart causing the problem, or maybe it's the vasculitis from his antisynthetase syndrome. And we can't ignore the impact of the steroids. \n\nBut let's not stop there. We should also think about other conditions that could cause sudden vision loss. Giant cell arteritis comes to mind, even though it usually causes painful vision loss. And what about other types of vasculitis, like polyarteritis nodosa? They could be involved too. \n\nOkay, so let's rank these possibilities. Given his history and symptoms, I'd say central retinal artery occlusion is a strong contender. The clot risk from his atrial flutter is definitely relevant. \n\nNext, I'd consider the vasculitis from his antisynthetase syndrome. It's been active recently, so it makes sense. \n\nGiant cell arteritis is less likely because of the painless nature, but it's still worth considering. And polyarteritis nodosa could be a factor too, given the systemic symptoms. \n\nFinally, let's not forget about non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. It's a bit less likely here, but it's still on the table. \n\nSo, after thinking it all through, I'd rank them as follows: central retinal artery occlusion, embolic event from atrial flutter, vasculitis from antisynthetase syndrome, giant cell arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, and non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. That seems to fit with what we know.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's sudden unilateral painless vision loss, along with a final ranking of these possibilities:\n\n1. **Central Retinal Artery Occlusion** - This condition is a strong contender given the sudden and painless nature of the vision loss.\n\n2. **Embolic Event from Atrial Flutter** - The patient's history of atrial flutter increases the risk of embolic events that could lead to vision loss.\n\n3. **Vasculitis from Antisynthetase Syndrome** - The recent rash and digital ischemia suggest active vasculitis, which could affect the blood vessels in the eye.\n\n4. **Giant Cell Arteritis** - Although it typically causes painful vision loss, it's still a consideration due to the potential for serious vision complications.\n\n5. **Polyarteritis Nodosa** - This type of vasculitis could explain the systemic symptoms and vision loss.\n\n6. **Non-arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy** - While less likely, it remains a possibility given the sudden vision loss.\n\n7. **Retinal Detachment** - Sudden vision loss could also be due to retinal detachment, although it often presents with other symptoms like floaters or flashes.\n\n8. **Vitreous Hemorrhage** - Bleeding into the vitreous could cause sudden vision loss, potentially related to the anticoagulation therapy.\n\n9. **Optic Neuritis** - Typically painful, but could present without pain in some cases, especially with underlying systemic conditions.\n\n10. **Ocular Ischemic Syndrome** - Resulting from carotid artery disease, this could cause sudden vision changes, although it's less directly related to the patient's history.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are:\n1. Central Retinal Artery Occlusion\n2. Embolic Event from Atrial Flutter\n3. Vasculitis from Antisynthetase Syndrome\n4. Giant Cell Arteritis\n5. Polyarteritis Nodosa\n6.

His medical history was significant for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and allergic contact dermatitis. The patient reported being started on ibrutinib and allopurinol therapy 6 weeks prior to the rash onset for treatment of CLL.

A punch biopsy specimen from the scalp was obtained for histopathologic analysis (Figure, B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Ibrutinib-induced toxic effects", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a man in his 60s with a purpuric rash on his scalp. It's not tender or itchy, which is interesting. He's got a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, and he's recently started on ibrutinib and allopurinol. Hmm, could these medications be causing the rash? Ibrutinib is known to cause bruising and bleeding issues, so that's something to consider.\n\nNow, let's think about the fact that the rash is purpuric. This usually means there's some kind of bleeding under the skin. Could it be due to low platelets? That's a possibility. Ibrutinib can affect platelet function, so maybe that's playing a role here.\n\nBut wait, there's also the biopsy results to think about. If the biopsy shows any specific patterns, like extravasated red blood cells or particular types of inflammation, that could point us in a different direction. Let's not forget about that.\n\nOh, and what about other causes of purpura? There's idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, which is an immune-mediated condition that can cause low platelets and purpura. And then there's vasculitis, which involves inflammation of the blood vessels and can also cause purpura. We should keep these in mind too.\n\nAlso, the patient's history of allergic contact dermatitis is interesting. Could this be some kind of allergic reaction? But then again, the rash isn't itchy, which makes an allergic reaction less likely.\n\nLet's not forget about drug reactions. Ibrutinib and allopurinol are relatively new to his regimen. Could one of these drugs be causing a reaction? Drug-induced lupus or a drug eruption could be possibilities.\n\nNow, considering the biopsy, if it shows signs of vasculitis, like necrotizing capillaritis, that would be a big clue. Vasculitis could definitely cause this type of rash.\n\nHmm, what about other bleeding disorders? Like, could this be a sign of a more systemic issue, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation or DIC? That's a serious condition that can cause widespread bleeding.\n\nOh, and let's not overlook the possibility of a paraneoplastic phenomenon. The patient has CLL, and sometimes cancers can cause strange skin reactions. A paraneoplastic syndrome could be at play here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top differential diagnoses are: 1) Ibrutinib-induced platelet dysfunction, 2) Vasculitis, 3) Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, 4) Drug-induced lupus, 5) Paraneoplastic phenomenon, 6) Allergic contact dermatitis, 7) Disseminated intravascular coagulation, 8) Senile purpura, 9) Amyloidosis, and 10) Hypergammaglobulinemia.

Current ophthalmic medications included topical prednisolone acetate, 1%, in the right eye 6 times per day. The patient reported no improvement with the treatment. On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/80 OD and 20/20 OS. Pupils were reactive without relative afferent pupillary defect, and intraocular pressures were 18 mm Hg in the right eye and 11 mm Hg in the left eye. A slitlamp biomicroscopic examination of the right eye revealed grade 2 to 3 diffuse central corneal edema and folds (Figure 1). The anterior chamber was deep and the posterior chamber intraocular lens was in good position within the capsular bag. Although the view to the posterior pole of the right eye was hazy owing to corneal edema, dilated fundus examination findings were unremarkable. Examination of the left eye revealed a few guttate. The central corneal thickness by ultrasound pachymetry was 957 μm in the right eye and 547 μm in the left eye. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Corneal edema after cataract surgery secondary to intraoperative Descemet membrane detachment (Figure 2)", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an 82-year-old man who had cataract surgery 8 weeks ago, and now he's dealing with blurry vision in his right eye. That's a pretty common issue after cataract surgery, so let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst off, his cornea is edematous. That's a big clue. Corneal edema can happen for a few reasons after cataract surgery. One common cause is cystoid macular edema. It's known to cause vision issues, but it usually shows up with retinal changes, and we don't have clear signs of that here. So, let's keep it in mind but look further.\n\nAnother possibility could be a detached posterior capsule. That's when the capsule that holds the lens in place gets cloudy or detaches, but the exam says the intraocular lens is in good position. So, that's probably not it.\n\nWhat about infection? Endophthalmitis is a serious one. It would likely come with a lot more drama like pain, redness, or discharge, and we don't see any of that. Plus, the anterior chamber is quiet, so infection seems unlikely.\n\nNow, let's think about the corneal edema itself. It's pretty significant with a central thickness of 957 μm. That's much thicker than normal. Could it be a corneal issue like decompensation? The cornea might be having trouble staying clear after the surgery, especially if there was some pre-existing condition like Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy.\n\nAh, and the patient is on prednisolone, a steroid drop. That can sometimes mask symptoms but not really fix the underlying issue. If the cornea's endothelial layer was compromised during surgery, that could explain the persistent edema.\n\nSo, what's the story with the left eye? It has some guttate, which are those little excrescences you see in Fuchs' dystrophy. That's a big hint. If the left eye has guttate, the right eye might have had some pre-surgery endothelial weakness too.\n\nPutting it all together, it seems like we're dealing with corneal decompensation, likely related to Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy. The surgery might have pushed the cornea over the edge, leading to this persistent edema. That fits with the thick cornea, the lack of response to steroids, and the guttate in the other eye.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. Corneal decompensation from Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy seems like the best fit for what's going on here.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the 82-year-old man's condition is corneal decompensation secondary to Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy. The significant corneal edema, increased central corneal thickness, lack of response to steroid treatment, and the presence of guttate in the left eye all point towards this diagnosis. This condition could have been exacerbated by the cataract surgery, leading to the persistent blurred vision in the right eye. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Corneal Decompensation from Fuchs' Endothelial Dystrophy** - This is the most likely diagnosis given the presence of corneal edema, increased corneal thickness, and guttate in the fellow eye.\n2. **Cystoid Macular Edema** - While this is a common post-cataract surgery issue, the lack of clear retinal changes makes it less likely.\n3. **Posterior Capsule Opacification** - The intraocular lens is in good position, making this less likely.\n4. **Endophthalmitis** - The absence of pain, redness, or discharge, along with a quiet anterior chamber, makes infection unlikely.\n5. **Steroid-Induced Glaucoma** - Although intraocular pressure is higher in the right eye, it's not significantly elevated, and the primary issue is corneal edema.\n6. **Corneal Graft Rejection** - Not applicable as there's no history of corneal transplant.\n7. **Anterior Segment Inflammation** - There's no significant inflammation noted on examination.\n8. **Retinal Detachment** - The fundus exam is unremarkable, making this unlikely.\n9. **Vitreous Hemorrhage** - There's no evidence of hemorrhage on examination.\n10. **Central Retinal Artery Occlusion** - The examination findings do not support this diagnosis.", "topic": "['Cornea', 'Cataract and Other Lens Disorders', 'Ophthalmology']"}

The child's mother reported that, on discovery, the plaque was initially 1 × 1 cm and had since grown in size with the child. She was uncertain if the plaque was present at birth. The patient’s medical history was significant for dermal melanocytosis of the right hip and mid back, increased head circumference (97th percentile), and expressive language delay. There was no family history of congenital birthmarks or neurofibromatosis type 1 or 2. Physical examination revealed a well-appearing boy with normal vital signs and Fitzpatrick type III skin type. On the left lower back, there was a 15 × 5-cm indurated skin-colored to yellow, firm, multinodular plaque with hypertrichosis, extending from the midline to the left lower flank (Figure, A). There were additional blue-gray patches on the back and right hip, as well as a small café au lait macule on the right lower back. Limited neurologic examination was within normal limits. A 4-mm punch biopsy was performed for further diagnostic evaluation (Figure, B-D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Neurocristic hamartoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 17-month-old boy with a slow-growing, nontender plaque on his lower back. It's skin-colored to yellow and has hair growing out of it. That's interesting. The mother says it's been growing with him, but she's not sure if it was there at birth. Hmm, that's something to keep in mind.\n\nNow, let's see what else is going on with this little guy. He's got some other skin things happening, like blue-gray patches, which sound like dermal melanocytosis, and a small café au lait spot. Oh, and his head is on the larger side, in the 97th percentile. That's quite big. Plus, there's this expressive language delay. That's a lot to consider.\n\nOkay, so what could this plaque be? Let's start with neurofibroma. It's a common skin finding in neurofibromatosis type 1, which can also explain the café au lait spot. But wait, there's no mention of freckling in the axillary or inguinal regions, and no Lisch nodules or neurofibromas elsewhere. So, maybe it's not that.\n\nHow about a lipoma? They can be soft and yellowish, but they don't usually have hair. And this plaque is firm, not soft. So, that's probably not it.\n\nLet's think about a connective tissue nevus. These can be firm, skin-colored plaques, and they can be hairy. That fits. Plus, they can be present at birth or appear in early childhood. This is starting to make sense.\n\nBut wait, there's more. The boy's large head size and language delay are concerning. These could point to a neurocutaneous syndrome. Neurofibromatosis type 1 can cause these issues, but we don't have enough signs for that diagnosis. Hmm, what about tuberous sclerosis? It can cause skin lesions and neurological issues, but the plaque doesn't sound like a shagreen patch, which is what you'd expect in tuberous sclerosis.\n\nLet's not forget about congenital melanocytosis. Those blue-gray patches are a clue. But they don't explain the plaque or the other symptoms.\n\nWhat about a nevus lipomatosus? These are congenital, soft, and fatty, but this plaque is firm. So, that's not it.\n\nAnd then there's the possibility of a plexiform neurofibroma. These can be multinodular and hairy, and they're associated with neurofibromatosis type 1. That could explain the café au lait spot and maybe even the large head and language delay. This is starting to fit together.\n\nBut let's not jump to conclusions. We should also think about a congenital smooth muscle hamartoma. These can be firm, hairy plaques too. They're usually present at birth or appear early, just like this one. And they don't have the systemic associations that would complicate things.\n\nSo, after considering all of this, I think the most likely diagnosis is a congenital smooth muscle hamartoma. It matches the plaque's characteristics and doesn't contradict any of the other findings. Yeah, that seems to be the best fit.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 17-month-old boy's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Neurofibroma** - Considered due to the presence of a café au lait macule and the characteristics of the plaque.\n2. **Lipoma** - Initially considered due to the plaque's description as skin-colored to yellow, but less likely due to the firmness and hair growth.\n3. **Connective Tissue Nevus** - Fits the description of a firm, skin-colored, hairy plaque and can be present at birth or appear in early childhood.\n4. **Plexiform Neurofibroma** - Multinodular and hairy, associated with neurofibromatosis type 1, which could explain other symptoms.\n5. **Congenital Smooth Muscle Hamartoma** - Firm, hairy plaque present at birth or early childhood, without systemic associations.\n6. **Nevus Lipomatosus** - Congenital and soft, but the firmness of the plaque makes this less likely.\n7. **Tuberous Sclerosis** - Considered due to the large head size and language delay, but the plaque doesn't match typical skin findings.\n8. **Congenital Melanocytosis** - Explains blue-gray patches but not the plaque or other symptoms.\n9. **Epidermal Nevus** - Could present as a skin-colored plaque, but typically not hairy or firm.\n10. **Fibrous Hamartoma of Infancy** - A benign tumor that can present as a firm, multinodular mass, but less likely to be hairy.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the most likely diagnosis is a **Congenital Smooth Muscle Hamartoma**. This diagnosis aligns with the characteristics of the plaque and does not contradict other findings. However, a **Plexiform Neurofibroma** remains a close consideration due to the potential associations with neurofibromatosis type 1, which could explain the large head size and language delay. Further diagnostic evaluation, including the biopsy results, will be essential in confirming the diagnosis.", "topic": "['Pediatrics', 'Dermatology']"}

The mass had been slowly enlarging and he had been experiencing mild intermittent pain, but no additional symptoms were reported. His medical history was significant for several episodes of upper respiratory infection during the previous winter season, and he previously had an adenotonsillectomy several years prior and bilateral ear tubes placed 1 year before presentation. Physical examination showed a mildly tender, nonmobile, left parotid mass near the angle of the mandible with no overlying skin changes or drainage around the mass. There was no lymphadenopathy or other lesions noted in the neck area, and cranial nerve VII was fully intact. Ultrasonography results of the neck showed a left 1.5-cm preauricular nodular mass with internal and marginal vascularity. A neck magnetic resonance imaging study without contrast performed at an outside institution revealed the 1.5-cm heterogeneous intraparotid nodule that was predominantly isotense to glandular tissue on T1 images with vague hypointensity of a small irregular central region, as well as vague hyperintensity on T2 images. He subsequently underwent fine needle aspiration biopsy to assess the lesion, which demonstrated benign-appearing salivary gland tissue and clusters of myoepithelial cells. The mass was continuing to enlarge, and the patient’s pain was increasing in that area, so the decision was made to perform left superficial parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve. Intraoperatively, the left parotid mass was noted to be just below the lower branches of the facial nerve. The excised parotid mass was sent to the pathology department for analysis. Gross examination of the specimen demonstrated a 1.6 × 1.5 × 1.1–cm tan-white, well-circumscribed lesion that was partially surrounded by salivary gland parenchyma (Figure, A). Histologic examination of the nodule was performed (Figure, B and C). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Sclerosing polycystic adenoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 9-year-old boy with a neck mass that's been growing for a few months. It's on the left side, near the parotid gland, and it's a bit tender but not really moving around. That's interesting. Kids don't often have parotid tumors, but when they do, it's usually something like a pleomorphic adenoma. That's a benign tumor, so it's not too alarming. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet.\n\nNow, what about his history? He's had some upper respiratory infections recently, and he's had some surgeries like an adenotonsillectomy and ear tubes. None of that seems directly related to a parotid mass, but it's good to keep in mind. \n\nThe ultrasound and MRI show a small, vascular nodule in the parotid gland. It's got some mixed signals on the MRI, which could mean a few things. Pleomorphic adenomas can look like this, but we should consider other possibilities too. \n\nThe fine needle aspiration biopsy is a big clue. It shows benign salivary gland tissue and myoepithelial cells. That's pretty characteristic of a pleomorphic adenoma. But, we know these can be tricky, and sometimes they come back as benign when they're not. So, let's keep an open mind.\n\nOkay, so what else could this be? There's always a chance of a malignant tumor, like a mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Those can be tricky because they might look benign at first. And then there are other benign things like Warthin's tumor or a oncocytoma, but those are less common in kids.\n\nLet's think about the surgery. They did a superficial parotidectomy, and the mass was just below the facial nerve. That's good because it suggests it wasn't too deep or complicated. The pathology report will be key here.\n\nSo, after looking at everything, my first thought is pleomorphic adenoma. It fits the age, the symptoms, and the biopsy results. But I'm also considering other possibilities like a basal cell adenoma or even a malignant tumor like a mucoepidermoid carcinoma. \n\nNow, let's go through the pathology report. It describes a well-circumscribed lesion with salivary gland tissue and myoepithelial cells. That's consistent with a pleomorphic adenoma. But, we need to make sure we're not missing anything.\n\nHmm, let's think about other benign tumors. Could it be a Warthin's tumor? Those are usually in adults, but they can happen in kids. And what about a oncocytoma? That's rare, but possible.\n\nLet's not forget about malignant possibilities. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is still on my list, and maybe even an acinic cell carcinoma. Those can be sneaky.\n\nAfter going through everything again, I'm still leaning towards a pleomorphic adenoma. But I'm also considering a basal cell adenoma or a Warthin's tumor. And I'm keeping mucoepidermoid carcinoma on the list just in case.\n\nSo, here's my final list: pleomorphic adenoma, basal cell adenoma, Warthin's tumor, oncocytoma, and mucoepidermoid carcinoma. I think that covers all the bases.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 9-year-old boy with a left-sided neck mass:\n\n1. **Pleomorphic Adenoma** - This is the most likely diagnosis given the age, symptoms, and biopsy results showing benign salivary gland tissue and myoepithelial cells.\n\n2. **Basal Cell Adenoma** - A benign tumor that could present similarly, especially with the biopsy findings.\n\n3. **Warthin's Tumor** - Although more common in adults, it's a possibility to consider, especially with the vascular nature of the mass.\n\n4. **Oncocytoma** - A rare benign tumor, but one that could fit the clinical and radiological presentation.\n\n5. **Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma** - A malignant tumor that can appear benign on initial biopsy, so it remains a consideration.\n\n6. **Acinic Cell Carcinoma** - Another malignant possibility that could present with similar features.\n\n7. **Sialadenitis** - An inflammatory condition that could cause a mass, but less likely given the biopsy results.\n\n8. **Lymphatic Malformation** - Could present as a vascular mass, but typically has different imaging characteristics.\n\n9. **Hemangioma** - A vascular lesion that could be considered, especially in a child.\n\n10. **Neurofibroma** - A nerve-related tumor that could present as a mass in the parotid region.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are pleomorphic adenoma, basal cell adenoma, and Warthin's tumor, with mucoepidermoid carcinoma also being an important consideration due to its potential to mimic benign lesions.", "topic": "['Pediatrics', 'Otolaryngology', 'Salivary Gland Disorders', 'Dental Medicine']"}

Diluted triamcinolone acetonide (TA) was used to stain the posterior hyaloid. After removal of 25-gauge trocar cannulas, subconjunctival TA and ceftazidime was injected. Owing to cystoid changes in the central macula, a short-acting gas tamponade with sulfur hexafluoride was used to tamponade any cystoid abnormalities that may have been unroofed. Despite unremarkable postoperative day 1 (POD1) examination findings, the patient presented on postoperative week 3 with a painless central scotoma and worsening floaters. Her visual acuity was 20/400 OD and intraocular pressure was normal. There was no external hyperemia or chemosis, and the anterior chamber was deep and quiet with no cells or flare. On dilated fundus examination, there were 15 to 20 cells per high-power field (using a 1 × 1-mm2 high-intensity incidental slit beam) and a white macular lesion with disc edema and scattered intraretinal and peripapillary hemorrhages and mixed venous and arterial sheathing. Optical coherence tomography of the macula showed atrophy, full-thickness hyperreflectivity, and a residual epiretinal membrane (Figure). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cytomegalovirus retinitis and papillitis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 71-year-old woman who just had eye surgery, and now she's dealing with some troubling symptoms. She's got a painless central scotoma and more floaters than usual. Her vision is pretty bad right now, 20/400 in that eye, but at least her eye pressure is normal. No redness or swelling on the outside, and the front part of her eye looks calm, no inflammation there. But when we look deeper, there are some cells floating around in the vitreous, about 15 to 20 per little area we check. And there's this white lesion on her macula, along with some swelling and bleeding around the retina. Plus, the blood vessels in the back of her eye look like they're sheathed. \n\nOkay, so what's going on here? Let's start with the obvious. She just had vitrectomy surgery, so maybe it's something related to that. Could it be a vitreous hemorrhage? That would explain the floaters and the cells we see. But wait, there's more to consider. \n\nThe macular lesion and the sheathing of the vessels are pretty significant. These could be signs of an infection, like endophthalmitis. But usually, that's painful and comes with more obvious signs of inflammation, like redness and swelling, which she doesn't have. So, maybe not that. \n\nWhat about a central nervous system lymphoma? She does have non-Hodgkin lymphoma, so it's possible. But the lack of pain and the specific retinal findings make me think otherwise. \n\nOh, and there's the medication she's on, obinutuzumab. It's an immunosuppressant, which could make her more vulnerable to infections. That brings us back to thinking about infections, maybe something unusual that doesn't present with the usual pain and redness. \n\nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) comes to mind. It's a viral infection that affects the brain and could have ocular manifestations. But it's rare and usually associated with more neurological symptoms. \n\nLet's not forget about other possibilities like autoimmune retinopathy or even a drug reaction. But the timing and her symptoms make me lean towards an infectious cause. \n\nSo, what's the most likely explanation? Considering everything, I think we're looking at an atypical infectious process, maybe related to her immunosuppressed state. Something like PML or another unusual infection could be the culprit. \n\nBut wait, let's rethink this. The sheathing of the vessels and the macular lesion could also point towards a vascular issue, like frosted branch angiitis. That fits with the appearance of the vessels and the fact that it's painless. \n\nYeah, that makes sense. Frosted branch angiitis, possibly related to an underlying issue like her immunosuppression, seems to be the best fit for what's going on here.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Vitreous Hemorrhage** - Given the recent vitrectomy, this is a plausible initial consideration due to the floaters and vitreous cells.\n\n2. **Endophthalmitis** - Although it typically presents with pain and inflammation, atypical presentations can occur, especially in immunocompromised patients.\n\n3. **Central Nervous System Lymphoma** - The patient's history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma raises this possibility, but the lack of pain and specific retinal findings make it less likely.\n\n4. **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)** - This viral infection is a consideration due to the patient's immunosuppressed state, but it's rare and often involves neurological symptoms.\n\n5. **Frosted Branch Angiitis** - The retinal vascular sheathing and macular lesion fit this diagnosis, and it aligns with the painless nature of the symptoms.\n\n6. **Autoimmune Retinopathy** - This could explain the retinal findings, but the acute onset post-surgery suggests a different cause.\n\n7. **Cytomegalovirus Retinitis** - A common infection in immunocompromised patients, but usually presents with more distinct retinal lesions.\n\n8. **Toxoplasmosis** - This could cause retinal lesions, but typically presents with more inflammation and symptoms.\n\n9. **Drug-induced Retinopathy** - A reaction to obinutuzumab or other medications is possible, but less likely given the timing and presentation.\n\n10. **Sympathetic Ophthalmia** - An autoimmune response following surgery, but it usually involves both eyes and presents with more systemic symptoms.\n\nUpon reviewing all the information, **Frosted Branch Angiitis** emerges as the most likely diagnosis. This condition is characterized by retinal vascular sheathing and a macular lesion, aligning well with the patient's symptoms and the fact that it is painless. The patient's immunosuppressed state due to obinutuzumab treatment could contribute to this atypical presentation.", "topic": "['Infectious Diseases', 'Ophthalmology', 'Retinal Disorders', 'Macular Diseases']"}

A small, excoriated plaque was also noted on the right malar area (Figure 1A). No mucosal lesions were present, and the rest of the physical examination findings were unremarkable.

We've got a young girl, under 2 years old, with these skin lesions on her face. They're slightly itchy, but she's otherwise doing fine. No fever or anything like that. The lesions are skin-colored and red, little bumps, and they're in a pattern on one side of her forehead and nose. That's interesting.\n\nFirst, I'm thinking about common skin conditions in kids. Eczema comes to mind, but usually, that's more widespread and not just on one side of the face. Plus, it tends to be pretty itchy. So, maybe not eczema.\n\nNext, I consider viral infections like molluscum contagiosum. Those lesions are flesh-colored with a dimple in the center, but they don't usually follow a segmental pattern. So, that's probably not it.\n\nThen, there's the possibility of a fungal infection, like tinea faciei. It can cause red, scaly patches, but again, it's not typically one-sided or segmental. Hmm, maybe not that either.\n\nNow, let's think about something more congenital. Epidermal nevi could fit. They're usually present at birth or early childhood and can follow the lines of Blaschko, which could explain the segmental pattern. That seems like a strong possibility.\n\nOh, and what about acne? Neonatal acne or infantile acne could show up around this age, but it's usually more pustular and not segmental. So, probably not acne.\n\nI should also consider Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis, but that would likely have more systemic symptoms and different types of lesions. So, it's unlikely.\n\nNow, let's not forget about milia. Those are small, white, cystic lesions, but they're not usually erythematous or segmental. So, that's probably not it.\n\nHow about lichen nitidus? That's characterized by tiny, skin-colored bumps, and it can appear in a segmental pattern. That sounds like a good match.\n\nI should also think about folliculitis, but that's usually more inflammatory and not segmental. So, probably not that.\n\nLastly, there's the possibility of a congenital condition like tuberous sclerosis. Facial angiofibromas could present like this, but they usually appear a bit later and with other symptoms. So, maybe not that.\n\nAlright, let's rank these possibilities. Epidermal nevus seems like the strongest contender given the segmental pattern and age of onset. Lichen nitidus is a close second because of the matching lesion characteristics and pattern.

Her most recent hemoglobin A1c level was 8.3%, and 2 months prior to her visit, she had restarted diabetes medications. Her medications included metformin and glimepiride. Her corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Her pupil, color vision, and anterior segment examinations had normal results bilaterally. A posterior segment examination of the right eye showed mild temporal elevation of the optic disc with blurred margins, mild peripapillary hemorrhages, a small amount of preretinal hemorrhage, and small-caliber branching vessels at the temporal disc with no fibrosis (Figure 1A). The left eye showed a normal optic disc, a cup-disc ratio of 0.1, and some microaneurysms at the macula. There were a few scattered dot-blot hemorrhages bilaterally. Fluorescein angiography of the right eye showed mild leakage from the abnormal vessels at the temporal optic disc (Figure 1B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Diabetic papillopathy", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 47-year-old woman who's been dealing with diabetes and hypertension for quite a while. She's come in because of some sudden blurry vision in her right eye. That's a bit concerning, especially with her history.\n\nShe's describing this 'hair' thing moving across her vision. That sounds like a classic retinal issue, maybe a vitreous problem. Floaters can be caused by vitreous hemorrhage or even a posterior vitreous detachment. Let's keep that in mind.\n\nNow, looking at her eye exam, her visual acuity is actually pretty good, 20/20 in both eyes. That's a relief, but there's more to check. The right eye has some optic disc elevation and peripapillary hemorrhages. Hmm, that's interesting. It could be related to her diabetic retinopathy, maybe proliferative diabetic retinopathy causing some neovascularization.\n\nThe fluorescein angiography shows leakage from these abnormal vessels. That's a big hint. It's pointing towards neovascularization, which fits with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. But let's not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nGiven her history of diabetes, diabetic retinopathy is definitely on the table. But we should also think about other possibilities. Could it be a branch retinal vein occlusion? That can cause hemorrhages too. Or maybe even a central retinal vein occlusion, though that usually causes more widespread issues.\n\nOh, and what about vitreous hemorrhage from a tear or detachment? That could explain the floaters. And we can't forget about neoplastic conditions like choroidal melanoma, though that's less likely given the findings.\n\nLet's not overlook macular degeneration either. It can cause vision changes, but it's not as common in someone her age with her history.\n\nOkay, so let's rank these possibilities. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy is still top of the list because of the neovascularization and leakage. But branch retinal vein occlusion is a close second. It fits the hemorrhage pattern.\n\nVitreous hemorrhage is next, considering the floaters. Then central retinal vein occlusion, though it's less likely. Choroidal melanoma is down the list, and macular degeneration is last, given her age and history.\n\nSo, after thinking it all through, proliferative diabetic retinopathy is the most likely cause of her symptoms, followed by branch retinal vein occlusion. That seems to fit best with what we're seeing.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy** - This is highly likely given the patient's history of diabetes and the findings of neovascularization and leakage on fluorescein angiography.\n\n2. **Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion** - This could explain the peripapillary hemorrhages and is a common condition in patients with hypertension and diabetes.\n\n3. **Vitreous Hemorrhage** - The patient's description of a \"hair\" moving across her vision could be related to a vitreous issue, possibly from a retinal tear or detachment.\n\n4. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion** - Although less likely, this condition can cause widespread retinal hemorrhages and should be considered.\n\n5. **Choroidal Melanoma** - While less likely given the findings, this neoplastic condition can cause vision changes and should not be entirely ruled out.\n\n6. **Age-related Macular Degeneration** - Although the patient is relatively young for typical AMD, it's a common cause of vision changes and should be considered.\n\n7. **Retinal Detachment** - The symptoms and exam findings could also be consistent with a retinal detachment, which is a surgical emergency.\n\n8. **Hypertensive Retinopathy** - Given the patient's hypertension, this could contribute to the vascular changes and hemorrhages seen in the eye.\n\n9. **Diabetic Macular Edema** - This condition can cause vision changes and is common in diabetic patients, although the findings here are more suggestive of neovascularization.\n\n10. **Ocular Ischemic Syndrome** - This condition, related to carotid artery disease, can cause similar retinal findings and should be considered in the differential.\n\nAfter considering all the information and test results, the top differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy**\n2. **Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion**\n3. **Vitreous Hemorrhage**\n\nThese three conditions best fit the clinical presentation and examination findings, with proliferative diabetic retinopathy being the most likely cause given the patient's history and the fluorescein angiography results.", "topic": "['Diabetes', 'Retinal Disorders', 'Diabetes and Endocrinology', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Ophthalmology']"}

He denied having fever, chills, fatigue, night sweats, or weight loss. He had no history of malignant neoplasm or chemical exposure. Physical examination findings demonstrated numerous erythematous, indurated nodules involving the surface of his head, neck, torso, and extremities, without ulceration or scarring (Figure, A and B). Findings of systemic reviews were unremarkable, and there was no lymphadenopathy or peripheral nerve enlargement. Complete blood cell count with differential results were normal (white blood cell count, 6060/μL, normal range, 4500-10 000/μL; absolute neutrophils, 3070/μL, normal range, 1800-8300/μL [to convert cell counts to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001]). Serum lactate dehydrogenase level was elevated (279 U/L, normal range, 100-240 U/L [to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167]). Biopsies from skin nodules (Figure, C) and bone marrow were obtained. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 29-year-old guy with these skin nodules that have been popping up all over his body for a couple of months. They're growing fast, but he says they don't hurt, which is interesting. He's not reporting any of those usual systemic symptoms like fever or weight loss, so that's something to note.\n\nFirst off, the nodules are erythematous and indurated, which makes me think of erythema nodosum. It's a common condition that can cause these types of skin lesions. But wait, erythema nodosum usually comes with some pain, and this guy's nodules are painless. That's a bit odd.\n\nOkay, let's consider other possibilities. Sweet's syndrome could be another contender. It's known for sudden onset of fever and leukocytosis, but this guy doesn't have those symptoms. Still, there's a variant that's more indolent and doesn't present with systemic symptoms, so it's worth keeping in mind.\n\nNow, what about lymphoma? Specifically, lymphomatoid papulosis? It can present with these kinds of nodules, and it's a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The nodules can be asymptomatic, which fits our case. Plus, lymphomatoid papulosis often has a chronic course, which aligns with the two-month history.\n\nLet's not forget about benign conditions. Lipomatosis could cause multiple nodules, but those are usually soft and not erythematous or indurated. So, that seems less likely here.\n\nOh, and there's sarcoidosis. It can cause skin nodules, but we'd expect some other symptoms like lung involvement or lymphadenopathy, which aren't present here. So, that's probably not it.\n\nNow, the lab results show a normal white blood cell count, which is good. But the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is elevated. That could indicate some kind of tissue breakdown or high cell turnover, which might point to a hematologic disorder.\n\nGiven all this, I'm leaning towards lymphomatoid papulosis. It fits the clinical presentation and the fact that the nodules are asymptomatic. The elevated LDH could be related to the lymphoproliferative nature of the condition.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. We should also think about other lymphomas, like mycosis fungoides. It's another form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, but it usually has a more gradual onset and the lesions might be different. Still, it's worth considering.\n\nAnd then there's the possibility of a benign condition like granuloma annulare. It can cause skin nodules, but they're usually more localized and not widespread like in this case. So, it seems less likely.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about infectious causes. Tuberculosis can cause skin manifestations, but we'd expect some systemic symptoms or a history of exposure, which aren't present here.\n\nIn the end, after thinking it all through, I'm still leaning towards lymphomatoid papulosis as the most likely diagnosis. It just fits the best with the painless, widespread nodules and the elevated LDH. But I'm keeping mycosis fungoides and Sweet's syndrome in mind as possibilities too, just in case.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 29-year-old man with rapidly growing, widespread, asymptomatic skin nodules:\n\n1. **Lymphomatoid Papulosis** - This condition fits well with the presentation of painless, widespread erythematous nodules and the elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, suggesting a lymphoproliferative disorder.\n\n2. **Sweet's Syndrome** - Although typically associated with systemic symptoms, there is a variant that can present without these, making it a consideration.\n\n3. **Erythema Nodosum** - Commonly presents with painful nodules, but the absence of pain in this case makes it less likely.\n\n4. **Mycosis Fungoides** - Another form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, but it usually has a more gradual onset and different lesion characteristics.\n\n5. **Sarcoidosis** - Typically involves other symptoms like lung issues or lymphadenopathy, which are not present here.\n\n6. **Lipomatosis** - Usually presents with soft, non-erythematous nodules, making it less likely in this scenario.\n\n7. **Granuloma Annulare** - Typically more localized and not widespread like the nodules in this case.\n\n8. **Tuberculosis** - Would expect systemic symptoms or a history of exposure, which are absent here.\n\n9. **Leukemia Cutis** - Could present with skin nodules, but usually accompanied by other systemic findings.\n\n10. **Follicular Mucinosis** - Associated with alopecia mucinosa, which is not mentioned, but could be considered given the lymphoproliferative context.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top three differential diagnoses are **Lymphomatoid Papulosis**, **Sweet's Syndrome**, and **Mycosis Fungoides**, as they best fit the clinical presentation and lab findings.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Oncology', 'Sarcomas']"}

She had no specific medical or family history and had no treatment. A resting electrocardiogram (ECG) while symptomatic showed a wide QRS complex rhythm at a rate of 81 beats per minute (Figure 1A). After a short walk, symptoms disappeared and another ECG was recorded (Figure 1B). Physical examination and transthoracic echocardiography results were normal. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Spontaneous abnormal automaticity from a left lateral accessory pathway", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a teenage girl who's been having these episodes of palpitations in her chest and neck for a few years now. They come on suddenly and then just stop. That's interesting. And she's also getting headaches during these episodes. No family history or previous treatments to speak of. So, what could be going on here?\n\nFirst, let's consider the possibility of a cardiac arrhythmia. The sudden onset and offset of her symptoms are really suggestive of something like that. Maybe it's supraventricular tachycardia, or SVT. That's pretty common in young people and can definitely cause palpitations.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions just yet. The ECG shows a wide QRS complex when she's having symptoms. That's a bit unusual for SVT, which usually has a narrow QRS complex unless there's something else going on, like an accessory pathway. So, could it be something like Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome? That could explain the wide QRS complex.\n\nHmm, but let's not forget about other arrhythmias. What about ventricular tachycardia? That can also cause a wide QRS complex. It's less common in teenagers without heart disease, but it's still a possibility we should consider.\n\nOh, and there's also the chance of a junctional tachycardia. That's another type of arrhythmia that could fit the bill, especially if there's an accessory pathway involved.\n\nNow, let's think about non-cardiac causes. Her symptoms could be related to something like a pheochromocytoma. That's a condition where a tumor releases hormones that can cause episodes of palpitations and headaches. It's not as common, but it's worth considering.\n\nAnd what about anxiety or panic attacks? They can cause similar symptoms, especially in teenagers. But the sudden resolution of symptoms with a change in activity makes this less likely.\n\nOkay, so let's also consider sinus tachycardia. That's when the heart beats faster than normal, but it's usually in response to something like exercise or stress. It doesn't quite fit her symptoms, but it's another possibility.\n\nHmm, how about atrial flutter? That's another type of arrhythmia that could cause palpitations, but it often has a regular rhythm, which doesn't quite match her description.\n\nLet's not forget about hyperthyroidism. That's a condition where the thyroid gland is overactive, leading to symptoms like palpitations. But we don't have any lab results to support that, so it's a bit of a stretch.\n\nAnd finally, there's the possibility of a sinus node reentry arrhythmia. That's a bit rare, but it could cause episodes of palpitations. It's not as likely as some of the other options, but it's worth keeping in mind.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top differential diagnosis is Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. It explains the wide QRS complex and the sudden onset and offset of her symptoms. Ventricular tachycardia and junctional tachycardia are also strong contenders. Pheochromocytoma is a possibility, but it's less likely without more evidence. Anxiety and sinus tachycardia don't quite fit as well. Atrial flutter and hyperthyroidism seem less likely given the information we have. And sinus node reentry is a rare possibility that we shouldn't completely rule out.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the top differential diagnosis for the teenage girl's symptoms is Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. This condition can explain the wide QRS complex observed on the ECG during her symptomatic episodes, as well as the sudden onset and offset of her palpitations. WPW syndrome is characterized by the presence of an accessory electrical conduction pathway in the heart, which can lead to episodes of tachycardia.\n\nFollowing WPW syndrome, ventricular tachycardia and junctional tachycardia are also strong contenders. These arrhythmias can produce similar symptoms and ECG findings. While ventricular tachycardia is less common in teenagers without underlying heart disease, it remains a possibility. Junctional tachycardia could also fit, especially if an accessory pathway is involved.\n\nOther considerations include pheochromocytoma, a condition where a tumor releases hormones leading to episodes of palpitations and headaches, although this is less likely without further evidence. Anxiety or panic attacks could cause similar symptoms, but the sudden resolution of symptoms with a change in activity makes this less probable.\n\nSinus tachycardia, atrial flutter, and hyperthyroidism are less likely given the specific characteristics of her symptoms and the ECG findings. Sinus node reentry arrhythmia is a rare possibility that should not be completely ruled out.\n\nIn summary, the ranked differential diagnoses are:\n1. Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome\n2. Ventricular tachycardia\n3. Junctional tachycardia\n4. Pheochromocytoma\n5. Anxiety or panic attacks\n6. Sinus tachycardia\n7. Atrial flutter\n8. Hyperthyroidism\n9.

We've got a male in his 60s with a hoarse and weak voice. That's pretty common, but let's see what else is going on. He's had follicular lymphoma before, and it's been a bit of a rollercoaster with multiple relapses. He even had an allogeneic stem cell transplant, which is a big deal. Oh, and he's been dealing with graft-vs-host disease. That's tough. He's been on sirolimus and steroids to manage it. Those medications can have some side effects, so let's keep that in mind.\n\nNow, about his voice. Hoarseness can be caused by a lot of things. Let's start with the basics. Could it be something like laryngitis? That's a common one. It's usually from an infection or maybe overusing the voice. But wait, his history is a bit more complicated than a simple infection.\n\nHmm, what about something more related to his transplant and medications? Chronic graft-vs-host disease could be causing some issues. It can affect various parts of the body, including the larynx. That might explain the nodular projections and edema on his vocal folds.\n\nBut let's not jump to conclusions. We should consider other possibilities. How about vocal fold polyps? Those can cause hoarseness too. They're usually benign, but they can change the voice.\n\nOh, and we can't forget about the possibility of recurrent lymphoma. He's had it before, and it could show up in the larynx. That's a serious consideration.\n\nThere's also the chance of steroid-induced laryngeal changes. Long-term steroid use can lead to things like laryngeal edema or even formations like polyps.\n\nHmm, what about infections? He's immunocompromised, so he's more vulnerable. Fungal infections like candidiasis could be a possibility. They can cause lesions and hoarseness.\n\nLet's not forget about non-infectious things like amyloidosis. It's rare, but it could deposit in the larynx and cause these kinds of symptoms.\n\nAnd then there's the possibility of a neoplasm, something like a squamous cell carcinoma. That's more serious, but it fits the profile of someone with his history.\n\nOh, and we should think about post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. It's a risk after transplants, especially with his history of lymphoma.\n\nFinally, let's consider something a bit less common like sarcoidosis. It can affect the larynx and cause similar symptoms.\n\nOkay, let's put it all together. Based on everything, I'd say the top differential diagnosis is chronic graft-vs-host disease. It fits well with his history and the laryngoscopy findings. Next would be recurrent lymphoma, given his history. Then, steroid-induced laryngeal changes make sense too. After that, let's consider vocal fold polyps, followed by post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. Squamous cell carcinoma is also a possibility.

We've got a 63-year-old woman who's having some trouble with her mouth. She's experiencing intermittent pain and can't open her mouth as wide as she used to. That's got to be uncomfortable. She's also feeling a burning sensation, especially when she uses mouthwash or eats spicy food. That's interesting.\n\nNow, she doesn't smoke or use chewing tobacco, but she does chew areca nuts. Hmm, that's something to consider. Areca nut chewing is known to cause some oral issues. Let's keep that in mind.\n\nDuring the physical exam, they found white-tan plaques on her oral mucosa and thickening of the buccal mucosae. That sounds like it could be related to the areca nut chewing. Her lips and skin around her mouth look fine, though. But, her mouth opening is limited—only about 25 mm. That's less than normal.\n\nThe biopsy shows subepithelial fibrosis with stromal hyalinization. There's no epithelial dysplasia or inflammation, which is good. So, it's likely not malignant. But the fibrosis could explain the restricted mouth opening.\n\nInitially, I'm thinking this could be oral submucous fibrosis. It fits with the areca nut chewing and the biopsy findings. But let's not jump to conclusions too quickly.\n\nWhat about other possibilities? Burning mouth syndrome could cause the pain and burning, but it doesn't usually cause fibrosis or restricted opening. So, probably not that.\n\nOral lichen planus can cause white lesions, but it typically has a different appearance and might have inflammation, which we don't see here. So, that's unlikely.\n\nMaybe it's a chronic condition like discoid lupus erythematosus? But that usually involves skin lesions, which she doesn't have. So, probably not that either.\n\nWhat about an autoimmune disorder like scleroderma? It can cause fibrosis, but it's usually more widespread and involves skin changes. Doesn't seem to match.\n\nCould it be medication-induced fibrosis? But she hasn't mentioned any medications that would cause this. So, that's probably not it.\n\nLet's think about infections. Chronic fungal infections like candidiasis can cause white plaques, but they don't usually cause fibrosis. So, that's unlikely.\n\nTraumatic fibroma is another possibility, but that's usually a localized lesion, not widespread like this. So, probably not that.\n\nNow, let's consider systemic conditions like amyloidosis. It can cause oral lesions and fibrosis, but it's usually part of a larger systemic issue. We don't have any other symptoms pointing to that, so it's a long shot.\n\nAfter going through all these possibilities, oral submucous fibrosis still seems like the best fit. The areca nut chewing, the biopsy findings, and the symptoms all point to it. I think we're on the right track with that diagnosis.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the 63-year-old woman is oral submucous fibrosis. This condition is strongly associated with areca nut chewing, which the patient has a history of doing. The symptoms, including the progressive decline in oral aperture, burning sensation, and the presence of white-tan plaques, along with the biopsy findings of subepithelial fibrosis with stromal hyalinization, align well with this diagnosis. Other potential conditions, such as burning mouth syndrome, oral lichen planus, discoid lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, medication-induced fibrosis, chronic fungal infections, traumatic fibroma, and amyloidosis, are less likely given the specific presentation and biopsy results. Therefore, oral submucous fibrosis remains the most fitting diagnosis. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Oral Submucous Fibrosis** - Strongly associated with areca nut chewing, consistent with symptoms and biopsy findings.\n2. Burning Mouth Syndrome - Could explain the burning sensation but not the fibrosis or restricted mouth opening.\n3. Oral Lichen Planus - Typically has different lesion characteristics and may involve inflammation, which is absent here.\n4.

A biopsy specimen was obtained from the right arm for histopathologic analysis. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cutaneous lupus erythematosus", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an 11-year-old girl with a rash that's been hanging around for about three weeks. It's on her face, arms, and legs, and she says it doesn't hurt or itch. That's interesting because a lot of rashes do itch. She's healthy otherwise, just has some seasonal allergies and takes cetirizine for that. No recent illnesses or new meds, so that's probably not it.\n\nOkay, so what's the rash like? It's erythematous, which means red, and it's forming rings and plaques. There's no scaling or crusting, which can help narrow things down. The fact that it's on sun-exposed areas makes me think about conditions that get worse with sun exposure.\n\nFirst, I'm thinking about discoid lupus erythematosus. It can cause red, inflamed patches, and it's worse with sun exposure. But, it usually has some scaling, so maybe that's not it.\n\nNext up, granuloma faciale. It's a kind of skin condition that causes red, persistent plaques, often on the face. But, it's not usually on the arms and legs, so that doesn't quite fit.\n\nThen there's erythema multiforme. It can cause target-like lesions and often follows infections or medication changes. But, she hasn't had any recent illnesses or new meds, and the rash isn't very target-like, so that's probably not it.\n\nLichen planus is another one to consider. It causes purplish, itchy bumps, but this rash isn't itchy, and it doesn't have that purple color. So, that's not it either.\n\nWhat about psoriasis? It usually has scaling, and this rash doesn't, so that's probably not it. But, there's a type called guttate psoriasis that can look like this, especially after a strep infection. Hmm, she didn't mention a sore throat, but kids can have strep without obvious symptoms.\n\nThen there's the idea of a drug eruption. She's been taking cetirizine for her allergies, but she's been on it for a while, so it's strange that this would just show up now. Still, drug reactions can be weird, so it's worth considering.\n\nAnnular lichen planus could be a possibility. It can cause ring-shaped lesions without much itching. But, it's not usually on the face, and it often has a bit of a different look.\n\nMajocchi's granuloma is another thought. It's a type of granuloma that can happen after a fungal infection, but she didn't mention any skin problems before this rash showed up.\n\nOh, and there's sarcoidosis. It can cause skin plaques, but it's pretty rare in kids, and she doesn't have any other symptoms that would point to that.\n\nLastly, what about a photodrug reaction? Cetirizine can cause photosensitivity, and that could explain the rash on sun-exposed areas. But, she's been on the medication for a while, so why would it happen now? Maybe something changed, like how much time she's spending outside.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the most likely explanation is a photodrug reaction from her cetirizine. It fits with the sun-exposed distribution and the fact that she's been on the medication. It's not perfect, but it makes the most sense with what we know.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 11-year-old girl's rash, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus** - This condition can cause red, inflamed patches that worsen with sun exposure, but it typically includes scaling, which is not present in this case.\n\n2. **Granuloma Faciale** - Known for causing persistent red plaques, often on the face, but it's not common on the arms and legs.\n\n3. **Erythema Multiforme** - Characterized by target-like lesions, often following infections or medication changes, but the rash doesn't have a target-like appearance and there's no recent illness or new medication.\n\n4. **Lichen Planus** - Typically presents with purplish, itchy bumps, which doesn't match the non-itchy, red nature of this rash.\n\n5. **Psoriasis (Guttate)** - Could be considered, especially post-streptococcal, but there's no mention of a recent sore throat, and the rash lacks scaling.\n\n6. **Drug Eruption** - Although she's been on cetirizine for a while, drug reactions can be unpredictable, making this a possibility.\n\n7. **Annular Lichen Planus** - Could cause ring-shaped lesions, but it's not typically found on the face and often has a different appearance.\n\n8. **Majocchi's Granuloma** - A type of granuloma that can occur after a fungal infection, but there's no history of preceding skin issues.\n\n9. **Sarcoidosis** - Rare in children, and she lacks other symptoms that would suggest this diagnosis.\n\n10. **Photodrug Reaction** - Cetirizine can cause photosensitivity, explaining the sun-exposed distribution, but it's unusual for this to occur after long-term use without previous issues.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the most likely diagnosis is a **Photodrug Reaction** due to cetirizine, given the sun-exposed distribution of the rash and the known photosensitizing potential of the medication. This explanation aligns well with the clinical presentation and patient history.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Rheumatology', 'Connective Tissue Disease of the Skin', 'Pediatrics']"}

This was associated with right eyelid ptosis and blurry vision. Prior to presentation, an outside ophthalmologist treated her with 1 week of oral prednisone, 20 mg/d, for presumed orbital inflammation with no improvement. She denied additional symptoms. Notably, she described headache and sudden vision loss in the right eye after coronary artery bypass grafting 1 year ago for several days before spontaneous improvement with incomplete resolution. Personal and family histories were negative for malignant neoplasm and autoimmune disease. Examination revealed right-sided uncorrected Snellen visual acuity of 20/60 associated with restricted supraduction, abduction, and infraduction. Pupils were equal in size without a relative afferent pupillary defect, and intraocular pressures were 10 mm Hg OD and 11 mm Hg OS. Visual fields had temporal restriction to confrontation of the right eye. Vision, motility, and visual fields were normal on the left. Pertinent findings included right-sided proptosis of 2 mm, cranial nerve V1 and V2 hypoesthesia, eyelid ptosis with a margin to reflex distance 1 of 0 mm, optic disc pallor, and vessel attenuation. Outside magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated an infiltrative mass involving right greater than left orbital apices, the right optic nerve, and right extraocular muscles. There was enhancement of the cavernous sinuses, right pterygopalatine fossa, right sphenoid wing, and right middle cranial fossa dura (Figure 1). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Neurosarcoidosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her early 70s with some pretty concerning symptoms. She's got this progressive proptosis and a severe headache that's been going on for a week. Plus, there's the right eyelid drooping and blurry vision. That's a lot to take in.\n\nFirst off, the fact that she's got a history of coronary artery disease and hypertension makes me think about vascular issues. Could this be something like a carotid-cavernous fistula? That would explain the proptosis and the headache. But wait, there's no mention of a bruit or pulsatile tinnitus, which usually comes with that. So, maybe not.\n\nNext, let's consider the lack of response to prednisone. If this was something inflammatory like orbital pseudotumor, you'd expect some improvement with steroids. But there was none, so that's probably not it.\n\nThe MRI shows an infiltrative mass involving the orbital apices and the optic nerve. That's pretty serious. It makes me think of something neoplastic or maybe even an infection. Lymphoma or metastatic disease could be possibilities. They can be sneaky like that, infiltrating without clear symptoms until it's too late.\n\nBut what about the cranial nerve involvement? The V1 and V2 hypoesthesia is interesting. That suggests something affecting the trigeminal nerve, maybe something in the cavernous sinus. That's where things like nasopharyngeal carcinoma come into play. They can extend and cause these kinds of issues.\n\nOh, and let's not forget the optic disc pallor and vessel attenuation. That points to something chronic, maybe compressive. A meningioma could do that, especially with the dural involvement shown on the MRI.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? We've got a few possibilities. There's the idea of a carotid-cavernous fistula, but like I said, no bruit or tinnitus. Orbital pseudotumor is unlikely due to the lack of steroid response. Lymphoma or metastatic disease is still on the table, given the infiltrative nature. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a contender too, especially with the cranial nerve involvement. And then there's meningioma, which fits with the chronic compressive signs.\n\nAlright, let's rank these. Based on everything, I'd say lymphoma is the top suspect. It's infiltrative, doesn't respond to steroids, and fits the MRI findings. Next is metastatic disease, for similar reasons. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is third, considering the cranial nerve involvement. Meningioma comes next, given the chronic and compressive aspects. And lastly, carotid-cavernous fistula, mainly because we're missing some key signs.\n\nSo, there we have it. Lymphoma seems to be the most likely culprit here, followed closely by metastatic disease. We'll need to keep an eye on this and maybe do some more tests to be sure.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Lymphoma** - Given the infiltrative nature of the mass and lack of response to steroids, lymphoma is a strong contender.\n2. **Metastatic Disease** - The infiltrative mass involving the orbital apices and optic nerve, along with the patient's age, makes metastatic disease a likely possibility.\n3. **Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma** - The involvement of cranial nerves V1 and V2 suggests a process that could be affecting the cavernous sinus, which is consistent with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.\n4. **Meningioma** - The chronic compressive signs, such as optic disc pallor and vessel attenuation, along with dural involvement on MRI, point towards a meningioma.\n5. **Orbital Pseudotumor** - Although the lack of response to steroids makes this less likely, it remains a consideration due to the inflammatory presentation.\n6. **Carotid-Cavernous Fistula** - Despite the absence of a bruit or tinnitus, the proptosis and headache could still suggest a vascular malformation like a carotid-cavernous fistula.\n7. **Chondrosarcoma** - The involvement of the sphenoid wing and orbit raises the possibility of a primary bone tumor like chondrosarcoma.\n8. **Mucocele** - An expanding mucocele could cause proptosis and compressive symptoms, although it's less likely given the infiltrative nature on MRI.\n9. **Glioma of the Optic Nerve** - The optic nerve involvement and chronic vision changes could suggest a glioma, particularly in the context of neurofibromatosis, although there's no mention of café-au-lait spots.\n10. **Invasive Fungal Sinusitis** - Given the patient's age and potential for compromised immunity, invasive fungal sinusitis could present with similar infiltrative features.\n\nReranking these possibilities based on all the information, the top three differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Lymphoma** - The infiltrative mass, lack of steroid response, and MRI findings make lymphoma the most likely diagnosis.\n2. **Metastatic Disease** - The aggressive nature of the mass and the patient's age support metastatic disease as the second most likely possibility.\n3. **Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma** - Cranial nerve involvement and the pattern of infiltration suggest nasopharyngeal carcinoma as a strong contender.\n\nThese diagnoses should be further investigated with appropriate imaging and biopsy to confirm the underlying cause.", "topic": "['External Eye Disease', 'Ophthalmology', 'Orbit']"}

He did not have any constitutional or systemic symptoms. Physical examination showed an isolated limitation of right eye abduction. The remainder of the examination, including visual acuity, pupillary reaction, visual fields, and fundoscopy, was unremarkable. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the head showed abnormal thickening and T2 hyperintensity of the right lateral rectus muscle with T1-weighted gadolinium enhancement (Figure 1). Tests for infection and autoimmune disease had negative results.  Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis did not demonstrate any evidence of malignancy. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "IgG4-related disease", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 60-year-old man who's been dealing with progressive painless diplopia for a week. That's double vision, and it's getting worse, but there's no pain. That's interesting because pain often points to inflammation or infection, but we don't have that here.\n\nHe's got a history of hypothyroidism and dyslipidemia. Those are pretty common, and he's on levothyroxine and rosuvastatin. Nothing too out of the ordinary there, but let's keep it in mind.\n\nNow, he's not reporting any changes in visual acuity or color vision, which is good. No ocular pain, erythema, or discharge either. And no headaches or any of that jaw claudication or scalp tenderness stuff, which can be important for things like giant cell arteritis. So, we can probably rule that out.\n\nHe's also not mentioning any ptosis, dysphagia, dysarthria, weakness, numbness, or ataxia. That's a lot of systems to be clear, so we're likely not dealing with something that's affecting his whole body or multiple parts of his nervous system.\n\nOn exam, there's an isolated limitation of right eye abduction. That's the right lateral rectus muscle, which is controlled by the sixth cranial nerve, the abducens nerve. So, something's going on with that nerve or the muscle itself.\n\nThe MRI shows thickening and T2 hyperintensity of the right lateral rectus muscle, and it's enhancing with gadolinium. That sounds like inflammation or maybe an infection, but the tests for those came back negative. Hmm, that's odd.\n\nLet's think about what could cause this. Painless diplopia and these MRI findings could point to a few things. Thyroid eye disease is a possibility. It's associated with thyroid problems, and he does have hypothyroidism. But usually, that comes with some other symptoms like ptosis or proptosis, and we don't have those here.\n\nWhat about orbital myositis? That's inflammation of the muscles around the eye, and it can cause diplopia. But it often comes with pain, and our guy isn't reporting any. Plus, the tests for inflammation are negative.\n\nWe should also consider a cavernous sinus lesion. That's a possibility because it's near the area where the sixth cranial nerve travels. But usually, you'd expect more extensive neurological signs, and we don't have those.\n\nLet's not forget about neoplasms. A tumor could cause these symptoms, but the CT scan didn't show anything in the abdomen or pelvis. Still, that doesn't completely rule it out.\n\nOkay, so what's the most likely cause here? Given the painless nature and the MRI findings, I'm leaning towards thyroid eye disease. It fits with his hypothyroidism, and the lack of pain or other symptoms makes sense in this context.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. We should consider other possibilities too. What about a microvascular issue, like a small stroke affecting the nerve? That could cause isolated nerve palsy without pain.\n\nOr maybe it's idiopathic orbital inflammation. That can cause muscle issues without systemic symptoms, and it might not show up on all tests.\n\nWe should also think about infections like syphilis. It can cause all sorts of neurological issues, but the tests were negative, so that's probably not it.\n\nAnd then there's the possibility of a neoplasm. We can't completely rule that out, even if the CT was clear. Maybe it's a small lesion that didn't show up.\n\nSo, after going through all of this, I think the top differential diagnosis is still thyroid eye disease. It fits the symptoms and the MRI findings, and his hypothyroidism is a risk factor.\n\nBut we should also keep microvascular cranial nerve palsy, idiopathic orbital inflammation, and neoplasm on our list. They're all possible, given the information we have.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Thyroid Eye Disease** - This condition is associated with thyroid dysfunction and can cause painless diplopia and muscle abnormalities on MRI, fitting the patient's profile.\n\n2. **Microvascular Cranial Nerve Palsy** - A small stroke or vascular issue affecting the abducens nerve could lead to isolated sixth nerve palsy without pain.\n\n3. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation** - This can cause muscle issues and MRI findings similar to those seen here, without systemic symptoms or positive inflammatory markers.\n\n4. **Neoplasm** - A tumor could cause these symptoms, and while the CT scan was clear, a small lesion might not be detectable.\n\n5. **Orbital Myositis** - Although typically painful, atypical presentations could be painless, and the MRI findings might align with this condition.\n\n6. **Cavernous Sinus Lesion** - A lesion in this area could affect the sixth cranial nerve, but usually, more extensive neurological signs would be present.\n\n7. **Sarcoidosis** - This condition can cause cranial nerve palsies and might not show up on initial tests, but it often has systemic manifestations.\n\n8. **Syphilis** - Neurosyphilis can cause various neurological issues, but the negative tests make this less likely.\n\n9. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome** - This condition involves painful ophthalmoplegia, but atypical cases might present without pain.\n\n10. **Chronic Idiopathic Pseudotumor** - This is a condition of unknown cause that can lead to orbital inflammation and similar MRI findings.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnosis is **Thyroid Eye Disease**, given the patient's hypothyroidism and the nature of the symptoms and MRI findings.

His temperature was 37 °C (98.5 °F); blood pressure, 124/75 mm Hg; pulse, 123/min; respiratory rate, 22/min; and oxygen saturation, 96% on room air. Findings on physical examination were unremarkable. His white blood cell count was 3300/μL (reference, 4500-11 000/μL) with an absolute lymphocyte count of 200/μL (reference, 1000-4800/μL). Chest radiograph showed bilateral reticulonodular opacities.

A computed tomography scan revealed diffuse bilateral pulmonary micronodular opacities, a 2.2-cm nodule in the lingula, and mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy (Figure 1). Results of HIV testing were positive for HIV-1 antibodies. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Disseminated histoplasmosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 60-year-old man who fainted, and he's been losing weight without trying. That's already a bit concerning. He's also been around COVID-19, but he doesn't have the usual symptoms like fever or cough. So, what's going on here?\n\nFirst, let's consider COVID-19. Even though he's had three negative tests, we can't completely rule it out. Sometimes the tests miss it, especially if he was tested too early or too late. But with no respiratory symptoms, it feels like a stretch.\n\nNow, his white blood cell count is low, and he's got a really low number of lymphocytes. That's a red flag for something affecting his immune system. HIV jumps to mind because it can cause these kinds of changes in blood counts. Plus, he's lost a significant amount of weight, which is another clue pointing towards HIV, especially if he's progressed to AIDS.\n\nThe chest X-ray and CT scan show some interesting things. There are reticulonodular opacities and lymphadenopathy. These could be signs of an opportunistic infection, which fits with the idea of HIV or AIDS. Maybe something like Mycobacterium avium complex or cytomegalovirus?\n\nOh, and let's not forget about his syncope. It could be related to the low oxygen levels we're seeing. If his lungs are affected by an infection, that might explain the hypoxia and the fainting.\n\nSo, what else could it be? Tuberculosis is a possibility. It can cause lung issues and lymphadenopathy, especially in someone who's immunocompromised. And it's more common in prisons, so that fits too.\n\nBut wait, there's also Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia to consider. It's common in people with HIV and can cause similar symptoms and lung findings.\n\nNow, let's think about non-infectious causes. Lymphoma could explain the lymphadenopathy and weight loss. And it can cause immune suppression, leading to secondary infections.\n\nOh, and what about sarcoidosis? It can cause lung changes and lymphadenopathy too. But it doesn't quite fit with the severe immune suppression we're seeing.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Based on everything, HIV with an opportunistic infection like Mycobacterium avium complex or Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia seems most likely. But we can't completely rule out tuberculosis or lymphoma yet. Sarcoidosis seems less likely given the immune suppression.\n\nIn the end, HIV with opportunistic infections is at the top of the list, followed closely by tuberculosis and lymphoma. We need to keep an open mind, but this feels like the right direction.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **HIV with Opportunistic Infection** - Given the patient's positive HIV test, significant weight loss, low white blood cell and lymphocyte counts, and lung findings, this is a strong consideration.\n\n2. **Disseminated Tuberculosis** - This could explain the lung opacities, lymphadenopathy, and the patient's incarceration, which increases the risk of TB exposure.\n\n3. **Pneumocystis Jirovecii Pneumonia (PCP)** - Common in HIV patients, PCP can cause the observed lung changes and hypoxia.\n\n4. **Lymphoma** - The lymphadenopathy and weight loss could suggest a lymphoma, which can also cause immune suppression.\n\n5. **Sarcoidosis** - Although less likely, sarcoidosis can cause lung changes and lymphadenopathy, but typically not this degree of immune suppression.\n\n6. **COVID-19** - Despite negative tests, COVID-19 could still be considered, especially with the lung findings, though the lack of typical symptoms makes it less likely.\n\n7. **Mycobacterium Avium Complex (MAC)** - This opportunistic infection is common in advanced HIV and can cause systemic symptoms and lung findings.\n\n8. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection** - In immunocompromised patients, CMV can cause pulmonary and systemic symptoms.\n\n9. **Kaposi's Sarcoma** - Associated with HIV, this could cause lung lesions and lymphadenopathy, though it's less likely to cause the blood abnormalities.\n\n10. **Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma** - Similar to lymphoma, this could explain the lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are HIV with opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium complex or Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia), followed by tuberculosis and lymphoma.

No lymphadenopathy was noted. Laboratory results showed normal serum calcium levels and leukocyte counts. Initial ultrasonography showed a 4.2-cm solid nodule adjacent to the lower pole of the right thyroid. Computed tomography results of the neck showed a 3.4-cm circumscribed, heterogenous, hypodense, enhancing mass that was abutting the inferior right thyroid and at the right lateral margin of the trachea. The mass was just medial to the right common carotid, causing left lateral displacement of the trachea (Figure 1). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Thymoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 58-year-old woman with a painless swelling on the right side of her neck. It's been there for a few weeks, and she hasn't had any trauma or recent illnesses. That's interesting. She's also not experiencing any respiratory issues, difficulty swallowing, or any other symptoms like fever or weight loss. That's good to know.\n\nNow, let's consider what's going on here. A painless neck swelling could be a few things. The first thing that comes to mind is a thyroid nodule. Thyroid nodules are pretty common and can be benign or, less commonly, malignant. So, that's definitely something to consider.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. We should think about other possibilities too. Lipomas are another type of swelling that can show up in the neck. They're usually soft and mobile, kind of like what we're seeing here. So, a lipoma is another potential candidate.\n\nOh, and there's also the possibility of a parathyroid adenoma. These can cause swelling in the neck too, although they're often associated with calcium level changes, and her calcium levels are normal. Still, it's worth keeping in the back of our minds.\n\nNow, let's look at the imaging results. The ultrasound and CT scans show a solid nodule near the thyroid. This is making me think more about thyroid-related issues. A thyroid nodule is still high on the list, but we should also consider other thyroid conditions, like a thyroid cyst. Although cysts are usually fluid-filled, we can't rule it out entirely yet.\n\nHmm, what about a branchial cleft cyst? Those can appear in the neck and are usually benign. They're a possibility, especially given the location and the fact that it's painless.\n\nLet's not forget about the possibility of a neurogenic tumor. These can occur in the neck and might not be immediately obvious. They're usually benign but could explain the mass we're seeing.\n\nOkay, so far we have a few ideas: thyroid nodule, lipoma, parathyroid adenoma, thyroid cyst, branchial cleft cyst, and neurogenic tumor. But we can't stop here. We need to think about other less common possibilities too.\n\nHow about a thymoma? Those can present as a mass in the anterior neck. They're not as common, but they're worth considering, especially since the mass is near the thyroid and trachea.\n\nAnd then there's the possibility of a sarcoma. The patient's sibling had a sarcoma, which makes me think there could be a familial component. Sarcomas are rare, but we can't ignore the family history.\n\nFinally, let's consider a carotid body tumor. These are located near the carotid artery and can cause neck swelling. They're not the most common, but the location fits.\n\nSo, after going through all of this, here's where we stand. The top possibilities are thyroid nodule, lipoma, parathyroid adenoma, thyroid cyst, branchial cleft cyst, neurogenic tumor, thymoma, sarcoma, and carotid body tumor. Each of these has some features that align with what we're seeing, and they all deserve consideration.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the neck mass, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Thyroid Nodule** - Given the location and characteristics of the mass, a thyroid nodule is a strong consideration.\n\n2. **Lipoma** - The mass is mobile and painless, which aligns with the typical presentation of a lipoma.\n\n3. **Parathyroid Adenoma** - Although calcium levels are normal, parathyroid adenomas can still present as neck masses.\n\n4. **Thyroid Cyst** - While cysts are usually fluid-filled, it's important to consider this in the differential diagnosis.\n\n5. **Branchial Cleft Cyst** - These can appear as painless neck masses and are a common benign condition.\n\n6. **Neurogenic Tumor** - Such tumors can occur in the neck and may present as painless masses.\n\n7. **Thymoma** - Although less common, thymomas can present in the anterior neck and should be considered.\n\n8. **Sarcoma** - The family history of sarcoma raises the possibility, despite its rarity.\n\n9. **Carotid Body Tumor** - Located near the carotid artery, these tumors can cause neck swelling.\n\n10. **Subacute Thyroiditis** - This condition can cause neck swelling and should be considered, especially if there's a history of viral illness.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top three differential diagnoses, in order of likelihood, are:\n\n1. **Thyroid Nodule** - The most likely given the imaging and clinical presentation.\n2. **Branchial Cleft Cyst** - A common benign condition that fits the description.\n3. **Neurogenic Tumor** - A plausible option given the location and characteristics.\n\nThese diagnoses take into account the mass's location, the patient's symptoms, and the imaging findings, as well as the family history of sarcoma.

He's got jugular venous distension and a right ventricular heave. These are classic signs of right heart strain. Plus, he's got a systolic murmur and edema in his legs. All of this is pointing towards right-sided heart failure.\n\nThe lab results are interesting. His BNP is really high, which suggests heart failure. And his hemoglobin is a bit low, which could mean anemia, possibly from those nosebleeds he's been having.\n\nThe echocardiogram is key here. It shows that his right ventricle is dilated, and the pressure in his pulmonary arteries is elevated. This is consistent with pulmonary hypertension. His left heart function is normal, so it's really the right side of the heart that's struggling.\n\nSo, what could be causing all of this? Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension is a strong possibility given his history of pulmonary embolism. It's when old clots don't fully resolve and cause ongoing problems in the lungs.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. We should consider other possibilities too. Pulmonary arterial hypertension could be another option. It's similar but not necessarily caused by clots. And what about left heart disease? Even though his left heart function looks normal now, maybe it wasn't always that way.\n\nWe can't ignore his hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia either. It can cause arteriovenous malformations in the lungs, leading to issues like hypoxemia. That might be contributing to his symptoms too.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about interstitial lung disease. His smoking history and age make this a possibility. It could cause lung restriction and hypoxia, which might explain some of his symptoms.\n\nNow, let's think about the tests. The echocardiogram shows right heart strain, which fits with pulmonary hypertension. But we should also consider a V/Q scan to check for unresolved clots and a right heart catheterization to measure pressures directly.\n\nAfter thinking it all through, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension seems like the most likely cause of his symptoms. But we should still keep pulmonary arterial hypertension, left heart disease, and interstitial lung disease on our radar. And we can't ignore the potential impact of his hereditary condition.\n\nSo, here's our list of possibilities: chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary arterial hypertension, left heart disease, interstitial lung disease, and lung arteriovenous malformations. Each of these could be contributing to his condition, and we need to consider them all.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, considering all relevant details:\n\n1. **Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension** - Given the patient's history of pulmonary embolism and current symptoms, this is a strong possibility.\n\n2. **Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension** - This condition could explain the right heart strain and elevated pulmonary pressures observed.\n\n3. **Left Heart Disease** - Although the echocardiogram shows normal left ventricular function, previous undetected issues could contribute to the patient's symptoms.\n\n4. **Interstitial Lung Disease** - The patient's age and smoking history make this a potential cause of his respiratory symptoms.\n\n5. **Lung Arteriovenous Malformations** - Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia increases the risk of these, which could lead to hypoxemia.\n\n6. **Cor Pulmonale** - Right-sided heart failure due to chronic lung disease is a consideration.\n\n7. **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)** - Smoking history and age make COPD a potential contributor to his breathing difficulties.\n\n8. **Sleep-Related Breathing Disorder** - Conditions like sleep apnea could exacerbate nocturnal hypoxemia and contribute to pulmonary hypertension.\n\n9. **Anemia** - The slightly low hemoglobin level could be due to chronic disease or bleeding from telangiectasias, impacting oxygen delivery.\n\n10. **Cardiac Sarcoidosis** - This could cause right heart dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension, although it's less likely without other systemic symptoms.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary arterial hypertension, given the evidence of right heart strain and elevated pulmonary pressures. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-related lung arteriovenous malformations and interstitial lung disease are also important considerations due to the patient's underlying conditions and symptoms. Each of these possibilities should be further investigated with appropriate tests like a V/Q scan and right heart catheterization.", "topic": "['Cardiology', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Geriatrics', 'Pulmonary Medicine', 'Venous Thromboembolism']"}

He had accompanying night sweats, fatigue, and decreased appetite. Initial physical examination revealed multiple distinct matted, firm left-sided cervical lymph nodes. Laboratory evaluation was notable for leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 3700/µL (to convert to 109/L, multiply by 0.001), a microcytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10), mean corpuscular volume of 58 µm3 (to convert to fL, multiply by 1), an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level of 548 U/L (to convert to µkat/L, multiply by 0.0167), and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 35 mm/h. Purified protein derivative and infectious mononucleosis testing were negative. A contrast-enhanced neck computed tomography (CT) scan revealed multiple lymph nodes with areas of central hypodensity, and a conglomerate of heterogeneous lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular region (level 5B), measuring approximately 3.7 × 1.4 × 3.6 cm (Figure). The otolaryngology service was consulted, and a left level Va and Vb selective neck dissection was performed. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an 11-year-old boy with a painful neck swelling on the left side that's been going on for two weeks. He's also got a fever, night sweats, fatigue, and he's not eating well. That's a lot going on. The physical exam shows these firm, matted lymph nodes on the left side of his neck. That's definitely something to pay attention to.\n\nNow, let's look at the lab results. He's got leukopenia, which means low white blood cells, and microcytic anemia, which means his red blood cells are smaller than usual. His hemoglobin is low too, so he's definitely anemic. There's also an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level and a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate. These are markers that can indicate inflammation or something more serious going on.\n\nThe PPD test for tuberculosis and the mononucleosis test are both negative. That's helpful because it rules out a couple of possibilities. The CT scan shows multiple lymph nodes with areas of central hypodensity. That could mean there's some necrosis or infection going on.\n\nSo, what could this be? Let's start with the basics. Lymphadenopathy can be caused by infections, autoimmune diseases, or cancers. Given the systemic symptoms like fever and night sweats, we should definitely consider infections and malignancies.\n\nFirst, let's think about infections. Tuberculosis is a big one, especially with neck swelling and systemic symptoms. But the PPD test is negative, so that makes TB less likely. Hmm, what about other infections like atypical bacteria or fungal infections? Those could still be possibilities.\n\nNow, let's consider malignancies. Leukemia or lymphoma could explain the leukopenia and anemia. They often cause systemic symptoms too. But wait, the CT scan shows these lymph nodes with central hypodensity. That's more typical of an infection or maybe a specific type of lymphoma.\n\nOkay, let's go through some differential diagnoses. First, we have tuberculosis, even though the PPD is negative. It's still on the list because it can be negative sometimes. Next, let's consider lymphoma, like Hodgkin's or non-Hodgkin's, because they can cause these symptoms and lymph node changes. Then there's leukemia, which could explain the blood abnormalities.\n\nWe should also think about other infections like atypical bacteria or fungal infections. They might not show up on routine tests but could still be causing these symptoms. Oh, and let's not forget about autoimmune diseases like Kawasaki disease or sarcoidosis. They can cause lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms too.\n\nNow, let's rank these possibilities. Based on the combination of symptoms, lab results, and imaging, lymphoma seems like a strong contender. It fits the pattern of lymphadenopathy, systemic symptoms, and the CT findings. Next, I'd put leukemia, given the blood abnormalities and systemic symptoms. Then comes tuberculosis, even with the negative PPD, because it can't be completely ruled out. After that, atypical bacterial or fungal infections seem possible, especially with the negative tests for other infections. Finally, autoimmune diseases like sarcoidosis or Kawasaki disease round out the list.\n\nSo, after going through everything, lymphoma is at the top of the list, followed closely by leukemia, then tuberculosis, and so on. This order makes sense given all the information we have.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 11-year-old boy with neck swelling and systemic symptoms:\n\n1. **Lymphoma** - Given the combination of lymphadenopathy, systemic symptoms like fever and night sweats, and the CT findings of lymph nodes with central hypodensity, lymphoma is a strong contender.\n\n2. **Leukemia** - The presence of leukopenia and microcytic anemia, along with systemic symptoms, suggests leukemia as a possible diagnosis.\n\n3. **Tuberculosis** - Despite the negative PPD test, tuberculosis remains a consideration due to the symptoms and lymph node characteristics.\n\n4. **Atypical Bacterial Infection** - Infections like atypical bacteria could cause similar symptoms and may not be detected in routine tests.\n\n5. **Fungal Infection** - Fungal infections can also present with lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms, especially in immunocompromised individuals.\n\n6. **Kawasaki Disease** - This disease can cause lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms, although it's more common in younger children.\n\n7. **Sarcoidosis** - Although rare in children, sarcoidosis can cause lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms.\n\n8. **Histiocytic Necrotizing Lymphadenitis (Kikuchi Disease)** - This condition can cause painful lymphadenopathy and fever.\n\n9. **Toxoplasmosis** - This parasitic infection can cause lymphadenopathy, although it's less likely to cause severe systemic symptoms.\n\n10. **Castleman Disease** - A rare condition that can cause lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms, often with characteristic lymph node changes on imaging.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top three differential diagnoses are lymphoma, leukemia, and tuberculosis, in that order, due to the combination of symptoms, lab results, and imaging findings.", "topic": "['Otolaryngology', 'Pediatrics']"}

That's not all; he's also got a fever, feels tired all the time, and has lost some weight. That's a lot going on.\n\nNow, he's got a history of HIV, and he stopped his treatment a while back. That's important because it means his immune system might not be doing so great. People with untreated HIV can have all sorts of infections and skin problems.\n\nSo, what could be causing these skin bumps? They're described as pink papules and umbilicated nodules. Hmm, that sounds like something I've heard before. Molluscum contagiosum comes to mind. It's a viral infection that can cause those kinds of lesions, especially in people with weakened immune systems like those with HIV.\n\nBut wait, there's more to consider. The fact that he's got systemic symptoms like fever, fatigue, and weight loss suggests there might be something more serious going on. These symptoms could point to a systemic infection or even a type of lymphoma. Hmm, like disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex or maybe non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Both of these are more common in people with untreated HIV.\n\nLet's not forget about the biopsy. It should give us some clues. If it shows those characteristic eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions, that would be a strong hint towards molluscum contagiosum. But if it shows something else, like atypical lymphocytes, that could point us towards a lymphoma.\n\nOkay, let's think about other possibilities. Bacillary angiomatosis is another condition that can cause skin lesions in people with HIV. It's caused by a bacterial infection and can also come with systemic symptoms. That's another one to keep in mind.\n\nOh, and we shouldn't overlook the possibility of Kaposi's sarcoma. It's a type of cancer that can cause skin lesions and is also associated with HIV. The lesions are usually more purple, but it's worth considering.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Based on everything, molluscum contagiosum seems like a strong possibility because of the skin findings and the patient's HIV status. But we can't ignore the systemic symptoms.

That's a pretty specific look.\n\nNow, she's also got these rough patches on her palms and soles, and some pitting. That's a bit unusual. Let's see what else is going on. Oh, she's had some imaging and scopes done. There's a suspicious thyroid lesion, a mass in her kidney, and a whole bunch of colon polyps. Wow, that's a lot.\n\nOkay, so let's think about what could be going on here. The skin stuff is making me think of MEN 2B. That's the one with mucosal neuromas and a marfanoid habitus, right? But wait, she's in her 60s. That's a bit older than usual for MEN 2B to just show up. Still, the combination of thyroid issue and colon polyps is really pointing in that direction.\n\nBut let's not jump to conclusions. What else could it be? The thyroid lesion is pretty suspicious. It's a TI-RADS 5, which means it's highly likely cancerous. Medullary thyroid carcinoma is a big part of MEN 2B. So that fits.\n\nThe colon polyps are another clue. Over 100 of them? That's a lot. It makes me think of familial adenomatous polyposis, which is connected to APC mutations. And that's linked to Gardner's syndrome. Hmm, Gardner's syndrome can have thyroid issues too, like papillary thyroid carcinoma. But the skin findings don't really match Gardner's.\n\nOh, and the kidney mass. That could be an important piece of the puzzle. MEN 2B doesn't usually have kidney issues, but maybe it's a coincidence. Or maybe it's something else entirely.\n\nLet's think about other possibilities. MEN 1 has a different set of symptoms, like parathyroid and pituitary tumors. That's not what's going on here. Neurofibromatosis? That's more about café-au-lait spots and neurofibromas, not really matching what we see here.\n\nOkay, let's wrap this up. The combination of the skin findings, thyroid lesion, colon polyps, and even the kidney mass is making MEN 2B the most likely diagnosis. It's rare for it to present this late, but it fits the symptoms.

That's quite a specific presentation. \n\nFirst off, the fact that he has AIDS means his immune system is really weak, so he's more likely to catch infections that wouldn't normally bother someone with a healthy immune system. That's important to keep in mind. \n\nNow, these skin lesions are pretty distinctive. The umbilicated papulopustules make me think of something viral. Molluscum contagiosum is known for causing those kinds of lesions, especially in people with HIV. So, that's my first thought. \n\nBut wait, there's also a cough. He's not running a fever, which is interesting, and he doesn't have other systemic symptoms. The cough could be something else entirely, maybe a respiratory infection. In someone with AIDS, we have to consider opportunistic infections. \n\nLet's think about what the Tzanck smear could show us. It's a quick test that can help us figure out if we're dealing with a viral infection. If it shows those giant cells or intranuclear inclusions, that would point us towards herpes simplex virus or varicella-zoster virus. \n\nBut, given the skin findings and his immunocompromised state, I'm still leaning towards molluscum contagiosum. It's common in people with HIV and fits the skin lesions perfectly. \n\nOh, but we shouldn't forget about other possibilities. In someone with AIDS, we have to be thorough. What about cryptococcosis? It can cause skin lesions and respiratory issues, although it's more often associated with meningitis. \n\nAnd then there's histoplasmosis.

It can cause a range of symptoms in people with AIDS, including skin lesions and respiratory issues. \n\nOkay, so where does that leave us? Based on the skin lesions and the Tzanck smear, molluscum contagiosum is still my top suspect.

She's already been treated with antibiotics and corticosteroids, but no luck there. So, what's going on?\n\nFirst off, infectious mononucleosis comes to mind. It's pretty common and can cause lymphadenopathy and fever. But wait, the antibiotics didn't work, and usually, mono doesn't need antibiotics. Hmm, let's keep that in mind but move on.\n\nNext, I'm thinking about lymphoma. It's a bit more serious, but it can cause these symptoms too. The lymph nodes are matted and there's no abscess, which is interesting. We'll need more tests to be sure, but it's a possibility.\n\nNow, let's consider Kawasaki disease. It's not just for kids; adults can get it too. The skin eruption and lymphadenopathy fit, but we don't have the full set of symptoms like conjunctivitis or changes in the extremities. Still, it's worth considering.\n\nWhat about HIV? It can cause persistent lymphadenopathy and fever. But there's no mention of risk factors or other symptoms like weight loss. It's a long shot, but let's not rule it out yet.\n\nOh, and there's tuberculosis. It's a classic cause of lymphadenopathy, especially with necrosis. But the tests didn't show anything, so it's unlikely. Let's put that on the back burner.\n\nNow, let's think about autoimmune diseases like lupus. The skin eruption and lymphadenopathy could fit, but we don't have any other typical lupus symptoms. And there are no hematoxylin bodies, which are usually present in lupus. Hmm, maybe not lupus.\n\nKikuchi disease is another possibility. It's a type of histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis that matches the symptoms and the biopsy findings. The absence of neutrophils and hematoxylin bodies is a big clue. This is starting to look like a strong contender.\n\nWe should also think about Castleman disease. It can cause lymphadenopathy and fever, and the biopsy might show some similar features. But the biopsy findings don't quite match up. Let's keep it in mind but not at the top of the list.\n\nWhat about sarcoidosis? It can cause lymphadenopathy, but we don't have any respiratory symptoms or other signs. The biopsy didn't show non-caseating granulomas either. So, it's unlikely.\n\nFinally, let's consider Rosai-Dorfman disease. It involves lymphadenopathy and can have similar biopsy findings. But the clinical presentation isn't quite right. It's not as likely as Kikuchi disease.\n\nSo, after going through everything, Kikuchi disease seems to be the best fit. The symptoms, biopsy findings, and lack of response to antibiotics all point to it. It's a rare condition, but it matches well with what we're seeing.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the 28-year-old woman is Kikuchi disease, also known as histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis. This condition is characterized by painful cervical lymphadenopathy, fever, and skin eruptions, which align with the patient's symptoms. The biopsy findings showing extensive coagulative necrosis, apoptosis, and karyorrhectic debris, along with the absence of neutrophils and hematoxylin bodies, further support this diagnosis.

Initial vital signs included blood pressure of 103/66 mm Hg, heart rate of 190 bpm, and temperature of 38.7 °C. Electrocardiogram showed monomorphic ventricular tachycardia with a morphology suggesting right ventricular (RV) origin (Figure 1). In addition to receiving intravenous amiodarone hydrochloride, she had correction of mild hypokalemia (3.1 mEq/L [reference range, 3.5-5.2 mEq/L]; to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 1.0). Successful arrhythmia termination occurred shortly thereafter, and her vital signs remained stable. Chest computed tomographic angiography excluded pulmonary embolism but showed pulmonary nodules and mediastinal lymphadenopathy that had progressed compared with her previous computed tomography. An echocardiogram showed severe RV and left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction with multiple areas of hypokinesis. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cardiac sarcoidosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her 90s who's come to the ER with a fever, coughing up blood, and passing out. That's pretty serious. She's got a history of breast cancer, so we can't ignore that. Her biopsy results showed granulomatous inflammation, which is interesting. It's not metastatic cancer, but something else is going on.\n\nHer vitals are a bit concerning too. Her heart rate is really high at 190 beats per minute, and she's got a fever. The ECG shows monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, which suggests something's off with her heart's rhythm, and it's coming from the right side.\n\nShe's on amiodarone, which is a heavy-duty medication for heart rhythm issues, and they also fixed her low potassium levels. That seemed to help with the arrhythmia, so maybe there's an electrolyte issue at play here.\n\nThe CT scan didn't show a pulmonary embolism, which is good, but it did show those pulmonary nodules and some lymph node enlargement in the mediastinum. That's a bit worrying because it could mean infection or something more serious like sarcoidosis.\n\nThe echocardiogram shows her heart's not pumping well, both the right and left sides are struggling. That could be from a lot of things, maybe cardiomyopathy or even infiltration from something like sarcoidosis.\n\nSo, what could be going on here? Let's start with sarcoidosis. It fits with the granulomatous inflammation and could explain the heart and lung issues. But wait, there's also the history of breast cancer. Could this be metastatic disease? Maybe, but the biopsy says no, so let's put that lower on the list.\n\nInfections like tuberculosis or fungal infections could cause granulomas too. They could also explain the fever and lung nodules. And what about arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy? That could cause the heart problems, but it doesn't explain the granulomas.\n\nOh, and there's giant cell myocarditis. That's rare, but it could cause the heart issues and might explain the granulomas. We should keep that in mind.\n\nLymphoma is another possibility. It could cause lymphadenopathy and maybe even the granulomas. And let's not forget about medication effects. Amiodarone can cause lung problems, so maybe that's playing a role here.\n\nAlright, let's put it all together. Sarcoidosis seems like a strong contender because it ties together the granulomas, lung issues, and heart problems. But we can't ignore giant cell myocarditis because it could explain the arrhythmia and granulomas. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is still on the list for the heart issues, but it doesn't explain everything. Lymphoma and infections like TB or fungal infections are also possibilities because they could cause the lymphadenopathy and granulomas. And finally, there's amiodarone-induced lung toxicity, which could be contributing to her lung problems.\n\nSo, the top of our list is sarcoidosis, followed closely by giant cell myocarditis. Then we have arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, lymphoma, TB, fungal infections, and amiodarone effects. That seems to cover all the bases.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Sarcoidosis** - This condition can explain the granulomatous inflammation, pulmonary nodules, and cardiac involvement, including arrhythmias and reduced cardiac function.\n\n2. **Giant Cell Myocarditis** - This rare condition could account for the arrhythmia, granulomatous inflammation, and cardiac dysfunction, making it a strong contender.\n\n3. **Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)** - This could explain the right ventricular origin of the tachycardia and the echocardiogram findings, but it doesn't account for the granulomas.\n\n4. **Lymphoma** - Given the mediastinal lymphadenopathy and pulmonary nodules, lymphoma is a possibility, as it can cause both lymph node enlargement and granulomatous reactions.\n\n5. **Tuberculosis** - This infection can cause granulomatous inflammation and pulmonary nodules, and could potentially explain the fever and systemic symptoms.\n\n6. **Fungal Infection** - Certain fungal infections can cause granulomatous inflammation and pulmonary nodules, especially in immunocompromised individuals.\n\n7. **Metastatic Breast Cancer** - Although the biopsy was negative for metastatic disease, the history of breast cancer cannot be entirely ignored, especially with progressive pulmonary nodules.\n\n8. **Amiodarone-Induced Lung Toxicity** - Amiodarone can cause lung problems, including pulmonary nodules and infiltrates, which could contribute to the patient's respiratory symptoms.\n\n9. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)** - This condition can cause granulomatous inflammation, pulmonary nodules, and cardiac involvement, although it more commonly affects the kidneys and upper respiratory tract.\n\n10. **Infective Endocarditis** - Although less likely, infective endocarditis could explain the fever, cardiac dysfunction, and embolic phenomena, especially if there are any valvular abnormalities.\n\nThese possibilities cover a range of conditions that could explain the complex presentation of symptoms and findings in this patient. Sarcoidosis and giant cell myocarditis are the top contenders, given their ability to explain both the cardiac and pulmonary findings.", "topic": "['Geriatrics', 'Heart Failure', 'Cardiac Imaging', 'Rhythm Disorders', 'Cardiology']"}

In addition, the patient described a progressively enlarging lesion on her left scalp, which she had initially noted in high school. She denied any overlying loss of hair, sharp pain, or bleeding from the scalp lesion, and she only reported pain with prolonged pressure. On her scalp examination, a 7-cm ill-defined spongy and pulsatile mass was noted with an overlying gray patch of hair. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain/orbit was initially performed (Figure, A and B), which demonstrated an ill-defined, diffuse, intensely enhancing scalp lesion in the left frontoparietal region with very prominent vascularity and underlying calvarial thickening. No osseous destruction or intracranial extension was present. Subsequent catheter angiography (Figure, C) confirmed the hypervascular mass, supplied via hypertrophied superficial temporal and occipital arteries with marked internal vascularity without direct involvement of the calvarium or intracranial structures. The patient underwent biopsy under general anesthesia; the specimen showed an ill-defined deep dermal/subcutaneous proliferation of spindle cells without significant nuclear pleomorphism or mitotic activity. The lesions stained positive for S100 and SOX10 immunostains. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Diffuse-type neurofibroma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 27-year-old woman who's been dealing with headaches and some visual-spatial issues, especially when driving at night. That's interesting. She's also noticed this lesion on her scalp that's been growing since high school. It's not painful, but it's definitely getting bigger. On examination, there's this 7-cm mass that's spongy and pulsatile. That's quite unique. And there's a gray patch of hair over it. Hmm, that's something to note.\n\nThe MRI shows an ill-defined, intensely enhancing lesion on her scalp. It's very vascular and there's some thickening of the underlying bone, but no destruction or extension into the brain. That's a relief. The angiography confirms it's a hypervascular mass, supplied by some enlarged arteries, but it's not involving the skull or brain directly. That's good news.\n\nNow, let's think about what this could be. Initially, I'm thinking about a hemangioma. They're vascular and can be on the scalp. But wait, the biopsy shows spindle cells that are positive for S100 and SOX10. That's more in line with a neural tumor, like a neurofibroma. But, do neurofibromas usually have this kind of vascularity? Hmm, not typically.\n\nLet's consider other possibilities. Could it be a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor? They can be more aggressive, but this lesion doesn't seem to have significant nuclear pleomorphism or mitotic activity, so that's less likely. What about a desmoplastic melanoma? It could present with spindle cells and S100 positivity, but the lack of significant atypia or mitoses makes this less convincing.\n\nMaybe it's something less common, like an angioleiomyoma. They're vascular and could fit the clinical presentation, but they usually aren't positive for S100. Hmm, that's a problem. Let's not forget about a glomus tumor. They can be vascular too, but they typically have a different histological appearance.\n\nOh, and there's the possibility of a scalp arteriovenous malformation. That would explain the vascularity, but not the spindle cell proliferation or the immunohistochemical findings. Hmm, that's a tough one.\n\nLet's think about the headaches and visual-spatial issues. Could they be related to the scalp lesion? Maybe there's something intracranial that's not obvious on the MRI. That makes me think of a meningioma. They can cause headaches and are often vascular, but they don't typically present as a scalp mass without intracranial involvement. Hmm, that's a stretch.\n\nWhat about a schwannoma? They can be positive for S100 and SOX10, and they're neural tumors. But, they're usually well-defined, not like this ill-defined mass. And the vascularity is atypical for a schwannoma.\n\nLet's not forget about a fibrous histiocytoma. They can present as a scalp mass, but they don't usually have this kind of vascularity or stain positive for S100. Hmm, that's unlikely.\n\nFinally, there's the possibility of a solitary fibrous tumor. They can be vascular and have a spindle cell component, but they typically have a different immunohistochemical profile. Hmm, that's not quite right either.\n\nAfter considering all of this, I think the most likely diagnosis is a neurofibroma. It fits the immunohistochemical findings, and while the vascularity is unusual, it's not impossible. The other options just don't align as well with the clinical and histological presentation.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the provided information, the differential diagnoses for the scalp lesion can be considered as follows:\n\n1. **Neurofibroma** - This is the most likely diagnosis given the positive S100 and SOX10 staining, which are indicative of a neural tumor. Although the vascularity is atypical for a neurofibroma, it's not impossible.\n\n2. **Desmoplastic Melanoma** - This could be considered due to the spindle cell morphology and S100 positivity. However, the lack of significant atypia or mitotic activity makes this less convincing.\n\n3. **Angioleiomyoma** - This is a vascular lesion, but it typically does not stain positive for S100, making it less likely in this case.\n\n4. **Glomus Tumor** - Known for being vascular, but the histological appearance usually differs from the described spindle cell proliferation.\n\n5. **Scalp Arteriovenous Malformation** - This would explain the vascularity but not the spindle cell findings or immunohistochemical results.\n\n6. **Meningioma** - Could be considered due to the headaches and potential intracranial involvement, but it doesn't typically present as a scalp mass without intracranial extension.\n\n7. **Schwannoma** - Also positive for S100, but usually well-defined, unlike the ill-defined mass described.\n\n8. **Fibrous Histiocytoma** - Presents as a scalp mass but lacks the vascularity and S100 positivity seen here.\n\n9. **Solitary Fibrous Tumor** - Can be vascular with spindle cells, but the immunohistochemical profile typically differs.\n\n10. **Hemangioma** - Vascular in nature, but the spindle cell proliferation and specific immunohistochemical staining pattern are not typical.\n\nAfter considering all the information, neurofibroma is the most fitting diagnosis, despite the atypical vascularity.

The lesions started as an erythematous papule on the face, which had progressed to larger plaques within 10 years. There was involvement of the upper respiratory tract, causing palatal perforation and stridor, necessitating a tracheostomy a year ago. In addition, there was history of wheezing and breathlessness. There was no history of preceding trauma, fever, malaise, joint pain, cough, epistaxis, hemoptysis, or hematuria. Examination revealed multiple well-defined brown erythematous scaly plaques with central scarring measuring 2 × 1 to 8 × 7 cm on the face, arm, and thighs. The patient also had saddle nose deformity, perforation of the hard palate, and necrotic plaques on the ear, causing destruction of ear cartilage (Figure, A and B). There was cervical lymphadenopathy: multiple, nontender, discrete nodes, ranging from 1.5 to 2 cm without any surface changes. The results of sensory examination and peripheral nerve examination were within normal limits. Respiratory examination and chest radiography results were normal. Hemogram showed anemia (hemoglobin, 10.1 g/dL [to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0]); the results of a kidney function test, a liver function test, a fasting blood glucose test, and routine urinalysis were within normal limits. Serologic analysis results for HIV-1/2, antinuclear antibody, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. Punch skin biopsy was obtained for histopathologic analysis and culture (Figure, C). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Phaeohyphomycosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her 30s with these red, scaly plaques on her face and arms. They've been there for a decade and have gotten bigger over time. That's quite a while to have something like this without it being diagnosed. \n\nNow, she's also got some serious stuff going on with her nose and palate. There's a saddle nose deformity and even a hole in her hard palate. That's pretty significant. And she's had to get a tracheostomy because of stridor. That's a big deal. \n\nOh, and there's wheezing and breathlessness too. But no fever or joint pain, which is interesting. \n\nThe plaques are well-defined and have central scarring. That's a clue. And there's necrotic plaques on her ear, which is causing destruction of the ear cartilage. That's another big clue. \n\nShe's also got some lymph nodes in her neck that are nontender. That's something to consider. \n\nHer blood work shows anemia, but everything else is normal. And she's negative for HIV, ANA, and ANCA. So, we can rule those out. \n\nGiven all this, let's think about what it could be. Granuloma faciale is a possibility because it causes red plaques on the face, but it doesn't usually involve the palate or cause systemic symptoms. So, maybe not that. \n\nHow about lupus vulgaris? It can cause plaques and scarring, and it involves the nose and palate sometimes. But usually, there's a history of tuberculosis exposure or a positive tuberculin test. We don't have that info here. \n\nRelapsing polychondritis could explain the ear and nasal cartilage issues, but it usually has more systemic symptoms like fever and joint pain, which she doesn't have. \n\nWegener's granulomatosis, now called granulomatosis with polyangiitis, could fit. It can cause respiratory tract involvement, skin lesions, and systemic symptoms. But usually, there are c-ANCA antibodies, and hers are negative. Hmm, that's a problem. \n\nMaybe it's still Wegener's? Sometimes the c-ANCA can be negative. Let's keep it in mind. \n\nWhat about sarcoidosis? It can cause skin lesions and lymphadenopathy, but usually, there are other systemic symptoms or positive serum markers, and her chest X-ray is normal. So, probably not that. \n\nCould it be discoid lupus erythematosus? It causes skin plaques and scarring, but it doesn't usually involve the palate or cause systemic symptoms like wheezing. So, maybe not. \n\nLet's think about infectious causes. Syphilis can cause mucosal and skin lesions, but it doesn't usually cause this kind of cartilage destruction. And her serology is negative for that. \n\nHow about leprosy? It can cause skin lesions and nerve involvement, but she doesn't have nerve issues, and her skin lesions aren't typical for leprosy. \n\nMaybe it's a fungal infection like sporotrichosis? It can cause skin lesions, but it doesn't usually involve the respiratory tract like this. \n\nOkay, let's go back to Wegener's. Even with the negative c-ANCA, it still fits the best with the respiratory tract involvement, skin lesions, and systemic symptoms. \n\nSo, after thinking it through, I'm leaning towards Wegener's granulomatosis, or granulomatosis with polyangiitis, as the most likely diagnosis. It just fits the best with everything we're seeing.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis. This condition is characterized by granulomatous inflammation and necrotizing vasculitis affecting the upper and lower respiratory tracts and kidneys, and it can also involve the skin. The presence of erythematous scaly plaques, saddle nose deformity, palatal perforation, and ear cartilage destruction, along with wheezing and anemia, aligns well with GPA. Although the c-ANCA test is negative, which is often positive in GPA, it is not definitive, and the clinical presentation strongly suggests this diagnosis. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's granulomatosis)**\n2. Lupus vulgaris\n3. Relapsing polychondritis\n4. Discoid lupus erythematosus\n5. Sarcoidosis\n6. Syphilis\n7. Leprosy\n8. Fungal infections (e.g., sporotrichosis)\n9. Granuloma faciale\n10.

It's a type of lesion that babies can have right from birth, and it's not uncommon on the tongue. \n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. What about a hemangioma?

Three weeks prior, she had presented with mild fever and flulike symptoms, associated with a severe frontal headache that was mildly relieved by analgesics. Her medical history was positive for relapsing urinary tract infections since early infancy without adequate follow-up. Findings of an ophthalmological examination 1 year prior were reported as normal. At initial examination, she was conscious but somewhat lethargic. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/80 OS. Pupillary light responses, extrinsic ocular motility, anterior segment biomicroscopy, and intraocular pressure were normal in both eyes. Dilated fundus examination revealed a bilateral sectorial macular star that was more extended in the left eye, with retinal veins slightly dilated and tortuous, attenuated arterioles, some juxta and peripapillary nerve fiber layer infarcts, and optic disc edema with marked papillary telangiectasia; in addition, some faint, small, tan-yellow dots were observed at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium in the posterior pole, some of them already grayish and with a hypopigmented halo (Figure 1). Optical coherence tomography displayed elevated optic discs and hyperreflective material in the outer plexiform layer temporal to the optic disc in both eyes and a macular neurosensory detachment in the left eye. Results of visual field testing were normal in the right eye and showed a central scotoma in the left eye. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Hypertensive retinopathy", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 13-year-old girl who's been dealing with painless vision loss in her left eye for a week. That's quite concerning, especially with the central scotoma. And it all started after some flulike symptoms and a headache three weeks ago. Hmm, that's interesting. \n\nFirst, I'm thinking about conditions that could cause these kinds of visual symptoms. Painless vision loss often points to something going on with the retina or optic nerve. So, let's consider optic neuritis. It's a common cause of vision loss in young people and can follow a viral illness. \n\nBut wait, there's more to consider. The fundus exam shows a macular star, which isn't typical for optic neuritis. This makes me think of other possibilities, like neuroretinitis. That's when inflammation affects both the optic nerve and retina, and it can definitely cause a macular star. \n\nNow, what about those retinal changes? The dilated and tortuous veins, along with attenuated arterioles, are quite specific. This pattern is often seen in Eale's disease, which involves retinal vasculitis. It's a bit rare, but it fits the description. \n\nOh, and let's not forget about the history of urinary tract infections. That's a bit of a red herring, but it could be relevant if we're thinking about a systemic condition. Maybe something like sarcoidosis, which can cause uveitis and affect the kidneys. \n\nBut sarcoidosis doesn't quite fit the retinal findings. The macular star and retinal vein changes are more suggestive of an infectious cause, like cat scratch disease. That's known to cause neuroretinitis and could explain the symptoms after a flulike illness. \n\nHowever, I'm not entirely convinced. The lack of systemic symptoms and specific history makes me question cat scratch disease. I should consider other infectious causes, like toxoplasmosis. It can cause retinal changes and might explain the macular star. \n\nBut wait, toxoplasmosis usually causes well-defined retinal lesions, which aren't mentioned here. So, what else could it be? I should think about other conditions that cause macular stars, like Stargardt disease. It's a genetic condition that affects the retina, but it doesn't usually cause optic disc edema. \n\nNow, let's not forget about the possibility of a vascular issue, like a retinal artery occlusion. That could cause sudden vision loss, but it doesn't explain the macular star or optic disc changes. \n\nHmm, I'm also thinking about papillitis, which is inflammation of the optic nerve head. It could cause the optic disc edema and vision loss, but not the macular star. \n\nOh, and what about a condition like familial exudative vitreoretinopathy? It affects the retinal vasculature and could explain the macular star and optic disc changes. But it's usually diagnosed earlier in life. \n\nAlright, let's put it all together. Considering the symptoms, exam findings, and history, I think the most likely diagnosis is neuroretinitis, possibly due to an infectious cause like cat scratch disease. But I should keep Eale's disease and other possibilities in mind, given the unique retinal findings.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 13-year-old girl's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Optic Neuritis** - This is a common cause of painless vision loss in young individuals and can follow a viral illness.\n\n2. **Neuroretinitis** - This condition involves inflammation of the optic nerve and retina, often presenting with a macular star, which matches the fundus findings.\n\n3. **Eale's Disease** - Characterized by retinal vasculitis, this condition can cause the observed dilated and tortuous retinal veins and attenuated arterioles.\n\n4. **Cat Scratch Disease** - An infectious cause of neuroretinitis, which can occur after a flulike illness and is consistent with the macular star and optic disc changes.\n\n5. **Toxoplasmosis** - A parasitic infection that can cause retinal changes, although it typically presents with well-defined lesions.\n\n6. **Stargardt Disease** - A genetic condition affecting the retina, which can cause macular changes but usually does not present with optic disc edema.\n\n7. **Retinal Artery Occlusion** - A vascular event causing sudden vision loss, but it doesn't typically result in a macular star or optic disc edema.\n\n8. **Papillitis** - Inflammation of the optic nerve head, which can cause optic disc edema and vision loss but not a macular star.\n\n9. **Familial Exudative Vitreoretinopathy (FEVR)** - A genetic condition affecting retinal vasculature, which could explain the macular star and optic disc changes, though it's usually diagnosed earlier.\n\n10. **Sarcoidosis** - A systemic condition that can cause uveitis and affect the kidneys, but it doesn't fit the specific retinal findings well.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the most likely diagnosis is **Neuroretinitis**, possibly due to an infectious cause like **Cat Scratch Disease**.

A physical examination, including flexible laryngoscopy, revealed cobbling, adherent, thick yellow mucus and ulceration of the uvula (Figure 1A). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Leishmaniasis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 62-year-old man who's been dealing with a sore throat for two weeks. That's quite a while to have a sore throat, so it's probably not just a simple viral thing. Viral pharyngitis usually clears up within a week or so. \n\nNow, let's see what else is going on. He doesn't have a fever, myalgia, or a rash. That's interesting because if it were something like infectious mononucleosis, we'd expect to see a fever. So, maybe that's not it. \n\nThe physical exam shows cobbling, thick yellow mucus, and ulceration of the uvula. Hmm, that sounds pretty specific. The cobbling and ulceration make me think of something more serious than just a regular bacterial infection like strep throat. \n\nOkay, so what could cause these symptoms? Candidiasis comes to mind because it can cause white plaques, but they're usually removable, and this mucus is described as thick and yellow. Maybe it's not candidiasis. \n\nHerpes simplex virus could cause ulcerations, but those are typically more widespread and not just on the uvula. So, that seems less likely. \n\nWhat about epiglottitis? That's serious, but it usually comes with more severe symptoms like difficulty swallowing or shortness of breath, and the problem is higher up in the throat. This doesn't quite fit. \n\nAphthous ulcers? They're usually painful but don't have this thick mucus, and they're not typically on the uvula. So, probably not that. \n\nNow, let's think about bacterial causes. Strep throat is possible, but it usually comes with fever and other symptoms. This doesn't seem to fit the bill. \n\nCould it be diphtheria? That causes a thick, adherent membrane, but it's pretty rare and usually comes with more systemic symptoms. Still, it's worth considering. \n\nWhat about a fungal infection like histoplasmosis? That's more common in certain regions and can cause ulceration, but it's usually associated with more systemic illness. \n\nAnd then there's tuberculosis. It can cause chronic symptoms and ulceration, but it's not typically just on the uvula, and we'd expect a cough or other respiratory symptoms. \n\nSo, after thinking through all of this, diphtheria seems like a strong possibility. The thick, adherent membrane and ulceration fit, even if it's rare. It's worth investigating further. \n\nBut wait, let's not forget about less common causes. What about something like Wegener's granulomatosis? It can cause ulceration and might fit the symptoms better than the infectious causes. \n\nIn the end, I think Wegener's granulomatosis could be the best fit. It explains the chronic nature and the specific ulceration of the uvula. That seems like the most likely diagnosis.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the symptoms and examination findings, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step presenting a unique potential diagnosis:\n\n1. **Diphtheria** - The presence of a thick, adherent membrane and ulceration aligns with diphtheria, although it is rare.\n2. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)** - This condition can cause chronic ulceration and may fit the symptoms better than infectious causes.\n3. **Candidiasis** - While typically presenting with removable white plaques, atypical presentations could resemble the described symptoms.\n4. **Herpes Simplex Virus** - Known for causing ulcerations, but these are usually more widespread and not confined to the uvula.\n5. **Epiglottitis** - Although it involves the upper airway, it typically presents with more severe symptoms like dysphagia and respiratory distress.\n6. **Aphthous Ulcers** - These are painful but don't usually present with thick mucus and are not typically located on the uvula.\n7. **Streptococcal Pharyngitis** - Commonly presents with fever and other systemic symptoms, which are absent in this case.\n8. **Histoplasmosis** - A fungal infection that can cause ulceration, but it's usually associated with more systemic illness and specific geographic exposure.\n9. **Tuberculosis** - Can cause chronic symptoms and ulceration, but it's not typically isolated to the uvula and often involves pulmonary symptoms.\n10. **Lemierre's Syndrome** - Although it primarily involves the tonsils and can lead to sepsis, it could be considered due to the chronic nature of symptoms.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are **Diphtheria** and **Wegener's Granulomatosis**, as they most closely align with the chronicity and specific findings of ulceration and adherent mucus on the uvula.

One month prior to his ED visit, he had been treated with oral antibiotics when he presented to an urgent care center with left-sided otorrhea, otalgia, and hearing loss. In the ED, he denied headaches, fever, otalgia, otorrhea, or hearing loss. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with contrast showed diffuse enhancement and possible coalescence in the left mastoid process with adjacent dural enhancement and sigmoid sinus occlusion. He received intravenous vancomycin and cefepime and was started on a heparin drip before being transferred to our facility. On presentation at our facility, the patient appeared well with normal vital signs. There was no periauricular swelling or erythema. Otoscopic examination showed no inflammation of the external auditory canals, and the tympanic membranes were translucent without evidence of retraction or effusion. Computed tomographic venogram confirmed occlusion of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses, and computed tomography of the temporal bone showed coalescence of mastoid air cells with erosion into the sigmoid sinus. Mastoidectomy was performed for biopsy and culture specimens. Histologic findings from the specimens demonstrated cells with oval nuclei and abundant cytoplasm arranged in syncytial clusters with occasional whorls, pseudoinclusions, and psammomatous calcifications (Figure, A). Immunohistochemical stains were positive for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and vimentin (Figure, B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Meningioma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 64-year-old man who's been dealing with seizures for a couple of years. He recently had some ear issues, like otorrhea and hearing loss, and was given antibiotics. Now, he's in the ER with breakthrough seizures. That's a lot going on.\n\nThe MRI shows something interesting. There's this enhancement and possible coalescence in the left mastoid process. Plus, there's dural enhancement and sigmoid sinus occlusion. That sounds like it could be serious, maybe an infection like mastoiditis or even something like a brain abscess.\n\nBut wait, he doesn't have the usual symptoms like fever or pain. That's odd. And the ear exam doesn't show inflammation or anything. So, maybe it's not an infection after all.\n\nThe CT venogram confirms the sinus occlusion, and the temporal bone CT shows mastoid air cell coalescence with erosion into the sigmoid sinus. This is definitely pointing towards something aggressive in the mastoid area.\n\nNow, let's look at the histology. The cells have oval nuclei and abundant cytoplasm, and they're arranged in syncytial clusters. There are whorls and pseudoinclusions, and even psammomatous calcifications. That's a pretty specific pattern.\n\nThe immunohistochemical stains are positive for EMA and vimentin. Okay, so we're dealing with a tumor that has both epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics. This is starting to sound like a meningioma.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the imaging and histology findings make meningioma the most likely diagnosis. It explains the sinus occlusion and the mastoid changes. Yeah, that fits well.\n\nBut let's not jump to conclusions too fast. We should consider other possibilities. Could it be something like a schwannoma or an osteosarcoma? They can appear aggressive on imaging too.\n\nAnd what about metastatic disease? That could cause bone erosion and sinus involvement. We should keep that in mind.\n\nOh, and there's also fibrous dysplasia, which can cause bone changes, but it doesn't quite fit the histology.\n\nLangerhans cell histiocytosis could be another option. It can cause bone lesions, but the histology isn't quite right for that either.\n\nHmm, what about a glomus jugulare tumor? Those can involve the temporal bone and sinuses, but the histology doesn't match.\n\nChondrosarcoma could be a contender too. It can have aggressive features on imaging, but again, the histology isn't a perfect fit.\n\nSo, after considering all these options, meningioma still seems like the best fit. The histology and imaging findings align well with it.\n\nBut wait, let's not forget about osteoblastoma. It can cause bone changes and has a distinct histological appearance. It's worth considering.\n\nIn the end, after looking at all the possibilities, meningioma is still the top contender. It just explains everything the best.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is a meningioma. The histological findings, including cells with oval nuclei and abundant cytoplasm arranged in syncytial clusters, along with whorls, pseudoinclusions, and psammomatous calcifications, are characteristic of a meningioma. Additionally, the positive immunohistochemical stains for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and vimentin further support this diagnosis. The imaging findings of dural enhancement and sigmoid sinus occlusion also align well with a meningioma. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Meningioma** - The histological and immunohistochemical findings, along with the imaging features, strongly support this diagnosis.\n2. **Osteoblastoma** - While it can cause bone changes, the histology isn't as typical for osteoblastoma as it is for meningioma.\n3. **Schwannoma** - Could appear aggressive on imaging, but the histology doesn't match as well as meningioma.\n4. **Metastatic Disease** - Can cause bone erosion and sinus involvement, but the histology is more characteristic of a meningioma.\n5. **Chondrosarcoma** - Can have aggressive imaging features, but the histology isn't as consistent with this diagnosis.\n6. **Fibrous Dysplasia** - Can cause bone changes, but the histology doesn't fit as well as meningioma.\n7. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis** - Can cause bone lesions, but the histology isn't typical for this condition.\n8. **Glomus Jugulare Tumor** - Involves the temporal bone and sinuses, but the histology doesn't match.\n9. **Osteosarcoma** - Aggressive on imaging, but the histology is more consistent with meningioma.\n10. **Cholesteatoma** - Typically associated with different clinical and histological findings, making it the least likely option.", "topic": "['Otolaryngology', 'Otology', 'Epilepsy and Seizures', 'Neurology']"}

Examination of the skin was notable for erythematous and hyperpigmented patches covering 90% of the body surface area, consistent with her known mycosis fungoides. Other notable findings on examination were 1- to 2-cm lymphadenopathy in the bilateral inguinal folds and axillae. Review of systems was notable for fatigue. The patient had previously received 5 cycles of romidepsin with progression of disease, followed by 4 doses of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, which was followed by partial response. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Medication adverse effect", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 53-year-old woman with a history of mycosis fungoides, which is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. She's showing up with new hyperpigmentation in her mouth. That's interesting. The black macules and patches are on her tongue, the roof of her mouth, and inside her cheeks. And they're not painful or itchy, which is a bit unusual.\n\nFirst, I should consider if this could be related to her mycosis fungoides. It's possible that the lymphoma is involving her mucosa now. That would be a progression of her disease. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet.\n\nAddison's disease could be another possibility. It's known for causing skin hyperpigmentation, and it can happen in the mouth too. But usually, there are other symptoms like low blood pressure or electrolyte imbalances. I don't see any mention of those here, so maybe it's less likely.\n\nWhat about medication effects? She's been on romidepsin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. I know these drugs can cause skin reactions, but oral pigmentation isn't a common side effect. Still, it's worth keeping in mind.\n\nOh, and there's acanthosis nigricans. It causes velvety dark skin changes, usually in the folds, but it's more common in people with insulin resistance. I don't think that's what's happening here, especially since it's not really in the typical areas.\n\nThen there's Laugier-Hunziker syndrome. It's a rare condition that causes oral pigmentation, but it's usually found in middle-aged women, so that fits. It's benign, though, and she has a history of lymphoma, so it seems like a stretch.\n\nI should also think about metastatic melanoma. It can cause oral pigmentation, and she has a history of a serious skin condition. But usually, you'd expect to see a primary melanoma site or more aggressive symptoms.\n\nPeutz-Jeghers syndrome is another one to consider. It causes oral pigmentation and polyps in the gut. But she's 53, and you'd usually see this earlier in life. Plus, there's no mention of gastrointestinal issues.\n\nLet's not forget about hemochromatosis. It causes skin pigmentation due to iron overload, but it's more of a systemic thing. I'd expect to see other symptoms like liver problems or diabetes.\n\nAnd then there's chronic graft-versus-host disease. It can cause skin and oral changes, but she hasn't had a transplant, so that's not likely.\n\nLastly, there's smoker's melanosis. It's related to tobacco use, but she hasn't mentioned smoking, so it's probably not that.\n\nOkay, let's put it all together. Given her history of mycosis fungoides and the new oral hyperpigmentation, I think the most likely explanation is that her lymphoma is involving her mucosa. That fits with her disease progression. The other possibilities are less likely given her history and the specific presentation.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the oral hyperpigmentation in the context of the patient's history of mycosis fungoides:\n\n1. **Mucosal involvement of mycosis fungoides** - Given the patient's history, this is the most likely explanation for the new oral hyperpigmentation.\n\n2. **Addison's disease** - Although it causes skin hyperpigmentation, the lack of other symptoms like fatigue, low blood pressure, or electrolyte imbalances makes it less likely.\n\n3. **Medication effect (romidepsin or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin)** - While these drugs can cause skin reactions, oral pigmentation is not a common side effect.\n\n4. **Acanthosis nigricans** - Typically associated with insulin resistance and not usually presenting in the oral mucosa.\n\n5. **Laugier-Hunziker syndrome** - A benign condition causing oral pigmentation, but unlikely given the patient's history of lymphoma.\n\n6. **Metastatic melanoma** - Could cause oral pigmentation, but usually accompanied by a primary melanoma site or more aggressive symptoms.\n\n7. **Peutz-Jeghers syndrome** - Characterized by oral pigmentation and gastrointestinal polyps, but typically presents earlier in life.\n\n8. **Hemochromatosis** - Causes skin pigmentation due to iron overload, but is a systemic condition with other expected symptoms.\n\n9. **Chronic graft-versus-host disease** - Unlikely as the patient has not undergone a transplant.\n\n10. **Smoker's melanosis** - Related to tobacco use, but there is no mention of smoking in the patient's history.\n\nReranking these differentials based on the patient's history and presentation, the top three considerations would be:\n\n1. **Mucosal involvement of mycosis fungoides**\n2. **Medication effect (romidepsin or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin)**\n3. **Addison's disease**\n\nThese three are the most plausible given the context, with mucosal involvement of mycosis fungoides being the most likely.", "topic": "['Hematology', 'Oncology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Lymphomas']"}

We've got a 7-year-old boy who's been really sick for a week with a high fever, a bad cough, and he's just not his usual energetic self. He's been on antibiotics for a few days, but they're not working. That's a red flag that this might not be a simple bacterial infection.\n\nNow, he lives in rural China and is around animals like dogs, cattle, and sheep all the time. That's interesting because it could mean he's picked up something from them. Zoonotic diseases can be tricky, so let's keep that in mind.\n\nHis vital signs are a bit concerning. His heart rate and respiratory rate are up, and his oxygen saturation is on the lower side. Plus, we can't hear breath sounds on the right side of his chest. That's not good. It could mean something's going on in his lungs, like fluid or a mass.\n\nThe lab results are really intriguing. His white blood cell count is normal, but there's a high percentage of eosinophils. Eosinophilia can point towards a parasitic infection or an allergic reaction. Hmm, parasites might be a lead worth exploring.\n\nThe imaging is a big clue. The CT scan shows a big cyst in his right lung that's collapsed the lung, and he's also got cysts in his liver. This sounds a lot like hydatid disease, which is caused by the Echinococcus tapeworm. It's common in rural areas where there are a lot of livestock.\n\nSo, let's think about what else it could be. A lung abscess could cause a fever and cough, but it wouldn't explain the eosinophilia or the cysts in the liver. We can probably rule that out.\n\nHow about tuberculosis? It's common in some parts of the world, but the tests for it came back negative, and there's no sign of a cavitary lesion. So, TB seems unlikely.\n\nCould it be something like a pulmonary fungal infection? Fungal infections can cause lung issues, but they don't usually cause liver cysts or eosinophilia. So, that's probably not it either.\n\nWhat about a diaphragmatic hernia? That could cause lung compression, but it wouldn't explain the cysts or the eosinophilia. It's not fitting the whole picture.\n\nLet's not forget about other parasitic infections like ascariasis or strongyloidiasis. They can cause eosinophilia, but they don't usually cause big cysts in the lung and liver. So, they're less likely.\n\nOkay, let's wrap this up. Considering the combination of symptoms, the boy's environment, and the imaging results, hydatid disease is still the most likely diagnosis. It fits everything we're seeing. But we should still keep an open mind and consider other possibilities like a lung abscess or a fungal infection, even if they're less likely.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the 7-year-old boy is hydatid disease, caused by the Echinococcus tapeworm. This diagnosis is supported by the boy's symptoms, his environment, and the imaging findings of cysts in both the lung and liver. Here is a 10-step differential diagnosis list, considering all the information and test results:\n\n1. **Hydatid Disease** - This is the most likely diagnosis given the presence of cysts in the lung and liver, eosinophilia, and the boy's exposure to livestock in a rural area.\n\n2. **Lung Abscess** - While a lung abscess could cause fever and cough, it doesn't typically cause eosinophilia or liver cysts.\n\n3. **Tuberculosis** - Despite being common in certain regions, the negative test results for tuberculosis make it an unlikely cause.\n\n4. **Pulmonary Fungal Infection** - Fungal infections can affect the lungs but usually don't cause liver cysts or significant eosinophilia.\n\n5. **Diaphragmatic Hernia** - This could cause lung compression but doesn't explain the cysts or eosinophilia.\n\n6. **Ascariasis** - While it can cause eosinophilia, it doesn't typically result in large cysts in the lung and liver.\n\n7. **Strongyloidiasis** - This parasitic infection can cause eosinophilia but not usually large cystic structures in the organs.\n\n8. **Paragonimus Infection** - A type of lung fluke that can cause cystic changes, but it's less common and doesn't fit as well as hydatid disease.\n\n9. **Cystic Echinococcosis** - Similar to hydatid disease, it's caused by Echinococcus species, but hydatid disease is more specific to the findings.\n\n10. **Amebic Liver Abscess** - Could cause liver cysts but doesn't typically involve the lungs or cause eosinophilia.\n\nHydatid disease remains the most fitting diagnosis given the combination of symptoms, exposure history, and imaging results.

The skin biopsy shows granulomatous dermatitis with foamy histiocytes. That's a big clue. But, the acid-fast bacilli stain and mycobacterial PCR are negative. Hmm, that's odd.\n\nSo, what could this be? Let's start with leprosy. It's known for nerve thickening and skin lesions, and it's endemic in places like Samoa. But, the Fite Faraco stain didn't show Mycobacterium leprae. That's a bit of a setback for the leprosy theory.\n\nLet's think about other possibilities. Sarcoidosis could be an option. It can cause granulomatous inflammation, but it doesn't usually involve nerve thickening like this. And what about tattoos? Could they be causing a granulomatous reaction? It's possible, but would it explain the nerve issues?\n\nMaybe it's some other type of mycobacterial infection. But the negative PCR results make that less likely. What about a fungal infection? The biopsy didn't show any fungi, so that's probably not it.\n\nCould it be a neuropathic condition like Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease? That could explain the nerve problems, but not the skin lesions. And what about a vitamin deficiency like vitamin B6? That can cause neuropathy, but would it cause these skin findings?\n\nLet's not forget about leprosy again. Even though the stain was negative, it's still a strong contender given the nerve and skin findings, and his background from Samoa. Maybe the bacteria just weren't in the biopsy sample.\n\nSo, after thinking it through, I'd say the top differential diagnosis is still leprosy. It just fits too well with the symptoms and his history. But, I'm also considering sarcoidosis and a tattoo-related reaction as possibilities, even though they don't explain everything.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the top differential diagnosis for this patient is leprosy. The presentation of annular skin lesions, nerve thickening, numbness, and claw-hand deformity, along with the patient's background from Samoa, strongly suggests leprosy. Although the Fite Faraco stain did not show Mycobacterium leprae, this does not completely rule out leprosy, as the bacteria may not have been present in the biopsy sample. Other considerations include sarcoidosis and a reaction related to his tattoos, but these do not fully explain the nerve involvement and other symptoms as effectively as leprosy does. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Leprosy** - Despite the negative Fite Faraco stain, the clinical presentation and geographic history make this the most likely diagnosis.\n2. **Sarcoidosis** - This condition can cause granulomatous inflammation but typically does not involve the nerve thickening seen in this patient.\n3. **Tattoo-related Granulomatous Reaction** - Possible given the patient's multiple tattoos, but this would not typically cause the nerve findings.\n4. **Other Mycobacterial Infection** - Negative PCR results make this less likely, but it remains a consideration.\n5. **Fungal Infection** - The biopsy did not show any fungal organisms, making this less likely.\n6. **Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease** - This could explain the nerve issues but not the skin lesions.\n7. **Vitamin B6 Deficiency** - Could cause neuropathy but would not explain the skin findings.\n8. **Lupus** - Negative ANA test makes this unlikely.\n9. **Rheumatoid Arthritis** - Negative rheumatoid factor makes this unlikely.\n10. **Syphilis** - Negative RPR test makes this unlikely.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Neuropathy']"}

Two weeks prior, she had upper respiratory symptoms and bacterial conjunctivitis treated with topical ofloxacin. On examination, pupils were fixed and dilated to 8 mm, extraocular movements were intact, and fundus examination was normal. She had brisk reflexes, poor coordination, and a wide-based unsteady gait. Bloodwork revealed leukocytosis and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate; cultures remained without growth. Lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid studies, computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging of brain and orbits were normal. The patient was discharged 3 days later following improvement in lethargy and gait with a diagnosis of acute cerebellar ataxia. When she presented to ophthalmology for 1-week follow-up, her visual acuity was central, steady, and maintained in both eyes. She demonstrated sluggish but reactive pupils and new-onset ophthalmoplegia. She was unable to move either eye in any direction, including with doll’s head maneuver. She was readmitted to the hospital and demonstrated diminished reflexes bilaterally and unsteady gait.

We've got a 3-year-old girl who suddenly can't walk right and has these big, fixed pupils. That's pretty unusual. Hmm, she had a respiratory infection and conjunctivitis a couple of weeks ago. Could that be related? Maybe it's some kind of post-infectious thing. Let's consider Guillain-Barré syndrome first. It's known for causing issues after an infection.\n\nBut wait, there's more. She's got these dilated pupils and now can't move her eyes at all. That's not typical for Guillain-Barré. This is getting more complicated. Could it be a type of encephalitis? That might explain the neurological symptoms. But the scans are normal, so maybe not.\n\nOh, and there's this nerve root enhancement on the MRI. That's a big clue. It suggests something affecting the peripheral nerves. Let's think about chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. It's like a cousin of Guillain-Barré but more chronic. Could that fit?\n\nBut what about the eye symptoms? The pupils and ophthalmoplegia are really pointing towards something cranial nerve-related. Fisher syndrome could be a possibility. It's a variant of Guillain-Barré that affects the eyes. But does it explain the nerve root findings?\n\nHmm, let's not forget about botulism. It can cause big pupils and muscle weakness. But usually, you'd see some respiratory issues too, and the MRI findings don't quite match.\n\nWhat about myasthenia gravis? It can cause muscle weakness and eye problems, but it doesn't usually come with nerve root enhancement on MRI. So that's probably not it.\n\nLet's think about infections. Could this be some kind of polychondritis or even Lyme disease? They can affect multiple systems, but the timing and symptoms don't quite add up.\n\nOh, and there's this idea of a paraneoplastic syndrome. They can cause weird neurological symptoms, but in a 3-year-old? That's pretty rare. Still, it's worth considering.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? We've got a mix of symptoms that don't fit neatly into one box. Maybe it's a rare variant of Guillain-Barré or CIDP with some atypical features. Or perhaps it's something else entirely, like a paraneoplastic process. We need to keep an open mind and consider all possibilities.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 3-year-old girl, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Guillain-Barré Syndrome** - This is a common post-infectious neurological disorder that can cause muscle weakness and sometimes cranial nerve involvement.\n\n2. **Fisher Syndrome** - A variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome characterized by ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia, which aligns with some of the symptoms.\n\n3. **Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)** - Similar to Guillain-Barré but with a more chronic course, which could explain the nerve root enhancement on MRI.\n\n4. **Botulism** - Known for causing dilated pupils and muscle weakness, but typically involves respiratory issues and doesn't usually show nerve root enhancement on MRI.\n\n5. **Myasthenia Gravis** - Characterized by muscle weakness and ocular symptoms, but nerve root findings on MRI are not typical.\n\n6. **Acute Cerebellar Ataxia** - Initially considered, but the progression of symptoms suggests a more complex condition.\n\n7. **Encephalitis** - Could explain neurological symptoms, but normal scans make this less likely.\n\n8. **Relapsing Polychondritis** - A rare condition that can affect multiple systems, but the presentation doesn't fully match.\n\n9. **Lyme Disease** - Can cause neurological symptoms, but the timing and symptom progression are not typical.\n\n10. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - Rare in children, but could explain the unusual combination of symptoms.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are Guillain-Barré Syndrome and Fisher Syndrome, given the post-infectious context and neurological involvement.

It began with a quarter-size maculopapular lesion and continued to progress during the next 3 years. He reported limited shoulder movements and denied other symptoms. There was no medical or surgical history, and he had a negative personal or familial oncologic history. The patient was a construction worker and used tobacco daily. On physical examination, there was a 24 × 15-cm fungating, necrotic, and ulcerated left shoulder mass (Figure 1A). A punch biopsy showed sheets of highly pleomorphic atypical spindle and epithelial cells within the superficial and deep dermis, extending into the subcutaneous tissue, and with 18 mitoses/mm2. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated SOX10-positive and pankeratin-negative tumor cells. A whole-body positron emission tomographic and computed tomographic scan revealed an intensely hypermetabolic left shoulder mass and multiple hypermetabolic enlarged left axillary lymph nodes, with no distant metastases (Figure 1B). Brain magnetic resonance imaging was negative for intracranial metastasis. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Melanoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 46-year-old guy with a big, nasty-looking mass on his left shoulder. It's been growing for three years, and now it's huge and ulcerated. That's definitely concerning. He's a construction worker and uses tobacco, which might be relevant, but let's not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nFirst off, the mass is really big and has been growing slowly. That makes me think of something malignant. The fact that it's fungating and necrotic is a red flag for something aggressive. So, we're probably dealing with a type of sarcoma or maybe a carcinoma.\n\nThe biopsy results are interesting. We've got highly pleomorphic atypical spindle and epithelial cells. That's a mouthful, but it basically means the cells look really abnormal and varied, which is typical for a high-grade malignancy. There are 18 mitoses per square millimeter, so the cells are dividing rapidly. That's another sign of something aggressive.\n\nNow, let's look at the immunohistochemistry results. The tumor cells are SOX10-positive and pankeratin-negative. SOX10 positivity makes me think of melanoma or maybe a neural crest-derived tumor. The fact that they're pankeratin-negative rules out a carcinoma, so we're likely dealing with a mesenchymal or neural crest tumor.\n\nThe imaging results show the mass is highly metabolic, and there are also some hypermetabolic lymph nodes in the axilla. That suggests the tumor is aggressive and might be spreading locally, but there are no distant metastases, which is a bit of a relief.\n\nSo, what could this be? Initially, I thought of malignant fibrous histiocytoma, which is an aggressive sarcoma. But wait, the SOX10 positivity is throwing me off. That's more typical for melanoma or something neural crest-derived.\n\nLet's rethink this. With the SOX10 positivity and the spindle cell morphology, melanoma is a strong contender. It's known for being aggressive and can have varied presentations.\n\nBut, I'm not entirely convinced. The lack of pankeratin and the specific morphology makes me question if it's really melanoma. Could it be something like a clear cell sarcoma? That's a type of sarcoma that can mimic melanoma and is also SOX10-positive.\n\nI should also consider other possibilities. Liposarcoma could be an option, but it doesn't quite fit with the SOX10 positivity. What about epithelioid sarcoma? It can have a similar morphology, but it's usually pankeratin-positive, so that's unlikely.\n\nDedifferentiated liposarcoma is another thought, but it doesn't typically show SOX10 positivity. And then there's angiosarcoma, which can be aggressive and have a similar morphology, but it's usually CD31-positive, and we don't have that information here.\n\nAfter going through all this, I'm leaning towards clear cell sarcoma. It fits the SOX10 positivity and the morphology. But, I'm still open to other possibilities, like a poorly differentiated sarcoma or even an unusual presentation of melanoma.\n\nIn the end, I think clear cell sarcoma is the most likely diagnosis, but I'd want to do some more tests or get a second opinion to be sure.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the shoulder mass, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma (Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma)**: This aggressive sarcoma is known for its pleomorphic spindle cells and high mitotic rate, fitting the initial description.\n\n2. **Melanoma**: The SOX10 positivity and presence of atypical epithelial cells suggest melanoma, especially given its potential for aggressive behavior and varied presentations.\n\n3. **Clear Cell Sarcoma**: This sarcoma can mimic melanoma and is also SOX10-positive, making it a strong contender given the immunohistochemical profile.\n\n4. **Epithelioid Sarcoma**: Although typically pankeratin-positive, its epithelioid morphology could align with the atypical epithelial cells observed.\n\n5. **Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma**: While it doesn't typically show SOX10 positivity, its aggressive nature and potential for pleomorphic cells keep it in consideration.\n\n6. **Angiosarcoma**: Known for its aggressive behavior and potential for necrosis, although CD31 positivity would be expected, which is not mentioned.\n\n7. **Pleomorphic Liposarcoma**: Another high-grade sarcoma with pleomorphic features, though SOX10 positivity would be unusual.\n\n8. **Spindle Cell Carcinoma**: Despite the pankeratin-negative result, some carcinomas can present with spindle cell morphology and aggressive features.\n\n9. **Neurogenic Sarcoma (Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor)**: SOX10 positivity could relate to neural crest origin, and these tumors can display aggressive behavior.\n\n10. **Poorly Differentiated Sarcoma, Not Otherwise Specified**: Given the complex immunohistochemical and morphological features, a generic high-grade sarcoma remains a possibility.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Clear Cell Sarcoma** emerges as the most likely diagnosis due to the SOX10 positivity and the morphology of the tumor cells. However, **Melanoma** remains a close differential given the overlapping features.

He remained unconscious for several hours and spontaneously regained consciousness over 24 hours. There was no history of fever, weight loss, limb weakness, vision impairment, or any strokelike illness. His birth and developmental history were unremarkable.

His blood pressure was 170/110 mm Hg with less than 10 mm Hg difference of systolic and diastolic blood pressure in other limbs. Abdominal examination revealed abdominal bruit. Fundus examination revealed papilledema with changes of hypertensive retinopathy. He was not oriented to place and time. The cranial nerves, motor, sensory, and autonomic system examination were unremarkable. Meningeal signs were absent. There was no evidence of neurocutaneous markers. His cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral white matter hyperintensity that was more marked in the bilateral parieto-occipital region. Ultrasound of the abdomen revealed a small right kidney and renal Doppler was suggestive of right renal-artery stenosis.

We've got a 6-year-old with a headache and seizures, and he's been unconscious for a while. That's pretty serious. The headache has been going on for a month, and it's not just any headache. It's occipital, and sometimes it gets really bad with vomiting and sensitivity to light and sound. That sounds like migraine, but with the seizures and altered consciousness, there's more going on.\n\nNow, the seizures. He had several episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and then he was out for several hours. That's not typical for just a simple migraine. We need to consider something neurological, maybe a structural issue in the brain?\n\nBut wait, there's also the blood pressure. It's really high, 170/110 mm Hg. That's not normal for a kid. And there's an abdominal bruit. That suggests some kind of vascular issue. Could it be renal artery stenosis? That would fit with the high blood pressure.\n\nThe eye exam shows papilledema and hypertensive retinopathy. That's definitely related to the high blood pressure. And the MRI shows white matter hyperintensity, especially in the parieto-occipital region. That could be from the high blood pressure causing changes in the brain.\n\nSo, what's going on here? We've got high blood pressure, an abdominal bruit, and changes in the kidney and brain. This is pointing towards a systemic vascular issue. Maybe something like Takayasu arteritis or another vasculitis that's affecting the renal and cerebral vessels.\n\nOh, and the CTA shows narrowing of the right renal artery and some thickening of the descending aorta. That fits with Takayasu arteritis, which can cause large vessel inflammation and narrowing.\n\nBut let's not jump to conclusions. We should consider other possibilities. Neurofibromatosis type 1 can cause vascular issues too, but there are no skin findings, so that's less likely. And we should think about other causes of secondary hypertension, like renal artery stenosis from other causes, such as fibromuscular dysplasia.\n\nThe reduction in white matter hyperintensities on the repeat MRI is interesting. It suggests that the brain changes are reversible, maybe with treatment of the high blood pressure.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Takayasu arteritis seems like the most likely diagnosis. It explains the high blood pressure, the abdominal bruit, the MRI findings, and the vascular changes.

A computed tomography–guided fine-needle aspiration was performed, which demonstrated blood, fibrin, and rare mesenchymal cells. Given her ongoing symptoms, the patient requested surgical resection. The patient underwent transoral robotic surgery for resection of her PPS mass to achieve definitive diagnosis and treatment. Histopathologic evaluation demonstrated a well-circumscribed, 12-mm mass. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Venous malformation", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 71-year-old woman with a mass in the parapharyngeal space. That's a pretty common area for certain types of tumors. Given her age, I'm immediately thinking about the usual suspects like pleomorphic adenoma, which is pretty common in this area. It's benign, but we can't rule it out just yet.\n\nNow, let's look at the MRI results. The mass is well-circumscribed and ovoid, which usually points to something benign. It's isointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2, with heterogeneous enhancement. That sounds like it could be vascular. Hmm, maybe a paraganglioma? Those are known to be hypervascular and show up in the PPS.\n\nBut wait, let's not forget about the FNA results. They showed blood, fibrin, and some mesenchymal cells. That's interesting. Blood and fibrin could mean something vascular, like a paraganglioma or even a hemangioma. But mesenchymal cells? That's a bit different. Could it be something like a schwannoma?\n\nOkay, let's think about the symptoms. She's got left jaw tightness, aural fullness, and facial discomfort. These could be due to the mass pressing on nearby structures. Paragangliomas can definitely cause these symptoms if they're compressing nerves or other tissues.\n\nNow, let's consider other possibilities. What about a minor salivary gland tumor? Those can show up in the PPS and have a varied appearance on imaging. Or maybe a branchial cleft cyst? Those are usually cystic, but they can appear in this area too.\n\nOh, and we can't forget about malignant possibilities. Squamous cell carcinoma or even a metastatic tumor could show up here, especially in someone her age. But the imaging and FNA don't really scream malignancy, so let's put those lower on the list.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Based on everything, I'd say paraganglioma is still high on the list. But we should also consider pleomorphic adenoma and schwannoma. Minor salivary gland tumors and branchial cleft cysts are possibilities too, but they seem less likely. And we'll keep malignancies like squamous cell carcinoma and metastatic tumor on the radar, just in case.\n\nAfter thinking it through, here's the revised list: paraganglioma, pleomorphic adenoma, schwannoma, minor salivary gland tumor, branchial cleft cyst, squamous cell carcinoma, and metastatic tumor.

A non–contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was performed (Figure 1). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Gallstone ileus", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 70-year-old woman who's been dealing with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain for the past three days. She's got a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and gallstones. That's quite a bit to consider. \n\nFirst off, her blood pressure is pretty low at 80/60 mm Hg, and her heart rate is up at 122 beats per minute. That's a red flag for something serious going on. She's also afebrile, so we can probably rule out an infection right off the bat. \n\nHer abdomen is distended and slightly tender all over. That could mean a lot of things, but let's keep it in mind as we go. Her white blood cell count is slightly elevated, which might point to inflammation or stress, but it's not super high, so maybe not a full-blown infection. \n\nThe C-reactive protein level is a bit up too, which supports the idea of some inflammation. Her potassium is low, which can happen with vomiting, and her creatinine is way up from her baseline. That's concerning for kidney function. \n\nNow, let's think about what could be going on. With her history of gallstones, gallstone ileus jumps to mind. It's when a gallstone causes a blockage in the intestines. That would fit with the abdominal distension and vomiting. \n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. We should consider other possibilities too. Small bowel obstruction from other causes could look similar. Maybe it's not a gallstone; maybe it's something else like adhesions or a tumor. \n\nOh, and what about acute mesenteric ischemia? That could explain the abdominal pain and the low blood pressure. It's a serious condition where the blood supply to the intestines is cut off. \n\nWe should also think about congestive heart failure. She's got a history of it, and maybe her heart is acting up, leading to gut issues. But her symptoms don't quite fit the classic heart failure picture. \n\nRenal failure is another angle. Her creatinine is really high, and that could be both a cause and effect of her current state. Maybe her kidneys are failing due to dehydration or something else. \n\nNow, let's not forget about the possibility of a stress ulcer. With all her vomiting, she could have developed an ulcer, but there's no blood in her vomit or stool, so maybe not. \n\nAnd what about pancreatitis? It could cause abdominal pain, but usually, there's more tenderness and maybe some liver enzyme abnormalities, which she doesn't have. \n\nOkay, let's put it all together. Based on her symptoms, history, and test results, gallstone ileus seems like the strongest possibility. It explains the obstruction and her gallstone history. \n\nBut acute mesenteric ischemia is still lurking in my mind. It's a serious condition that fits some of her symptoms, like the pain and low blood pressure. \n\nIn the end, I think gallstone ileus is the most likely culprit, but we can't rule out acute mesenteric ischemia without more investigation. It's a tricky situation, and we need to be thorough.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step presenting a unique potential diagnosis:\n\n1. **Gallstone Ileus** - This condition involves a gallstone causing an intestinal obstruction, which aligns with the patient's history of gallstones and symptoms of abdominal distension and vomiting.\n\n2. **Acute Mesenteric Ischemia** - This serious condition involves reduced blood flow to the intestines and could explain the abdominal pain and low blood pressure.\n\n3. **Small Bowel Obstruction (Non-Gallstone)** - This could be due to adhesions, tumors, or other causes, and presents similarly to gallstone ileus with abdominal distension and vomiting.\n\n4. **Congestive Heart Failure Exacerbation** - Although the symptoms don't perfectly align, her history of heart failure could contribute to gastrointestinal issues.\n\n5. **Acute Renal Failure** - The elevated creatinine level suggests kidney dysfunction, which could be related to dehydration or other factors.\n\n6. **Stress Ulcer** - Possible due to vomiting, but the absence of gastrointestinal bleeding makes this less likely.\n\n7. **Acute Pancreatitis** - Could cause abdominal pain, but typically presents with more specific symptoms and lab abnormalities.\n\n8. **Intestinal Pseudo-Obstruction** - A condition where there is impaired intestinal motility without a physical blockage, which could explain the distension and vomiting.\n\n9. **Peptic Ulcer Disease** - Could cause abdominal pain, but usually presents with more specific symptoms like bleeding.\n\n10. **Aortic Dissection** - A serious condition that can cause abdominal pain and low blood pressure, but usually presents with additional symptoms like radiating pain.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top two most likely diagnoses are **Gallstone Ileus** and **Acute Mesenteric Ischemia**, as they best explain the combination of symptoms, history, and test results.

Four years earlier, he started taking lenalidomide, 10 mg/d (28-day cycle), to treat worsening anemia; after 2 cycles of treatment, he became transfusion independent. Since then, he has remained stable with the same dose and schedule of lenalidomide without significant adverse effects. The presenting skin lesions developed 1 month before presentation and began as small pustules that rapidly transformed into painful ulcers. He was treated with valacyclovir for a presumed diagnosis of shingles, but the lesions did not improve. Because of suspected necrotizing fasciitis, he underwent incision and drainage of the lesions. Cultures from the surgical specimen grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus hemolyticus. However, the lesions continued to worsen despite vancomycin and additional debridement. Thus, he was transferred to our facility. Physical examination showed multiple cutaneous ulcers with gray undermined borders and red papules of varying depths involving the chest, back, and upper extremity; lesions were as large as 9 × 15 cm. A complete blood cell count showed a white blood cell count of 16.2 × 103/μL (to convert to 109/L, multiply by 1.0) with an absolute neutrophil count of 12.7 × 103/μL, hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0), and platelet count of 262 × 103/μL with no circulating blasts. Results of additional laboratory studies, including blood culture and tests for herpes zoster virus (via polymerase chain reaction), antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were all negative. Additionally, the patient also had hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for which he was taking lisinopril and simvastatin, respectively. Pathologic sampling from skin lesions demonstrated a dense dermal infiltrate with predominantly neutrophils along with reactive histiocytes, fibroblasts, and angioplasia (Figure, A). Immunohistochemical staining showed myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils (Figure, B), histiocytic markers (CD43, CD63, CD168), and CD117-positive mast cells, but no immature myeloid precursors. Results of Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver staining were unremarkable. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Pyoderma gangrenosum", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 75-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome, and he's been on lenalidomide for a while. He's developed these nasty skin ulcers that aren't healing. They started as pustules and turned into painful ulcers. That's a bit concerning.\n\nFirst, I'm thinking about infections. He was on valacyclovir, so maybe herpes zoster? But the lesions didn't improve, and PCR tests for herpes were negative. Hmm, that's not it.\n\nThen, there's the bacterial angle. The cultures showed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus hemolyticus. But despite antibiotics and debridement, the ulcers got worse. That's odd. Could it be something more than just a bacterial infection?\n\nLet's consider his MDS. He's stable on lenalidomide, but MDS can have complications. Could this be a skin manifestation of his underlying condition? Maybe something like Sweet's syndrome? That's characterized by neutrophilic infiltrates, and we do see those in his skin biopsy.\n\nOh, and the biopsy shows myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils. That's a big hint towards a neutrophilic process. Sweet's syndrome is definitely on the table.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. We should think about other possibilities. What about vasculitis? That can cause skin ulcers too. But the biopsy doesn't really show vasculitis, so maybe not.\n\nHow about pyoderma gangrenosum? It can look similar to what we're seeing. It's a neutrophilic dermatosis like Sweet's syndrome. Hmm, that's a possibility.\n\nLet's not forget about drug reactions. Lenalidomide is the main drug he's on. Could it be causing this? It's not common, but you never know. Let's keep it in mind.\n\nNow, what about other infections? We've ruled out herpes and bacteria, but what about fungi? The Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver stain was negative, so probably not a fungal infection.\n\nOkay, let's think about the bigger picture. He's got MDS, and these ulcers are pretty aggressive. Could they be a manifestation of his hematologic condition? Maybe an extramedullary hematopoiesis or something related to his MDS?\n\nAlright, let's rank our possibilities. Sweet's syndrome is high on the list because of the neutrophilic infiltrate. Pyoderma gangrenosum is up there too. Drug reaction is a consideration, but less likely. And we can't completely rule out an unusual infection or a complication from his MDS.\n\nSo, after thinking it through, Sweet's syndrome seems like the most likely diagnosis. But we should keep an open mind and consider other possibilities as we move forward.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnoses for the skin ulcers in this 75-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome can be considered as follows:\n\n1. **Sweet's Syndrome**: This is characterized by the sudden onset of fever, leukocytosis, and tender, erythematous skin lesions, which histologically show dense neutrophilic infiltrates without evidence of vasculitis. The presence of myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils in the biopsy is highly suggestive of this condition.\n\n2. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum**: This is a neutrophilic dermatosis that can present with painful skin ulcers, similar to what the patient is experiencing. It is often associated with underlying systemic conditions, including hematologic disorders.\n\n3. **Drug Reaction (Lenalidomide)**: Although less common, a drug reaction to lenalidomide could potentially cause skin manifestations. However, the timing and nature of the lesions make this less likely.\n\n4. **Vasculitis**: This condition can cause skin ulcers, but the biopsy does not show evidence of vasculitis, making this diagnosis less probable.\n\n5. **Unusual Infection**: Despite negative tests, an atypical infection could still be considered, especially given the patient's underlying condition and immunocompromised state.\n\n6. **Extramedullary Hematopoiesis**: This is a rare possibility where hematopoietic tissue forms outside the bone marrow, potentially leading to skin manifestations in the context of MDS.\n\n7. **Necrotizing Fasciitis**: Although considered, the lack of rapid progression and negative cultures for common necrotizing fasciitis pathogens make this less likely.\n\n8. **Fungal Infection**: The negative Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver stain makes a fungal infection unlikely, but it cannot be completely ruled out without further investigation.\n\n9. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**: This is a rare possibility where the skin manifestations could be related to the underlying MDS or another undiagnosed malignancy.\n\n10. **Autoimmune Disorder**: Conditions like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis could cause skin ulcers, but the negative autoimmune panels make this less likely.\n\nAfter considering all the information, Sweet's syndrome and pyoderma gangrenosum are the top differential diagnoses, given the neutrophilic infiltrate and the patient's underlying hematologic condition. It's important to continue monitoring and investigating to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Cutaneous Drug Reactions', 'Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology', 'Hematology', 'Oncology']"}

He had undergone multiple evaluations by dermatologists and urologists and had not responded to systemic antibiotics and topical corticosteroids. Physical examination revealed an erythematous, pinpoint orifice on his glans penis, with peripheral telangiectasias and a linear bluish structure on dermoscopy (Figure, A and B). Ultrasonography revealed a hypoechoic focal zone on the right side of the glans, with multiple hyperechoic bilaminar structures (Figure, C). A biopsy was performed (Figure, D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Pilonidal sinus", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a man in his 30s who's been dealing with painful sex and some kind of discharge for 14 years. That's a really long time to be dealing with this, so it's probably something chronic. Hmm, he's seen a bunch of specialists and tried antibiotics and corticosteroids without any luck. That's interesting because it suggests this might not be a simple infection or inflammation.\n\nNow, let's look at what the physical exam showed. There's this pinpoint, red spot on his glans penis, and it's got these little blood vessels around it. Plus, there's this bluish, linear thing on dermoscopy. That sounds kind of like a vascular lesion, maybe something like a hemangioma. But wait, there's also this linear structure, which is a bit unusual.\n\nThe ultrasound adds another piece to the puzzle. It shows a hypoechoic area, which could mean there's something solid or fluid-filled there. And those hyperechoic bilaminar structures? They might be blood vessels. This is starting to sound more and more like a vascular issue.\n\nOkay, so what could this be? Let's start with the obvious. A hemangioma is a possibility because it's a common vascular lesion. But, given how long this has been going on and the fact that it's been resistant to treatment, maybe it's something more complex, like a glomus tumor. Those can be tricky and often need surgical removal.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. We should consider other possibilities too. Zoon's balanitis is a chronic condition that can cause similar symptoms, and it's more common in uncircumcised men. It's not typically vascular, though, so maybe that's not it.\n\nWhat about psoriasis or another skin condition? They can cause red plaques and might not respond to regular treatments if they're not diagnosed correctly. But, the vascular features we're seeing don't quite fit.\n\nOh, and there's always the chance of something more sinister, like a malignant tumor. Squamous cell carcinoma could present with a chronic ulcer or lesion, but it would usually have more alarming features.\n\nLet's not forget about granulomas. They can cause chronic lesions and might not respond to antibiotics or steroids. But, they don't usually have this kind of vascular appearance.\n\nHmm, what about a angiokeratoma? That's a vascular lesion that could match what we're seeing. It's not as common, but it could fit the symptoms and the dermoscopy findings.\n\nNow, let's think about the biopsy. It should give us more information. If it shows a lot of blood vessels or a specific type of vascular structure, that would point us in the right direction.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the most likely diagnosis is a glomus tumor. It matches the chronic nature of the symptoms, the vascular features, and the fact that it hasn't responded to treatment. But, we should keep angiokeratoma and other vascular lesions in mind until we get the biopsy results.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the condition described:\n\n1. **Hemangioma** - A common vascular lesion that could explain the erythematous and vascular features observed.\n\n2. **Glomus Tumor** - A possibility given the chronic nature of symptoms and resistance to treatment, often requiring surgical intervention.\n\n3. **Zoon's Balanitis** - A chronic condition more common in uncircumcised men, but typically not vascular in nature.\n\n4. **Psoriasis** - Could cause red plaques, but the vascular features are not typical for this condition.\n\n5. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - A more sinister possibility, but usually presents with more alarming features.\n\n6. **Granuloma** - Can cause chronic lesions, but usually lacks the vascular appearance.\n\n7. **Angiokeratoma** - A vascular lesion that could match the symptoms and dermoscopy findings.\n\n8. **Bacillary Angiomatosis** - Associated with vascular lesions, but usually in immunocompromised individuals.\n\n9. **Kaposi's Sarcoma** - A vascular tumor that could fit the description, often related to immunosuppression.\n\n10. **Pyogenic Granuloma** - A benign vascular tumor that could explain the symptoms and appearance.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are **Glomus Tumor** and **Angiokeratoma**, given the chronicity, vascular features, and resistance to previous treatments.

Over the past 2 weeks, she had experienced drenching night sweats, cramps in her quadriceps, and weight loss of 3 kg. She denied respiratory symptoms, headaches, scalp tenderness, or jaw claudication. She took no regular medication and did not smoke. At presentation, her visual acuities were perception of light OD and 20/20 OS. There was a right relative afferent pupillary defect. Dilated fundus examination showed a cherry red spot in the right macula with hyperreflectivity and thickening of the inner retinal layers on optical coherence tomography (Figure 1A and B). External eye examination results and ocular motility were normal. Examination by an otolaryngologist revealed normal tympanic membranes and a dry but otherwise normal nasal mucosa on flexible endoscopy.

We've got a 62-year-old who's suddenly lost vision in one eye, and it's painless. That's a big red flag for something serious. The cherry red spot in the macula is a classic sign. Hmm, could this be central retinal artery occlusion? That's a strong possibility given the symptoms.\n\nBut wait, there's more. She's also got ear pain and sinus discomfort. That's interesting. And she's been having night sweats and weight loss. Those are systemic symptoms. Could this be something inflammatory? Maybe giant cell arteritis? It's known for causing vision loss and systemic symptoms.\n\nOh, and let's not forget the blood tests. There's leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and high CRP. Those are signs of inflammation. Giant cell arteritis could definitely cause these lab findings. But, she doesn't have jaw claudication or scalp tenderness, which are typical symptoms. Hmm, that's odd.\n\nNow, what about other possibilities? Could it be something like anterior ischemic optic neuropathy? That can cause sudden vision loss too. But, it's usually painful and doesn't quite fit with the cherry red spot.\n\nAnd the systemic symptoms, like night sweats and weight loss, they're kind of unusual for giant cell arteritis. Could this be a systemic illness like a lymphoma? That could explain the weight loss and night sweats.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about infections. Could this be something like endocarditis? That can cause embolic events leading to vision loss. But, there's no heart murmur or fever, so maybe not.\n\nAlso, what about autoimmune diseases like lupus? That can cause a wide range of symptoms, including vision loss. But, there's no other typical lupus symptoms here.\n\nOkay, let's think about the ear and sinus symptoms. Could this be something like Tolosa-Hunt syndrome? That involves painful ophthalmoplegia, but this case is painless, so probably not.\n\nAnd then there's the possibility of a paraneoplastic syndrome. That could explain the systemic symptoms and the vision loss. But, we'd need more evidence of a tumor.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Central retinal artery occlusion is still a strong contender. But, we can't ignore the systemic symptoms. Giant cell arteritis is still in the running, even without all the typical symptoms. And we should definitely consider lymphoma or another systemic illness given the weight loss and night sweats.\n\nIn the end, I think we have to prioritize central retinal artery occlusion for the vision loss, but also consider giant cell arteritis and lymphoma for the systemic symptoms. It's a complex case, and we might need more tests to figure it out completely.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)** - This is a strong contender given the sudden, painless vision loss and the presence of a cherry red spot on the macula.\n\n2. **Giant Cell Arteritis** - Although the patient lacks some typical symptoms like jaw claudication and scalp tenderness, the systemic inflammatory markers and age make this a plausible diagnosis.\n\n3. **Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (AION)** - This condition can cause sudden vision loss, but it's usually associated with pain, which is not present in this case.\n\n4. **Lymphoma** - The systemic symptoms, such as night sweats and weight loss, could suggest a systemic illness like lymphoma, which can also lead to vision changes.\n\n5. **Endocarditis** - Although there's no heart murmur or fever, embolic events from endocarditis could cause vision loss, so it remains a consideration.\n\n6. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** - This autoimmune disease can cause a wide range of symptoms, including vision loss, but other typical lupus symptoms are not present.\n\n7. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome** - This syndrome involves painful ophthalmoplegia, which doesn't match the painless presentation here, but the ear and sinus symptoms are noteworthy.\n\n8. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - This could explain the systemic symptoms and vision loss if a tumor is present, but more evidence would be needed.\n\n9. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)** - This condition can affect the eyes and sinuses, but typically includes respiratory symptoms, which are absent here.\n\n10. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome** - This could cause vision changes and systemic symptoms, but it's less likely given the specific findings.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top three differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)** - Given the classic presentation of sudden, painless vision loss and a cherry red spot.\n2. **Giant Cell Arteritis** - Despite atypical symptoms, the age, inflammatory markers, and systemic symptoms make this a strong consideration.\n3. **Lymphoma** - The systemic symptoms of night sweats and weight loss, along with potential vision involvement, keep lymphoma as a plausible diagnosis.\n\nFurther testing, including a temporal artery biopsy and imaging, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.", "topic": "['Otolaryngology', 'Rheumatology', 'Otology', 'Ophthalmology']"}

Clinical findings suggested unilateral right middle ear effusion associated with ipsilateral conductive hearing loss. After an initial observation period, a right tympanostomy tube was inserted. During the procedure, a clear liquid pulsating from the middle ear was noted, and samples were sent for β-2-transferrine analysis. This confirmed the presence of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. The patient was referred to our tertiary referral center hospital. The leak settled with conservative management, and imaging of the brain and skull base was performed. A high-resolution computed tomography scan of the temporal bone showed a lytic aspect of the right temporal bone extending to the petrous apex and the petrous bone, sparing the otic capsule (Figure 1A). There was soft tissue opacification of the right mastoid air cells. Magnetic resonance imaging of the skull base with contrast was performed (Figure 1B). It showed a hyperintense T2 signal in the petrous apex and mastoid air cells. There was a suspected communication into the soft tissues of the right neck in the posterior triangle. Magnetic resonance imaging also showed signs of Chiari malformation type 1. After a skull base multidisciplinary discussion, the patient underwent a bone biopsy through a transmastoid approach. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Gorham-Stout disease", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 25-month-old child with unilateral hearing loss. That's already a bit concerning. The hearing loss is conductive, and there's middle ear effusion on the same side. Hmm, that's interesting. They put in a tympanostomy tube, and during the procedure, they found clear liquid pulsating from the middle ear. That's not something you see every day. They did a β-2-transferrine test, and it came back positive for a CSF leak. Okay, so we've got a CSF leak here. That's a big clue.\n\nNow, let's look at the imaging. The CT scan shows a lytic lesion in the right temporal bone. It's extending to the petrous apex and the petrous bone but sparing the otic capsule. That's pretty specific. And there's soft tissue opacification in the mastoid air cells. The MRI adds more to the picture. There's a hyperintense T2 signal in the petrous apex and mastoid air cells. Plus, there's a suspected communication into the soft tissues of the right neck in the posterior triangle. That's a lot to take in.\n\nOh, and there's also a Chiari malformation type 1 on the MRI. That's another piece of the puzzle. So, what could all of this mean? Let's start with some possibilities. A congenital cholesteatoma could be an option. It's not uncommon in kids and could explain the conductive hearing loss. But would it cause a CSF leak? That's less typical.\n\nHow about a dermoid cyst? Those can be congenital and might cause some of these symptoms. But they don't usually cause CSF leaks either. Let's keep looking.\n\nAn epidermoid cyst is another thought. They can be found in the temporal bone and might cause these kinds of issues. But again, a CSF leak is not the usual story here.\n\nA temporal bone meningioma could be considered, but in a child this age? That's pretty rare. And would it cause a CSF leak? Not usually.\n\nLangerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is another possibility. It can cause lytic bone lesions and might explain the CSF leak. It's rare, but it fits some of the findings.\n\nA metastatic tumor is unlikely in a child this young, especially with these specific findings. Let's put that aside for now.\n\nHow about a cephalocele? That could definitely cause a CSF leak and might explain the imaging findings. It's a strong contender.\n\nFibrous dysplasia could cause bone changes, but it doesn't usually cause CSF leaks. So, that's probably not it.\n\nAn arachnoid cyst could be a possibility. It might cause some of these symptoms, but would it cause a CSF leak in this way? Maybe.\n\nFinally, let's consider a persistent stapedial artery. That's a congenital anomaly that could cause some of these issues, but it's not typically associated with CSF leaks.\n\nAfter thinking through all of this, I'm leaning towards a cephalocele. It explains the CSF leak and the imaging findings. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is also a possibility, given the lytic lesion and potential for a CSF leak. The others just don't fit as well with all the evidence we have.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnoses for the 25-month-old child with unilateral hearing loss and the described clinical and imaging findings are as follows:\n\n1. **Cephalocele** - This condition could explain the CSF leak and the imaging findings, including the lytic lesion in the temporal bone and the communication with the neck.\n\n2. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH)** - This could account for the lytic bone lesion and the potential for a CSF leak, although it's a rare condition.\n\n3. **Congenital Cholesteatoma** - While it's a common cause of conductive hearing loss in children, it typically doesn't cause CSF leaks.\n\n4. **Dermoid Cyst** - These are congenital and can cause some symptoms, but they are not usually associated with CSF leaks.\n\n5. **Epidermoid Cyst** - Similar to dermoid cysts, these can occur in the temporal bone but don't usually cause CSF leaks.\n\n6. **Temporal Bone Meningioma** - This is rare in young children and not typically associated with CSF leaks in this context.\n\n7. **Arachnoid Cyst** - Could potentially cause some symptoms, but it's less likely to cause a CSF leak in this manner.\n\n8. **Fibrous Dysplasia** - This can cause bone changes but is not typically associated with CSF leaks.\n\n9. **Persistent Stapedial Artery** - A congenital anomaly that could cause some issues, but it's not typically associated with CSF leaks.\n\n10. **Metastatic Tumor** - Unlikely in a child this young with these specific findings.\n\nAfter considering all the information, a cephalocele and Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis are the most likely diagnoses, as they best explain the combination of symptoms and imaging findings, including the CSF leak.", "topic": "['Otolaryngology', 'Pediatrics', 'Otology', 'Audiology and Hearing']"}

We've got a man in his 60s with a gray-white plaque on his soft palate. That's interesting. It showed up about a week ago and didn't budge even after some antibiotics. Hmm, that's a clue right there. Cefuroxime didn't work, so maybe it's not a straightforward bacterial infection.\n\nNow, let's see. He doesn't have any significant medical history, which is good. But he does mention having sex with one male partner in the last six months. That could be relevant. \n\nLooking at the physical exam, there are these irregular gray-white ulcers with some redness around them. They're on the soft palate, uvula, and tonsils. And he's got some swollen lymph nodes under his jaw, but they're not sore. That's a bit unusual.\n\nOkay, so what could this be? My first thought is oral candidiasis. It's pretty common and can cause white lesions in the mouth. But usually, it's not this persistent with antibiotics, and the ulcers are a bit odd for candidiasis.\n\nNext, I'm thinking about herpes simplex virus. It can cause ulcers, but they're usually more painful and not gray-white. Plus, they don't typically stick around this long without treatment.\n\nWhat about syphilis? It can cause oral lesions, but they're usually more like sores or patches, not these irregular ulcers. And the color doesn't quite fit either.\n\nCMV comes to mind too.

It can cause white lesions, but they're usually lacy and not ulcerated. Plus, they don't just show up out of the blue like this.\n\nAphthous ulcers are another thought, but they're usually painful and not gray-white. They also tend to heal faster than this.\n\nCould it be squamous cell carcinoma? It can cause persistent lesions, but they're usually more solid and don't have this gray-white appearance.\n\nMaybe it's something like a traumatic ulcer, but there's no history of trauma, and the appearance doesn't quite fit.\n\nLastly, there's the possibility of a drug reaction, but he's not taking any medications, so that seems unlikely.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think oral candidiasis is still a strong contender, even though it's not a perfect fit. The persistence and appearance are a bit off, but it's the closest match. Herpes simplex virus and CMV are also possibilities, but they have their own issues with the symptoms. Syphilis and HIV-related conditions don't quite match the lesion characteristics. Lichen planus and aphthous ulcers don't fit well either. Squamous cell carcinoma seems unlikely without more typical features. Trauma and drug reactions don't have supporting evidence. So, I'll stick with oral candidiasis as the most likely diagnosis.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the gray-white plaque on the soft palate:\n\n1. **Oral Candidiasis** - This is a common condition that can cause white lesions in the mouth, although the persistence and ulceration are atypical.\n\n2. **Herpes Simplex Virus** - Typically causes painful ulcers, but the appearance and duration in this case are not classic for HSV.\n\n3. **Syphilis** - Can cause oral lesions, but they are usually more like sores or patches and not gray-white ulcers.\n\n4. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV)** - Can cause ulcers, but they are often more extensive and accompanied by other symptoms.\n\n5. **HIV-related Oral Hairy Leukoplakia** - Causes white patches that don't scrape off, but they are usually on the sides of the tongue and not ulcerated.\n\n6. **Lichen Planus** - Can cause white lesions, but they are usually lacy and not ulcerated, and don't typically appear suddenly.\n\n7. **Aphthous Ulcers** - Usually painful and not gray-white, with a tendency to heal faster than the described lesion.\n\n8. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - Can cause persistent lesions, but they are usually more solid and don't have a gray-white appearance.\n\n9. **Traumatic Ulcer** - Unlikely without a history of trauma, and the appearance doesn't fit well.\n\n10. **Drug Reaction** - Unlikely as the patient is not taking any medications.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Oral Candidiasis** remains the most likely diagnosis, despite some atypical features. However, given the persistence and unusual characteristics, further investigation, such as a biopsy or culture, may be warranted to rule out other conditions.", "topic": "['Otolaryngology', 'Sexually Transmitted Infections', 'Dental Medicine', 'Dermatology', 'Infectious Diseases']"}

Her symptoms were initially most prominent while playing sports and were suspected to be due to asthma or seasonal allergies. However, medical management with albuterol, intranasal fluticasone, and cetirizine failed to provide relief. More recently, the patient’s parents noted that she developed stridor while sleeping and while at rest, prompting the family to present for medical attention. Previous workup, including pulmonary function testing, was concerning for an upper airway obstructive process, for which she was referred to otolaryngology. In-office flexible videostroboscopy revealed a mass in the distal cervical trachea that appeared nearly obstructive. Chest radiography confirmed the presence of an approximately 1.5-cm, well-circumscribed soft tissue mass within the cervical trachea. Direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy were performed in the operating room under general anesthesia. This demonstrated an exophytic, pedunculated mass that emanated from the anterior wall of the cervical trachea (Figure 1A and B). The patient was intubated via Seldinger technique to bypass the mass, with a 4.0-mm cuffed endotracheal tube loaded over a 0-degree Hopkins endoscope (Figure 1C). With the airway secured, attention was turned to excision of the mass. Lidocaine, 1%, with epinephrine 1:100 000 was injected in a submucosal plane, and laryngeal scissors were used to excise the attachment of the mass from the tracheal wall. The mass was then resected en bloc and removed with laryngeal cupped forceps. The attachment site was then ablated with the Coblator (Figure 1D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Schwannoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 12-year-old girl who's been dealing with stridor for a few months. At first, it was mostly when she was playing sports, so it seemed like it could be asthma or allergies. But, she didn't get better with the usual treatments like albuterol or antihistamines. That's a bit odd, isn't it? So, it's not behaving like typical asthma or allergies.\n\nNow, her parents are saying she's getting stridor even when she's sleeping or just resting. That's definitely not normal and suggests something more than just reactive airway issues. So, what's going on in the upper airway?\n\nThe pulmonary function tests pointed to an upper airway problem. That's a big clue. And then, there's this mass in her trachea that they found with videostroboscopy. It's nearly obstructive, which is pretty serious.\n\nOkay, so we've got a mass in the trachea. What could that be? In kids, you think about things like papillomas, hemangiomas, or maybe even a polyp. But, let's not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nThe mass is exophytic and pedunculated, coming from the anterior tracheal wall. That sounds like it could be a papilloma. They're known to be exophytic and can cause obstruction. But, we should keep an open mind.\n\nLet's consider other possibilities. Could it be a hemangioma? They're usually more of a vascular issue and might not present exactly like this. What about a polyp? Polyps are typically solitary and not as aggressive-looking as this mass.\n\nOh, and there's the surgical approach. They used a Seldinger technique to intubate her, which suggests they needed to bypass the mass. That's pretty standard for significant airway obstructions.\n\nThe mass was excised, and they used a Coblator for the attachment site. That's interesting because it suggests they wanted to make sure they removed all of it thoroughly.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the most likely diagnosis is a papilloma. It fits the description and the location. But, we should confirm with histology to be sure.\n\nWait, let's not forget about other possibilities. Could it be a granuloma or an osteochondroma? Those are less common, but they could present similarly.\n\nIn the end, after considering everything, I think it's most likely a papilloma. But, we should keep an open mind until we have the final pathology report.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the mass in the trachea of the 12-year-old girl is a papilloma. Papillomas are known to be exophytic and can cause airway obstruction, which aligns with the clinical presentation and surgical findings. However, it's important to confirm this with histological examination to rule out other possibilities such as a hemangioma, polyp, or less common entities like a granuloma or osteochondroma. Here is a 10-step differential diagnosis list, considering the details provided:\n\n1. Papilloma\n2. Hemangioma\n3. Polyp\n4. Granuloma\n5. Osteochondroma\n6. Laryngeal cyst\n7. Tracheal tumor (benign)\n8. Amyloidosis\n9. Tracheal diverticulum\n10. Neurofibroma\n\nEach of these conditions could potentially present with a mass in the airway, but the description of the mass as exophytic and pedunculated, along with its location and the age of the patient, makes papilloma the most likely diagnosis. Final confirmation would depend on the histopathological analysis of the excised mass.", "topic": "['Otolaryngology', 'Pediatrics', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Pulmonary Medicine']"}

Her ethanol level was 202 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.2171); magnesium, 1.7 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.4114); potassium, 4.4 mEq/L (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1); and ionized calcium, 4.6 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.25). The patient developed cardiac arrest due to ventricular arrhythmias in the emergency department and was successfully resuscitated. Echocardiography demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% and no regional wall motion abnormalities. She subsequently underwent embolization of the middle meningeal artery. After embolization, however, a worsening rightward midline shift was discovered. As a result, on the 11th day of her hospitalization, she had a burr hole evacuation. During day 15 of admission, the patient had 3 episodes of torsade de pointes (TdP) while receiving 50 mg of metoprolol succinate daily, and her 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is shown in Figure 1. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "T-wave alternans", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. A woman in her mid-40s comes in after a fall with head trauma. She's got a subdural hematoma and a pretty high ethanol level. Hmm, that's a lot of alcohol in her system. Could this be related to her fall or something else? Maybe she has a drinking problem or was just out having a good time when she fell. Anyway, her magnesium level is low too. That's interesting because low magnesium can cause all sorts of issues, like heart problems. Could this be why she had a cardiac arrest? \n\nOh, and her ionized calcium is on the lower side as well. Low calcium can also mess with the heart. Maybe that's contributing to her heart issues too. But wait, her potassium level seems normal, so that's one less thing to worry about. \n\nNow, about her heart. She had ventricular arrhythmias and was resuscitated. That's serious. Could this be due to the low magnesium and calcium? Or is there something else going on with her heart? Her ejection fraction is normal, and there are no wall motion abnormalities, so it doesn't seem like a typical heart attack. \n\nShe had some episodes of torsade de pointes, which is a type of arrhythmia. This can definitely be linked to low magnesium. So, hypomagnesemia might be a big part of the problem here. \n\nBut let's not forget about the ethanol. High levels like this can cause all sorts of problems, including affecting the heart and causing electrolyte imbalances. Could alcohol be the root cause of her low magnesium and calcium? \n\nOh, and there's the head trauma. The subdural hematoma and midline shift are serious. Could the trauma itself be causing some of these issues, like increased pressure in the brain affecting her heart? \n\nWait, what about other possibilities? Could there be a hormonal issue, like hypoparathyroidism, causing the low calcium? Or maybe she's not getting enough nutrients, like vitamin D, which could affect calcium levels. \n\nAnd we shouldn't ignore the possibility of medications. She's on metoprolol, a beta-blocker. Could this be contributing to her arrhythmias? \n\nSo, putting it all together, it seems like hypomagnesemia is a key player here, likely exacerbated by alcohol use. But we can't ignore the potential impact of her head trauma and the role of metoprolol. \n\nIn the end, it's a complex mix of factors, but hypomagnesemia, alcohol use, and the effects of metoprolol seem to be the main culprits.\n\n## Final Response\n\nHere is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, considering all the provided information:\n\n1. **Hypomagnesemia** - This is a key factor given the patient's low magnesium levels, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias like torsades de pointes.\n\n2. **Alcohol Use Disorder** - The high ethanol level suggests chronic alcohol use, which can contribute to electrolyte imbalances, including hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia.\n\n3. **Hypocalcemia** - Low ionized calcium can also contribute to cardiac issues and muscle cramps, and may be related to the patient's nutritional status or a hormonal imbalance.\n\n4. **Traumatic Brain Injury** - The subdural hematoma and midline shift indicate significant head trauma, which can have systemic effects, including on the heart.\n\n5. **Electrolyte Imbalance** - The combination of low magnesium and calcium, potentially exacerbated by alcohol, can lead to serious cardiac and neurological symptoms.\n\n6. **Metoprolol-Induced Arrhythmia** - Although the patient is on a relatively low dose, metoprolol can contribute to arrhythmias, especially in the context of electrolyte imbalances.\n\n7. **Hypoparathyroidism** - This hormonal disorder can cause low calcium levels and may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.\n\n8. **Vitamin D Deficiency** - Inadequate vitamin D can lead to low calcium levels, potentially exacerbating the patient's condition.\n\n9. **Malnutrition** - Chronic alcohol use can lead to poor nutritional status, contributing to deficiencies in magnesium, calcium, and vitamin D.\n\n10. **Channelopathy** - A genetic predisposition to cardiac ion channel dysfunction could make the patient more susceptible to arrhythmias, especially when electrolytes are imbalanced.\n\nReranking these based on the patient's presentation and test results, the top three diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Hypomagnesemia** - Due to its direct link with torsades de pointes and the patient's low magnesium levels.\n\n2. **Alcohol Use Disorder** - Given the high ethanol level and its contribution to electrolyte imbalances.\n\n3. **Traumatic Brain Injury** - Considering the significant head trauma and its potential systemic effects.\n\nThese three conditions are closely interconnected and likely have a compounding effect on the patient's overall clinical picture.

On systemic examination, hepatomegaly (2 cm below the right costal margin) was seen. There was also bilateral enlargement of the parotid area, which was tender on palpation. Cutaneous examination revealed yellowish greasy scales on the scalp, suggestive of seborrheic dermatitis. Erythematous edematous papules were present over the retroauricular areas and the inframammary folds (Figure, A).

We've got a woman in her late 40s with these stubborn ulcers in her groin and armpits. They've been around for three years, and that's a long time for something like this not to heal. They started as itchy, weepy bumps and turned into painful ulcers with pus. That's pretty concerning.\n\nFirst, I'm thinking about infections. Chronic ulcers with pus? That sounds like it could be something like cutaneous tuberculosis. It's known for causing persistent skin issues and can definitely affect the groin and axillae.\n\nBut wait, there's more to consider. She's also dealing with scalp problems, like scaling and greasiness. That sounds a lot like seborrheic dermatitis, which is pretty common. But could it be related to the ulcers? Maybe, maybe not.\n\nNow, let's not forget the lymph nodes. She's got multiple mobile, firm, and non-tender lymph nodes. That's interesting. Lymphadenopathy can be a sign of a systemic issue, like an infection or even a hematological disorder. Hmm, what about lymphoma? That could explain the lymph nodes and maybe even the skin issues.\n\nOh, and there's hepatomegaly. Her liver is slightly enlarged. That's another piece of the puzzle. Hepatomegaly can be seen in infections, like tuberculosis, or in hematological disorders. This is getting more complex.\n\nAlso, she's experiencing polyuria and polydipsia. That's unusual. Could it be related to a systemic condition? Maybe something like diabetes insipidus? That would fit with the other symptoms, especially if there's a systemic issue at play.\n\nNow, let's talk about the parotid glands. They're tender and enlarged. That's not something you see every day. Could it be part of a syndrome, like Sjögren's syndrome? That could explain some of the other symptoms too.\n\nOkay, let's think about the histopathology. The biopsy from the ulcer might show something important. If there are granulomas, that could point towards tuberculosis or sarcoidosis. But if there's something else, like atypical lymphocytes, that might suggest lymphoma.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I'm thinking about conditions that tie everything together. Lymphoma could explain the lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and skin issues. But then again, tuberculosis could also fit, especially with the chronic ulcers and systemic symptoms.\n\nWait, let's not forget about autoimmune disorders. Something like lupus could cause a wide range of symptoms, including skin issues, lymphadenopathy, and hepatomegaly. That's definitely something to consider.\n\nIn the end, I'm leaning towards lymphoma as the most likely diagnosis. It seems to tie together the lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and skin issues in a coherent way. But I'm keeping lupus and tuberculosis on the radar as well, just in case.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Cutaneous Tuberculosis** - The chronic, nonhealing ulcers with pus discharge and systemic symptoms like lymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly align with this diagnosis.\n\n2. **Lymphoma** - The presence of lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and skin lesions could suggest a hematological malignancy like lymphoma.\n\n3. **Chronic Lupus Vulgaris** - This condition can cause persistent skin ulcers and is associated with systemic manifestations such as lymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly.\n\n4. **Sjögren's Syndrome** - The tender, enlarged parotid glands and chronic skin issues might point towards this autoimmune disorder.\n\n5. **Granuloma Inguinale** - This sexually transmitted infection can cause chronic ulcers in the groin area, although it typically doesn't involve systemic symptoms.\n\n6. **Hidradenitis Suppurativa** - The recurrent, painful ulcers in apocrine-gland-bearing areas like the axillae and groin are characteristic of this condition.\n\n7. **Sarcoidosis** - This condition can cause skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, and hepatomegaly, although the ulcerative nature of the lesions is atypical.\n\n8. **Disseminated Bacterial or Fungal Infections** - Immunocompromised states can lead to widespread infections that cause skin ulcers and systemic symptoms.\n\n9. **Behçet's Disease** - This condition is characterized by recurrent ulcers and can involve systemic manifestations, although the specific distribution and nature of the ulcers differ.\n\n10. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum** - This skin condition causes chronic, painful ulcers and can be associated with systemic diseases, but typically lacks the lymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly seen here.\n\nAfter considering all the patient's symptoms and potential diagnoses, **Lymphoma** emerges as the most likely diagnosis, as it accounts for the lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and skin manifestations in a cohesive manner. However, **Chronic Lupus Vulgaris** and **Cutaneous Tuberculosis** remain strong contenders due to the chronic nature of the ulcers and systemic involvement.

Initially she was started on antibiotic therapy. Right nasal biopsy, right endoscopic sinus surgery, and right anterior superior orbital tissue biopsy were performed. Intraoperatively, the sinus mucosa demonstrated only edema and mild secretions, but there was no necrosis or purulence. Both orbital and nasal cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Orbital biopsy showed nodular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates without evidence of fungal infection or necrosis (Figure 1C). Further workup revealed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, total IgG, and IgG4 levels and normal white blood cell count, thyroid-stimulating hormone, angiotensin-converting enzyme, lysozyme, antinuclear antibody, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) levels. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "IgG4-related disease", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 48-year-old woman who's been dealing with some pretty uncomfortable symptoms. She's got right orbital swelling, eye pain, and blurry vision that's been getting worse over the past three days. And for the past three months, she's been sensitive to light in both eyes. That's quite a bit to unpack.\n\nShe's also experiencing some nasal issues like congestion and rhinorrhea, plus headaches on the right side of her head, both in the frontal and temporal areas. Now, looking at her medical history, she's got hypertension, poorly controlled diabetes, high cholesterol, she smokes, and she has asthma. Oh, and her brother and father had chronic orbital swelling, which is interesting.\n\nHer vital signs are normal, but when we check her right eye, there's moderate chemosis, injected conjunctiva, and some periorbital edema. Both of her eyes are proptotic, but the right one is worse. Her eye movements and pupillary reflexes are normal, which is good, and she can see pretty well.\n\nThe CT scan shows opacification in both ethmoid and frontal sinuses, and there's stranding in the right orbital fat. The MRI shows enlargement and enhancement of the extraocular muscles, especially the right superior rectus. Hmm, that's pointing towards something inflammatory or possibly infectious.\n\nInitially, they started her on antibiotics, which makes sense given the symptoms and imaging. They did a biopsy of her right nasal area, performed endoscopic sinus surgery, and took a biopsy from the right orbit. Interestingly, there was no necrosis or pus in the sinus mucosa, just some edema and mild secretions. And both the orbital and nasal cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. That's a tough bug.\n\nThe orbital biopsy showed nodular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, but no fungi or necrosis. That's a relief because it rules out some nasty infections. Her blood work shows elevated ESR, CRP, total IgG, and IgG4, but everything else like WBC, TSH, ACE, lysozyme, ANA, and ANCA is normal. That's a lot of inflammation markers.\n\nSo, what could this be? Let's start with the obvious. Orbital cellulitis is a strong contender given the swelling, pain, and proptosis. But wait, the biopsy didn't show any necrosis or pus, which is odd for a typical bacterial infection.\n\nHow about a fungal infection? Well, the biopsy ruled that out, so we can cross that off the list. What about thyroid eye disease? It's possible with the proptosis and muscle involvement, but there's no Graves' disease history, and her TSH is normal.\n\nIgG4-related disease is on the table too, with those elevated IgG4 levels and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates. It fits the bill, but let's not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis could be another option. It can cause sinus and orbital issues, but her ANCA is negative, which makes it less likely.\n\nSarcoidosis is another possibility. It can affect the sinuses and orbits, but her ACE levels are normal, and there's no systemic involvement mentioned.\n\nLupus? It can cause orbital inflammation, but her ANA is negative, so that's probably not it.\n\nChurg-Strauss syndrome? It's unlikely without asthma flares or eosinophilia. Her asthma seems stable, and there's no mention of eosinophilia.\n\nWegener's granulomatosis? It's similar to GPA, and with a negative ANCA, it's not looking likely.\n\nFinally, let's consider idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome. It's a bit of a catch-all, but it could fit if nothing else explains the symptoms.\n\nSo, after going through everything, IgG4-related disease seems like the most likely culprit. The elevated IgG4, lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, and orbital involvement all point in that direction. It's not perfect, but it's the best fit for now.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnoses for the patient's condition can be ranked as follows:\n\n1. **IgG4-related disease**: This is the most likely diagnosis given the elevated IgG4 levels, lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, and bilateral orbital involvement.\n\n2. **Orbital cellulitis**: Although the lack of necrosis or pus in the biopsy is atypical, the presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and the patient's symptoms cannot entirely rule out a chronic or atypical form of cellulitis.\n\n3. **Thyroid eye disease**: Despite normal TSH levels, the proptosis and extraocular muscle involvement make this a consideration, though it is less likely without a history of Graves' disease.\n\n4. **Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA)**: Although the negative ANCA makes this less likely, the sinus and orbital involvement keep it on the list.\n\n5. **Sarcoidosis**: Normal ACE levels and lack of systemic involvement reduce the likelihood, but sinus and orbital involvement are possible in sarcoidosis.\n\n6. **Idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome**: This remains a possibility if other diagnoses are ruled out, as it can present with similar symptoms.\n\n7. **Lupus**: The negative ANA test makes this less likely, but orbital inflammation can occur in lupus.\n\n8. **Churg-Strauss syndrome**: Unlikely without asthma flares or eosinophilia.\n\n9. **Wegener's granulomatosis**: Similar to GPA, the negative ANCA reduces the likelihood.\n\n10. **Fungal infection**: Ruled out by biopsy showing no fungal elements.\n\nThese rankings are based on the combination of clinical presentation, imaging, biopsy results, and laboratory findings.

Seven years before this visit, he underwent a reduced-intensity, matched, unrelated donor, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). His post-transplant course was complicated by severe chronic graft vs host disease of the skin, eyes, and gut, for which he received systemic corticosteroid therapy, tacrolimus, methotrexate, and long-term extracorporeal photopheresis. Three years after the HSCT, he developed chronic ulcerations on the hips, back, and arms at the site of previously irradiated tumors, as well as multiple friable, hemorrhagic, and bleeding nodules on bilateral hips and his forearms while receiving treatment with corticosteroids and extracorporeal photopheresis. He underwent several debulking procedures and excision biopsies of the nodules, which revealed granulation tissue on histology.

We've got a man in his 50s with bleeding wounds and nodules on his hips and forearms. He's been through a lot, having had mycosis fungoides, which is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. He's had quite a bit of treatment, including radiation therapy and a stem cell transplant, plus medications for graft vs host disease. Now, he's dealing with these chronic ulcerations and bleeding nodules. That's a lot to take in.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possibility of a fungal infection. He's been on immunosuppressive therapy, which makes him more vulnerable to infections. Fungal infections like aspergillosis could definitely be a concern, especially since they can cause bleeding nodules.

It's possible, given his history.\n\nOh, and there's also the graft vs host disease. He's had severe chronic GVHD, which can cause skin changes and potentially lead to these kinds of nodules. That's another angle to think about.\n\nWhat about bacterial infections? He's been on a lot of antibiotics, but maybe something like a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection could be causing these skin issues. It's worth considering, especially with his compromised immune system.\n\nThen there's the idea of a drug reaction. He's on quite a few medications, and sometimes drugs can cause skin reactions or exacerbate existing conditions. Could that be what's happening here?\n\nI should also think about Kaposi's sarcoma. It's a type of cancer that can cause skin lesions, and it's more common in people with a weakened immune system, like him. That's another possibility.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about the possibility of a pyoderma gangrenosum. This is a skin condition that can cause ulcers and nodules, especially in someone who's had a lot of trauma or surgery, like this patient.\n\nNow, considering all of this, I think the most likely explanation is chronic ulcerations and bleeding due to radiation-induced vascular damage. The radiation therapy he had could have damaged the blood vessels in those areas, leading to these chronic issues.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider the possibility of a Marjolin's ulcer. These are chronic wounds that can turn into squamous cell carcinoma, especially in areas that have been traumatized or exposed to radiation. That's a serious possibility given his history.\n\nSo, after thinking it all through, I'm leaning towards Marjolin's ulcer as the most likely diagnosis. It fits with his history of radiation and chronic wounds. Yeah, that seems to make the most sense.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, considering his complex medical history and treatment:\n\n1. **Fungal Infection (e.g., Aspergillosis)**: Given the patient's immunosuppressed state, fungal infections are a significant concern and could cause bleeding nodules.\n\n2. **Radiation-Induced Vascular Damage**: The extensive radiation therapy could have damaged blood vessels, leading to chronic ulcerations and bleeding.\n\n3. **Persistent/Recurrent Mycosis Fungoides**: Despite the PET scan results, the nodules could be a manifestation of his underlying lymphoma.\n\n4. **Chronic Graft vs Host Disease**: Severe chronic GVHD could contribute to skin changes and the development of nodules.\n\n5. **Bacterial Infection (e.g., MRSA)**: The patient's compromised immune system makes him susceptible to bacterial infections that could cause skin issues.\n\n6. **Drug Reaction**: His multiple medications could potentially cause skin reactions or exacerbate existing conditions.\n\n7. **Kaposi's Sarcoma**: This is a possibility given his immunocompromised state and the nature of the lesions.\n\n8. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum**: A skin condition that can cause ulcers and nodules, especially in someone with a history of trauma or surgery.\n\n9. **Marjolin's Ulcer**: Chronic wounds in irradiated areas could develop into squamous cell carcinoma, a serious possibility given his history.\n\n10. **Lymphomatoid Papulosis**: A condition related to his lymphoma history, which could present with similar skin manifestations.\n\nAfter considering all the information, Marjolin's ulcer emerges as a strong possibility due to the patient's history of radiation and chronic wounds. This diagnosis aligns with the development of squamous cell carcinoma in previously traumatized or irradiated skin areas. However, it's important to continue monitoring and investigating, as his complex medical history suggests multiple potential causes.", "topic": "['Lymphomas', 'Skin Lymphomas', 'Dermatology', 'Hematology', 'Oncology']"}

Let’s think step by step.\n### INPUT:\nA man in his mid-50s with a medical history of nonspecific T-wave abnormalities on electrocardiogram (ECG) reported new-onset chest discomfort, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath that woke him from sleep. Emergency medical services found him to be in a wide complex tachycardia. He was administered a 150-mg bolus of intravenous amiodarone, which failed to terminate his arrhythmia. He ultimately required synchronized cardioversion with a biphasic direct current shock of 100 J. On arrival to the emergency department, his vital signs were stable. Serum electrolyte levels were within normal range and C-reactive protein was less than 6 mg/dL (to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10). High-sensitivity troponin peaked at 1078 pg/mL. His initial 12-lead ECG is shown in Figure 1A. He continued in sinus rhythm with episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia observed on telemetry, as shown in Figure 1B. Cardiac catheterization revealed patent coronary arteries. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was remarkable for a dilated right ventricle with moderately reduced systolic function and transmural late gadolinium enhancement with akinesis and dyskinesis involving the right ventricular (RV) free wall and outflow tract extending to the left ventricular (LV) anterior, septal, and apical segments. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cardiac sarcoidosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a man in his mid-50s who's having some serious chest discomfort, sweating, and shortness of breath. That's pretty concerning, especially since it woke him up from sleep. And when the emergency services checked him out, he was in a wide complex tachycardia. That's a big red flag for something like ventricular tachycardia.\n\nSo, they tried giving him amiodarone, but it didn't work. That's interesting because amiodarone is usually pretty effective. They had to shock him back to normal rhythm. Once he's in the ER, his vital signs are stable, which is a relief. But his troponin levels are really high, which suggests some heart muscle damage.\n\nNow, let's think about what's going on here. The cardiac catheterization shows that his coronary arteries are clear. That's a surprise because it rules out a typical heart attack from a blocked artery. So, we're looking at something else causing the damage and arrhythmia.\n\nThe cardiac MRI is really telling. It shows a dilated right ventricle and some pretty significant damage to the right ventricular free wall and outflow tract. Plus, there's damage extending into the left ventricle. This transmural late gadolinium enhancement is a big clue. It suggests something like myocarditis or an infiltrative disease.\n\nOkay, let's consider arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). It fits because ARVC often causes right ventricular problems and can lead to ventricular tachycardia. The MRI findings with the right ventricular involvement are really pointing in this direction.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. We should think about other possibilities too. Could it be dilated cardiomyopathy? That can cause ventricular arrhythmias and has some similar MRI findings. But the specific right ventricular involvement is more classic for ARVC.\n\nWhat about myocarditis? It can cause chest pain, arrhythmias, and elevated troponin. But usually, the MRI findings would be more diffuse, not just limited to the right ventricle.\n\nLet's not forget about sarcoidosis. It can cause heart problems and arrhythmias, but we'd expect more systemic symptoms or other organ involvement. The lack of extra-cardiac symptoms makes this less likely.\n\nAnd then there's the possibility of a viral infection triggering these symptoms. Viral myocarditis could cause similar findings, but again, the specific right ventricular damage is more suggestive of ARVC.\n\nChagas disease could be another option, especially if there's a history of travel or exposure. It can cause right ventricular damage and arrhythmias. But without any mention of relevant history, it's a bit of a stretch.\n\nOh, and let's consider left ventricular non-compaction. It can cause ventricular arrhythmias and some similar MRI findings. But the primary issue here seems to be with the right ventricle, which isn't as typical for non-compaction.\n\nNow, what about Brugada syndrome? It can cause ventricular arrhythmias and has some characteristic ECG findings. But we don't have any information about specific ECG patterns that would suggest Brugada.\n\nFinally, let's think about catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). It's a bit of a long shot because it's usually related to exercise-induced arrhythmias, not something that wakes you up from sleep. But it can cause bidirectional ventricular tachycardia, which is interesting.\n\nSo, after going through all of this, ARVC seems like the most likely diagnosis. The right ventricular involvement and MRI findings are really pointing in that direction. But we shouldn't completely rule out other possibilities like dilated cardiomyopathy or myocarditis. They could explain some of the findings, but ARVC fits the best with what we have.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). The key findings that point towards ARVC include the dilated right ventricle with reduced systolic function and the transmural late gadolinium enhancement involving the right ventricular free wall and outflow tract on cardiac MRI. These features are characteristic of ARVC, which is known to cause ventricular arrhythmias due to the replacement of myocardium with fibrofatty tissue, primarily in the right ventricle.\n\nHowever, other differential diagnoses should be considered as well. Here is a ranked list of possibilities:\n\n1. **Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)**: The presentation and imaging findings strongly suggest ARVC due to the right ventricular involvement and characteristic MRI changes.\n\n2. **Dilated Cardiomyopathy**: While it can cause ventricular arrhythmias, the specific right ventricular findings are more indicative of ARVC.\n\n3. **Myocarditis**: Could cause chest pain, arrhythmias, and elevated troponin, but typically presents with more diffuse rather than localized right ventricular findings.\n\n4. **Sarcoidosis**: Possible, but less likely without systemic symptoms or other organ involvement.\n\n5. **Viral Myocarditis**: Could cause similar symptoms and MRI findings, but the specific pattern of right ventricular damage is more suggestive of ARVC.\n\n6. **Chagas Disease**: A consideration if there's a relevant travel or exposure history, but less likely without such background.\n\n7. **Left Ventricular Non-Compaction**: Can cause ventricular arrhythmias, but the primary right ventricular involvement is atypical for this condition.\n\n8. **Brugada Syndrome**: Possible if there were characteristic ECG findings, but these are not mentioned.\n\n9. **Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT)**: Typically exercise-induced, making it less likely in this scenario.\n\n10. **Idiopathic Ventricular Tachycardia**: A diagnosis of exclusion if other causes are ruled out, but less likely given the specific MRI findings.\n\nIn summary, while ARVC is the most likely diagnosis, it's important to consider these other possibilities in the differential diagnosis.", "topic": "['Rhythm Disorders', 'Cardiology']"}

He had noticed the rash a few days after receiving the second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna). He denied itching, weeping, bleeding, or discharge from the rash or the nipple. He had a history of metabolic syndrome treated with antihypertensives and oral hypoglycemics. The physical examination showed a morbidly obese White man. The skin examination showed a 19 × 10-cm pink, fallacious purple color deep-infiltrated papule in the left breast and a similar 15 × 7-cm papule under the left clavicle (Figure, A). The breast examination was notable for bilateral gynecomastia and inverted left nipple without any palpable lumps. No lymphadenopathy was noted either. His laboratory results showed stage 2 chronic kidney disease. Results of a viral panel including hepatitis A, B, and C and HIV were negative. The punch biopsy of the skin showed a diffuse island of atypical cells in the dermis (Figure, B). On immunohistochemical staining, the atypical cells stained positive for CK-7, GATA-3, and PAX-8 (weak focal staining) and negative for estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (<1%), TTF-1, SATB-2, CDX-2, and NKX-3.1. The positron emission tomography–computed tomography scan showed a diffuse, infiltrating fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid cutaneous lesion on the left chest wall (standardized uptake value, 6.5) and multiple FDG-avid nodes in the axilla (bilaterally), left internal mammary, and left cervical chain. The core biopsy from the lymph node is shown in the Figure, C. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Inflammatory breast cancer", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 71-year-old man who's come in with a rash and swelling on his chest that started a few days after he got his second COVID-19 vaccine. That's interesting timing. The rash is pretty big and has a distinct color. It's not itchy or oozing, which is good, but it's definitely something unusual.\n\nNow, he's got a history of metabolic syndrome, so he's on medications for that. But nothing really jumps out from his medical history that screams 'skin condition.' He's also morbidly obese, which can sometimes play a role in skin issues, but let's not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nThe physical exam shows these large, deep-infiltrated papules. They're a pinkish, purplish color, which is a bit concerning. And there's bilateral gynecomastia and an inverted nipple on the left. That's definitely something to note. No lumps, though, which is a bit surprising.\n\nThe lab results show stage 2 chronic kidney disease. That's something to keep in mind, but it might not be directly related. The viral panel is negative, so we can rule out hepatitis and HIV. That's one less thing to worry about.\n\nThe biopsy results are really key here. We've got atypical cells in the dermis, and they're staining positive for CK-7, GATA-3, and PAX-8. Hmm, those markers are often associated with breast tissue. And they're negative for ER and progesterone receptor, which is interesting. This is starting to sound like a breast cancer scenario, maybe even invasive lobular carcinoma.\n\nThe PET-CT scan shows these FDG-avid lesions on the chest and lymph nodes. That suggests something aggressive and possibly metastatic. This is definitely pointing towards a malignancy.\n\nSo, let's think about the differentials. Initially, I thought about inflammatory breast cancer because of the rapid progression and the vaccine timing. But the biopsy results are steering us towards something more like invasive lobular carcinoma.\n\nThen there's the idea of a secondary malignancy. The vaccine could have triggered some sort of paraneoplastic phenomenon. But the immunohistochemistry is pretty specific for breast cancer.\n\nPaget's disease of the breast crossed my mind too, but the lack of certain symptoms and the biopsy results don't quite fit.\n\nLet's not forget lymphoma. The FDG-avidity could suggest that, but the markers are really pointing towards carcinoma, not lymphoma.\n\nIn the end, it seems like invasive lobular carcinoma is the most likely diagnosis. The clinical presentation, biopsy results, and imaging all align with that.\n\nBut wait, let's rethink this. The vaccine could have played a role in uncovering an underlying issue. Maybe it's not just the cancer itself but how it's presenting. Could this be a case of vaccine-related inflammatory breast cancer?\n\nThe rapid onset after vaccination is suspicious. It's possible the vaccine triggered an inflammatory response, leading to this presentation. That would fit with the timing and the aggressive nature of the lesions.\n\nSo, after considering everything, I think vaccine-related inflammatory breast cancer makes the most sense. It explains the quick progression and the biopsy results. Yeah, that feels right.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the 71-year-old man is invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast. The clinical presentation, biopsy results, and imaging findings all align with this diagnosis. The rapid progression of the rash and swelling after the COVID-19 vaccination could potentially be related to an inflammatory response triggered by the vaccine, but the immunohistochemical markers specifically point towards a breast carcinoma, particularly of lobular origin. \n\nHere is a 10-step differential diagnosis list, with each step considering new information:\n\n1. **Inflammatory Breast Cancer** - Given the rapid progression and the timing related to the COVID-19 vaccine.\n2. **Invasive Lobular Carcinoma** - Suggested by the biopsy results showing atypical cells positive for CK-7, GATA-3, and PAX-8.\n3. **Paget's Disease of the Breast** - Considered due to skin changes, but lacks specific symptoms and biopsy findings.\n4. **Lymphoma** - Possible due to FDG-avidity on PET-CT, but immunohistochemistry favors carcinoma.\n5. **Angiosarcoma** - Considered for the skin and vascular involvement, but markers don't support this.\n6. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma** - A skin malignancy, but the biopsy results don't align with this diagnosis.\n7. **Metastatic Carcinoma** - Possible due to widespread lymph node involvement, but primary site unclear.\n8. **Vaccine-Related Paraneoplastic Phenomenon** - The vaccine potentially unmasking an underlying malignancy.\n9. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans** - A skin condition, but biopsy results don't match.\n10. **Breast Cancer with Pseudoinflammatory Presentation** - Combines features of inflammatory breast cancer with underlying carcinoma.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnosis is **Invasive Lobular Carcinoma**, with the presentation potentially influenced by the COVID-19 vaccine.", "topic": "['Breast Cancer', 'Dermatology', 'Oncology']"}

She reported dyspnea on exertion but had no fevers or chills, nausea or vomiting, hematochezia, or change in the caliber or consistency of her stools.

Computed tomography (CT) of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a large mass occupying the entire abdominal cavity (Figure 1). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Mucinous ovarian carcinoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 62-year-old woman who's been dealing with some pretty uncomfortable symptoms for the past 10 months. She's experiencing progressive abdominal distension and pain, and she's gained 25 kg during this time. That's quite a bit of weight, and it's all adding up to a big mystery.\n\nFirst off, the fact that she's nulligravida, meaning she's never been pregnant, might be important. It could mean her uterus is more prone to certain conditions. So, let's keep that in mind.\n\nNow, she's also having trouble breathing when she exerts herself. That's interesting because it could be related to the mass in her abdomen pushing up against her diaphragm. But, she doesn't have any fever or chills, which kind of rules out an infection.\n\nThe normal results from her upper endoscopy and colonoscopy are a relief because they mean we're not dealing with a common gastrointestinal issue. And her blood work is all normal too, which is surprising. You'd expect some abnormal lab results with a mass this large.\n\nThe tumor markers, CEA, CA-125, and CA19-9, are all normal. That's a bit of a head-scratcher because these are often elevated in ovarian cancer. So, maybe it's not ovarian cancer, or it's a type that doesn't raise these markers.\n\nThe CT scan shows a huge mass taking up her entire abdominal cavity. That's massive! It's not clear what it is, but it's definitely significant.\n\nOkay, let's think about what this could be. Given her age and the fact that she's never been pregnant, a uterine fibroid seems like a strong possibility. Fibroids can get really big and cause symptoms like these.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. We should consider other options too. Ovarian cancer is common in women her age, but those normal tumor markers are throwing me off. Maybe it's a type of ovarian tumor that doesn't elevate those markers.\n\nThere's also the possibility of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor. These can get big and don't always show up in blood tests. Hmm, that's something to think about.\n\nAnd what about lymphoma? It can present as a large abdominal mass, and the normal blood work doesn't rule it out. That's another possibility.\n\nOh, and we can't forget about sarcomas. These are rare, but they can definitely grow to be quite large and might not change blood test results.\n\nAs I'm thinking this through, I'm also considering the possibility of a benign cyst. Sometimes these can grow to be quite large without causing too much trouble.\n\nNow, let's not forget about the possibility of a pancreatic pseudocyst. These can get big and might not show up in blood tests. It's a bit of a long shot, but it's worth considering.\n\nAnd finally, there's the chance of a retroperitoneal fibrosis. This can cause a mass in the abdomen, although it's not the most common thing.\n\nSo, after thinking through all of this, I'm leaning towards uterine fibroids as the most likely cause. But I'm also keeping ovarian cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, lymphoma, sarcoma, benign cyst, pancreatic pseudocyst, and retroperitoneal fibrosis on the list. Each of these has some features that fit the case, and we can't rule them out completely without more information.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 62-year-old woman with a large abdominal mass:\n\n1. **Uterine Fibroid** - Given her age and nulligravid status, a large uterine fibroid is a strong possibility.\n2. **Ovarian Cancer** - Although tumor markers are normal, certain types of ovarian tumors may not elevate these markers.\n3. **Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor** - These can grow large and may not present with abnormal blood tests.\n4. **Lymphoma** - Can present as a large abdominal mass with normal blood work.\n5. **Sarcoma** - Rare, but can grow quite large without significant changes in blood tests.\n6. **Benign Cyst** - Could be a large benign cyst that has grown without causing significant symptoms.\n7. **Pancreatic Pseudocyst** - Although less common, it could present as a large abdominal mass.\n8. **Retroperitoneal Fibrosis** - Can cause an abdominal mass, though it's not the most common condition.\n9. **Hepatic Hemangioma** - A large liver hemangioma could present as an abdominal mass.\n10. **Mesenteric Cyst** - A rare cystic mass in the mesentery could also be a possibility.\n\nAfter considering all the information, uterine fibroid remains the most likely diagnosis, but ovarian cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumor are also strong contenders.

He reported intermittent dull pain in his left eye for 1 month that improved with acetaminophen. His family history was significant for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (mother) and leukemia (mother and maternal grandfather). On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25 OD and 20/200 OS, limited by keratoconus. Extraocular movements were full, there was no relative afferent pupillary defect, and intraocular pressures were 13 mm Hg OD and 11 mm Hg OS. There was no proptosis. Anterior segment examination demonstrated keratoconus with corneal scarring in both eyes and Descemet folds in the left eye. Both eyes had mixed cataract. There were no signs of anterior segment or vitreous inflammation. Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed an amelanotic area of choroidal thickening (confirmed by optical coherence tomography) overhanging the inferonasal margin of the optic disc with associated subretinal fluid and scattered areas of hyperpigmentation (Figure 1A). There was an additional, subtle amelanotic elevated lesion under the fovea. Fundus autofluorescence demonstrated hyperautofluorescence in a leopard-spotting pattern (Figure 1B). Indocyanine green angiography revealed hypocyanescent lesions inferonasal to the disc and at the fovea. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Erdheim-Chester disease", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 68-year-old man with a choroidal lesion in his left eye. He's been dealing with some dull pain, but it's manageable with acetaminophen. That's interesting. His vision in that eye is pretty poor, 20/200, but that's mostly because of his keratoconus. Now, his family history is catching my attention. His mom had non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and both she and his grandfather had leukemia. That's a lot of blood-related cancers in the family.\n\nOkay, so let's look at the eye exam. His eye movements are fine, no issues with the pupils, and the pressures in his eyes are normal. No proptosis either, so no bulging of the eye. The front part of the eye shows keratoconus and some cataract, but nothing inflamed or unusual there. Now, the interesting part is the back of the eye. There's this amelanotic area, which means it's not pigmented, and it's thickening the choroid. It's hanging over the edge of the optic disc and there's some fluid under the retina. Hmm, and there are some spots of hyperpigmentation around.\n\nThe imaging is really telling us a lot. The OCT confirms the choroidal thickening, and the fundus autofluorescence shows a leopard-spot pattern. That's a unique finding. The indocyanine green angiography reveals these hypocyanescent lesions, which means they're not lighting up like the rest of the choroid. This is definitely pointing towards something specific.\n\nSo, what could this be? Let's start with the obvious. Metastatic carcinoma is a possibility. Choroidal metastases are known to be amelanotic and can cause subretinal fluid. Given his age and family history, this is a strong contender. But let's not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nNext, I'm thinking about lymphoma. The family history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a red flag. Lymphoma can present with amelanotic lesions and subretinal fluid too. It's less common, but it fits.\n\nNow, let's consider melanoma. Even though it's amelanotic, melanoma can still present this way. It's a common primary tumor in the eye, but usually, you'd expect more pigmentation.\n\nWhat about hemangiomas? Choroidal hemangiomas can be amelanotic and cause subretinal fluid. They often have a leopard-spot pattern on autofluorescence, which matches our findings. This is a strong possibility.\n\nLet's not forget about choroidal nevus. These are common and can be amelanotic, but they usually don't cause subretinal fluid. Still, it's worth considering.\n\nOh, and there's the possibility of an inflammatory lesion like posterior scleritis. This can cause subretinal fluid and might present with some of these findings. But there's no significant inflammation, so it's less likely.\n\nNow, let's think about the family history again. With all those blood-related cancers, maybe we should consider a hematologic disorder like leukemia. Could this be a leukemic infiltrate? It's rare, but it's possible.\n\nAs I'm going through these options, I'm also considering the age of the patient. At 68, metastatic carcinoma is quite common. But the leopard-spot pattern is really making me think of a hemangioma.\n\nAfter going through all of this, I'm leaning towards a choroidal hemangioma. It fits the clinical and imaging findings well. But I'm not completely ruling out metastatic carcinoma or lymphoma. They're still in the running given the context.\n\nSo, my top differential diagnoses are choroidal hemangioma, metastatic carcinoma, and lymphoma. These three explain the findings the best, but I'm keeping an open mind.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the choroidal lesion in the patient's left eye, with a focus on one distinct possibility at each step:\n\n1. **Metastatic Carcinoma**: Given the patient's age and the amelanotic nature of the choroidal lesion with associated subretinal fluid, metastatic carcinoma is a strong initial consideration.\n\n2. **Choroidal Lymphoma**: The family history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma raises the suspicion for lymphoma, which can present with similar amelanotic lesions and subretinal fluid.\n\n3. **Amelanotic Choroidal Melanoma**: Although typically pigmented, melanoma can occasionally present as amelanotic and is a common primary intraocular tumor.\n\n4. **Choroidal Hemangioma**: The leopard-spot pattern on fundus autofluorescence is characteristic of choroidal hemangiomas, which can be amelanotic and cause subretinal fluid.\n\n5. **Choroidal Nevus**: While less likely to cause subretinal fluid, nevi can be amelanotic and are common choroidal lesions.\n\n6. **Posterior Scleritis**: This inflammatory condition can cause subretinal fluid, but the lack of significant inflammation makes it less likely.\n\n7. **Leukemic Infiltrate**: Given the family history of leukemia, a leukemic infiltrate is a rare but possible consideration.\n\n8. **Choroidal Osteoma**: These bony growths in the choroid can cause subretinal fluid, but typically have a distinct appearance on imaging.\n\n9. **Intraocular Lymphoid Hyperplasia**: This rare condition can mimic lymphoma and presents with similar lesions.\n\n10. **Plasmacytoma**: A rare tumor composed of plasma cells, which can present as an amelanotic choroidal lesion.\n\nAfter considering all the information and test results, the top three differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Choroidal Hemangioma**: The leopard-spot pattern on autofluorescence and amelanotic nature of the lesion make this a strong contender.\n2. **Metastatic Carcinoma**: The patient's age and the commonality of metastatic lesions to the choroid keep this high on the list.\n3. **Choroidal Lymphoma**: The family history of lymphoma and the presentation of the lesion support this as a likely possibility.\n\nThese three diagnoses best explain the clinical and imaging findings, but it's important to remain open to other possibilities as well.", "topic": "['Hematology', 'Oncology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Ophthalmology', 'Ophthalmic Imaging']"}

He reported mild alcohol consumption, denied any cigarette or illicit substance use, and endorsed engaging in oral and anal intercourse. A physical examination was notable for bilateral raised leukoplakia on the tongue; it was larger on the right side than the left and had a slightly hairy appearance. The lesion was tender to touch and could not be scraped off (Figure 1A). The lips and oral mucosa were without lesions, masses, or ulcers. The patient had no cervical lymphadenopathy. The findings of the physical examination were otherwise unremarkable. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Secondary syphilis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 19-year-old guy with painful tongue lesions that have been hanging around for a while. He says spicy food makes it worse, which makes sense because spicy stuff can irritate oral sores. He tried clotrimazole, which helped a bit at first, but then things got worse again. That's interesting because clotrimazole is an antifungal, so maybe we're dealing with something fungal, or maybe not.\n\nFirst, let's consider oral candidiasis. It's pretty common, and clotrimazole should work if that's what it was. But since it didn't, maybe it's not candidiasis. Hmm, what else could it be?\n\nGeographic tongue comes to mind. It's known for these red patches with white borders that move around, but this guy's lesions are fixed and can't be scraped off. So, probably not geographic tongue.\n\nHow about hairy leukoplakia? It's usually seen in people with weakened immune systems, but this guy doesn't have any signs of that. Still, it's worth considering because of the 'hairy' appearance.\n\nLet's not forget about oral lichen planus. It can cause white lesions, but they're usually not painful, and this guy's lesions are definitely painful. So, maybe not lichen planus.\n\nWhat about squamous cell carcinoma? It's a bit of a worry with persistent lesions like these, but there's no bleeding or ulceration, which are common with cancer. Still, we can't rule it out completely.\n\nNow, considering his sexual history, we should think about HPV. It can cause leukoplakia, and this guy's lesions do have that hairy appearance. That's a strong possibility.\n\nThen there's the fact that clotrimazole helped at first. Could it be a mixed infection? Maybe candida was part of the problem, but not all of it. That's something to think about.\n\nWe should also consider traumatic keratosis. If he's been biting his tongue or something, that could cause these lesions. But they would probably be in a different spot, and he didn't mention any trauma.\n\nOh, and what about syphilis? It can cause oral lesions, but they're usually not painful, and there's no other symptoms like a rash. So, probably not syphilis.\n\nFinally, let's think about autoimmune disorders like lupus. They can cause oral lesions, but this guy doesn't have any other symptoms like joint pain or a butterfly rash. So, it's unlikely to be lupus.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I'd say the top possibilities are HPV-related leukoplakia, mixed infection with candida, and maybe traumatic keratosis. But really, HPV is standing out the most given his symptoms and history.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the painful tongue lesions in the 19-year-old male:\n\n1. **Oral Candidiasis** - Although clotrimazole initially helped, the symptoms worsened, suggesting it may not be the primary issue.\n2. **Geographic Tongue** - Unlikely, as the lesions are fixed and cannot be scraped off.\n3. **Hairy Leukoplakia** - Possible, given the 'hairy' appearance, but typically associated with immunocompromised individuals.\n4. **Oral Lichen Planus** - Unlikely, as the lesions are painful, whereas lichen planus lesions usually are not.\n5. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - A concern with persistent lesions, but lacks typical features like bleeding or ulceration.\n6. **HPV-related Leukoplakia** - Strong possibility due to the 'hairy' appearance and sexual history.\n7. **Mixed Infection** - Possible, if candida was part of the initial problem but not the sole cause.\n8. **Traumatic Keratosis** - Possible if there's a history of tongue trauma, but unlikely given the lesion's location and symptoms.\n9. **Syphilis** - Unlikely, as the lesions are painful and there are no other typical symptoms.\n10. **Autoimmune Disorder (e.g., Lupus)** - Unlikely, given the lack of systemic symptoms like joint pain or a butterfly rash.\n\nReranking these based on all the information, the top differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **HPV-related Leukoplakia**\n2. **Mixed Infection with Candida**\n3. **Hairy Leukoplakia**\n\nThese possibilities align with the patient's symptoms, sexual history, and the partial response to antifungal treatment.

Computed tomography (CT) of the neck with contrast at his initial hospital admission was concerning for suppurative lymphadenitis. Despite incision and drainage, and intravenous ampicillin and sulbactam, his cervical lymphadenopathy persisted. Results of subsequent workup—including Haemophilus, tetanus, and pneumococcal antibody titers; QuantiFERON-TB Gold test; serum IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE levels; absolute lymphocyte count; neutrophil phenotype and function; angiotensin-converting enzyme level; HLA-B27 test; and antinuclear antibody level—were within normal limits. Magnetic resonance imaging of the neck with gadolinium contrast demonstrated bilateral, bulky, enlarged cervical lymph nodes, as well as enhancing nodules in the left laryngeal ventricle (2.3 × 1.6 × 1.2 cm), right false vocal cord, and right tracheal wall (0.6 × 0.4 cm). Findings from nasal endoscopy, awake flexible laryngoscopy, and operative microlaryngoscopy revealed yellow submucosal masses in the left nasal cavity, left laryngeal ventricle, and right trachea, as well as left vocal cord paresis (Figure, A). Biopsies were taken of the tracheal, laryngeal, and nasal cavity masses, and an excisional biopsy was taken of a left cervical lymph node (Figure, B). Histopathologic examination revealed a prominent infiltrate of benign-appearing histiocytes with numerous forms showing emperipolesis and some nuclei showing distinct central nucleoli. Immunohistochemical staining in these cells was positive for S100 and negative for CD1a. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Rosai-Dorfman disease", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 12-year-old boy who's been dealing with some pretty tough symptoms for the past three months. He's got nasal obstruction, his voice is changing in a way that's not typical for his age, and he's had recurrent deep neck abscesses. Plus, there's this tender, bulky cervical lymphadenopathy. That's a lot going on.\n\nFirst, I'm thinking about infections. Lymphadenopathy and abscesses make me think of something infectious, maybe even tuberculosis. TB can cause lymph node issues and has a pretty varied presentation, so it's a strong contender.\n\nBut wait, the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test came back normal. That's a pretty good test for TB, so I should probably put that idea on the back burner for now.\n\nNext, I'm considering autoimmune issues. Conditions like sarcoidosis could explain the lymphadenopathy and maybe even the nasal and laryngeal involvement. But then, the angiotensin-converting enzyme level is normal, which usually wouldn't happen in sarcoidosis. Hmm, that's a strike against it.\n\nNow, let's think about immunodeficiencies. Something like Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) could lead to recurrent infections and lymphadenopathy. But the immunoglobulin levels are normal, so that's not really fitting either.\n\nOkay, what about lymphoma? It can cause lymphadenopathy and sometimes involves extranodal sites. But usually, you'd expect some abnormal blood counts or other signs, and we don't have that here. Plus, the biopsy didn't show anything malignant.\n\nI should also think about non-infectious granulomatous diseases. Wegener's granulomatosis, now called Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis, can involve the respiratory tract and lymph nodes. But we don't have any kidney issues or c-ANCA positivity, so that's probably not it.\n\nLet's not forget about Rosai-Dorfman disease. The biopsy shows histiocytes with emperipolesis and they're positive for S100 but negative for CD1a. That's pretty classic for Rosai-Dorfman. It can involve lymph nodes and extranodal sites like the skin or, in this case, the respiratory tract.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Rosai-Dorfman disease seems to fit the best. The histology is spot on, and it explains the lymphadenopathy and the nasal and laryngeal masses. Yeah, that's got to be it.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis for the 12-year-old boy is Rosai-Dorfman disease. This condition is characterized by the presence of histiocytes with emperipolesis, and the immunohistochemical staining profile (positive for S100 and negative for CD1a) aligns well with this diagnosis. Rosai-Dorfman disease can involve lymphadenopathy and extranodal sites, such as the respiratory tract, which corresponds with the boy's symptoms and biopsy findings. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Rosai-Dorfman Disease** - The histological findings and immunohistochemical staining are classic for this condition.\n2. Tuberculosis - Although the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test was normal, TB can present with lymphadenopathy and respiratory involvement.\n3. Sarcoidosis - Normal angiotensin-converting enzyme levels make this less likely, but it can involve lymph nodes and the respiratory tract.\n4. Lymphoma - The biopsy did not show malignant cells, and there are no abnormal blood counts.\n5. Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis - Lack of kidney involvement and c-ANCA positivity makes this less likely.\n6. Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) - Normal immunoglobulin levels do not support this diagnosis.\n7. Cat Scratch Disease - Typically presents with unilateral lymphadenopathy and a known cat scratch history.\n8. Kikuchi Disease - Usually presents with fever and night sweats, which are not mentioned here.\n9. Castleman Disease - Often involves lymphadenopathy, but the histological findings do not match.\n10. IgG4-related Disease - The immunohistochemical profile does not support this diagnosis.\n\nRosai-Dorfman disease is the most fitting diagnosis given the clinical presentation and histological findings.", "topic": "['Hematology', 'Pediatrics', 'Laryngology', 'Otolaryngology']"}

The patient had become progressively disabled and had been using a wheelchair for 4 years prior to presentation. Neurological examination showed gaze-evoked horizontal nystagmus in both directions along with slow saccades and gaze restriction in both vertical and horizontal planes. There was ataxic dysarthria. Tone was normal in all 4 limbs but stretch reflexes were absent and plantar fascia were mute. Limb power was normal. Ataxia was seen on finger-to-nose and heel-knee-shin tests. Chorea was present in both legs. Ankle inversion with bilateral hammertoes was noted. Electromyography revealed sensory neuronopathy. On brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffuse cerebellar atrophy was noted along with T2 hyperintensities in bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles, cerebellar white matter, pons, and bilateral thalamus (Figure). Psychiatric treatment was commenced for her severe anxiety but did not relieve the fear of falling. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Mitochondrial ataxia", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 55-year-old woman who's been dealing with some pretty tough symptoms for 14 years. She's got a history of high cholesterol and anxiety, but it's this progressive imbalance and fear of falling that's really been a problem. She's even been using a wheelchair for the past 4 years. That's quite significant.\n\nNow, when we look at her neurological exam, there's a lot going on. She's got gaze-evoked nystagmus, which means her eyes are making these jerky movements when she looks side to side. Her saccades, or fast eye movements, are slow, and she's having trouble moving her eyes up and down and side to side. That's definitely pointing towards some kind of issue with her brain, maybe the cerebellum or its connections.\n\nThen there's the ataxic dysarthria, which is a kind of slurred speech that comes from coordination problems. Her muscle tone is normal, but she doesn't have reflexes in her arms or legs. That's strange because it suggests something might be happening with her peripheral nerves or sensory pathways.\n\nShe's also got normal muscle strength, but she's failing the finger-to-nose and heel-knee-shin tests, which are classic for checking coordination. And chorea, these involuntary jerky movements, are happening in her legs. Plus, her ankles are inverted, and she has hammertoes. That's a lot of neurological symptoms pointing to different possible issues.\n\nThe EMG shows sensory neuronopathy, which means her sensory neurons are not working right. This could be from a variety of causes, maybe something genetic or acquired. And the MRI is really telling. There's cerebellar atrophy and these T2 hyperintensities in the cerebellum, pons, and thalamus. That's a pretty widespread issue in the brain.\n\nSo, what could this be? Initially, I'm thinking about some hereditary cerebellar degenerations. They often cause ataxia and nystagmus. But then, the sensory neuronopathy and chorea make me think of something more complex, maybe a spinocerebellar ataxia. SCA types like SCA 3 or SCA 17 could fit because they can have a mix of cerebellar and other neurological symptoms.\n\nBut wait, there's also the absence of reflexes and the specific MRI findings. These make me consider other conditions, like Multiple System Atrophy. It can cause cerebellar problems and autonomic dysfunction, but usually not sensory neuronopathy.\n\nI should also think about other ataxias, like those caused by vitamin deficiencies. Vitamin E deficiency can cause ataxia and chorea, but it doesn't quite fit with the MRI findings. And then there's gluten sensitivity, which can cause ataxia and neurological issues, but it's not typically associated with these specific MRI changes.\n\nHmm, what about genetic conditions like Friedreich's ataxia? It causes ataxia and areflexia, but it usually starts younger, and the MRI findings aren't quite right. And then there's abetalipoproteinemia, which can cause similar symptoms, but it also doesn't quite fit the age and MRI profile.\n\nSo, after considering all of this, I'm leaning towards a hereditary cerebellar degeneration, maybe a type of spinocerebellar ataxia. The combination of cerebellar atrophy, sensory neuronopathy, and chorea fits. But I'm also keeping Multiple System Atrophy in mind because of the overlap in symptoms. It's a complex case, and these conditions can have a lot of variability.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the provided information, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA) Type 3 (Machado-Joseph Disease)**: This condition is known for causing progressive ataxia, nystagmus, and can include other neurological symptoms such as chorea.\n\n2. **Multiple System Atrophy (MSA)**: This disorder can present with cerebellar ataxia, autonomic dysfunction, and some Parkinsonian features, although sensory neuronopathy is not typical.\n\n3. **Friedreich's Ataxia**: Characterized by progressive ataxia and areflexia, but it usually presents at a younger age and has distinct MRI findings.\n\n4. **Abetalipoproteinemia**: This rare genetic disorder can cause ataxia, sensory neuronopathy, and other systemic symptoms, but typically starts at a younger age.\n\n5. **Vitamin E Deficiency**: Can cause ataxia and chorea, but the MRI findings and age of onset don't align well with this diagnosis.\n\n6. **Gluten Ataxia**: Associated with gluten sensitivity, it can cause ataxia and neurological issues, but the specific MRI changes are not typical.\n\n7. **Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia**: Primarily causes progressive spasticity, but can have some overlap with cerebellar symptoms.\n\n8. **Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis**: A metabolic disorder that can cause ataxia and some neurological symptoms, but is more associated with tendon xanthomas.\n\n9. **Ataxia-Telangiectasia**: Presents with ataxia, but usually includes telangiectasias and immunodeficiency, which are not mentioned here.\n\n10. **Late-Onset Tay-Sachs Disease**: A rare condition that can present with ataxia and neurological decline, but typically has other distinctive features.\n\nAfter considering all the symptoms, test results, and the progression of the disease, **Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (Machado-Joseph Disease)** emerges as the most likely diagnosis. This condition aligns well with the combination of cerebellar atrophy, sensory neuronopathy, and chorea, along with the specific MRI findings.

The patient lived in Southern California but had visited Kenya for an extended trip a few years prior. Review of systems was negative for fevers, night sweats, weight loss, headache, vision changes, respiratory distress, or arthralgias. On the left nasal dorsum and medial cheek, there was a 3 × 4 cm violaceous plaque with focal purulent drainage. Within several weeks, the lesion rapidly expanded into a vegetative, freely draining plaque covering the cheeks and glabella and approaching the medial canthi (Figure, B). Computed tomography revealed findings consistent with abscess that did not involve the orbits, sinuses, or bone. Chest radiography results were unremarkable.

We've got a woman in her late 70s with a history of immunoglobulin A monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance. That's already a bit of a red flag for potential immune issues. She's got this tender, draining lesion right on her face, and it's been stubborn despite antibiotics. That's odd. \n\nFirst, I'm thinking about infections. With her travel history to Kenya, my mind jumps to leprosy. It's not common, but it's endemic there, and it can cause some pretty unusual skin stuff. Plus, it's known for being resistant to regular antibiotics. \n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. The lesion is violaceous and has purulent drainage. That sounds more like a bacterial or fungal infection to me. Maybe something like lupus vulgaris? It's a form of cutaneous tuberculosis, and it can look like that. \n\nOh, but the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test was negative. Hmm, that makes lupus vulgaris less likely. But I shouldn't completely rule it out yet. These tests aren't perfect. \n\nLet's think about other possibilities. What about chromoblastomycosis? It's a fungal infection that can cause these nodular, draining lesions. It's rare, but it fits the description. \n\nAnd there's also the possibility of a mycobacterial infection other than tuberculosis. These can be tricky and might not show up on the usual tests. \n\nNow, considering her immunoglobulin A monoclonal gammopathy, she might be more prone to infections or have unusual presentations. That could be a clue. \n\nI should also think about non-infectious causes. Could it be something like pyoderma gangrenosum? It's a skin condition that can look like an infection but isn't. \n\nOh, and what about IgG4-related disease? It can cause some pretty strange skin manifestations and might fit with her monoclonal gammopathy. \n\nLet's not forget about neoplasms. Could this be a sign of something like a natural killer/T-cell lymphoma? It's rare, but it can cause skin lesions like this. \n\nOkay, so putting it all together, I think the top differential should be leprosy. It fits her travel history and the lesion's characteristics. \n\nNext, I'd consider chromoblastomycosis. It's a good match for the nodular, draining aspect. \n\nThen, lupus vulgaris is still on the list, despite the negative test. I just can't shake the clinical presentation. \n\nAfter that, a mycobacterial infection seems plausible, especially with her immune history. \n\nPyoderma gangrenosum is next. It's a bit of a wildcard, but it could explain the lack of response to antibiotics. \n\nIgG4-related disease is also on the list. It ties in with her monoclonal gammopathy and could explain the lesion. \n\nNatural killer/T-cell lymphoma is a consideration too. It's rare, but the presentation fits. \n\nThen there's the possibility of a bacterial infection like actinomycosis. It can cause similar lesions. \n\nFinally, I'd think about sporotrichosis. It's a fungal infection that can cause nodular lesions, and it fits the outdoor exposure history. \n\nSo, that's my list. It's a mix of infections, immune-related conditions, and neoplasms. I think it covers all the bases.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, considering her history and clinical presentation:\n\n1. **Leprosy** - Given her travel history to Kenya, where leprosy is endemic, and the characteristics of the lesion, leprosy is a strong consideration.\n\n2. **Chromoblastomycosis** - This fungal infection can cause nodular, draining lesions and fits the description of the patient's condition.\n\n3. **Lupus Vulgaris** - Despite the negative QuantiFERON-TB Gold test, the clinical presentation aligns with this form of cutaneous tuberculosis.\n\n4. **Mycobacterial Infection** - Other than tuberculosis, mycobacterial infections could explain the lesion and might not be detected by the usual tests.\n\n5. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum** - This skin condition can mimic an infection and is a possibility given the lack of response to antibiotics.\n\n6. **IgG4-related Disease** - This condition can cause unusual skin manifestations and may be related to her monoclonal gammopathy.\n\n7. **Natural Killer/T-cell Lymphoma** - This rare lymphoma can present with skin lesions similar to what the patient is experiencing.\n\n8. **Actinomycosis** - A bacterial infection that can cause similar lesions and is worth considering.\n\n9. **Sporotrichosis** - A fungal infection that causes nodular lesions, fitting the outdoor exposure history.\n\n10. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** - Although less likely, this common skin cancer can sometimes present with unusual features.\n\nThese differentials cover a range of infectious, immune-related, and neoplastic conditions, reflecting the complexity of the case. Further diagnostic workup, including biopsy and culture results, will be essential in narrowing down the diagnosis.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Hematology', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine', 'Rheumatology', 'Skin Infections']"}

Physical examination revealed a mass in the buccinator space that was smooth, was nontender to palpation, and had no overlying cutaneous changes. A contrast-enhanced maxillofacial computed tomography scan demonstrated a 1.8 × 1.8 × 1.9-cm rounded, well-circumscribed lesion at the anterior aspect of the left masticator space (Figure 1). The mass was abutting the parotid duct, which did not appear dilated, and appeared to have a peripheral rim of hyperenhancing soft tissue with a central cystic/necrotic component. Results of ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration revealed rare epithelial cells with degenerative changes and inflammatory cells present. Findings from a core biopsy demonstrated a spindle cell neoplasm of uncertain origin. On immunostaining, spindle cells were CK8/18, S100, and SOX10 negative; myosin and smooth muscle actin (SMA) negative; and CD31 negative. However, STAT6 staining was diffusely positive. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Solitary fibrous tumor", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an 81-year-old woman with a mass in her cheek. It's been growing slowly over three months, and she's not experiencing any symptoms like pain or numbness. That's interesting because it suggests the mass might not be too aggressive. \n\nWhen I look at the CT scan, I see it's well-circumscribed with a peripheral rim that's enhancing and a central part that looks cystic or necrotic. This kind of appearance could mean a few things. It might be a benign tumor, or maybe something a bit more complex like a malignant process with necrosis. \n\nThe fine-needle aspiration shows some epithelial cells and inflammatory cells, but nothing too conclusive. The core biopsy is more revealing; it's a spindle cell neoplasm, but we don't know where it's coming from yet. \n\nNow, let's talk about the immunostaining. The spindle cells are negative for CK8/18, S100, and SOX10, which rules out epithelial and melanocytic origins. They're also negative for myosin and smooth muscle actin, so we can cross off smooth muscle tumors. And CD31 is negative, which means it's not a typical vascular tumor. But here's the kicker: STAT6 is diffusely positive. That's a big hint towards a solitary fibrous tumor. \n\nSo, what could this be? Initially, I thought about a pleomorphic adenoma because it's common in the salivary glands, but the immunostaining doesn't match. Then, I considered a mucoepidermoid carcinoma, but that doesn't fit either. \n\nHow about a solitary fibrous tumor? The STAT6 positivity is a strong indicator, and they can appear in various locations, including the head and neck. This seems like a good fit. \n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. We should think about other possibilities. Could it be a schwannoma? They can be spindle cell neoplasms too, but usually, they're S100 positive, which isn't the case here. \n\nWhat about a fibrosarcoma? It's a malignant tumor, and the spindle cell morphology could match, but we'd expect more aggressive features clinically. \n\nThere's also the idea of a malignant fibrous histiocytoma/undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. These can be tricky, but they usually have more complex immunohistochemical profiles. \n\nLet's not forget about liposarcomas. They can have a spindle cell component, but we'd likely see some lipid-related findings. \n\nAnd then there's the possibility of a neurofibroma. They're often S100 positive, though, so that's unlikely here. \n\nAfter considering all these options, the solitary fibrous tumor still seems like the best fit. The STAT6 positivity is a strong clue, and the clinical presentation matches. \n\nSo, after going through everything, I'm confident that the most likely diagnosis is a solitary fibrous tumor. It's not the most common in this location, but the evidence points that way.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the mass in the cheek of the 81-year-old woman is a solitary fibrous tumor. This conclusion is supported by the diffuse positivity for STAT6, a marker commonly associated with solitary fibrous tumors, along with the clinical presentation and imaging characteristics. While other differential diagnoses such as schwannoma, fibrosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma/undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, liposarcoma, and neurofibroma were considered, they were ruled out due to the immunohistochemical profile and clinical features that did not align as closely as they did with a solitary fibrous tumor. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Solitary Fibrous Tumor** - Strongly suggested by STAT6 positivity and clinical presentation.\n2. **Pleomorphic Adenoma** - Common in salivary glands, but immunostaining doesn't match.\n3. **Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma** - Doesn't fit with the immunohistochemical findings.\n4. **Schwannoma** - Typically S100 positive, which is not the case here.\n5. **Fibrosarcoma** - More aggressive features expected clinically.\n6. **Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma/Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma** - More complex immunohistochemical profile expected.\n7. **Liposarcoma** - Would likely show lipid-related findings.\n8. **Neurofibroma** - Usually S100 positive, making it unlikely in this case.\n9. **Vascular Tumors** - CD31 negativity rules out typical vascular tumors.\n10. **Smooth Muscle Tumors** - Negative myosin and smooth muscle actin make this unlikely.", "topic": "['Otolaryngology', 'Salivary Gland Disorders', 'Dental Medicine', 'Facial Nerve', 'Facial Plastic Surgery']"}

And he doesn't have a history of smoking or any previous surgeries or radiation in the head and neck area, so we can probably rule out some of the more common causes of vocal issues related to those factors.\n\nNow, he's been treated for asthma, but it didn't help. That's a clue that his airway problem might not be related to asthma. Hmm, what else could it be? Let's think about conditions that cause hoarseness and breathing problems. Laryngeal cancer comes to mind, but usually, there are other symptoms like weight loss or a noticeable mass. Plus, the CT scan didn't show any tumors or swollen lymph nodes, so that's probably not it.\n\nThe CT scan did show some irregularity on the vocal folds, though. That could mean something is going on with the larynx itself. Maybe it's laryngitis? But that usually comes with other symptoms, and it's not typically chronic like this. What about a polyp or a nodule? Those can cause hoarseness, but they usually don't cause breathing problems unless they're pretty big, and the scan didn't mention anything like that.\n\nOh, and there's the biopsy. It showed edematous and irregular mucosa. That sounds like some kind of inflammation or swelling. Could it be something like laryngeal edema? That might explain the airway narrowing. But what's causing the edema? It's not like he has a history of allergies or reflux that could cause it.\n\nWait, let's not forget about the possibility of a neurological issue. True vocal fold immobility can sometimes be due to nerve problems, like vocal cord paralysis. But usually, that's unilateral, and the other side would compensate more effectively. Plus, there's no history of conditions that might cause nerve damage.\n\nHmm, what about something more systemic? Like, maybe a granulomatous disease? Sarcoidosis can cause laryngeal involvement and doesn't always present with obvious systemic symptoms right away. That could explain the mucosal changes and the chronic nature of the symptoms.\n\nSo, putting it all together, it seems like we're dealing with something that's causing chronic inflammation and swelling in the larynx. Sarcoidosis seems like a strong possibility here. It fits with the biopsy findings and the lack of other symptoms. Yeah, that makes sense. Let's go with that as the most likely diagnosis.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Laryngeal Cancer** - Although the CT scan did not show any tumors, laryngeal cancer remains a consideration due to the chronic nature of the symptoms and the irregularity on the vocal folds.\n\n2. **Vocal Cord Paralysis** - The right true vocal fold immobility could suggest nerve involvement, potentially due to neurological issues, but typically this would present with more localized symptoms.\n\n3. **Laryngeal Polyp** - A polyp could cause hoarseness and, if large enough, affect breathing, but the CT scan did not indicate any such mass.\n\n4. **Chronic Laryngitis** - This could explain the hoarseness and mucosal irregularity, but it usually comes with other symptoms like cough or throat clearing.\n\n5. **Laryngopharyngeal Reflux** - Although the patient denies reflux symptoms, reflux could still cause chronic inflammation and edema in the larynx.\n\n6. **Sarcoidosis** - This systemic condition can cause laryngeal involvement, leading to mucosal changes and chronic symptoms without obvious systemic manifestations.\n\n7. **Amyloidosis** - This could cause laryngeal deposits leading to swelling and airway narrowing, but it's relatively rare and would likely have other systemic signs.\n\n8. **Relapsing Polychondritis** - This condition involves cartilage inflammation and could affect the larynx, but it typically presents with more widespread symptoms.\n\n9. **Laryngeal Edema** - This could be due to allergic reactions or angioedema, but there's no history of allergies or typical triggers.\n\n10. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis** - This condition can cause laryngeal involvement and systemic symptoms, but it often presents with more obvious signs like renal or skin involvement.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the most likely diagnosis is **Sarcoidosis**. It aligns with the chronic symptoms, biopsy findings, and the absence of other systemic symptoms. This condition can affect the larynx and cause the type of mucosal changes and airway narrowing observed in this patient.", "topic": "['Fungal Infections', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Laryngology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Critical Care Medicine']"}

She was breastfeeding her 10-month-old, had no history of alcohol use, and had a remote history of hookah use. She was a Southern California native with travel history to Pakistan, Turkey, Jordan, Israel, Qatar, and Dubai 5 years prior to symptom onset. One month prior to onset, she drove from Los Angeles, California, to Houston, Texas. She denied recent unintentional weight loss, cough, fever, night sweats, chills, stridor, dyspnea, dysphonia, or rash. On examination, her vital signs were within normal limits, and physical examination revealed a small right tonsillolith, mild tonsillar erythema that was worse on the right side, and a mobile 2-cm, right level 2 lymph node that was slightly tender to palpation. Laboratory evaluation was notable for an elevated eosinophil count and positive Epstein-Barr immunoglobulin G. Her white blood cell count and mononucleosis spot test result were within normal parameters. Her symptoms persisted despite treatment with penicillin, azithromycin, and steroids from her primary physician and amoxicillin-clavulanate, sinus rinses, fluticasone propionate, and azelastine spray from an otolaryngologist to treat any contributing postnasal drainage and tonsillitis. Flexible transnasal videolaryngoscopy revealed a lesion on the laryngeal surface of the right epiglottis passing midline extending to the right aryepiglottic fold, but not involving the true vocal cords (Figure 1A). Given inconclusive office biopsy results, direct laryngoscopy with biopsy was performed, showing extensively inflamed squamous mucosa with ulceration, granulation tissue, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and atypia (Figure 1B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Coccidioidomycosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 29-year-old woman from Pakistan with some pretty uncomfortable symptoms. She's dealing with postnasal drip, sore throat, painful swallowing, neck pain, swollen lymph nodes, and ear pain. That's a lot going on! And it's been over a week, so it's not just a simple cold or anything. \n\nFirst off, I'm thinking about infections. Strep throat is pretty common, right? It can cause a sore throat and swollen lymph nodes. But, she's already been treated with antibiotics like penicillin and azithromycin, and there's been no improvement. That makes strep throat less likely. \n\nNext, let's consider infectious mononucleosis. It can cause a sore throat, fever, and swollen lymph nodes too. But, her mononucleosis spot test came back normal, so that's probably not it. \n\nNow, what about something a bit more unusual, like tuberculosis? It can cause a persistent cough and fever, but she doesn't have those symptoms. Plus, she's been treated for other infections without success, so TB seems unlikely. \n\nHmm, maybe it's a fungal infection like histoplasmosis? That can cause similar symptoms, especially if she's been traveling. She did travel to several countries in the Middle East and South Asia, so that's a possibility. But, we'd usually expect some respiratory symptoms, which she doesn't have. \n\nLet's not forget about non-infectious causes. Could it be something like sarcoidosis? That can cause lymph node swelling and throat issues, but we'd usually see more systemic symptoms. Plus, her lab results don't really point to that. \n\nOh, and there's that elevated eosinophil count. That's interesting. Eosinophilia can be caused by allergic reactions or parasitic infections. Maybe something like ascariasis? That's a parasitic infection that can cause eosinophilia, but it usually comes with gastrointestinal symptoms, which she doesn't have. \n\nWait, what about a neoplasm like squamous cell carcinoma? The persistent symptoms and lymph node involvement could fit, but she's pretty young for that, and her biopsy results didn't show cancer. \n\nThe biopsy did show pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, though. That can be seen in conditions like tuberculosis or fungal infections. So, maybe we're back to thinking about something like TB or a fungal infection? \n\nBut, she doesn't have the typical symptoms for those, and the treatments she's had didn't work. This is tricky. \n\nLet's think about other possibilities. What about cat scratch disease? It can cause swollen lymph nodes and throat symptoms, and it's caused by a bacteria called Bartonella henselae. That could fit, especially since her symptoms have persisted despite treatment. \n\nSo, after going through all of this, I think cat scratch disease is a strong contender. It matches her symptoms and the fact that she hasn't responded to other treatments. Yeah, that seems like a plausible explanation.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's symptoms, with a focus on one potential diagnosis per step, without repetition:\n\n1. **Strep Throat**: Initially, strep throat is a common cause of sore throat and swollen lymph nodes, but the lack of response to antibiotics like penicillin and azithromycin makes this less likely.\n\n2. **Infectious Mononucleosis**: This can cause sore throat, fever, and lymphadenopathy, but the normal mononucleosis spot test result makes this diagnosis unlikely.\n\n3. **Tuberculosis**: Although TB can cause persistent symptoms and lymph node involvement, the absence of cough, fever, and weight loss makes this less probable.\n\n4. **Histoplasmosis**: This fungal infection could be considered given the travel history, but the lack of respiratory symptoms makes it less likely.\n\n5. **Sarcoidosis**: This condition can cause lymphadenopathy and throat issues, but the absence of systemic symptoms and specific lab findings makes it unlikely.\n\n6. **Ascariasis**: The elevated eosinophil count could suggest a parasitic infection like ascariasis, but the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms makes this less likely.\n\n7. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: Persistent symptoms and lymph node involvement could suggest a neoplasm, but the patient's young age and biopsy results not indicating cancer make this unlikely.\n\n8. **Cat Scratch Disease**: This bacterial infection can cause lymphadenopathy and throat symptoms, and the lack of response to previous treatments makes this a plausible diagnosis.\n\n9. **Lemierre's Syndrome**: This condition involves throat symptoms and lymphadenopathy due to a bacterial infection, but the absence of typical signs like fever and sepsis makes it less likely.\n\n10. **Chronic Fungal Infection**: The biopsy showing pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia could suggest a chronic fungal infection, which might fit the persistent symptoms and treatment resistance.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are cat scratch disease and chronic fungal infection, as they align with the patient's symptoms and the lack of response to previous treatments.

She reported difficulty opening her jaw, pain when chewing, and a 2.3-kg weight loss. The week prior, she experienced left-sided ptosis that persisted for 2 days and subsequently resolved. She denied vision changes, eye pain, scalp tenderness, and myalgias. Past medical history included schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and supraventricular tachycardia. Her examination demonstrated normal visual acuity in both eyes. Pupils were equal, round, and reactive. There was right upper-eyelid ptosis. Extraocular motility demonstrated limitation of elevation and abduction bilaterally (Figure 1). Results of dilated fundus examination were normal, and the remainder of her neurologic examination results were normal.

A lumbar puncture demonstrated normal opening pressure, cell count, and glucose and protein levels. Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast of the brain demonstrated diffuse edema and enhancement of the scalp, skull base, neck, and paraspinal soft tissues, as well as T2 hyperintensity and enhancement of the extraocular muscles bilaterally. An additional test was obtained, and a diagnosis was made. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Giant cell arteritis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 75-year-old woman who's dealing with some pretty uncomfortable symptoms. She's got horizontal double vision, a droopy eyelid on the right side, and a headache that's been getting worse over the past few days. That's quite a trio of issues. And she's also having trouble opening her jaw and pain when chewing. Plus, she's lost a bit of weight. That's interesting.\n\nNow, she mentioned that she had a similar droopy eyelid on the left side just last week, but it went away after a couple of days. That's a bit unusual, isn't it? It makes me think there's something going on that's affecting her nerves or muscles.\n\nHer past medical history includes schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and a heart rhythm issue. But nothing that immediately screams 'this is the cause' of her current problems. So, let's keep looking.\n\nWhen we examine her, her vision is fine, and her pupils are normal. That's good. But she can't move her eyes upwards or outwards properly, and that's on both sides. Hmm, that's a clue. And the droopy eyelid is still there on the right.\n\nThe blood tests show really high inflammation markers. That's a big red flag for something inflammatory. And the MRI shows swelling and enhancement in the scalp, skull base, and even the muscles around her eyes. That's pointing towards some kind of inflammation or swelling in those areas.\n\nSo, what could this be? My first thought is giant cell arteritis. It's common in older adults and can cause headaches and inflammation. But, it usually comes with jaw pain and vision loss, which she doesn't have. So, maybe not that.\n\nHow about polymyalgia rheumatica? It's related to giant cell arteritis and causes muscle pain and inflammation. But, it usually affects the shoulders and hips, not the eyes. So, that's probably not it either.\n\nCould it be myasthenia gravis? That causes muscle weakness, but it usually gets worse with activity and better with rest. And the symptoms don't quite fit, especially with the inflammation markers being so high.\n\nWhat about orbital myositis? That's inflammation of the eye muscles, which fits with the MRI findings. But, it's usually more painful and doesn't explain the systemic symptoms.\n\nMaybe it's something like dermatomyositis? That's an inflammatory condition that affects muscles and skin. But, she doesn't have the typical skin rash, so that's unlikely.\n\nCould it be a chronic infection like endocarditis? That can cause systemic symptoms and inflammation, but it usually has other signs like fever or heart murmur, which she doesn't have.\n\nHow about a parasitic infection like trichinosis? That can cause muscle pain and inflammation after eating undercooked meat. But, she didn't mention any recent suspicious meals, so that's a stretch.\n\nWhat about something like sarcoidosis? That's an inflammatory condition that can affect various parts of the body, including the eyes. But, it usually has other symptoms like lung issues or skin problems, which she doesn't have.\n\nCould it be a tumor or cancer? That can cause systemic symptoms and weight loss, but it doesn't usually cause this kind of eye muscle inflammation.\n\nAfter thinking through all of this, I'm leaning towards giant cell arteritis. Even though it doesn't fit perfectly, it explains the inflammation and some of the symptoms. But, I'm not completely convinced. I think we need more tests to be sure.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnoses for the 75-year-old woman with horizontal binocular diplopia, right-sided ptosis, progressive headache, difficulty opening her jaw, and elevated inflammation markers are as follows:\n\n1. **Giant Cell Arteritis**: This condition is common in older adults and can cause headaches and inflammation, but it typically involves jaw pain and vision loss, which are not present here.\n\n2. **Polymyalgia Rheumatica**: Related to giant cell arteritis, it causes muscle pain and inflammation, but it usually affects the shoulders and hips, not the eyes.\n\n3. **Orbital Myositis**: Inflammation of the eye muscles, which fits with the MRI findings, but it's usually more painful and doesn't explain the systemic symptoms.\n\n4. **Myasthenia Gravis**: Causes muscle weakness, but symptoms usually worsen with activity and improve with rest, and the high inflammation markers don't fit well.\n\n5. **Dermatomyositis**: An inflammatory condition affecting muscles and skin, but the absence of a skin rash makes this less likely.\n\n6. **Endocarditis**: A chronic infection causing systemic symptoms and inflammation, but it typically presents with fever or heart murmur, which are not present.\n\n7. **Trichinosis**: A parasitic infection causing muscle pain and inflammation, but there's no history of consuming undercooked meat.\n\n8. **Sarcoidosis**: An inflammatory condition affecting various body parts, including the eyes, but it usually involves lung or skin issues, which are not present.\n\n9. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome**: A rare condition causing painful ophthalmoplegia due to inflammation at the skull base, which could explain the headache and eye muscle involvement.\n\n10. **Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP)**: An autoimmune condition affecting peripheral nerves, but it typically presents with more widespread weakness rather than isolated eye muscle involvement.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome** emerges as a strong contender, given the combination of headache, eye muscle involvement, and inflammatory markers.

Five years before this otolaryngology evaluation, the patient developed diffuse skin plaques with erythema and was subsequently diagnosed with hypopigmented cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL, mycosis fungoides type). The patient was treated with a regimen of narrowband UV-B phototherapy and triamcinolone cream, which he has continued for 4 years. Owing to significant worsening of his symptoms 4 months before his evaluation, a biopsy of his cutaneous lesions was performed to rule out progression of CTCL (Figure 1). Physical examination demonstrated large annular plaques with peripheral hyperpigmentation of the body. There were also confluent, indurated pink plaques with slightly raised edges along the forehead, malar eminence, and scalp. The nasal septum demonstrated an inverted V deformity with compromise of the keystone junction. Nasal passages were obstructed with thick mucus and synechiae formation, nearly obstructing the entire nasal passage bilaterally. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Lepromatous leprosy", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 66-year-old African American man who's been dealing with some pretty bad nasal congestion for a while now. That's a long time to be stuffy! He's also got a history of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, which is a type of skin lymphoma. That's important to keep in mind.\n\nNow, he's had these skin plaques for a while, and they've been treated with some light therapy and creams. But things got worse a few months back, so they did a biopsy to see if his lymphoma was getting worse. That makes sense.\n\nWhen I look at his symptoms, the nasal congestion and skin issues are sticking out. The nasal septum has this weird inverted V deformity. That's not something you see every day. And there's thick mucus and synechiae, which means his nasal passages are really blocked. That sounds pretty uncomfortable.\n\nSo, what could be going on here? Let's start with the skin. His history of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is a big clue. Could it be progressing? That's definitely something to consider. But wait, the nasal symptoms are pretty significant too. They might be pointing to something else.\n\nNasal congestion and destruction could mean a few things. Wegener's granulomatosis, or granulomatosis with polyangiitis, comes to mind. It can cause nasal issues and skin problems. That's a strong possibility.\n\nBut let's not jump to conclusions. We should think about other conditions too. Relapsing polychondritis could cause cartilage destruction, leading to nasal deformities. That's another one to consider.\n\nAnd what about infectious causes? Syphilis can cause some weird skin and nasal symptoms. It's not common, but it's worth thinking about.\n\nOh, and there's leprosy. It can cause skin lesions and nasal issues, especially in certain populations. That's another possibility.\n\nNow, let's think about the tests. The biopsy from a few months ago could give us some clues. If it showed any granulomas or necrosis, that might point to Wegener's. But if it showed acid-fast bacilli, that would make me think of leprosy.\n\nOkay, let's put it all together. Based on everything, Wegener's granulomatosis seems like a strong contender. It fits the nasal and skin symptoms. But I can't completely rule out leprosy or relapsing polychondritis. They're still in the running.\n\nSo, here's my final list. Wegener's granulomatosis is at the top, followed by leprosy, and then relapsing polychondritis. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is still a consideration, but it seems less likely to be the main issue here. And syphilis, while possible, is a bit further down the list. That's my take.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)**: This condition is known for causing both nasal and skin manifestations, including the type of nasal septum deformity and skin plaques described.\n\n2. **Leprosy**: Given the skin lesions and nasal involvement, leprosy is a consideration, especially in certain populations. It can cause both dermatological and nasal symptoms.\n\n3. **Relapsing Polychondritis**: This condition involves cartilage destruction, which could explain the nasal deformity and might also be associated with skin manifestations.\n\n4. **Syphilis**: Syphilis can present with a variety of skin and mucosal symptoms and should be considered due to its potential for causing nasal and skin lesions.\n\n5. **Progression of Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL)**: While the patient has a history of CTCL, progression could lead to more severe skin and possibly nasal symptoms.\n\n6. **Sarcoidosis**: This condition can affect the skin and nasal areas, leading to similar symptoms, including nasal obstruction and skin plaques.\n\n7. **Lupus Vulgaris**: A form of cutaneous tuberculosis, it can cause skin lesions and potentially involve the nasal area.\n\n8. **Rhinoscleroma**: A chronic granulomatous condition that affects the nasal mucosa and can cause obstruction and deformity.\n\n9. **Churg-Strauss Syndrome**: An eosinophilic vasculitis that can involve the nasal passages and skin, leading to similar symptoms.\n\n10. **Nasal T-cell/NK-cell Lymphoma**: A rare form of lymphoma that can present with nasal and skin involvement.\n\nAfter considering all the patient's symptoms and history, the top three differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)**\n2. **Leprosy**\n3. **Relapsing Polychondritis**\n\nThese conditions best fit the combination of nasal and skin symptoms, along with the patient's history and biopsy results.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Otolaryngology']"}

Color fundus photography showed symmetric bilateral mottling of the retinal pigment epithelium in the periphery (Figure 1B). Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography on initial examination showed an abnormal foveal contour with loss of the foveal pit and intraretinal cystoid cavities within the inner nuclear layer. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Congenital nanophthalmos", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 9-year-old boy with some interesting eye issues. He's been dealing with high hyperopia and amblyopia since he was really young, just 3 years old. That's quite early to have these issues, so it's definitely something to keep in mind.\n\nNow, looking at his current symptoms, his visual acuity isn't great. It's 20/50 in one eye and 20/30 in the other. Not terrible, but not perfect either. His pupils are round and react to light, which is normal. And the pressure in his eyes and the front part of the eyes look fine too.\n\nBut here's where it gets more interesting. The fundus examination shows blunted foveal reflexes and some weird blood vessel stuff going on in one of his eyes. That's a bit of a red flag.\n\nThe fluorescein angiography is really telling. It shows these circular dark areas around the macula in both eyes. No leakage, which is good, but still, it's unusual.\n\nAnd then there's the color fundus photography. It shows this mottled pattern in the peripheral retina. That's not something you see every day.\n\nThe OCT scan is probably the most revealing. It shows an abnormal foveal contour and these cyst-like spaces in the inner nuclear layer. That's definitely pointing towards something specific.\n\nSo, what could this be? Initially, I'm thinking about conditions that affect the retina and have these kinds of patterns. Best's disease comes to mind first. It's known for those vitelliform lesions, but they're usually more distinct and evolve over time. This doesn't quite fit.\n\nThen there's Stargardt disease. It causes mottling and can affect young people, but it usually leads to central vision loss, and that's not the main issue here.\n\nUsher syndrome is another possibility. It affects the retina and can cause vascular changes, but it's usually associated with hearing loss, and there's no mention of that here.\n\nMaybe it's a vascular issue like Coats disease? That can cause abnormal blood vessels, but it's usually more asymmetric and doesn't quite match the bilateral symmetry we're seeing.\n\nOh, and what about Alström syndrome? It's rare, but it can cause retinal issues and has systemic symptoms, though none are mentioned here.\n\nWait, let's not forget about familial exudative vitreoretinopathy. It can cause avascular areas and retinal changes, but it's usually more severe and progressive.\n\nNow, considering the combination of foveal and peripheral changes, maybe we're looking at something like enhanced S-cone syndrome. It causes night blindness and retinal changes, but it's rare and might not fit perfectly.\n\nHmm, what about cone dystrophy? It affects central vision and can cause some of these retinal changes, but it's not typically associated with these specific vascular patterns.\n\nLet's think about the possibility of a retinal detachment. It can cause some of these symptoms, but it's usually more acute and not bilateral like this.\n\nOh, and there's also the idea of a developmental disorder like Walker-Warburg syndrome. It's a possibility, but it's usually associated with more systemic and neurological issues.\n\nAfter going through all of this, I think the most likely diagnosis is enhanced S-cone syndrome. It matches the combination of foveal and peripheral retinal changes, and the night blindness aspect fits too. Yeah, that seems to be the best fit given everything we've considered.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the provided information, the differential diagnoses for the 9-year-old boy's condition are as follows:\n\n1. **Best's Disease** - Known for vitelliform lesions, but the description doesn't perfectly match the findings.\n2. **Stargardt Disease** - Causes retinal mottling, but typically leads to central vision loss, which isn't the primary issue here.\n3. **Usher Syndrome** - Associated with retinal changes and hearing loss, but there's no mention of hearing issues.\n4. **Coats Disease** - Characterized by abnormal blood vessels, but usually more asymmetric than the bilateral presentation here.\n5. **Alström Syndrome** - A rare condition with retinal and systemic symptoms, though none are mentioned.\n6. **Familial Exudative Vitreoretinopathy** - Causes avascular areas and retinal changes, but typically more severe and progressive.\n7. **Enhanced S-Cone Syndrome** - Matches the combination of foveal and peripheral retinal changes, with associated night blindness.\n8. **Cone Dystrophy** - Affects central vision, but not typically associated with these vascular patterns.\n9. **Retinal Detachment** - Usually more acute and not bilateral.\n10. **Walker-Warburg Syndrome** - A developmental disorder with systemic and neurological issues, not primarily ocular.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Enhanced S-Cone Syndrome** appears to be the most likely diagnosis, given the combination of foveal and peripheral retinal changes and the aspect of night blindness.", "topic": "['Retinal Disorders', 'Pediatrics', 'Ophthalmology']"}

He had a pink macule on his left cheek at birth, which became raised and discolored around age 3 to 4 weeks. He was diagnosed with a capillary hemangioma, and propranolol was started at age 1 month with progression despite dosage increases. Topical timolol was tried without improvement; oral prednisolone decreased the size of the lesion, but was poorly tolerated and discontinued. An ophthalmic evaluation at an outside hospital was concerning for amblyopia because of anisohypermetropia, greater on the left, and a left esotropia and hypertropia. A magnetic resonance image revealed an orbital mass surrounding the left lateral rectus muscle with mass effect on the globe and extension into the eyelid, pterygopalatine fossa, and cheek. Given the risk of amblyopia, the patient underwent 2 embolization and debulking procedures of the orbital and cheek components of the lesion, which were positive for glucose transporter 1 on pathology. However, the esotropia abruptly worsened after the second debulking. At age 3 years, he presented to the clinic with a persistent cheek and orbit lesion, dense amblyopia, large-angle monocular esotropia and hypertropia, and proptosis of the left eye. The left extraocular muscle showed inability to abduct past midline (Figure 1A). A repeated magnetic resonance image showed persistent orbital involvement causing medial displacement of the lateral rectus muscle and mass effect on the globe (Figure 1B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Infantile hemangioma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 3-year-old boy with a vascular lesion on his left orbit and face. It started as a pink mark at birth and then got bigger and darker a few weeks later. That sounds like a capillary hemangioma, which is pretty common in babies. But this one's being stubborn. It didn't respond well to propranolol or timolol, and even when prednisolone worked a bit, it had to be stopped because of side effects. That's unusual.\n\nNow, there's more to consider. The eye doctor found some issues like amblyopia, anisohypermetropia, and strabismus. These are all related to how the eye is aligning and seeing, and it's likely because of the lesion's impact. The MRI showed this mass around the lateral rectus muscle, which is a key muscle for moving the eye outward. No wonder the kid can't move his eye past the midline.\n\nThe fact that the lesion was glucose transporter 1 positive is a big clue. That's typical for infantile hemangiomas. But the way it's behaving, not responding to treatment and causing all these problems, makes me think there might be something more complex going on.\n\nLet's consider other possibilities. Could it be a kaposiform hemangioendothelioma? That's a type of vascular tumor that can be more aggressive and not respond to typical treatments. Or maybe a tufted angioma? Those can be tricky too. But neither of these really fits perfectly with the glucose transporter 1 positivity.\n\nWhat about a vascular malformation like a venous malformation or an arteriovenous malformation? Those can be pretty persistent and cause significant issues, but they don't usually present like this in infants.\n\nThe lesion's behavior after the surgeries is also a red flag. The strabismus got worse after the second procedure. That suggests the lesion might be more aggressive than a typical infantile hemangioma.\n\nLet's not forget about other conditions that could involve the orbit, like lymphangiomas or even something like neurofibromatosis. But again, the glucose transporter 1 positivity keeps pointing back to an infantile hemangioma.\n\nAfter thinking it through, I'm leaning towards this being a complicated infantile hemangioma. It's not responding to treatment, it's causing significant issues, and it's glucose transporter 1 positive. But I'm also considering the possibility of a kaposiform hemangioendothelioma or a tufted angioma because of its aggressive behavior. It's a tough case, and we need to keep an open mind.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the vascular lesion in the 3-year-old boy, considering the unique aspects of the case:\n\n1. **Infantile Hemangioma** - This is the most likely diagnosis given the glucose transporter 1 positivity and the initial presentation as a capillary hemangioma.\n\n2. **Kaposiform Hemangioendothelioma** - This is considered due to the aggressive behavior and lack of response to typical treatments like propranolol.\n\n3. **Tufted Angioma** - Another possibility due to its potential for aggressive behavior, although it's less common.\n\n4. **Venous Malformation** - A type of vascular malformation that can be persistent and cause significant issues, but typically doesn't present with glucose transporter 1 positivity.\n\n5. **Arteriovenous Malformation** - Considered due to the persistent nature of the lesion and its impact on surrounding structures.\n\n6. **Lymphangioma** - Although less likely, it's considered due to orbital involvement and potential for causing similar symptoms.\n\n7. **Neurofibromatosis Type 1** - This condition can involve orbital tumors, but it doesn't fit well with the glucose transporter 1 positivity.\n\n8. **Hemangiopericytoma** - A rare vascular tumor that could present aggressively, but it's not typical in this age group.\n\n9. **Angiosarcoma** - A malignant vascular tumor, although extremely rare in young children, it's considered due to the aggressive behavior.\n\n10. **PTEN-related Vascular Anomaly** - A condition that can involve complex vascular lesions, although it's less common and not directly suggested by the glucose transporter 1 positivity.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are infantile hemangioma, kaposiform hemangioendothelioma, and tufted angioma, due to the combination of aggressive behavior, treatment resistance, and glucose transporter 1 positivity. However, the possibility of a vascular malformation or other rare vascular tumors should also be kept in mind.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Pediatrics', 'Cutaneous Vascular Malformations', 'External Eye Disease', 'Ophthalmology']"}

On physical examination, the patient had normal vital signs, mild diffuse abdominal tenderness without rebound or guarding, and bluish pigmentation along his gingival margin (Figure, panel A). Blood testing showed alanine aminotransferase level 51 U/L (0.85 μkat/L; reference range, 7-23 U/L [0.12-0.38 μkat/L]), aspartate aminotransaminase 68 U/L (1.14 μkat/L; reference range, 13-30 U/L [0.22-0.50 μkat/L]), total bilirubin 3.2 mg/dL (54.73 μmol/L; reference range, 0.4-1.5 mg/dL [6.84-25.66 μmol/L]) and direct bilirubin 0.9 mg/dL (15.39 μmol/L; reference range, 0.0-0.4 mg/dL [0.0-6.84 μmol/L]). Hemoglobin level was 8.7 g/dL with a normal mean corpuscular volume, and ferritin level was 637.9 ng/mL (reference range, 39.9-465 ng/mL). Blood testing revealed normal lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin, iron, vitamin B12, folate, zinc, and copper levels, and results of urinalysis were normal. A peripheral blood smear demonstrated small, bluish-purple punctate inclusions in erythrocytes (Figure, panel B). Results of upper and lower endoscopy and abdominal-pelvic computed tomography performed within the past 3 months were unremarkable. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Lead poisoning", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 59-year-old man who's been having this annoying diffuse abdominal pain for a while now. He's been to the ER a few times, but nothing seems to be really standing out. He's not drinking, smoking, or doing drugs, so we can probably rule out some of the usual suspects there. \n\nNow, what's really catching my eye is this bluish pigmentation on his gums. That's not something you see every day. It makes me think of something like argyria, which is when you have too much silver in your body. Silver can cause that kind of discoloration. \n\nHis liver enzymes are a bit elevated, and his bilirubin is up too. But it's mostly the indirect bilirubin that's elevated, which is interesting. That could mean there's something going on with how his body is processing bilirubin, or maybe it's related to hemolysis. But his hemoglobin is low, and the blood smear shows these tiny, bluish-purple spots in his red blood cells. Those sound like basophilic stippling, which can happen in a few different situations like lead poisoning or thalassemia. \n\nBut wait, his ferritin is really high. That's strange because if he had thalassemia, I'd expect his iron stores to be low, not high. So, thalassemia might not be the right direction. \n\nLead poisoning could explain the basophilic stippling and the high ferritin, but it doesn't really fit with the gum discoloration. Lead poisoning usually causes a bluish line on the gums, not a diffuse bluish color. \n\nSo, what about the silver? Argyria could explain the gum discoloration, but it doesn't usually cause these blood changes. Still, it's worth considering because it's such a distinctive symptom. \n\nLet's think about other possibilities. Sideroblastic anemia could cause the basophilic stippling and high ferritin, but it doesn't explain the gum color. \n\nWilson's disease? It can cause liver problems and hemolytic anemia, but it doesn't fit with the gum discoloration or the blood smear findings. \n\nMaybe it's something else entirely, like a chronic disease that's causing these symptoms in a weird way. But nothing else seems to fit as well as argyria for the gum discoloration. \n\nIn the end, even though it's not a perfect fit, argyria seems like the most likely explanation for what's going on. It's not common, but it matches the gum discoloration, and maybe the other symptoms are related in a way that's not immediately obvious.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is argyria. The bluish pigmentation along the gingival margin is a classic sign of argyria, which results from silver deposition in the body. While argyria does not typically cause the blood abnormalities seen in this patient, such as basophilic stippling and elevated ferritin, these findings could potentially be related to other factors or conditions that are not immediately apparent. Therefore, argyria remains the most fitting explanation for the distinctive gum discoloration observed in this case.\n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Argyria** - The bluish pigmentation along the gingival margin is characteristic of silver deposition in the body.\n2. **Lead Poisoning** - Could explain basophilic stippling and elevated ferritin, but typically causes a bluish line on the gums, not diffuse discoloration.\n3. **Sideroblastic Anemia** - Could cause basophilic stippling and elevated ferritin, but does not explain the gum discoloration.\n4. **Wilson's Disease** - Can cause liver problems and hemolytic anemia, but does not fit with the gum discoloration or blood smear findings.\n5. **Chronic Disease** - Could potentially cause a range of symptoms, but is less specific and does not explain the distinctive gum findings.\n6. **Hemolytic Anemia** - Could explain elevated indirect bilirubin, but does not account for the gum discoloration or basophilic stippling.\n7. **Iron Overload** - Could cause elevated ferritin, but does not explain the gum discoloration or blood smear findings.\n8. **Thalassemia** - Could cause basophilic stippling, but typically results in low iron stores, not high ferritin.\n9. **Copper Toxicity** - Can cause liver damage and hemolytic anemia, but does not fit with the gum discoloration or blood findings.\n10. **Zinc Deficiency** - Can cause various symptoms, but does not explain the specific findings in this case.", "topic": "['Complementary and Alternative Medicine', 'Gastroenterology', 'Hematology', 'Toxicology', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology']"}

After recovering from anesthesia in the postanesthesia care unit, he experienced headache, facial numbness, inability to open both his eyes, and inability to move both eyes in any direction. He had a known enhancing central skull base lesion in sella turcica with compression of the optic chiasm and mild mass effect on the pons that was felt to be a pituitary macroadenoma (Figure). His baseline examination before the cystectomy showed visual acuity of 20/20 OU with intact extraocular movements and unremarkable confrontational fields, although a mild bitemporal hemianopia was seen on automated visual fields. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Pituitary apoplexy", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 50-year-old guy who just had a long surgery for bladder cancer, and now he's got some serious eye issues. He can't move his eyes or open them, and he's got a headache and facial numbness. That's pretty concerning.\n\nFirst off, the fact that he can't move his eyes at all makes me think about something affecting the nerves that control eye movement. The cranial nerves involved are the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves. Hmm, could it be something like a stroke affecting these nerves? A brainstem stroke could definitely cause this kind of paralysis.\n\nBut wait, he's also got facial numbness. That suggests the trigeminal nerve might be involved too. This is getting more complicated. A stroke could still be possible, but it's not the only thing that could cause these symptoms.\n\nNow, let's not forget about the surgery. It was a long one, 8.5 hours, and surgeries like that can cause complications. Could this be a case of nerve compression or ischemia from being in one position too long? That's definitely something to consider.\n\nOh, and there's that pituitary macroadenoma. It's sitting there in the sella turcica, pressing on the optic chiasm. That's already causing some visual field problems. Could it have gotten worse during surgery? Maybe. If it swelled up or bled, that could affect a lot of structures nearby, including those cranial nerves.\n\nHmm, what about a cavernous sinus thrombosis? That could involve multiple cranial nerves and cause these symptoms. It's a bit of a stretch, but it's possible, especially post-surgery.\n\nLet's not forget about anesthesia-related issues. Could this be something like a total intravenous anesthesia effect? Those can sometimes cause weird neurological symptoms. But it seems less likely given the specific nerve involvement.\n\nNow, what about a subarachnoid hemorrhage? That could cause a sudden headache and affect cranial nerves. But it's usually pretty dramatic, and we don't have any mention of something like a thunderclap headache.\n\nOkay, let's think about the timing. The symptoms showed up right after surgery. That makes me think it's something related to the procedure itself, like a surgical complication or a positioning issue.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the most likely explanation is a traumatic or ischemic event affecting the cranial nerves during surgery. Maybe the positioning during the long procedure caused some kind of compression or ischemia. That seems to fit the symptoms and the timing best.\n\nBut wait, let's not completely rule out the pituitary macroadenoma. If it swelled up or bled during surgery, that could definitely cause these symptoms too. It's a close second in terms of likelihood.\n\nSo, after going through everything, I think the top two possibilities are a surgical complication like nerve compression or ischemia, and a worsening of the pituitary macroadenoma. Both make sense given the situation.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's symptoms, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Brainstem Stroke** - Given the sudden onset of ophthalmoplegia and facial numbness, a stroke affecting the brainstem where multiple cranial nerves originate is a strong consideration.\n\n2. **Pituitary Apoplexy** - The patient's known pituitary macroadenoma could have undergone apoplexy during surgery, leading to sudden expansion and compression of nearby structures, including cranial nerves.\n\n3. **Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis** - This condition could involve multiple cranial nerves and is a possibility post-surgery, especially with the proximity of the pituitary macroadenoma.\n\n4. **Surgical Positioning Injury** - The lengthy surgery could have resulted in nerve compression or ischemia due to positioning, affecting the cranial nerves responsible for eye movement.\n\n5. **Total Intravenous Anesthesia Effect** - Although less likely, anesthesia effects can sometimes result in neurological symptoms, including ophthalmoplegia.\n\n6. **Subarachnoid Hemorrhage** - A sudden headache and neurological deficits could suggest a subarachnoid hemorrhage, but the absence of a thunderclap headache makes this less probable.\n\n7. **Diabetes Insipidus** - While primarily affecting water balance, in the context of a pituitary adenoma, diabetes insipidus could contribute to the clinical picture, especially with headache and visual disturbances.\n\n8. **Hypothalamic Dysfunction** - The close proximity of the hypothalamus to the pituitary could result in dysfunction affecting cranial nerves and causing some of the symptoms.\n\n9. **Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis** - This could involve cranial nerves and lead to symptoms like headache and ophthalmoplegia, especially in the postoperative setting.\n\n10. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension** - Although less directly related, increased intracranial pressure could exacerbate symptoms, particularly headache and visual changes.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top two most likely diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Surgical Positioning Injury** - The symptoms and timing strongly suggest a nerve compression or ischemia event related to surgical positioning.\n2. **Pituitary Apoplexy** - The known pituitary macroadenoma could have worsened during surgery, causing sudden compression of cranial nerves and resultant symptoms.\n\nThese two possibilities best fit the clinical presentation and the context of recent surgery.", "topic": "['Neurology', 'Oncology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Surgery', 'Surgical Oncology']"}

She was initially evaluated at an outside institution and was found to have bilateral symmetric vision loss with nyctalopia. The onset of the symptoms was unknown. At that time, her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/70 OU. The patient did not receive any ophthalmological care until 2 years later, when she was seen for marked vision loss and was noted to have a BCVA of light perception in both eyes. When she presented to the pediatric retina service, she demonstrated poor mentation and was unable to recall simple things such as the name of her siblings. Her BCVA was light perception. Her pupils were round and reactive. The anterior segment examination and intraocular pressures were within normal limits. Fundus autofluorescence disclosed attenuated, narrow vasculature and diffuse peripheral patchy hypoautofluorescence (Figure 1A). Color fundus photography showed optic disc pallor, attenuated retinal vasculature, prominent choroidal markings, and central retinal atrophy with diffusely mottled pigmentation (Figure 1B). Optical coherence tomography displayed decreased retinal thickness, more prominent in the inner layers, and hyper-reflective dots in the outer retinal layers.

We've got a 9-year-old girl with progressive vision loss. That's pretty concerning. She's also got a history of neonatal seizures, which might be important. Hmm, she was found to have bilateral vision loss and nyctalopia, which means night vision problems. That's a big clue. Her visual acuity has dropped a lot over time, from 20/70 to just light perception. That's a significant change.\n\nOkay, let's look at the fundus findings. There's optic disc pallor, attenuated vasculature, and those prominent choroidal markings. Plus, there's central retinal atrophy and mottled pigmentation. These are classic signs of a retinal issue. The OCT shows decreased retinal thickness, especially in the inner layers, and some hyper-reflective dots in the outer layers. That's interesting.\n\nNow, let's think about what this could be. Retinitis pigmentosa comes to mind first. It's known for causing night blindness and progressive vision loss, and it can have that characteristic bone spicule pigmentation. But wait, the family history doesn't quite fit. The grandmother had unilateral vision loss, which is odd for RP, which is usually bilateral.\n\nLet's consider other possibilities. Could it be cone-rod dystrophy? It causes central vision loss and can have similar fundus findings. But, it typically starts with decreased central vision rather than night blindness. Hmm, not a perfect fit.\n\nWhat about Usher syndrome? It combines RP with hearing loss, but there's no mention of hearing issues here. So, probably not that.\n\nLeber congenital amaurosis could be another option. It causes severe vision loss early in life, and the fundus findings could match. But, it usually presents much earlier, and the progression here seems slower.\n\nOh, and Usher syndrome type II has a later onset than type I, but still, no hearing loss is mentioned. So, it's less likely.\n\nLet's not forget about Bardet-Biedl syndrome. It has retinal dystrophy along with other systemic features, but there's no mention of those here. So, probably not.\n\nWait, what about neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis? It can cause vision loss and cognitive decline, which fits with her poor mentation and memory issues. The fundus findings could match too, with the attenuated vasculature and optic disc pallor.\n\nSo, putting it all together, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis seems like the best fit. It explains the vision loss, the cognitive issues, and the fundus findings. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 9-year-old girl with progressive vision loss:\n\n1. **Retinitis Pigmentosa** - This condition is known for causing night blindness and progressive vision loss, with characteristic fundus findings such as bone spicule pigmentation.\n\n2. **Cone-Rod Dystrophy** - This condition typically causes decreased central vision and can have similar fundus findings, but it usually starts with central vision loss rather than night blindness.\n\n3. **Usher Syndrome** - This syndrome combines retinitis pigmentosa with hearing loss, but there is no mention of hearing issues in this case.\n\n4. **Leber Congenital Amaurosis** - This condition causes severe vision loss early in life and could match the fundus findings, but it usually presents much earlier than the age of 9.\n\n5. **Usher Syndrome Type II** - Similar to Usher syndrome, but with a later onset; however, the absence of hearing loss makes it less likely.\n\n6. **Bardet-Biedl Syndrome** - This syndrome includes retinal dystrophy along with other systemic features, but there is no mention of these features in the case.\n\n7. **Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis** - This condition can cause vision loss and cognitive decline, which fits with the girl's poor mentation and memory issues, along with the fundus findings.\n\n8. **Stargardt Disease** - An inherited juvenile macular degeneration that could cause progressive vision loss, but typically starts with central vision loss.\n\n9. **Best Disease** - Characterized by yellow lesions in the macula, but the fundus findings do not match this description.\n\n10. **Alström Syndrome** - Includes retinal dystrophy and other systemic abnormalities, but there is no mention of these in the case.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis** seems to be the most fitting diagnosis, as it explains the vision loss, cognitive decline, and fundus findings.", "topic": "['Genetics and Genomics', 'Ophthalmology', 'Pediatrics', 'Retinal Disorders', 'Neurology']"}

We've got a 67-year-old man who's come in with some pretty specific symptoms. He's got pain and redness in his left eye and ear, and he's been coughing for a month. Plus, he's lost 9 kg over the past three months. That's quite a bit of weight. \n\nFirst off, the eye and ear symptoms are really catching my attention. Pain and redness in those areas could mean something inflammatory. I'm thinking about conditions that affect the eyes and ears. Relapsing polychondritis comes to mind because it's known for causing cartilage inflammation, especially in the ears and nose. \n\nNow, let's not forget the cough and weight loss. Those could be hinting at something going on in the lungs or maybe even a systemic issue. Sarcoidosis is a possibility here because it can affect the lungs and cause systemic symptoms like weight loss. \n\nBut wait, there's more to consider. The weight loss is significant, and when you combine that with a cough, I have to think about the possibility of a malignancy. Lung cancer could present with these symptoms, especially if there's some kind of paraneoplastic syndrome involved. \n\nHmm, what about autoimmune disorders? They can be tricky because they often have diverse symptoms. Rheumatoid arthritis could fit, especially with the eye and potential lung involvement. \n\nOh, and Wegener's granulomatosis, or granulomatosis with polyangiitis, is another one to think about. It can affect the respiratory tract and have systemic manifestations. \n\nNow, let's not jump to conclusions too fast. We should also consider infections. Tuberculosis can cause cough and weight loss, and it might explain some of the systemic symptoms. \n\nBut, wait a minute, let's go back to the eye and ear symptoms. They're really specific, and relapsing polychondritis is still a strong contender because it matches those symptoms so well. \n\nAlso, I should think about other autoimmune conditions like lupus. It can have a wide range of symptoms, including those affecting the eyes and lungs. \n\nAnd then there's polyarteritis nodosa. It's a vasculitis that can cause systemic symptoms and might explain the weight loss and cough. \n\nOkay, let's wrap this up. After considering everything, relapsing polychondritis seems like the most likely diagnosis. It fits the eye and ear symptoms perfectly, and it can have some systemic involvement. But I'm also keeping Wegener's granulomatosis and polyarteritis nodosa on the list because they could explain the broader range of symptoms. \n\nSo, in order, I'd say relapsing polychondritis is the top suspect, followed by Wegener's granulomatosis, polyarteritis nodosa, sarcoidosis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, lung cancer, tuberculosis, and then maybe some other possibilities like syphilis or even multiple sclerosis. That seems to cover all the bases.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the symptoms and history provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient:\n\n1. **Relapsing Polychondritis** - This condition is characterized by cartilage inflammation, which aligns with the patient's eye and ear symptoms.\n\n2. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegener's Granulomatosis)** - This can affect the respiratory tract and have systemic manifestations, explaining the cough and weight loss.\n\n3. **Polyarteritis Nodosa** - A vasculitis that can cause systemic symptoms, including weight loss and cough.\n\n4. **Sarcoidosis** - Can affect the lungs and cause systemic symptoms like weight loss, potentially explaining the respiratory and systemic findings.\n\n5. **Rheumatoid Arthritis** - Although primarily a joint condition, it can have ocular and pulmonary involvement, fitting some of the patient's symptoms.\n\n6. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus** - A systemic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs, including the eyes and lungs.\n\n7. **Lung Cancer** - Could present with cough and significant weight loss, possibly with paraneoplastic syndromes affecting the eyes and ears.\n\n8. **Tuberculosis** - An infectious disease that can cause cough, weight loss, and potentially other systemic symptoms.\n\n9. **Syphilis** - A systemic infection that can have varied manifestations, including ocular and systemic symptoms.\n\n10. **Multiple Sclerosis** - Although primarily neurological, it can have uncommon presentations that might align with some of the patient's symptoms.\n\nThese diagnoses are ordered based on how well they explain the combination of symptoms, with relapsing polychondritis being the most likely given the specific eye and ear involvement.

But, she's 88, and this condition is more common in younger people, so maybe it's not the best fit.\n\nHmm, what about vitelliform macular dystrophy? Those hyperreflective foci on her OCT could be a clue. They look like vitelliform material, and that's a hallmark of this condition. Plus, the pattern of her symptoms and the autofluorescence findings are making me think of this.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. We should also think about polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy. It can cause pigment epithelial detachments and doesn't always show leakage on angiography, which fits her case. It's also more common in older adults, so that lines up too.\n\nOh, and what about idiopathic choroidal neovascularization? It's another possibility, especially since she's had so many treatments without improvement. But, we don't have clear evidence of new vessel growth, so maybe it's less likely.\n\nNow, let's not forget about pattern dystrophy. The dispersed, speckled hyperautofluorescence could point to this. It's a broader category that includes several conditions, and her age could make this more likely.\n\nAlright, let's put it all together. Based on everything we've seen, I think the top contender is vitelliform macular dystrophy. The OCT findings, the autofluorescence patterns, and her age all support this. Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy is a close second, given the PEDs and lack of leakage. Age-related macular degeneration is still a possibility, but the treatment resistance makes me think it's less likely. Central serous chorioretinopathy seems less probable due to her age. And idiopathic choroidal neovascularization, while possible, doesn't have strong enough evidence. Pattern dystrophy rounds out the list, as it could explain some of the findings, but isn't as strong a fit as the others.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step presenting a unique potential diagnosis:\n\n1. **Vitelliform Macular Dystrophy**  \n2. **Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy**  \n3. **Age-related Macular Degeneration**  \n4. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy**  \n5. **Idiopathic Choroidal Neovascularization**  \n6. **Pattern Dystrophy**  \n7. **Choroidal Melanoma**  \n8. **Metastatic Choroidal Tumors**  \n9. **Optical Coherence Tomography Artifact**  \n10. **Drusenoid Pigment Epithelial Detachment**\n\nAfter considering all the patient's symptoms, test results, and the persistence of subretinal fluid and enlarging pigment epithelial detachments despite treatment, the top differential diagnosis is **Vitelliform Macular Dystrophy**. This is supported by the presence of hyperreflective foci suggestive of vitelliform material on OCT and the specific pattern seen on autofluorescence imaging. **Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy** is a close second, given the characteristics of the pigment epithelial detachments and the lack of leakage on angiography. **Age-related Macular Degeneration** remains a possibility, but the resistance to treatment makes it less likely. The other conditions, while considered, are less consistent with the presented findings.", "topic": "['Oncology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Retinal Disorders', 'Hematology']"}

A fine-needle biopsy of an enlarged left-sided cervical lymph node yielded benign results. One month later, he presented to a local emergency department with diffuse abdominal pain. Symptoms began 6 weeks earlier and had been intermittent in nature. He had also experienced fatigue, night sweats, decreased appetite, and weight loss for 6 weeks. He otherwise denied having fevers, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or easy bruising. Physical examination revealed bilateral cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymphadenopathy in addition to mild diffuse abdominal pain. Laboratory results revealed a hemoglobin level of 13.1 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10), a white blood cell count of 6.4 × 103/μL, and a platelet count of 404 × 103/μL  (to convert to × 109/L, multiply by 1) in addition to negative results for HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C assays. Additional workup results were notable for elevated levels of interleukin (IL) 10 (1091 pg/mL), IL-6 (3.1 pg/mL), C-reactive protein (4.9 mg/dL [to convert to mg/L, multiply by 10]), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (79 mm/h). A computed tomography scan of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis further revealed extensive cervical, supraclavicular, retroperitoneal, pelvic, and inguinal lymphadenopathy, with extensive inflammation and fat stranding adjacent to these enlarged nodes. Positron emission tomography–computed tomography further demonstrated fluorodeoxyglucose-avid lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm. The patient then underwent excisional biopsy of an enlarged right cervical lymph node (Figure). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Multicentric Castleman disease", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a man in his 70s with a history of mitral valve repair, and he's been found to have cervical lymphadenopathy. That's a bit concerning. Lymphadenopathy can be due to a lot of things, so let's start with the basics. Infectious mononucleosis is a common cause, but he's not young, and there are no fever or sore throat symptoms, so that's probably not it. Hmm, what about tuberculosis? It can cause lymphadenopathy, but there's no cough or weight loss mentioned specifically related to TB, and he's not from a high-risk area, so maybe not.\n\nNow, let's think about lymphomas. This guy has lymph nodes enlarged all over—cervical, axillary, inguinal. That's pretty widespread. And he's got these systemic symptoms like night sweats and weight loss. That's classic 'B' symptoms for lymphoma. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma could definitely be on the table. But wait, there's more. He's got elevated IL-10 and IL-6. Those are inflammatory markers, and they're through the roof. That's pointing towards something more than just a simple infection.\n\nOh, and the imaging shows these lymph nodes are FDG-avid on PET-CT. That means they're metabolically active, which is something you see with cancers, especially aggressive ones. So, lymphoma is still a strong contender. But let's not forget about other possibilities. Castleman disease can also cause widespread lymphadenopathy and has those same systemic symptoms. It's rare, but it fits the bill.\n\nNow, what about autoimmune disorders? Rheumatoid arthritis or lupus could cause lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms, but they usually have other specific symptoms or blood markers that aren't mentioned here. So, they seem less likely.\n\nLet's not forget about metastatic cancer. It can cause lymphadenopathy, but usually, you'd have a known primary cancer or more specific symptoms. There's nothing here to strongly suggest that.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a strong possibility, but Castleman disease is also a good fit. The lab results and imaging are key here. The inflammatory markers are really high, and the PET-CT shows widespread activity. Castleman disease can cause that kind of systemic inflammation. Hmm, I think Castleman disease might actually be the best fit for this patient. It explains the lymphadenopathy, the systemic symptoms, and the lab findings. Yeah, that seems to make the most sense.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnosis for this patient can be developed as follows:\n\n1. **Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma** - Given the widespread lymphadenopathy, systemic symptoms like night sweats and weight loss, and the metabolic activity seen on PET-CT, non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a strong contender.\n\n2. **Castleman Disease** - This condition can cause widespread lymphadenopathy, systemic symptoms, and elevated inflammatory markers, making it a good fit for this patient's presentation.\n\n3. **Tuberculosis** - Although less likely due to the lack of specific symptoms like cough or fever, tuberculosis can cause lymphadenopathy and should be considered.\n\n4. **Metastatic Cancer** - While it can cause lymphadenopathy, the absence of a known primary cancer or specific symptoms makes this less likely.\n\n5. **Rheumatoid Arthritis** - This autoimmune disorder can cause lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms, but usually, there are other specific findings or blood markers present.\n\n6. **Infectious Mononucleosis** - Although it's more common in younger individuals, it can cause lymphadenopathy, but the lack of fever or sore throat makes it less likely.\n\n7. **HIV-associated Lymphoma** - Despite the negative HIV test, this could have been considered if the test was recent or if there were other risk factors.\n\n8. **Sarcoidosis** - This can cause lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms, but usually, there are pulmonary symptoms or other specific findings.\n\n9. **Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome** - A rare condition that can cause lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms, but it's more common in younger individuals.\n\n10. **Kaposi Sarcoma** - Although unlikely given the negative HIV test, it can cause lymphadenopathy and should be considered in the differential.\n\nAfter considering all the information, Castleman disease emerges as the most likely diagnosis due to the combination of widespread lymphadenopathy, systemic symptoms, and significantly elevated inflammatory markers. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma remains a close second in the differential diagnosis.", "topic": "['Geriatrics', 'Hematology', 'Oncology', 'Hematologic Cancer']"}

Punch biopsy of a lesion from the chest was sent for histopathological examination (Figure, B and C). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Metastatic carcinoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her 40s with these painful red plaques on her trunk. They've been there for a couple of months and are spreading. That's definitely something to pay attention to. She's also having abdominal discomfort, losing weight, and experiencing vaginal bleeding. That's quite a mix of symptoms.\n\nNow, there's this solid mass in her lower abdomen that she's had for about 10 years, but it's gotten bigger recently. That's a red flag. A rapidly growing mass is always concerning. Could it be related to her skin issues?\n\nLet's look at the skin lesions. They're erythematous plaques, and they're painful. That's interesting. Painful plaques could mean a few things. Maybe something inflammatory or even neoplastic. I should consider conditions that cause painful skin lesions.\n\nFirst, I'm thinking about Sweet's syndrome. It's known for painful plaques and can be associated with systemic symptoms. It's a strong contender right now.\n\nBut wait, there's also the abdominal mass. It's been stable for years but is now growing. That's suspicious. Could it be an ovarian tumor? Ovarian tumors can cause a range of symptoms, including abdominal discomfort and changes in menstrual bleeding.\n\nI should also think about how the mass and skin lesions might be connected. Maybe it's a paraneoplastic syndrome. These syndromes can cause skin changes in response to internal cancers.\n\nErythema nodosum comes to mind too. It causes painful skin nodules and can be linked to systemic diseases, including cancers. It's another possibility.\n\nNow, let's not forget the histopathology. The biopsy might give us more clues. If it shows neutrophilic infiltrates, that could point to Sweet's syndrome. But if there are other findings, maybe something more like a lupus-related rash?\n\nI should also consider lupus profundus. It causes painful plaques and can be part of systemic lupus erythematosus, which might explain some of her symptoms.\n\nBut what about that abdominal mass? If it's an ovarian tumor, it could be a granulosa cell tumor. These can produce hormones, leading to changes like vaginal bleeding.\n\nHmm, I should also think about other hormone-related issues. Could it be Meigs' syndrome? That's when an ovarian tumor causes ascites and pleural effusion, leading to abdominal discomfort.\n\nLet's not forget about gastrointestinal issues. Maybe the mass is affecting nearby organs, causing her abdominal symptoms. Could it be a gastrointestinal stromal tumor?\n\nOh, and there's also the possibility of a desmoid tumor. These can cause abdominal masses and skin changes, especially if they're part of a syndrome like Gardner's syndrome.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top differential diagnosis is Sweet's syndrome. It fits the painful plaques and systemic symptoms. But I'm also considering ovarian granulosa cell tumor, erythema nodosum, lupus profundus, Meigs' syndrome, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and desmoid tumor as possibilities. Each of these could explain some or all of her symptoms.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with a focus on one potential diagnosis per step, without repetition:\n\n1. **Sweet's Syndrome** - Characterized by painful erythematous plaques and systemic symptoms, which aligns with the patient's skin lesions and overall symptoms.\n\n2. **Ovarian Granulosa Cell Tumor** - This could explain the abdominal mass, hormonal changes leading to vaginal bleeding, and systemic symptoms.\n\n3. **Erythema Nodosum** - Known for painful skin nodules and associations with systemic diseases, including malignancies, which fits the skin and systemic symptoms.\n\n4. **Lupus Profundus** - Causes painful plaques and can be part of systemic lupus erythematosus, potentially explaining the skin and systemic symptoms.\n\n5. **Meigs' Syndrome** - Involves an ovarian tumor leading to ascites and pleural effusion, which could cause abdominal discomfort and other symptoms.\n\n6. **Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor** - Could explain the abdominal mass and related symptoms if the mass is affecting nearby organs.\n\n7. **Desmoid Tumor** - Can cause abdominal masses and skin changes, especially in syndromes like Gardner's syndrome.\n\n8. **Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma** - A type of ovarian cancer that could explain the abdominal mass and systemic symptoms.\n\n9. **Pseudomyxoma Peritonei** - A condition causing abdominal distension and discomfort, potentially related to an ovarian tumor.\n\n10. **Gorlin Syndrome** - A genetic syndrome that could explain the skin and abdominal findings if there are associated desmoid tumors or other manifestations.\n\nAfter considering all the information and test results, the top differential diagnosis is **Sweet's Syndrome**, given the painful erythematous plaques and systemic symptoms. However, **Ovarian Granulosa Cell Tumor** and **Erythema Nodosum** are also strong contenders, as they could explain the abdominal mass and skin symptoms, respectively.

His medical history comprised unexplained sensory hearing loss, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis. At age 23 years, he had bilateral cataract surgery, and over the last 2 years, he developed worsening stiffness and walking difficulties with frequent falls. He reported features of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome (RLS), visual daytime hallucinations, and rapid cognitive decline. He was given levodopa/benserazide (up to 200 mg/50 mg 4 times daily) without improvement on his Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale scores. Therefore, his dopaminergic medication was ceased. Family history was negative for movement or developmental disorders. His neurologic examination showed hypomimia, symmetrical bradykinesia, and rigidity of the extremities without tremors (Video). There was full range of eye movements with large-amplitude saccadic intrusions on smooth pursuit in all directions. Neuropsychological assessment revealed significant abnormalities in cognitive functioning, affecting verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills (ie, speed of information processing, visuospatial skills, verbal and visual memory loss, executive skills). Mini-Mental Status Examination score was 26 of 30 points. Systemic examination was unremarkable. Laboratory and cerebral spinal fluid testing (ie, paraneoplastic antibodies Hu, Yo, Ri, CV2, Ma2, amphiphysin, glutamic acid decarboxylase, N-methyl-d-aspartic acid, LGI1, and Caspr2, 14-3-3 protein) were normal. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed mild frontal and parietal atrophy. An electroencephalogram demonstrated slowing in keeping with moderate generalized encephalopathy. Total-body positron emission tomography (PET) using fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) as a tracer showed no FDG-avid lesions; however, a subsequent brain-specific FDG-PET/MRI revealed hypometabolism throughout the left cerebral hemisphere and crossed cerebellar diaschisis (Figure 1). As the patient’s cognitive function and parkinsonism had deteriorated rapidly, a brain biopsy of the left frontal cortex was done. Immunohistochemistry showed scattered globular inclusions consistent with Lewy bodies. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Autosomal recessive parkinsonism", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 44-year-old man who's been having a tough time with symptoms that seem to be getting worse. He's got this stiffness and walking difficulties, and he's falling a lot. That's definitely concerning. Plus, he's having these vivid dreams that seem all too real, which makes me think of REM sleep behavior disorder. And then there are these visual hallucinations during the day. That's a lot to take in.\n\nNow, he's been given levodopa, which usually helps with Parkinson's, but it didn't do much for him. That's a red flag that we might not be dealing with straightforward Parkinson's disease. So, what else could it be? Let's see.\n\nFirst off, the combination of cognitive decline, hallucinations, and poor response to levodopa makes me think of Dementia with Lewy Bodies. It's known for these kinds of symptoms. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet.\n\nThe brain biopsy showed Lewy bodies, which are a big hint. They're a hallmark of both Parkinson's disease and Dementia with Lewy Bodies. But the fact that his symptoms didn't improve with levodopa makes me lean more towards Dementia with Lewy Bodies.\n\nOh, and there's the MRI showing some frontal and parietal atrophy. That could fit with a neurodegenerative disease. And the PET scan shows hypometabolism in the left cerebral hemisphere. That's interesting and could indicate some sort of degenerative process affecting one side of the brain more than the other.\n\nNow, let's think about other possibilities. Could it be something like Progressive Supranuclear Palsy? That often comes with balance problems and falls, but it usually has some specific eye movement issues, which aren't mentioned here. So, maybe not.\n\nWhat about Corticobasal Degeneration? It can cause movement problems and cognitive decline, and it might fit with the asymmetric findings on the PET scan. That's something to consider.\n\nWe should also think about Alzheimer's disease. It's a common cause of dementia, but the presence of Lewy bodies and the type of symptoms he's having make it less likely. Plus, Alzheimer's doesn't usually come with REM sleep behavior disorder.\n\nMultiple System Atrophy could be another option. It can have parkinsonism and autonomic features, but we don't have any mention of autonomic problems here, so it seems less likely.\n\nAnd then there's Frontotemporal Dementia. It can cause personality changes and cognitive decline, but it doesn't usually come with the movement problems he's having. So, that's probably not it.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Considering everything—the symptoms, the biopsy results, the imaging—Dementia with Lewy Bodies seems like the most likely diagnosis. But we can't completely rule out something like Corticobasal Degeneration, given the asymmetric brain findings. It's a complex case, and we need to keep an open mind.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for this 44-year-old man is Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). The presence of Lewy bodies on brain biopsy, combined with symptoms such as progressive parkinsonism, REM sleep behavior disorder, visual hallucinations, and rapid cognitive decline, strongly points towards DLB. The poor response to levodopa further supports this diagnosis, as DLB typically shows limited or no improvement with dopaminergic treatment. While other conditions like Corticobasal Degeneration and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy could be considered, the specific combination of symptoms and biopsy findings makes Dementia with Lewy Bodies the most fitting diagnosis. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Dementia with Lewy Bodies** - The presence of Lewy bodies, cognitive decline, visual hallucinations, REM sleep behavior disorder, and poor response to levodopa are characteristic of DLB.\n2. **Corticobasal Degeneration** - Considered due to the asymmetric findings on PET scan and the combination of movement and cognitive symptoms, but it is less likely given the specific symptoms and biopsy results.\n3. **Progressive Supranuclear Palsy** - Characterized by balance problems and falls, but typically involves specific eye movement abnormalities not mentioned here.\n4. **Alzheimer's Disease** - While it's a common cause of dementia, the presence of Lewy bodies and the symptom profile make it less likely.\n5. **Multiple System Atrophy** - Parksinsonism and autonomic features are typical, but the absence of autonomic symptoms makes it less likely.\n6. **Frontotemporal Dementia** - Usually involves personality changes and cognitive decline without prominent movement symptoms.\n7. **Parkinson's Disease** - The poor response to levodopa and presence of cognitive decline and hallucinations make this less likely.\n8. **Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus** - Typically involves gait disturbance, incontinence, and cognitive decline, which doesn't match this case.\n9. **Vascular Parkinsonism** - Involves gait disturbance and cognitive decline due to vascular causes, but the biopsy findings don't support this.\n10. **Drug-Induced Parkinsonism** - There is no mention of medication use that could cause parkinsonism, making this unlikely.", "topic": "['Movement Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Parkinson Disease']"}

A physical examination revealed no erythema or tenderness of the parotid. Her cranial nerves were intact, specifically the right facial nerve and its branches. The oral mucosa was intact with no epithelial lesions. Urinalysis results revealed slight hematuria. Her international normalized ratio (INR) was 4.4.

A follow-up CT was performed 6 weeks later (Figure, B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Parotid gland hemorrhage", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. A 53-year-old woman comes in with swelling around her right ear and upper neck. That's interesting. She's got a history of coronary artery disease and has been on warfarin after a heart attack. Hmm, warfarin can cause bleeding issues, so that's something to keep in mind. She doesn't have any cancer history, which is good, but she did used to smoke. That's a risk factor for a lot of things.\n\nNow, let's see what the physical exam says. No redness or pain in the parotid area, that's a relief. Her facial nerves are working fine, and there's nothing weird in her mouth. That's good to know because it rules out some things like a parotid tumor or infection.\n\nOh, her INR is 4.4. That's pretty high, meaning her blood is thinner than it should be. With warfarin, that's not too surprising, but it does make bleeding more likely. And there's slight hematuria. Could be related, could be something else.\n\nThe CT scan shows an ill-defined mass in the deep lobe of the right parotid gland. It's spreading into nearby tissues. That sounds serious. It could be a tumor, maybe malignant. But wait, let's not jump to conclusions.\n\nOkay, so what could this be? First thought, a parotid tumor. They're common in this area, and with her history, it's a possibility. But let's not stop there.\n\nWarfarin can cause bleeding, so maybe it's a hematoma. That would explain the swelling and the high INR. But would a hematoma look like an infiltrative mass on a CT? Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWhat about a benign tumor like a pleomorphic adenoma? They can be in the deep lobe and might look like this on a scan. But they're usually not aggressive, so the infiltration is odd.\n\nCould it be a metastasis? She doesn't have a cancer history, but you never know. Maybe something from an unknown primary source. That's a possibility.\n\nOh, let's not forget about infections. A parotid abscess could cause swelling, but there's no redness or pain. And the CT doesn't really show fluid, so that's less likely.\n\nHow about a lymphatic malformation? Those can be infiltrative, but they're rare in adults. Still, it's something to consider.\n\nNow, let's think about nerve sheath tumors. They can be infiltrative and are in the right area. That's a strong possibility.\n\nWhat about a sarcoma? Those are aggressive and infiltrative, which matches the CT findings. That's definitely something to consider.\n\nAnd finally, let's not forget about a branchial cleft cyst. They can be in the upper neck and might look like this on a scan. It's a long shot, but it's possible.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top possibility is a nerve sheath tumor. It fits the location and the infiltrative nature on the CT. A sarcoma is a close second, given the aggressive appearance. And a metastasis is still on the list, just in case.

The patient denied any history of dysphagia, dysphonia, drainage, previous neck surgery, trauma, or recent fever. There was no significant medical or family history of thyroid disease. On examination, the mass moved with swallowing. The patient had normal thyroid stimulating hormone and calcium levels and a parathyroid hormone (PTH) level of 63 pg/mL. Neck ultrasonography revealed a well-circumscribed anechoic lesion with a diameter of 5.9 cm in the right thyroid lobe without any internal solid nodularity or septation. A neck computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an intrathyroidal lesion extending inferiorly to 3 cm above the angle of Louis causing tracheal compression and displacement (Figure, A). The patient underwent right hemithyroidectomy to relieve tracheal compression. A near-infrared autofluorescence (NIRAF) camera yielded a homogenously dim lesion (Figure, B). Pathologic examination confirmed a normal right thyroid lobe, a normal right parathyroid gland, and a cystic lesion at the inferior pole with no evidence of malignant disease in the specimen. The tissue inside the lesion stained positive for PTH. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Parathyroid cyst", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an 18-year-old guy with a neck mass that's been growing slowly over four months. It's painless, and he hasn't mentioned any trouble swallowing or changes in his voice. That's interesting because it suggests it's not causing too much disruption. Plus, there's no history of surgery, trauma, or recent illness, which might rule out some inflammatory or post-traumatic causes.\n\nNow, when I hear that the mass moves with swallowing, my first thought is the thyroid. Thyroglossal duct cysts can do this, but they're usually more midline. This one's on the right side, so maybe it's something else related to the thyroid.\n\nThe lab results are pretty normal. His thyroid function tests are fine, and his calcium levels are normal too. But, his parathyroid hormone level is a bit elevated at 63 pg/mL. That's curious. It's not super high, but it's something to note. Could this be related to a parathyroid issue?\n\nThe ultrasound shows a well-circumscribed anechoic lesion, which sounds like a cyst. It's in the right thyroid lobe and there's no solid part or septation, so it doesn't look suspicious for cancer. But, it's 5.9 cm, which is pretty big. No wonder it's causing some compression.\n\nThe CT scan gives us more info. The lesion is intrathyroidal and extends down towards the chest, causing the trachea to shift. That's probably why they decided to do surgery to relieve the pressure.\n\nDuring surgery, they used a special camera that shows autofluorescence, and this lesion was dim. That's a bit unusual because thyroid tissue usually lights up. So, this could be something else.\n\nAfter the surgery, the pathologist finds that the thyroid and parathyroid tissues are normal, but there's a cystic lesion at the bottom that stains positive for parathyroid hormone. Hmm, that's interesting. It suggests that this cyst might be related to the parathyroid, even though it's not a typical adenoma.\n\nSo, what could this be? At first, I thought about a thyroglossal duct cyst, but it's not midline and doesn't fit perfectly. Then, I considered a branchial cleft cyst, but those usually don't move with swallowing. A parathyroid cyst seemed possible because of the PTH staining, but it's not a typical presentation.\n\nCould it be a thyroid nodule? They can be cystic, but the PTH staining is unusual for that. What about a paratracheal cyst? Those can be related to the thyroid or parathyroid, but they don't usually have PTH in them.\n\nI'm also thinking about an ectopic parathyroid gland. That could explain the PTH staining, but it's not a classic cyst.\n\nMaybe it's a cystic parathyroid adenoma. That would explain the PTH levels and the cystic nature, but it's rare for them to be this big and intrathyroidal.\n\nUltimately, I think the most likely explanation is a parathyroid cyst. It matches the PTH staining and the cystic nature, even if it's not a textbook case. But, I'm keeping an open mind because this is a pretty unusual presentation.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the neck mass, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst** - Although typically midline, it can present off-center and move with swallowing.\n2. **Branchial Cleft Cyst** - Common in the lateral neck, but usually doesn't move with swallowing.\n3. **Parathyroid Cyst** - The positive PTH staining supports this, despite it being an atypical presentation.\n4. **Thyroid Nodule** - Can be cystic, but PTH staining is unusual for thyroid tissue.\n5. **Paratracheal Cyst** - Could be related to thyroid or parathyroid, but PTH staining is atypical.\n6. **Ectopic Parathyroid Gland** - Could explain PTH staining, but not typically cystic.\n7. **Cystic Parathyroid Adenoma** - Matches PTH levels and cystic nature, though rare and atypically large.\n8. **Lateral Thyroid Nodule** - Could be a thyroid lesion extending laterally.\n9. **Thymic Cyst** - Though rare in this location, could be considered given the cystic nature.\n10. **Dermoid Cyst** - Less likely, but could be a congenital cystic lesion in the neck.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the most likely diagnosis is a **Parathyroid Cyst**. This diagnosis aligns with the cystic nature of the mass, the positive PTH staining, and the location, despite being an unusual presentation. However, the atypical features highlight the complexity of the case, and clinical correlation with further investigation may be necessary for definitive diagnosis.", "topic": "['Adolescent Medicine', 'Endocrinology', 'Diabetes and Endocrinology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Head and Neck Surgery']"}

Visual acuity was 20/20 OU, with briskly reactive pupils OU and no relative afferent pupillary defect. Intraocular pressure was 17 mm Hg OU. Ishihara color plates were 13/13 OU. Extraocular movements were full. Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed blurring and elevation of the nasal margins of the optic disc consistent with grade 1 optic disc edema in both eyes (Figure).

Automated visual fields demonstrated subtle enlargement of the blind spots. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes) syndrome", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 23-year-old woman who's been dealing with some pretty uncomfortable symptoms for the past six months. She's experiencing intermittent pain behind her eyes, and that's not all. She's also seeing blurry vision and these wavy lines, which sounds quite distressing. And if that wasn't enough, she's got numbness and tingling in her hands and legs. That's a lot to unpack.\n\nFirst off, the eye pain and vision issues make me think about optic neuritis. It's a condition that often causes pain with eye movement and vision problems, and it's something that can definitely cause optic disc edema, which she has. Plus, it's common in young women, so that fits.\n\nBut wait, there's more to consider. The numbness and tingling in her extremities are important clues. These symptoms make me think of conditions that affect the nervous system more broadly. Multiple sclerosis comes to mind because it can cause both optic neuritis and sensory disturbances like the ones she's experiencing.\n\nNow, let's not jump to conclusions just yet. There are other possibilities. Could this be related to a vitamin deficiency? Like vitamin B12 deficiency, which can cause neuropathy and affect the optic nerve? It's possible, but usually, there are other symptoms like anemia or more severe neurological signs.\n\nHmm, what about diabetes? It can cause neuropathy, but typically, you'd expect more systemic symptoms, and the optic disc edema isn't as common in diabetes without other significant findings.\n\nOh, and there's idiopathic intracranial hypertension. That can cause optic disc edema and vision problems, and it's associated with headaches, which could explain the retro-orbital pain. Plus, it's more common in young, overweight women, which fits her profile.\n\nBut let's not forget about other inflammatory conditions like sarcoidosis. It can cause optic nerve issues and neuropathy, but we'd usually see more systemic symptoms or abnormalities on an MRI.\n\nOkay, so where does that leave us? Considering everything, multiple sclerosis seems like a strong contender because it ties together the optic neuritis and the sensory symptoms. But idiopathic intracranial hypertension is also a possibility given the optic disc edema and her demographic profile.\n\nIn the end, after weighing all the evidence, I think multiple sclerosis is the most likely diagnosis. It just fits well with the combination of her symptoms and the test results. But we should definitely keep idiopathic intracranial hypertension on the radar too.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the symptoms and examination findings, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient:\n\n1. **Optic Neuritis** - This condition is characterized by pain with eye movement and vision loss, which aligns with the patient's symptoms.\n2. **Multiple Sclerosis** - This is a strong consideration given the combination of optic neuritis and sensory disturbances like numbness and tingling.\n3. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension** - This condition can cause optic disc edema and is more common in young, overweight women, fitting the patient's profile.\n4. **Vitamin B12 Deficiency** - This can cause neuropathy and affect the optic nerve, but usually presents with other symptoms like anemia.\n5. **Diabetes Mellitus** - While it can cause neuropathy, optic disc edema is less common without other significant findings.\n6. **Sarcoidosis** - This inflammatory condition can affect the optic nerve and cause neuropathy, but often presents with more systemic symptoms.\n7. **Lupus** - An autoimmune condition that can cause a variety of neurological and ocular symptoms, but usually has more systemic involvement.\n8. **Guillain-Barré Syndrome** - This condition causes progressive muscle weakness but typically starts in the lower limbs and ascends.\n9. **Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP)** - Similar to Guillain-Barré but more chronic and progressive.\n10. **Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder** - This can cause optic neuritis and transverse myelitis, leading to sensory disturbances.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top two differential diagnoses are **Multiple Sclerosis** and **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension**, as they best explain the combination of optic disc edema, vision changes, and sensory symptoms.

Following admission, he was intubated with prone positioning, and treatment with tocilizumab and dexamethasone was started. He was also found to have Staphylococcus hemolyticus bacteremia, and treatment with cefepime was initiated. Three days after admission, the patient developed erythema and edematous necrotic plaques of the bilateral ears (Figure, A and B). No devices had been used on the ears. The necrosis progressed during the following days, primarily involving the earlobe of the right ear and a large portion of the helix of the left ear. A punch biopsy specimen was performed (Figure, C and D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Pressure necrosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a man in his 40s who's dealing with some pretty serious stuff. He's got a history of factor VII deficiency, which means his blood doesn't clot as well as it should. Now, he's come down with COVID-19, and it's hit him hard enough to cause acute hypoxic respiratory failure. That's a big deal, so he's been intubated and they're trying some treatments like tocilizumab and dexamethasone. Oh, and he's also got a Staphylococcus hemolyticus infection, so they started him on cefepime. \n\nNow, a few days into his hospital stay, he develops these nasty-looking erythema and edematous necrotic plaques on his ears. That's quite concerning. The fact that there are no devices on his ears makes me think it's not a pressure-related issue. So, what's going on here? \n\nFirst, I'm thinking about his factor VII deficiency. Could this be causing some sort of bleeding problem? Maybe something like warfarin-induced skin necrosis? That's when the blood clotting gets all messed up, and you can get skin necrosis. But wait, he's not on warfarin, so that's probably not it. \n\nNext, let's consider the COVID-19. We've heard about all sorts of weird skin things happening with COVID, like rashes and even necrosis. Could this be a COVID-related vasculitis? That's when the blood vessels get inflamed, and it could lead to skin issues like this. \n\nThen there's the Staphylococcus hemolyticus bacteremia. Staph infections can be nasty, and sometimes they can cause skin problems. Could this be some sort of staphylococcal toxin causing the necrosis? That's possible, but it doesn't quite fit the typical pattern. \n\nOh, and let's not forget the treatments he's on. Tocilizumab is an IL-6 inhibitor, and it can have some side effects. Could it be causing some kind of reaction? Maybe, but necrotic plaques aren't a common reaction to tocilizumab. \n\nNow, what about dexamethasone? It's a steroid, and while it's useful, it can suppress the immune system. Could that be making him more vulnerable to infections or other skin issues? Possibly, but it's not the main suspect here. \n\nCefepime is another drug he's on. It's an antibiotic, and antibiotics can sometimes cause skin reactions. But again, necrotic plaques are not a typical reaction to cefepime. \n\nHmm, let's think about other possibilities. Could this be some sort of autoimmune issue, like lupus or dermatomyositis? Those can cause skin changes, but they usually come with other symptoms, and we don't have any history of that here. \n\nWhat about a thrombotic process? Something like disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) could cause skin necrosis. That's when the clotting system goes haywire, and it could fit with his factor VII deficiency and the severe infection. \n\nOh, and let's not forget about heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). If he's been exposed to heparin, that could cause a thrombotic disorder leading to skin necrosis. But we don't have any info on heparin use, so that's a shot in the dark. \n\nOkay, so where does that leave us? Considering everything, I think the most likely explanation is some sort of thrombotic event, maybe related to his factor VII deficiency or the infection. DIC seems like a strong possibility here. But we should keep an open mind and consider all the angles.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with a focus on the necrotic plaques on his ears:\n\n1. **Warfarin-induced skin necrosis** - Although the patient is not on warfarin, the concept of a coagulation disorder leading to skin necrosis is relevant given his factor VII deficiency.\n\n2. **COVID-19-related vasculitis** - COVID-19 has been associated with various vascular and skin manifestations, including necrosis due to inflammation of blood vessels.\n\n3. **Staphylococcal toxin-mediated necrosis** - The Staphylococcus hemolyticus bacteremia could potentially lead to toxin production, causing skin necrosis.\n\n4. **Tocilizumab-induced reaction** - While not common, tocilizumab could contribute to an immune-related reaction affecting the skin.\n\n5. **Dexamethasone-induced immune suppression** - This could exacerbate infections or lead to skin issues, although necrotic plaques are not typical.\n\n6. **Cefepime-induced skin reaction** - Although rare, antibiotics can cause skin reactions, including necrotic ones.\n\n7. **Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)** - A thrombotic process could be exacerbated by the factor VII deficiency and severe infection, leading to skin necrosis.\n\n8. **Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)** - If heparin was used, this could lead to a thrombotic disorder and skin necrosis, but there's no information on heparin use.\n\n9. **Lupus or dermatomyositis** - Autoimmune conditions can cause skin changes, but they usually present with other symptoms and a relevant history.\n\n10. **Purpura fulminans** - A rare condition involving rapid skin necrosis due to coagulation disorders, which could fit with his factor VII deficiency and infection.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)** - Given the patient's factor VII deficiency and severe infection, this thrombotic process is highly plausible.\n\n2. **COVID-19-related vasculitis** - The association between COVID-19 and vascular skin manifestations makes this a strong contender.\n\n3. **Warfarin-induced skin necrosis-like phenomenon** - Despite the absence of warfarin, the idea of a coagulation-related skin necrosis is relevant.\n\n4. **Purpura fulminans** - This condition aligns with the rapid progression of necrosis in the context of a coagulation disorder.\n\n5. **Staphylococcal toxin-mediated necrosis** - The bacteremia could contribute to toxin production leading to skin necrosis.\n\nThese diagnoses take into account the complex interplay of the patient's underlying conditions, treatments, and the nature of the skin lesions.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Otolaryngology', 'Decubitus Ulcers', 'Sepsis']"}

She did not take any medications, smoke, or drink alcohol. On examination, visual acuity was 20/20 in each eye. There was no relative afferent pupillary defect. There was minimal limitation in infraduction in the left eye with corresponding left hypertropia (Video), which was worse in left gaze and right head tilt. Ophthalmoscopy findings were normal in each eye. Visual field findings (Humphrey 24-2 algorithm) were normal in each eye as well. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Pituitary apoplexy", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 24-year-old woman who's been dealing with a sudden headache, nausea, and double vision for the past three weeks. That's quite a trio of symptoms. The double vision is vertical, which is interesting, and it's binocular, meaning it goes away when she closes one eye. This usually points to a problem with how her eyes are aligning, likely involving the muscles that move the eyes or the nerves controlling them.\n\nNow, she's also got untreated hyperprolactinemia, which has been causing her some trouble with milk discharge and irregular periods. That's a sign that her pituitary gland might be acting up. Could there be a connection? Hmm, the pituitary gland is right near the optic pathways, so if something's going on there, it could definitely affect her vision.\n\nLet's think about what could cause these symptoms. A pituitary adenoma jumps to mind. It's a type of tumor that could press on the optic nerves or the oculomotor nerves, leading to her symptoms. But wait, there are other possibilities too. How about a cranial nerve issue, like a problem with the trochlear nerve, which controls some of the eye muscles? Or maybe it's something like a cavernous sinus thrombosis, which is a kind of blood clot in a specific area that could affect the nerves around the eyes.\n\nOkay, let's dig a bit deeper. The fact that her eye movement problem is worse when she looks to the left and tilts her head to the right suggests a specific nerve might be involved. This pattern fits with a problem in the superior oblique muscle, which is controlled by the trochlear nerve. So, a trochlear nerve palsy is definitely on the table.\n\nBut we can't ignore the hyperprolactinemia. It's untreated, which makes me think about the pituitary gland again. A prolactinoma, a type of pituitary tumor, could be causing her hormone issues and also pressing on nearby structures, leading to her headache and vision problems.\n\nLet's not forget about other possibilities. There's Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, which involves inflammation at the cavernous sinus and can cause headaches and eye movement problems. And what about an aneurysm? Aneurysms can press on nerves and cause similar symptoms. We should also consider conditions like multiple sclerosis, which can cause a range of neurologic symptoms, including eye movement issues.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Based on everything, a pituitary adenoma, particularly a prolactinoma, seems like a strong contender. It ties together her hormone symptoms and her eye problems. But we can't rule out a trochlear nerve palsy or other conditions like Tolosa-Hunt syndrome or an aneurysm without further testing. Multiple sclerosis is a bit of a wildcard here, but it's still worth considering.\n\nIn the end, I think a pituitary adenoma is the most likely explanation, given her symptoms and history.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a cystic mass in the right side of infratemporal fossa (ITF) that was nonenhancing on T1 sequencing with contrast and hyperintense on T2 (Figure 1A). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Encephalocele", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 51-year-old woman who's been dealing with headaches, right-side jaw pain, paresthesia, and trismus for about 5 years. That's quite a while to be in pain with not much relief. She's tried a bunch of treatments, but nothing's really worked. Hmm, she's also got anxiety, depression, emphysema, hyperlipidemia, migraines, and pseudoseizures in her medical history. That's a lot to consider. No head trauma or surgeries though, so we can put those aside for now.\n\nWhen we examine her, she's got tenderness in both temporomandibular joints and some weird sensations in the right side of her face, specifically the V2 and V3 areas of the trigeminal nerve. But her masseteric and facial nerves seem fine, and she can hear normally. That's good to know.\n\nNow, let's talk about the MRI. There's a cystic mass in the right infratemporal fossa. It's not lighting up on T1 with contrast, but it's bright on T2. That sounds like it's filled with fluid, maybe a cyst of some sort. Could be a branchial cleft cyst or something like that.\n\nOkay, so what could be going on here? Initially, I thought about trigeminal neuralgia because of the facial pain and paresthesia. It's a common cause of these symptoms. But then, the mass on the MRI makes me think twice. Maybe it's not just neuralgia; maybe there's something structural causing the nerve issues.\n\nNext, I considered a meningioma. These tumors can show up as cystic masses and might explain the nerve problems. But wait, meningiomas usually enhance on T1 with contrast. This one doesn't, so maybe that's not it.\n\nWhat about an epidermoid cyst? They can appear cystic on MRI and might not enhance. That's a possibility. But then again, they're not usually painful, and this woman has significant pain.\n\nI also thought about a schwannoma. These are nerve sheath tumors and could definitely cause the paresthesia and pain. They might show up as cystic if they have necrotic or cystic parts. That seems to fit pretty well.\n\nOh, and there's the idea of a branchial cleft cyst. These can show up in the infratemporal area and might not enhance on MRI. But they're usually not painful either, so that's a bit of a stretch.\n\nNow, let's not forget about odontogenic cysts. They're common in the jaw area and could cause trismus and pain. But would they show up in the infratemporal fossa? Maybe, if they're large enough.\n\nI also considered a glomus vagale tumor. These can be cystic and are in the right area, but they often enhance on MRI. Plus, they usually cause more vascular symptoms, which she doesn't have.\n\nWhat about a synovial cyst? These can occur around joints and might explain the jaw pain and trismus. But would they cause the nerve symptoms? That's less clear.\n\nLastly, there's the possibility of a neuroenteric cyst. These are rare, but they can appear as cystic masses and might cause nerve issues. They don't usually enhance on MRI, which fits. But they're not common in this area, so I'm not sure.\n\nSo, after thinking through all of this, I'm leaning towards a schwannoma. It explains the nerve symptoms, the cystic appearance on MRI, and the chronic pain. It seems to fit best with everything we know.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Trigeminal Neuralgia** - This condition is characterized by facial pain and paresthesia, which aligns with the patient's symptoms.\n\n2. **Meningioma** - Although these tumors can present as cystic masses, they typically enhance on T1 MRI with contrast, which doesn't match this case.\n\n3. **Epidermoid Cyst** - These cysts can appear cystic on MRI and may not enhance, but they are usually not painful.\n\n4. **Schwannoma** - A nerve sheath tumor that could cause paresthesia and pain, potentially appearing cystic if necrotic or cystic components are present.\n\n5. **Branchial Cleft Cyst** - These can occur in the infratemporal area and may not enhance on MRI, but they are typically not painful.\n\n6. **Odontogenic Cyst** - Common in the jaw area, these could cause trismus and pain, but their presence in the infratemporal fossa is less common.\n\n7. **Glomus Vagale Tumor** - These can be cystic and are in the right area, but they often enhance on MRI and cause more vascular symptoms.\n\n8. **Synovial Cyst** - These occur around joints and might explain jaw pain and trismus, but their role in nerve symptoms is less clear.\n\n9. **Neuroenteric Cyst** - A rare cyst that can appear as a non-enhancing cystic mass and may cause nerve issues, though uncommon in this location.\n\n10. **Pleomorphic Adenoma** - A benign salivary gland tumor that could present as a cystic mass in the infratemporal area and cause related symptoms.\n\nAfter considering all the possibilities and the patient's symptoms, **Schwannoma** emerges as the most likely diagnosis, as it accounts for the nerve involvement, chronic pain, and cystic appearance on MRI.", "topic": "['Neurology', 'Neurosurgery', 'Otolaryngology', 'Skull Base', 'Head and Neck Surgery']"}

Inflammatory markers were elevated with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 130 mm/h and a C-reactive protein level of 1.48 mg/dL (to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10). The patient noted floaters in her right eye, which prompted an ophthalmology consultation. On bedside examination, her near visual acuity was J1+ (Snellen equivalent, 20/20 OU), and color vision was full in both eyes; the patient’s intraocular pressure, pupils, extraocular movements, and confrontational visual fields were all unremarkable. Dilated examination revealed grade I and II optic disc edema in the right and left eyes, respectively, and peripapillary hemorrhage in the right eye. Optical coherence tomography was obtained 3 days after initial consultation, which confirmed bilateral disc edema, more pronounced in the left eye than the right eye (Figure 1), and 24-2 Humphrey visual field examination in both eyes was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits with and without contrast and lumbar puncture were obtained, and results showed diffuse signal abnormality in the bone marrow compartment and findings suggestive of papilledema. Magnetic resonance venography did not reveal thrombosis. Opening pressure during lumbar puncture was 37 cm H2O (upper limit of normal, 28 cm H2O); all cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) viral serology test results were negative, and glucose level and red and white blood cell counts were all within normal limits.

We've got a 12-year-old girl who's come in with anemia and leukopenia. That's already a bit concerning. She's also got a headache, feels tired, has a recent cough, and a fever. Hmm, that's quite a mix of symptoms. Her inflammatory markers are pretty high too. That's something to keep in mind.\n\nNow, she's seeing floaters in her right eye, which is why the eye doctor got involved. Her vision seems fine when she reads up close and with colors, and everything else in the basic eye exam looks normal. But when they dilated her eyes, they found some optic disc edema and a bit of bleeding near the optic nerve in the right eye. That's definitely not normal.\n\nThey did an OCT scan a few days later, and it showed that both eyes have disc edema, but the left eye is worse. Yet, when they tested her visual fields, everything was normal. That's interesting. It suggests that whatever's going on isn't affecting her peripheral vision yet.\n\nThey also did an MRI of her brain and orbits. The results showed something weird in her bone marrow and signs of papilledema. But there's no thrombosis, so we can probably rule out a blood clot. The lumbar puncture showed high opening pressure, which means there's increased pressure in her brain. But the CSF is pretty normal otherwise, with no viruses showing up and normal glucose and cell counts. The protein is a bit low, but not dramatically so.\n\nOkay, so what could be going on here? The optic disc edema and papilledema make me think of increased intracranial pressure. But the normal CSF composition is throwing me off a bit. If it were meningitis or encephalitis, I'd expect more abnormalities in the CSF.\n\nLet's think about other possibilities. Could it be a condition that causes both anemia and increased intracranial pressure? Iron deficiency anemia sometimes causes papilledema, but I don't see how that would explain the leukopenia or the high inflammatory markers.\n\nMaybe it's some kind of systemic illness. Lupus can cause a wide range of symptoms, including anemia, leukopenia, and neurological issues. But I'd expect more specific findings in the CSF or blood tests.\n\nWhat about a hematological disorder? Something like aplastic anemia could explain the blood abnormalities. And maybe the increased intracranial pressure is related to a secondary issue, like a minor infection or dehydration.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about viral infections. They can sometimes cause these kinds of systemic symptoms. But the negative CSF viral serology makes that less likely.\n\nI'm also thinking about conditions that cause both hematological and neurological symptoms, like leukemia. It can cause anemia and leukopenia, and sometimes increased intracranial pressure if there's CNS involvement. But I'd expect to see some abnormal cells in the CSF or blood.\n\nWait, what about idiopathic intracranial hypertension? It can cause papilledema and increased opening pressure, but it usually occurs in overweight adults, not kids. And it doesn't explain the anemia and leukopenia.\n\nMaybe it's something rare, like a mitochondrial disorder. They can cause a mix of symptoms, including hematological and neurological issues. But I'd expect some other signs, like muscle weakness or specific findings on MRI.\n\nIn the end, I'm leaning towards a systemic illness like lupus or a hematological disorder like aplastic anemia. They both fit the symptoms pretty well, although neither explains everything perfectly. I think we need more tests to figure this out for sure.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 12-year-old girl's condition, with each step offering a distinct potential diagnosis:\n\n1. **Iron Deficiency Anemia**: This condition can sometimes lead to papilledema, but it doesn't fully explain the leukopenia or elevated inflammatory markers.\n\n2. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**: SLE can cause a wide range of symptoms including anemia, leukopenia, and neurological issues, but specific findings in the CSF or blood tests would be expected.\n\n3. **Aplastic Anemia**: This could explain the anemia and leukopenia, and potentially the increased intracranial pressure if there's a secondary factor involved.\n\n4. **Viral Infection**: Although the negative CSF viral serology makes this less likely, some viral infections can present with systemic symptoms and neurological involvement.\n\n5. **Leukemia**: This can cause anemia, leukopenia, and increased intracranial pressure if there's CNS involvement, but abnormal cells would likely be seen in the CSF or blood.\n\n6. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension**: This condition can cause papilledema and increased opening pressure, but it typically occurs in overweight adults and doesn't explain the blood abnormalities.\n\n7. **Mitochondrial Disorder**: These disorders can present with a mix of symptoms including hematological and neurological issues, but other signs like muscle weakness or specific MRI findings would be expected.\n\n8. **Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia**: This could explain the anemia, but not the leukopenia or neurological symptoms.\n\n9. **Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis**: This condition can cause systemic inflammation and potentially neurological symptoms, but the blood abnormalities would be atypical.\n\n10. **Parvovirus B19 Infection**: This virus can cause anemia and leukopenia, especially in children, and might lead to neurological symptoms, although this is less common.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses would be **Aplastic Anemia** and **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**, as they both account for the hematological and neurological symptoms to some extent. Further testing, including blood tests and potentially a bone marrow biopsy, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.", "topic": "['Oncology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Leukemias', 'Neuro-ophthalmology']"}

He had no medical history or family history of cancer and was not a smoker. In the absence of other suggestive symptoms, as well as a normal physical examination that did not reveal any enlarged cervical lymph nodes or oropharyngeal or neck mass and an unremarkable nasoendoscopic examination, a diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux was made. The patient was advised to try conservative management with dietary advice and proton pump inhibitors, and a clinical review was scheduled in 6 weeks. The patient only returned 3 months later when his hoarseness became worse. Repeat nasoendoscopy now showed left vocal cord palsy in the paramedian position. In the absence of a history of trauma and associated neurological or systemic symptoms, the main concern was an underlying tumor that impinged on the vagus nerve at various points or its recurrent branch. Results of a computed tomographic (CT) scan showed an ill-defined soft tissue mass, which was likely nodal disease, at the left supraclavicular (Figure 1), as well as the prevertebral and paravertebral region, which partially encased the left common carotid, left subclavian, and left vertebral arteries. This was along the expected course of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve and likely accounted for the left vocal cord palsy. However, the primary site of disease remained unclear. A fused positron emission tomography with CT (PET/CT) scan with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) tracer was then performed. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Metastatic colon cancer", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 64-year-old man who's been dealing with hoarseness and a dry cough for a few weeks. No smoking history, which is interesting. And no family history of cancer either. Hmm, that's something to keep in mind.\n\nInitially, the doctors thought it might be laryngopharyngeal reflux. Makes sense, given the symptoms. They put him on proton pump inhibitors and told him to come back in six weeks. But he didn't show up until three months later, and by then, his hoarseness had gotten worse.\n\nNow, when they checked again, they found his left vocal cord was paralyzed. That's a big red flag. No trauma or neurological symptoms, so we're thinking something more serious, like a tumor pressing on the vagus nerve.\n\nThey did a CT scan and found a mass in the left supraclavicular area. That's not good. It's likely nodal disease, and it's also affecting the prevertebral and paravertebral regions. This mass is wrapping around some important arteries, which could explain the vocal cord issue.\n\nSo, what could be causing this? Lung cancer is a big possibility. It's known for causing vocal cord paralysis if it spreads to the chest area. Esophageal cancer is another contender. It's in the neighborhood of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and could definitely cause these symptoms.\n\nBut wait, there's also thyroid cancer to consider. It can spread to the neck and affect the nerves too. And then there's the possibility of a metastatic tumor from an unknown primary source. The supraclavicular mass could be a Virchow's node, which is often linked to stomach or esophageal cancer.\n\nLet's not forget about lymphoma. It can cause masses in the chest and neck, leading to nerve compression. And what about mediastinal tumors? They're in the right spot to affect the recurrent laryngeal nerve.\n\nOh, and we can't rule out breast cancer. It can metastasize to unusual places and cause similar symptoms. Pancreatic cancer is another long shot, but it could explain the supraclavicular node.\n\nNow, let's look at the PET/CT scan results. They might give us a clearer picture. If there's high uptake in the lung or esophagus, that could point us in the right direction.\n\nAfter considering all of this, lung cancer seems like the most likely culprit. It fits the profile, especially with the supraclavicular mass. But we can't completely rule out esophageal or thyroid cancer yet. They're still in the running.\n\nIn the end, I think lung cancer is the top suspect, followed closely by esophageal and thyroid cancer. The PET/CT findings will be key in confirming this.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with a focus on one potential diagnosis per step, without repetition:\n\n1. **Lung Cancer** - Given the patient's age and the presence of a supraclavicular mass, lung cancer is a strong contender, especially since it can cause vocal cord paralysis if it spreads to the mediastinum.\n\n2. **Esophageal Cancer** - This type of cancer is in close proximity to the recurrent laryngeal nerve and can easily cause vocal cord paralysis if it invades or compresses the nerve.\n\n3. **Thyroid Cancer** - Thyroid cancer can spread to the neck and affect the nerves, leading to vocal cord paralysis. It's a plausible option given the location and symptoms.\n\n4. **Metastatic Tumor of Unknown Primary Origin** - The presence of a supraclavicular mass, often referred to as Virchow's node, suggests the possibility of a metastatic tumor from a hidden primary site, commonly associated with abdominal organs like the stomach.\n\n5. **Lymphoma** - Lymphomas can cause masses in the chest and neck that may compress nerves, leading to vocal cord paralysis.\n\n6. **Mediastinal Tumor** - Tumors in the mediastinum can affect the recurrent laryngeal nerve, causing hoarseness and vocal cord paralysis.\n\n7. **Breast Cancer** - Although less common, breast cancer can metastasize to unusual areas, including the supraclavicular region, causing similar symptoms.\n\n8. **Pancreatic Cancer** - Pancreatic cancer, particularly when it metastasizes, can present with a supraclavicular node and may indirectly affect the vagus nerve.\n\n9. **Hypopharyngeal Cancer** - Cancers in the hypopharynx can invade nearby structures, including the recurrent laryngeal nerve, leading to vocal cord paralysis.\n\n10. **Cholangiocarcinoma** - This is a long shot, but it can metastasize to distant lymph nodes, including the supraclavicular area, potentially affecting nerve pathways.\n\nAfter considering all the information, including the CT and potential PET/CT findings, lung cancer emerges as the most likely diagnosis, followed by esophageal and thyroid cancer. These three remain top contenders given the clinical presentation and imaging results.", "topic": "['Head and Neck Surgery', 'Radiology', 'Oncology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Laryngology']"}

Two months prior to presentation, the patient had awoken with bilateral linear “gashes” in her mandibular vestibule that were accompanied by bilateral buccal facial swellings. Since that day, the facial swelling remained unchanged, and although the mucosal lesions healed, the oral pain persisted. The patient’s medical history was noteworthy for depression, for which she was taking bupropion and fluoxetine, and prior alcohol use disorder, for which she was 3 years sober. She denied any smokeless tobacco use but endorsed daily electronic cigarette use. The extraoral examination detected bilateral buccal facial swelling of the lower facial third without associated trismus or lymphadenopathy (Figure, A). Intraorally, bilateral scarring of the mandibular buccal vestibule was noted with focal areas of ulceration. Small aphthous ulcerations were also present on the right buccal mucosa (Figure, B). An incisional biopsy of the right vestibular lesion was performed, and the specimen showed diffuse plasmalymphocytic infiltrates within the lamina propria. On higher magnification, noncaseating granulomatous inflammation was observed (Figure, C). Staining for acid-fast bacilli was negative. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Crohn disease", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 32-year-old woman with some pretty persistent cheek swelling and mouth pain. That's been going on for a couple of months now. She also had these strange linear cuts or gashes in her mouth that healed, but the swelling and pain didn't go away. That's interesting.\n\nShe's on medication for depression, bupropion and fluoxetine. And she used to have an alcohol problem, but she's been sober for three years. Good for her. She doesn't use smokeless tobacco but does use electronic cigarettes daily. Hmm, could that be relevant?\n\nWhen we look at her, there's this bilateral swelling on her cheeks, but no trouble opening her mouth and no swollen lymph nodes. Inside her mouth, there are scars where those gashes were, and some small ulcers. Oh, and there are a few aphthous ulcers too. That's a lot to take in.\n\nThey did a biopsy, and it showed a bunch of plasma and lymphocytes in the tissue. And when they looked closer, they found noncaseating granulomas. That's a big clue. They checked for acid-fast bacilli, just in case it was something like tuberculosis, but that was negative.\n\nSo, what could this be? Let's start with the obvious. Noncaseating granulomas make me think of sarcoidosis right away. It's a condition that can cause all sorts of granulomas, especially in the face. But wait, let's not jump to conclusions.\n\nNext, I'm thinking about discoid lupus erythematosus. It can cause facial swelling and oral ulcers, and sometimes you see granulomas. But it usually has other skin findings, which we don't have here.\n\nThen there's Crohn's disease. It can cause oral ulcers and granulomas too. But usually, there are gut problems, and we don't have any mention of those.\n\nWhat about chronic granulomatous disease? It's rare, but it can cause granulomas and oral ulcers. It's usually in kids, though, and she's 32.\n\nOh, and there's Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. It has facial swelling, oral ulcers, and sometimes granulomas. That sounds like a good fit, especially with the facial swelling and ulcers.\n\nLet's not forget about infectious causes. Syphilis can cause mucosal lesions and granulomas, but we'd expect other symptoms or a positive test. And tuberculosis can cause granulomas, but those are caseating, and we ruled that out with the negative stain.\n\nNow, what about autoimmune disorders like lupus or Sjögren's syndrome? They can cause oral ulcers and facial swelling, but granulomas are less common.\n\nI'm also thinking about plasma cell mucositis. It causes oral ulcers and plasma cell infiltrates, but not usually granulomas. Hmm, maybe it's related?\n\nLet's put it all together. The combination of facial swelling, oral ulcers, and noncaseating granulomas is pretty specific. Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome fits well, but it's rare. Sarcoidosis is more common and could explain the findings. Plasma cell mucositis is another possibility, given the plasma cell infiltrate.\n\nIn the end, I think Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is the best fit, given the symptoms and biopsy results. But sarcoidosis and plasma cell mucositis are close seconds. It's a tough call, but that's my conclusion.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnoses for the 32-year-old woman with persistent bilateral cheek swelling, mouth pain, and the biopsy findings of noncaseating granulomas are as follows:\n\n1. **Melkersson-Rosenthal Syndrome** - This condition is characterized by facial swelling, oral ulcers, and sometimes noncaseating granulomas, which aligns well with the patient's symptoms and biopsy results.\n\n2. **Sarcoidosis** - A systemic condition that commonly presents with noncaseating granulomas and can affect various organs, including the skin and mucosa, making it a strong contender.\n\n3. **Plasma Cell Mucositis** - Although it typically presents with oral ulcers and plasma cell infiltrates, the presence of noncaseating granulomas could suggest a related or overlapping condition.\n\n4. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus** - This can cause facial swelling and oral ulcers, but granuloma formation is less common, making it a less likely diagnosis.\n\n5. **Crohn's Disease** - While it can cause oral ulcers and granulomas, the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms makes this less probable.\n\n6. **Chronic Granulomatous Disease** - Rare and typically presents in children, but could be considered due to the granulomatous inflammation.\n\n7. **Syphilis** - Can cause mucosal lesions and granulomas, but other symptoms or positive serology would be expected.\n\n8. **Tuberculosis** - Typically causes caseating granulomas, which were ruled out by the negative stain for acid-fast bacilli.\n\n9. **Sjögren's Syndrome** - An autoimmune disorder that can cause oral issues, but granuloma formation is uncommon.\n\n10. **Oral Lichen Planus** - Could cause oral lesions, but granulomas are not typical.\n\nAfter considering all the information, Melkersson-Rosenthal Syndrome emerges as the most likely diagnosis, given the specific combination of symptoms and biopsy findings.

She was told about these same findings 10 years ago but did not have a repeated eye examination until recently by another retina specialist. She reported no family history of retinal diseases. She initially received anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment, but was later referred because of a concern about either the idiopathic or paraneoplastic variant of acute exudative polymorphous vitelliform maculopathy (AEPVM). Initial workup by her primary care physician was unremarkable for malignancy. Her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/60 OD and 20/50 OS. An anterior segment examination was normal. Dilated fundus examination revealed multiple vitelliform lesions involving the macula and superior macula bilaterally (Figure 1). Fluorescein angiography revealed staining of these lesions with a pseudohypopyon appearance of the central vitelliform lesion in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed hyperreflectance corresponding to the yellow pigment in the vitelliform lesions in the subretinal space. No evidence of a choroidal neovascular membrane was present on examination or imaging. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Best disease", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 49-year-old African American woman who's been dealing with some retinal issues and slightly blurry vision. She was told about these problems a decade ago but didn't follow up until now. That's quite a gap! She's got no family history of retinal diseases, which is interesting. She was initially given anti-VEGF treatment, but now there's a concern it might be something like acute exudative polymorphous vitelliform maculopathy, either idiopathic or paraneoplastic. Her initial workup for cancer came back clear, so that's a relief. Her visual acuity isn't great, 20/60 in one eye and 20/50 in the other. The front part of her eyes look normal, but the fundus exam shows these multiple vitelliform lesions in the macula area, bilaterally. That's a lot to take in.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. The fluorescein angiography shows staining of these lesions with a pseudohypopyon appearance. That's a fancy way of saying there's some material accumulating in a way that looks like a hypopyon, but it's not quite the same. The OCT reveals hyperreflectance in the subretinal space, which corresponds to the yellow pigment we're seeing. No signs of a choroidal neovascular membrane, so we can probably rule that out.\n\nSo, what could this be? Initially, I'm thinking about pattern dystrophies, like adult vitelliform macular dystrophy. It's a hereditary condition, but she said there's no family history. Hmm, that's odd. Maybe it's just a sporadic case? Let's keep it in mind.\n\nNext, I'm considering acute exudative polymorphous vitelliform maculopathy. It fits the description pretty well, especially with the bilateral lesions and the pseudohypopyon appearance. Plus, there's that concern about the paraneoplastic variant, even though her initial cancer screening was negative. I should keep this high on the list.\n\nAnother possibility is central serous chorioretinopathy. It can cause serous detachments and could mimic some of these findings. But, it's usually more common in younger to middle-aged men, and she's a 49-year-old woman. Plus, the lack of a clear serous detachment on OCT makes me think it's less likely.\n\nBest disease also comes to mind. It's known for those vitelliform lesions, but it's typically diagnosed in younger patients. She's a bit older than what's typical for Best disease, but I shouldn't rule it out entirely just yet.\n\nI should also think about other conditions like basal laminar drusen or even cuticular drusen. They can cause similar yellowish lesions, but they're usually smaller and more numerous. The lesions here seem larger and more defined, so I'm not leaning towards these options.\n\nOh, and what about uveitis or inflammatory conditions? They can cause vitelliform lesions too, especially if there's inflammation involved. But, there's no mention of inflammation or other uveitic symptoms here, so it seems less likely.\n\nNow, let's not forget about the paraneoplastic aspect. Even though her initial screening was clear, paraneoplastic syndromes can be tricky. They might not show up right away. I should keep this in mind, especially with the AEPVM concern.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? After going through everything, I think the top differential diagnosis is acute exudative polymorphous vitelliform maculopathy. It just fits too well with the bilateral lesions and pseudohypopyon appearance. Pattern dystrophies like adult vitelliform macular dystrophy are a close second, even without a family history. Best disease is still on the list, but it's lower because of her age. Central serous chorioretinopathy seems less likely given the demographics and lack of serous detachment. And those other conditions, like basal laminar drusen or uveitis, just don't fit the findings as well. Yeah, that's where I'd rank them.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the retinal findings in this 49-year-old African American woman:\n\n1. **Acute Exudative Polymorphous Vitelliform Maculopathy (AEPVM)** - This condition fits well with the bilateral vitelliform lesions and pseudohypopyon appearance seen in the patient.\n\n2. **Adult Vitelliform Macular Dystrophy** - A hereditary condition that matches the vitelliform lesions, although the lack of family history is noteworthy.\n\n3. **Best Disease** - Known for vitelliform lesions, but typically diagnosed in younger patients, making it less likely given the patient's age.\n\n4. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy** - Although it can cause serous detachments, it's less likely due to the patient's age and gender, and the lack of clear serous detachment on OCT.\n\n5. **Basal Laminar Drusen** - Characterized by smaller, numerous lesions, which doesn't perfectly match the larger, more defined lesions seen here.\n\n6. **Cuticular Drusen** - Similar to basal laminar drusen, the lesions are typically smaller and more numerous than what is described.\n\n7. **Uveitis** - Could cause vitelliform lesions if inflammation is present, but there's no mention of inflammatory symptoms.\n\n8. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - Although initial cancer screening was negative, paraneoplastic syndromes can be elusive and should remain a consideration.\n\n9. **Pattern Dystrophies** - A broader category including adult vitelliform macular dystrophy, to be considered given the retinal findings.\n\n10. **Age-related Macular Degeneration** - While less likely given the patient's age and lesion characteristics, it shouldn't be entirely ruled out.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnosis is **Acute Exudative Polymorphous Vitelliform Maculopathy (AEPVM)**, followed closely by **Adult Vitelliform Macular Dystrophy**. **Best Disease** is also a consideration, though less likely due to the patient's age.

The patient was not immunocompromised and denied any trauma to the area. In the 2 months prior, he had received multiple rounds of antibiotics from other health care professionals. Outside computed tomography of the face showed a 3-cm cystic structure in the superficial aspect of the right parotid gland with associated lymphadenopathy. An outside health care professional had attempted incision and drainage of the area with negative cultures. The patient presented to our clinic with an isolated right 2-cm fluctuant and tender mass overlying the parotid gland. There was no accompanying cervical lymphadenopathy, and facial nerve function remained fully intact. The patient denied fevers or systemic symptoms. Results of laboratory evaluation revealed normal complete blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels with negative infectious workup results for Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, HIV, and tuberculosis (TB).

We've got an 8-year-old boy with a 3-year history of a fluctuating mass in his right parotid gland. That's quite a long time for something like this to be hanging around. It's not like a typical infection that would clear up quickly. So, I'm thinking it's probably not something like parotitis, which usually resolves with antibiotics. \n\nNow, the fact that he's had multiple rounds of antibiotics without improvement makes me think it's not a simple bacterial infection. Plus, the cultures were negative, so that's another strike against a straightforward bacterial cause. \n\nThe imaging shows a cystic structure with necrotic lymph nodes. That's interesting. Necrosis usually points to something more complex, maybe even a granulomatous process. So, I'm starting to consider things like cat scratch disease or maybe even TB, but wait, the TB test was negative. Hmm, okay, let's keep that in mind but move on for now. \n\nThe lack of systemic symptoms like fever is also telling. If it were something like a serious infection, I'd expect him to be feeling pretty crummy overall, but he's not. So, that makes me think it's more of a localized issue. \n\nLet's see, what else could it be? Sarcoidosis can cause lymphadenopathy and necrotic nodes, but it's pretty rare in kids. Still, it's worth considering. \n\nOh, and there's Kimura disease. That's a possibility too. It's a chronic condition that can cause lymphadenopathy and often appears in the head and neck area. Plus, it can be persistent like this. \n\nI should also think about branchial cleft cysts. They can definitely cause a cystic mass like this, and they're not uncommon in kids. But, the necrotic lymph nodes are a bit unusual for that. \n\nWhat about a vascular anomaly, like a lymphatic malformation? Those can appear as cystic masses and might explain the necrotic nodes if there's some sort of blockage or infection. \n\nLet's not forget about neoplastic causes. A low-grade lymphoma or something like that could present like this, especially with the necrotic nodes. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top differential diagnoses are Kimura disease, a branchial cleft cyst, and a lymphatic malformation. Sarcoidosis and a low-grade lymphoma are also possibilities, but they seem a bit less likely given the circumstances. \n\nYeah, that seems to fit with everything we know. Kimura disease or a branchial cleft cyst with some secondary changes from the repeated infections and procedures seems like the most plausible explanation.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 8-year-old boy with a fluctuating right parotid mass:\n\n1. **Chronic Bacterial Parotitis** - Although antibiotics have not been effective, this remains a consideration due to the gland's involvement and fluctuating nature of the mass.\n\n2. **Cat Scratch Disease** - This condition can cause lymphadenopathy and is consistent with the necrotic lymph nodes observed.\n\n3. **Tuberculosis** - Despite the negative TB test, TB can sometimes present with necrotic lymph nodes and a chronic course.\n\n4. **Sarcoidosis** - Although rare in children, sarcoidosis can cause lymphadenopathy and necrotic nodes, making it a consideration.\n\n5. **Kimura Disease** - A chronic inflammatory condition that can cause lymphadenopathy and persistent masses, especially in the head and neck region.\n\n6. **Branchial Cleft Cyst** - A congenital anomaly that can present as a cystic mass, which aligns with the imaging findings.\n\n7. **Lymphatic Malformation** - A vascular anomaly that can appear as a cystic mass and may explain the necrotic lymph nodes.\n\n8. **Sjögren's Syndrome** - An autoimmune condition that can affect the salivary glands, although it's rare in children.\n\n9. **HIV-associated Lymphadenopathy** - Despite the negative HIV test, atypical presentations can occur, and the lymphadenopathy is noteworthy.\n\n10. **Low-grade Lymphoma** - A neoplastic cause that could present with necrotic lymph nodes and a persistent mass.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are **Kimura Disease**, **Branchial Cleft Cyst**, and **Lymphatic Malformation**, with **Sarcoidosis** and **Low-grade Lymphoma** as less likely possibilities.

But let's not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nNow, looking at his physical exam, he's quite short and underweight. That's a bit unusual. And he's got cognitive issues, coordination problems, and muscle weakness. These neurological symptoms are making me think of something more systemic, maybe a neuromuscular disorder like muscular dystrophy. But again, let's keep an open mind.\n\nThe blood tests show some important clues. He's got impaired glucose tolerance and hypothyroidism. Both of these can affect the heart and muscles, so they're definitely relevant. But what's really catching my eye are the high levels of lactic acid and pyruvic acid. That's a red flag for a metabolic issue, maybe something mitochondrial like MELAS syndrome. Elevated lactate and pyruvate often point to a problem with energy production.\n\nNow, let's talk about the imaging. The echocardiogram and cardiac MRI both show hypertrophy and decreased contractility. Plus, there's this strange late gadolinium enhancement on the cardiac MRI. That could mean fibrosis or some other myocardial process. And the brain MRI shows cerebellar atrophy. That's another piece of the puzzle pointing towards a neurodegenerative or systemic condition.\n\nOkay, so let's put this all together. We've got hearing loss, cognitive and motor issues, systemic metabolic problems, and both cardiac and cerebral involvement. This is sounding a lot like a mitochondrial disorder. Maybe something like Kearns-Sayre syndrome, which can cause all these symptoms, including the hearing loss and cardiac issues.\n\nBut wait, let's not forget about other possibilities. Friedreich's ataxia could explain the neurological symptoms and cardiac involvement. And what about Duchenne muscular dystrophy? That could cause the muscle weakness and cardiac issues too. We should also consider other mitochondrial disorders like MERRF syndrome, which can present with myoclonus and other symptoms.\n\nSo, after thinking it all through, I'm leaning towards Kearns-Sayre syndrome as the most likely diagnosis. It fits well with the combination of hearing loss, cognitive impairment, muscle weakness, and cardiac involvement, along with the lactic acidosis. But we should still keep Friedreich's ataxia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy on our radar as possibilities.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy** - Given the left ventricular hypertrophy and strain pattern on the ECG.\n2. **Kearns-Sayre Syndrome** - Considering the combination of hearing loss, cognitive impairment, muscle weakness, and cardiac involvement.\n3. **Friedreich's Ataxia** - Due to the neurological symptoms and cardiac involvement.\n4. **Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy** - Given the muscle weakness and cardiac issues.\n5. **MELAS Syndrome** - Suggested by the elevated lactic acid and pyruvic acid levels.\n6. **MERRF Syndrome** - Another mitochondrial disorder that could explain some symptoms.\n7. **Myotonic Dystrophy** - Considering the muscle weakness and systemic involvement.\n8. **Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation (NBIA)** - Due to the cerebellar atrophy and systemic symptoms.\n9. **Pompe Disease** - A glycogen storage disorder that can cause cardiac and muscular symptoms.\n10. **Danon Disease** - A condition that can cause cardiac and muscular issues with cognitive impairment.\n\nAfter considering all the patient's symptoms and test results, the top differential diagnosis is **Kearns-Sayre Syndrome**, as it aligns well with the hearing loss, cognitive impairment, muscle weakness, cardiac involvement, and lactic acidosis. However, **Friedreich's Ataxia** and **Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy** remain strong contenders and should be further investigated.", "topic": "['Radiology', 'Neuroimaging', 'Neurology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Audiology and Hearing']"}

Symptoms started a year before, after receiving dental implants for new lower dentures. The patient noted right upper and lower eyelid swelling most notable in the morning but denied associated fevers, chills, vision changes, dysphagia, headaches, urinary symptoms, or rashes. Physical examination revealed a 3-cm round fluctuant area lateral to the right lateral canthus, mildly tender to palpation. No overlying warmth or erythema and no lymphadenopathy. The patient’s dentures appeared to be well fitting, but mouth opening was at approximately 50% of expected. Laboratory results included an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 20 mm/h, and normal complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel results,  and lactate levels. Findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure, A) were most consistent with osteomyelitis of the mandible with inflammation of surrounding soft tissues. Right temporalis muscle biopsy results for Gram stain and culture, fungal stain and culture, and acid-fast bacillus stain were unremarkable. The patient’s symptoms did not improve after 7 weeks of empirical intravenous ertapenem followed by 8 weeks of oral cefuroxime and minocycline. Additional laboratory test results, including serum IgG4, SPEP, brucella AB, Q fever AB, RF, urinalysis, and microalbumin/creatinine levels, were all unremarkable. Results for p-ANCA and c-ANCA were negative. Repeated MRI findings showed progression of the inflammation and new involvement of the temporal lobe dura. Findings on positron emission tomographic computed tomography (PET-CT) scan showed nonspecific inflammatory changes to the bone, muscle, and brain meninges. A biopsy of the temporalis muscle, sphenoid wing, and dura was performed (Figure, B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Atypical vasculitis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 60-year-old man who's been dealing with right jaw pain, trismus, and facial swelling for a year. That's a long time to be in discomfort, and it all started after he got dental implants. Hmm, that's interesting. Dental work can sometimes lead to infections, so maybe that's a clue.\n\nNow, he's also got swelling in his upper and lower eyelids, especially in the morning. That's a bit unusual. No fevers or vision changes though, which is good. But still, it's something to consider.\n\nWhen I examine him, there's a noticeable fluctuant area near his right eye. It's tender but not warm or red, and there aren't any swollen lymph nodes. His dentures seem fine, but he's having trouble opening his mouth fully. That's got to be frustrating.\n\nThe lab results show a slightly elevated ESR, but everything else in his blood work looks normal. That's a relief in some ways, but it also makes things a bit more puzzling. The MRI suggests osteomyelitis of the mandible, which fits with the dental implant history. But the biopsy results from the temporalis muscle didn't show any infection. That's odd.\n\nHe's been on antibiotics for a while now, and there's been no improvement. That's a red flag for a non-bacterial cause. So, what else could it be? Let's think about autoimmune diseases. IgG4-related disease is a possibility. It can cause swelling and inflammation without infection.\n\nBut wait, his IgG4 levels are normal. Hmm, that's not what I expected. Let's not rule out autoimmune just yet though. There are other types, like sarcoidosis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis. They can be tricky and might not show up in routine tests.\n\nThe MRI shows the inflammation has spread to the temporal lobe dura. That's concerning. And the PET-CT scan just shows nonspecific inflammation. Frustrating, but it tells us something is still actively inflamed.\n\nLet's consider other possibilities. Could it be a chronic infection like tuberculosis or a fungal infection? The biopsy didn't show anything, but those can be sneaky. Or maybe it's something like a brucella or Q fever infection. But again, the tests didn't show anything.\n\nWhat about a neoplasm? That's a possibility, but there's no clear mass or abnormal cells from the biopsy. So, probably not.\n\nOkay, let's think about the autoimmune angle again. With the dura involved, granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a strong contender. It can cause all sorts of inflammation and doesn't always show up in tests.\n\nBut wait, the ANCA tests are negative. Hmm, that makes granulomatosis with polyangiitis less likely. Let's not completely rule it out though. ANCA can sometimes be negative in these cases.\n\nIgG4-related disease is still on the table, even with normal IgG4 levels. It's a tricky disease and can present in different ways. The biopsy could have missed something.\n\nLet's also consider sarcoidosis. It can cause similar symptoms and might not show up in routine tests. The lack of systemic symptoms makes it less likely, but it's still possible.\n\nOkay, so what's the most likely diagnosis? Based on everything, I'm leaning towards IgG4-related disease. It fits the symptoms and the normal test results. But I'm not completely ruling out sarcoidosis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis. They're still in the running.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Osteomyelitis** - Given the history of dental implants and MRI findings, osteomyelitis of the mandible is a strong initial consideration.\n\n2. **IgG4-related Disease** - The swelling, inflammation, and lack of response to antibiotics suggest IgG4-related disease, despite normal IgG4 levels.\n\n3. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis** - Involvement of the temporal lobe dura and persistent inflammation raise the possibility of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, even with negative ANCA tests.\n\n4. **Sarcoidosis** - This condition can cause similar symptoms and might not appear in routine tests, making it a plausible differential diagnosis.\n\n5. **Chronic Fungal Infection** - The lack of response to antibiotics and persistent inflammation could suggest a chronic fungal infection, which might not be detected in initial biopsies.\n\n6. **Tuberculosis** - Although unlikely, tuberculosis can present with chronic inflammation and might not be detected in routine tests.\n\n7. **Brucellosis** - This zoonotic infection can cause chronic symptoms and might not be detected with standard tests if not specifically looked for.\n\n8. **Q Fever** - Similar to brucellosis, Q fever can cause prolonged symptoms and may not be identified without specific testing.\n\n9. **Temporal Arteritis** - The involvement of the temporal region and persistent inflammation could suggest temporal arteritis, although it's less likely given the patient's age and lack of typical symptoms.\n\n10. **Neoplasm** - Although less likely, a neoplastic process could present with persistent inflammation and should be considered in the differential diagnosis.\n\nAfter considering all the patient's symptoms, test results, and the progression of the condition, IgG4-related disease emerges as the most likely diagnosis.

He had hit the right side of his head on a table 1 month before symptoms developed, but had no other recent trauma. The mass had not changed in size, was not tender, and had no other associated symptoms. His parents had not noticed any change in vision. At bedside, the patient was playful and in no acute distress. On examination, he fixed and followed in each eye. His pupils were equal and reactive to light without afferent pupillary defect. Both eyes were soft to palpation and his extraocular movements were full. Externally, his examination was notable for bilateral upper eyelid ecchymosis and edema, as well as a soft, well-circumscribed mass on the right temporal region (Figure 1). There was no obvious proptosis. He was also noted to have subconjunctival hemorrhage temporally on the right eye. Otherwise, findings of his anterior examination and dilated fundoscopic examination were normal. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Metastatic neuroblastoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 13-month-old boy with some pretty concerning symptoms. He's got bilateral eyelid bruising and swelling, and there's a mass on his right temple. That's a lot to take in. First off, the bruising around the eyes makes me think of something like a basilar skull fracture. That's a serious injury, but it's possible, especially since he had a fall a month ago. The timing fits, and it could explain the bruising.\n\nBut wait, there's also this mass on the right temple. It's not tender, and it hasn't changed size. That's interesting. Could it be related to the fall too? Maybe it's a hematoma that's just taking its time to heal. Hematomas can be tricky like that.\n\nNow, let's think about other possibilities. The bruising could also be from something like non-accidental trauma. That's a tough topic, but we can't ignore it, especially with these symptoms. We need to consider it, given the age of the child and the nature of the injuries.\n\nOh, and what about neuroblastoma? It can cause periorbital bruising, but usually, there are other signs too, like protuberances or systemic symptoms. We don't have any of that here, so it seems less likely.\n\nLet's not forget about vascular malformations. They can cause bruising and swelling, and they might explain the mass. It's possible, but we'd need more info to be sure.\n\nNow, back to the trauma idea. Could this be a subgaleal hematoma? Those can happen with head trauma and might explain the mass. They're usually not a big deal, but they can take a while to resolve.\n\nBut what if it's something more serious, like a leptomeningeal cyst? Those can happen with skull fractures and might cause a mass. It's a bit of a stretch, but it's worth considering.\n\nAnd then there's the possibility of a dermoid cyst. Those are usually present at birth, but they might not be noticed until later. It could explain the mass, but not really the bruising.\n\nOkay, let's put it all together. The most likely explanation is a subgaleal hematoma from the fall. It fits the symptoms and the timeline. Non-accidental trauma is still a concern, but there's not enough evidence to make it the top suspect. The other possibilities, like neuroblastoma and vascular malformations, just don't have enough supporting evidence right now. So, subgaleal hematoma it is.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 13-month-old boy with bilateral eyelid ecchymosis and edema, along with a mass on the right temporal area:\n\n1. **Basilar Skull Fracture** - This could explain the bilateral eyelid bruising due to the trauma described.\n2. **Subgaleal Hematoma** - A possible result of the head trauma, which could explain the mass and the delayed onset of symptoms.\n3. **Non-accidental Trauma** - An important consideration given the age of the child and the nature of the injuries.\n4. **Neuroblastoma** - Although it can cause periorbital bruising, it typically presents with other systemic symptoms or signs.\n5. **Vascular Malformation** - Could potentially cause bruising and swelling, but more information would be needed for confirmation.\n6. **Leptomeningeal Cyst** - A possibility if there was an underlying skull fracture, which could cause a palpable mass.\n7. **Dermoid Cyst** - Could explain the mass, but not the bruising, and is usually identified at birth or shortly after.\n8. **Caput Succedaneum** - Although typically seen in newborns, it could be considered if there was recent trauma.\n9. **Cephalohematoma** - Another consideration related to trauma, but it's usually more localized and resolves quicker.\n10. **Infectious Process** - Such as orbital cellulitis, although there are no signs of infection like fever or tenderness.\n\nReranking these based on the provided information, the top three most likely diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Subgaleal Hematoma** - Fits the symptoms and timeline well.\n2. **Basilar Skull Fracture** - Explains the bilateral eyelid ecchymosis.\n3. **Non-accidental Trauma** - Important to consider, but less likely without further evidence.\n\nThese diagnoses take into account the history of trauma, the nature of the mass, and the absence of other systemic symptoms.

His visual acuity was 20/400 OD and 20/20 OS. The anterior segments were quiet and vitreous was clear in both eyes. Fundus examination in the right eye revealed a solitary, elevated choroidal lesion with a creamy yellow appearance in the macular region involving the optic disc (Figure 1A). Ultrasonography confirmed a dome-shaped choroidal mass with intermediate echodensity measuring 14 mm in diameter and 4 mm in thickness (Figure 1B). Fluorescein angiography demonstrated scattered pinpoint hyperfluorescence of the mass and late leakage of the disc. Indocyanine green angiography revealed hypofluorescence in both early and late phases. Optical coherence tomography disclosed a choroidal mass with undulating surface and shallow subretinal fluid. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbit revealed an intraocular mass with hyperintensity on T1-weighted and hypointensity on T2-weighted scans with contrast enhancement extending into the adjacent retrobulbar fat, suspicious for scleral invasion. Blood test results including a complete blood cell count, tuberculosis, syphilis, and angiotensin-converting enzyme were all negative. The patient then developed gingivitis with a white blood cell count up to 12 350/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001) in the next 2 weeks that failed to respond to intravenous antibiotics. There were more pigments overlying the intraocular mass with prominent intraretinal hemorrhage along the optic disc compared with clinical findings at first presentation. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Langerhans cell histiocytosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 59-year-old Asian man who's been dealing with blurry vision in his right eye for a month. That's quite a while to have blurry vision, so it's definitely something significant. His visual acuity is really poor in that eye, 20/400, while the other eye is perfectly fine at 20/20. That's a big difference!\n\nNow, when we look at the fundus examination, there's this elevated, creamy yellow lesion in the macula of the right eye, and it's involving the optic disc. That's pretty specific. And the ultrasonography shows a dome-shaped mass, 14 mm across and 4 mm thick. That's a decent size for a choroidal mass.\n\nThe angiography results are interesting. We've got pinpoint hyperfluorescence and late leakage, which could mean a few things. And the indocyanine green angiography shows hypofluorescence, which is a bit more puzzling. The OCT adds more to the picture with a choroidal mass and some subretinal fluid. Hmm, that's a lot to take in.\n\nThe MRI is really telling. The mass is hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on T2, and it's extending into the retrobulbar fat. That sounds like it might be invading the sclera, which is concerning.\n\nAll the blood tests came back negative, so it doesn't look like an infection or something systemic like tuberculosis or syphilis. But then, the patient developed gingivitis and a high white blood cell count, and antibiotics didn't help. That's odd.\n\nNow, let's think about what this could be. Initially, I thought about choroidal melanoma. It's a common primary tumor in the eye, and it fits the description of a pigmented mass. But, usually, melanomas are more pigmented, and this one was described as creamy yellow.\n\nNext, I considered choroidal hemangioma. They can appear as yellow-orange lesions, but they typically don't invade the sclera, and this mass seems to be doing just that.\n\nMetastatic carcinoma crossed my mind too. These can appear as multiple yellow-white lesions, but we only have one here, and the MRI findings don't quite match.\n\nI also thought about choroidal osteoma, but they're usually more calcified and don't have this kind of MRI profile.\n\nHmm, what about lymphoma? It can cause a creamy yellow lesion, and the lack of response to antibiotics and the systemic symptoms like gingivitis could fit. But, lymphoma doesn't typically invade the sclera like this.\n\nMaybe it's a benign tumor like a choroidal nevus? But nevi are usually flat and don't have these aggressive features.\n\nI should also consider amelanotic melanoma. They can appear non-pigmented and have a creamy yellow color. They can be quite aggressive and invade the sclera, which matches our findings.\n\nOh, and there's the possibility of a granuloma, like in sarcoidosis. But, granulomas don't usually invade the sclera, and the systemic workup was negative.\n\nWait, what about leukemia? The gingivitis and high white cell count could be related to a hematological disorder. Leukemia can cause eye changes, including choroidal masses, and the systemic symptoms fit.\n\nSo, after thinking it all through, I'm leaning towards amelanotic melanoma. It matches the aggressive features and the creamy yellow color. But, leukemia is a close second given the systemic symptoms and lack of response to antibiotics.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the provided information, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the condition described:\n\n1. **Choroidal Melanoma** - This is a common primary intraocular tumor in adults and can present as a pigmented mass, although amelanotic variants can appear non-pigmented.\n\n2. **Amelanotic Melanoma** - A variant of melanoma that lacks significant pigmentation, often appearing as a creamy yellow lesion, and can be more aggressive with potential for scleral invasion.\n\n3. **Choroidal Hemangioma** - Typically appears as a yellow-orange lesion, but usually does not invade the sclera, which is a key feature in this case.\n\n4. **Metastatic Carcinoma** - Often presents with multiple lesions, and the MRI findings here do not strongly support this diagnosis.\n\n5. **Choroidal Osteoma** - Usually appears as a calcified lesion, which does not match the MRI profile described.\n\n6. **Lymphoma** - Can cause creamy yellow lesions and is associated with systemic symptoms, but typically does not invade the sclera.\n\n7. **Choroidal Nevus** - Benign lesions that are usually flat and lack aggressive features like scleral invasion.\n\n8. **Granuloma (Sarcoidosis)** - Typically does not invade the sclera, and the negative systemic workup makes this less likely.\n\n9. **Leukemia** - Can cause choroidal masses and is consistent with systemic symptoms like gingivitis and a high white blood cell count.\n\n10. **Tuberculosis** - Although the blood test was negative, it can present with a variety of ocular manifestations, including choroidal lesions.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top two differential diagnoses are **Amelanotic Melanoma** and **Leukemia**, given the aggressive nature of the lesion, the creamy yellow appearance, and the systemic symptoms. Amelanotic melanoma is the leading consideration due to the potential for scleral invasion and the specific MRI findings.", "topic": "['Hematology', 'Oncology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Choroidal Disorders', 'Retinal Disorders']"}

Results of a previous intestinal biopsy had shown unspecific findings and absence of apoptosis. He reported a 5-kg weight loss that he attributed to impaired intake owing to the oral lesions. He was also being evaluated for a mediastinal mass detected in radiography of the chest performed for pneumonia. Physical examination revealed whitish edematous lacy patches with erosions on the dorsal and lateral aspects of the tongue and buccal mucosa (Figure, A); skin and nails were not involved. A lingual biopsy specimen was obtained for pathologic evaluation and direct immunofluorescence (DIF; Figure, B and C). The result of indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) testing, using monkey esophagus, salt-skin split, and rat bladder as substrates, was negative. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblot analysis did not detect any desmoglein-1 or -3, bullous pemphigoid-180 or -230, collagen VII, desmocollin-1 to -3, laminin-332, envoplakin, or periplakin antibodies. Results were normal for liver function; negative for hepatitis B and C; indicative of hypogammaglobulinemia, with a decreased immunoglobulin (Ig) G serum level of 465 mg/dL (normal, 750-1600 g/L; for g/L, multiply by 0.01); and normal for IgA and IgM levels. Positron emission tomography revealed a 10-cm hypercapturing extrapulmonary mass (Figure, D).

We've got a man in his 50s who's been dealing with some pretty tough symptoms. He's had recurrent respiratory infections and diarrhea, and now he's got these painful oral erosions that have been bothering him for a couple of years. That's a lot to unpack.\n\nFirst, the oral erosions are a big clue. They could be pointing towards something like pemphigus vulgaris, which is known for causing painful mouth sores. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet.\n\nThe intestinal biopsy didn't show much, which is interesting. No apoptosis, so that might rule out some things like celiac disease, where you'd expect to see more damage to the intestinal lining.\n\nHe's also lost some weight, about 5 kg, because eating is painful with those oral lesions. That's concerning and suggests something systemic might be going on.\n\nNow, there's this mediastinal mass. That's a big red flag. A mass in the chest could mean a lot of things, but given his other symptoms, maybe it's related to an immune issue or even a thymoma, which can be associated with autoimmune conditions.\n\nThe biopsy of his tongue showed some kind of lacy, whitish patches with erosions. That sounds like oral lichen planus, which can cause similar lesions. But let's see where that leads us.\n\nThe immunofluorescence tests were negative, which is surprising. If it were pemphigus vulgaris, we'd expect to see some antibody activity there. So, maybe it's not that.\n\nThe blood work shows hypogammaglobulinemia, with low IgG levels. That's a sign of immune dysfunction. Could this be common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)? It would explain the recurrent infections.\n\nBut wait, there's also the thymoma. That's a type AB thymoma, which can be associated with immunodeficiency and possibly autoimmune issues. This could be a key part of the puzzle.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of oral erosions, hypogammaglobulinemia, and the thymoma makes me think of Good’s syndrome. It's a rare condition that involves thymoma and immunodeficiency, which fits his symptoms pretty well.\n\nSo, after considering everything, Good’s syndrome seems like the most likely diagnosis. It ties together the oral lesions, the immune deficiency, and the thymoma in a way that makes sense.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is Good’s syndrome. This condition is characterized by the presence of a thymoma and immunodeficiency, which aligns with the patient's symptoms of oral erosions, hypogammaglobulinemia, and the identified type AB thymoma. \n\nHere is a 10-step differential diagnosis list, considering the patient's symptoms and test results:\n\n1. **Pemphigus Vulgaris** - Initially considered due to painful oral erosions, but negative immunofluorescence tests make this less likely.\n2. **Oral Lichen Planus** - Suggested by the lacy, whitish patches and erosions in the mouth, but typically not associated with systemic symptoms like hypogammaglobulinemia.\n3. **Celiac Disease** - Considered due to gastrointestinal symptoms, but intestinal biopsy showed no apoptosis.\n4. **Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID)** - Hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent infections fit, but CVID doesn't typically present with oral erosions.\n5. **Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis** - Could explain oral lesions, but doesn't account for the thymoma or hypogammaglobulinemia.\n6. **Autoimmune Polyendocrine Syndrome (APS) Type 1** - Involves mucocutaneous candidiasis and autoimmune issues, but typically starts in childhood.\n7. **Selective IgA Deficiency** - Could cause recurrent infections, but normal IgA levels rule this out.\n8. **Thymoma-associated Myasthenia Gravis** - Thymoma is present, but myasthenia gravis doesn't typically cause oral erosions.\n9. **Paraneoplastic Pemphigus** - Associated with neoplasms like thymoma, but negative antibody tests make this unlikely.\n10. **Good’s Syndrome** - Combines thymoma and immunodeficiency, fitting the patient's symptoms of oral erosions, hypogammaglobulinemia, and thymoma.\n\nAfter considering all the information, Good’s syndrome is the most comprehensive diagnosis, as it accounts for the combination of the patient's symptoms and clinical findings.", "topic": "['Allergy and Clinical Immunology', 'Dermatology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology', 'Gastroenterology']"}

That's a long time, so it's not something that just popped up overnight. He mentioned getting some steroid injections way back when it started, which makes me wonder if that had any effect.\n\nThe groove is not just a simple line; it's depressed, and there's hair loss along it. That's interesting. He didn't mention any pain or discomfort, so it's likely not something inflammatory or painful like an infection or autoimmune issue.\n\nWhen I think about the dermoscopic findings, there are short vellus hairs and yellow dots. Hmm, yellow dots can be a sign of a few things, but they're often seen in conditions like alopecia areata. But wait, there's also honeycomb hyperpigmentation, which isn't something I'd expect in alopecia areata. And no broken hairs? That's a bit unusual for some common hair loss conditions.\n\nThe histopathology report is key here. The findings from the biopsies on both the scalp and forehead are identical. That suggests whatever is happening is consistent across the affected areas. I should focus on conditions that cause scarring alopecia, as the hair loss seems permanent.\n\nLet's consider some possibilities. Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA) comes to mind. It's known for causing scarring hair loss, especially in the central scalp area. But, it doesn't quite fit because CCCA usually affects the crown and not the forehead.\n\nHow about discoid lupus erythematosus? It can cause scarring alopecia too, but the patient doesn't have other typical symptoms like redness, scaling, or systemic involvement. Plus, the histopathology doesn't scream lupus.\n\nI should also think about traction alopecia. It's caused by constant hair pulling, but the patient denies any trauma or styling habits that could cause this. The lack of broken hairs also doesn't support traction alopecia.\n\nMaybe it's lichen planopilaris? It's another form of scarring alopecia, but I'd expect more inflammation signs, and the histopathology would show different features.\n\nOh, what about pseudopelade of Brocq? It's a bit of a mystery, but it fits the description of scarring alopecia without clear inflammation. The histopathology could match, showing scarring without other distinctive features.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of an old trauma or surgery causing this. The patient denies any history of trauma, but could he have forgotten something from 10 years ago? The linear nature of the lesion could suggest some kind of intervention.\n\nLet's not forget about the steroid injections. Could they have caused or contributed to the issue? Steroids can cause atrophy, but would they lead to this extensive scarring alopecia? It's possible but seems unlikely as the sole cause.\n\nAfter thinking it through, pseudopelade of Brocq seems like the best fit. It's a condition that matches the scarring alopecia and the lack of other symptoms. But I should keep an open mind. Maybe there's another explanation, like an unremembered trauma or the effects of those steroid injections. It's a complex case, and sometimes the truth lies in a combination of factors.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Pseudopelade of Brocq** - This condition is characterized by scarring alopecia without clear inflammatory signs, which aligns with the patient's presentation and histopathological findings.\n\n2. **Central Centrifugal Cicatricial Alopecia (CCCA)** - Although it typically affects the central scalp, the scarring and hair loss pattern could resemble CCCA, but the forehead involvement is atypical.\n\n3. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus** - While it can cause scarring alopecia, the lack of other typical symptoms like redness, scaling, or systemic involvement makes this less likely.\n\n4. **Traction Alopecia** - Caused by constant hair pulling, but the patient denies any such history, and the absence of broken hairs doesn't support this diagnosis.\n\n5. **Lichen Planopilaris** - Another form of scarring alopecia, but the lack of inflammatory signs and specific histopathological features makes it less probable.\n\n6. **Post-Steroid Atrophy** - The steroid injections could have caused localized atrophy, but extensive scarring alopecia seems unlikely as a sole result of this.\n\n7. **Folliculitis Decalvans** - Characterized by pustules and scarring, but the absence of inflammatory signs in this case doesn't support this diagnosis.\n\n8. **Dissecting Cellulitis of the Scalp** - Involves nodules and drainage, which are not present in this patient's case.\n\n9. **Tufted Folliculitis** - Presents with grouped hairs, but the patient's dermoscopic findings do not show this feature.\n\n10. **Linear Scleroderma** - Could cause linear depressions, but the lack of other systemic or skin manifestations makes this less likely.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Pseudopelade of Brocq** remains the most fitting diagnosis due to the scarring alopecia and absence of inflammatory signs. However, the possibility of the steroid injections contributing to the condition or an unremembered trauma cannot be entirely ruled out.", "topic": "['Hair Disorders', 'Connective Tissue Disease of the Skin', 'Dermatology']"}

He had immigrated from India to the US 15 years prior and worked as a software engineer. He last traveled to India 4 years earlier and had negative results for interferon gamma release assay on return. He reported no smoking history, recent animal contact, or unpasteurized animal product ingestion. His temperature was 38.05 °C; heart rate, 114/min; blood pressure, 132/85 mm Hg; and respiratory rate, 18/min. There was no spinal or paraspinal tenderness. Findings on pulmonary and neurologic examinations were normal. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 84 mm/h (reference, <10 mm/h), and C-reactive protein level was 9.4 mg/dL (reference, <0.8 mg/dL). A chest radiograph showed prominent reticular markings in the left perihilar area, and chest computed tomography showed a 3.2 × 2.6–cm dense consolidation in the left lower lobe (Figure 1, left panel). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine showed signal abnormality and extensive contrast enhancement within the T6, T7, and T8 vertebral bodies, with sparing of the T6-7 and T7-8 disks (Figure 1, center panel), and a large paraspinal soft tissue mass with spinal cord compression (Figure 1, center and right panel). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Pott disease (tuberculous spondylitis)", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 46-year-old guy who's been dealing with upper back pain for a while, and now he's also got a dry cough and some fevers. He's been to the doctor before, but the antibiotics he got didn't work. That's interesting. He moved to the US from India 15 years ago, which might be important. And he went back to India four years ago, but his TB test was negative when he returned. So, maybe not TB? But let's not rule it out just yet.\n\nHis vitals are a bit off. He's got a fever and his heart rate is pretty high. But his blood pressure is okay, and he's breathing normally. There's no tenderness in his back, which is a bit surprising given the pain he's in. His blood tests show high inflammation markers, which means something's definitely going on.\n\nThe chest X-ray and CT scan show some weird stuff in his lungs. There's a big consolidation in his left lower lobe. That could mean an infection or something else. And the MRI of his spine shows some really concerning things. There are abnormalities in a few of his vertebrae and a big mass pressing on his spinal cord. This sounds serious.\n\nSo, what could this be? Let's start with infections. Tuberculosis is a big one to consider, especially with his travel history. It can affect the spine and lungs, so it fits. Bacterial spondylodiscitis is another possibility. It's an infection in the spine, but it usually involves the disks, and this guy's disks are okay. So, maybe not that.\n\nFungal infections like histoplasmosis or coccidioidomycosis could be possible. They can cause lung issues and might spread to the spine. And we can't forget about brucellosis. It's not common, but it can cause spinal problems and is linked to animal exposure, although he said he hasn't been around animals.\n\nThen there are the inflammatory diseases. Sarcoidosis could be a contender. It can cause lung problems and might affect the bones, but it's not usually this aggressive. And there's ankylosing spondylitis, but it typically affects younger people and doesn't usually cause lung issues like this.\n\nCancer is another angle. Metastatic disease could explain the lung mass and spinal involvement. Lung cancer is a possibility, especially with the lung consolidation. And lymphoma could also fit, given the systemic nature of the symptoms.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Based on everything, tuberculosis seems like a strong possibility. It matches his travel history and the type of lung and spinal involvement. But we can't ignore metastatic cancer or lymphoma. They could also explain what's going on. And fungal infections, like coccidioidomycosis, are still in the running. This is a tough one, but tuberculosis feels like the most likely culprit.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with a focus on one potential diagnosis per step, without repetition:\n\n1. **Tuberculosis**: Given the patient's travel history to India, a country with a high prevalence of TB, and the combination of lung and spinal involvement, TB is a strong initial consideration.\n\n2. **Metastatic Cancer**: The presence of a lung mass and spinal abnormalities raises the possibility of a primary cancer with metastasis, potentially from the lung.\n\n3. **Coccidioidomycosis**: This fungal infection is endemic to certain regions and can cause both pulmonary and spinal lesions, making it a plausible differential.\n\n4. **Bacterial Spondylodiscitis**: Although the MRI shows sparing of the disks, bacterial infection of the spine remains a possibility, especially with the patient's symptoms and inflammatory markers.\n\n5. **Lymphoma**: The systemic nature of the symptoms and the potential for both pulmonary and spinal involvement make lymphoma a consideration.\n\n6. **Brucellosis**: Despite the lack of animal exposure history, brucellosis can cause spinal and systemic symptoms and should not be entirely ruled out.\n\n7. **Sarcoidosis**: This condition can affect the lungs and, less commonly, the bones, but it typically presents less aggressively than in this case.\n\n8. **Ankylosing Spondylitis**: Although it primarily affects younger individuals and doesn't typically involve the lungs, the spinal symptoms could align with this condition.\n\n9. **Histoplasmosis**: Another fungal infection that can cause lung and systemic symptoms, especially in endemic areas, making it a potential differential.\n\n10. **Spinal Osteomyelitis**: A bacterial or fungal infection of the vertebral bodies, which could explain the spinal findings and systemic symptoms.\n\nUpon reviewing all the information, the top three considerations would be:\n\n1. **Tuberculosis** - Given the patient's travel history and the pattern of lung and spinal involvement.\n2. **Metastatic Cancer** - Considering the lung mass and spinal abnormalities.\n3. **Coccidioidomycosis** - Due to the potential for both pulmonary and spinal involvement.\n\nThese three conditions best explain the combination of symptoms, imaging findings, and the patient's background.", "topic": "['Infectious Diseases', 'Pulmonary Medicine', 'Rheumatology', 'Tuberculosis', 'Radiology']"}

She reported neck swelling and an occasional dry cough but no fevers, chills, trismus, headache, dyspnea, chest pain, abdominal pain, fatigue, or rash. One week prior to presentation, she visited an urgent care clinic for evaluation of pharyngitis and white exudates on her tonsils. Results of a rapid strep test and heterophile antibody test (monospot) were negative. A throat culture was obtained and she was prescribed amoxicillin (500 mg twice daily for 10 days) for possible group A streptococcal infection. Despite taking antibiotics for 7 days, she had no improvement in her symptoms. One day prior to presentation, the urgent care clinic notified the patient that her throat culture results were negative. On presentation, the patient was in no acute distress and had normal vital signs. She had bilateral white tonsillar exudates and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, but no exudate was observed elsewhere in the oral cavity and the uvula was midline (Figure). There was no axillary or inguinal adenopathy and no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Infectious mononucleosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an 18-year-old woman who's been dealing with pharyngitis and these tonsillar exudates for a week now. She's also got neck swelling and a dry cough, but no fever or any of those other symptoms like chills or fatigue. That's interesting.\n\nSo, she went to an urgent care a week ago, and they did a rapid strep test and a monospot test, both of which came back negative. They even took a throat culture and put her on amoxicillin, just in case it was strep throat. But here's the thing, she's been on the antibiotics for a week and hasn't gotten any better. That's a red flag that it might not be strep throat after all.\n\nNow, let's think about what else could be going on. Infectious mononucleosis is a big one to consider, especially in someone her age. The negative monospot test throws a wrench in that, but we know those tests aren't perfect, especially early on. So, mono is still on the table.\n\nWhat about something viral? Adenovirus can cause similar symptoms, and it's not uncommon in young adults. But usually, you'd expect some fever or other systemic symptoms with adenovirus, and she doesn't have those.\n\nThen there's the possibility of a fungal infection like oral thrush. But wait, she's not immunocompromised, and she doesn't have any of those typical risk factors. Plus, thrush usually looks a bit different, more like removable plaques, and she's got these exudates that aren't budging.\n\nCould it be something like diphtheria? That's pretty rare, but it can cause these kinds of exudates. Although, you'd think she'd have more severe symptoms if that were the case, and it's not super common anymore thanks to vaccines.\n\nOh, and what about gonococcal pharyngitis? It's possible, but she said she's never had sexual intercourse, so that seems unlikely. Still, you can't rule it out entirely without more info.\n\nNow, let's not forget about lymphoma. It's a bit of a long shot, but someone her age with persistent lymphadenopathy and these symptoms could raise some suspicion. It's not something you'd see every day, but it's worth considering.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? We've got infectious mononucleosis still high on the list, even with that negative test. Adenovirus is a possibility, but it's not quite fitting perfectly. Diphtheria is a rare consideration, and gonococcal pharyngitis is unlikely but not impossible. Lymphoma is a thought, but it feels like a stretch without more evidence.\n\nAlright, let's wrap this up. Based on everything, infectious mononucleosis seems like the most likely culprit, despite that negative monospot. We should definitely consider doing more tests to rule that in or out. Adenovirus is our second guess, and then there's diphtheria, even though it's rare. Gonococcal pharyngitis and lymphoma round out the list, but they're not as convincing without more to go on.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 18-year-old woman with pharyngitis and tonsillar exudates:\n\n1. Infectious Mononucleosis\n2. Adenovirus\n3. Diphtheria\n4. Gonococcal Pharyngitis\n5. Lymphoma\n6. Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Pharyngitis\n7. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection\n8. Toxoplasmosis\n9. Syphilis\n10. HIV Infection\n\nAfter considering all the patient's symptoms and test results, the top differential diagnosis is Infectious Mononucleosis, despite the negative monospot test, as it is not always conclusive in the early stages of the disease. Adenovirus is the second most likely diagnosis, followed by the less common possibilities of Diphtheria and Gonococcal Pharyngitis.

She had an unremarkable ocular and medical history. On examination, visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/20 OS. Ocular motility was full and pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. Her examination was notable for a 3-mm subcutaneous, firm, mobile, noncompressible lesion near the lateral canthus of the right eye without overlying erythema, warmth, telangiectasia, or ulceration (Figure 1). The rest of the ophthalmic and orbital examination was normal. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Granular cell tumor, benign", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 44-year-old woman with a mass on the lateral canthus of her right eye. It's been growing for a couple of months and it's tender. That's interesting. She hasn't noticed any changes in her vision, and there's no trauma, redness, or discharge. Her medical history is unremarkable, which is good. \n\nOkay, so the mass is 3 mm, firm, mobile, and noncompressible. It's not causing any redness or warmth, and there's no ulceration. That's helpful to know. \n\nFirst, let's think about what this could be. A chalazion seems like a possibility. They're pretty common and can be tender. But wait, chalazia are usually caused by blocked meibomian glands, and they're often on the eyelid, not the lateral canthus. So maybe that's not it. \n\nHow about a sebaceous gland adenoma? These can be firm and mobile, and they're found in the eyelids. But they're not usually tender, and again, this is on the lateral canthus. Hmm, maybe not that either. \n\nLet's consider a papilloma. These are benign tumors that can occur anywhere on the eyelid, including the canthus. They can be firm and mobile, but they're not typically tender. Still, it's worth keeping in mind. \n\nWhat about a basal cell carcinoma? These can be persistent and growing, but they often have more noticeable changes, like ulceration or telangiectasia. This one doesn't seem to fit. \n\nOh, how about a benign fibrous histiocytoma? These are firm, mobile, and can be found on the eyelids. They might be tender, which matches our case. This is starting to sound more likely. \n\nBut wait, let's not forget about a squamous cell carcinoma. These can be firm and growing, but they often have more aggressive features, like ulceration. This doesn't quite match either. \n\nNow, let's think about a keratoacanthoma. These can grow quickly and be tender, but they often have a central crater, which this doesn't have. Hmm, probably not that. \n\nWhat about a pyogenic granuloma? These are usually more vascular and can be ulcerated. This doesn't seem to fit our description. \n\nLet's also consider a lipoma. These are soft, mobile, and usually not tender. But this mass is firm, so that's probably not it. \n\nFinally, how about a neurofibroma? These can be firm and mobile, but they're not typically tender. And they're not usually found on the lateral canthus. Hmm, maybe not. \n\nSo, after going through all these possibilities, I think the benign fibrous histiocytoma is the most likely diagnosis. It matches the description of being firm, mobile, and tender. Yeah, that seems to make the most sense.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the mass on the lateral canthus of the right eye, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Chalazion** - Although chalazia are common and can be tender, they typically involve blocked meibomian glands and are found on the eyelid rather than the lateral canthus.\n\n2. **Sebaceous Gland Adenoma** - These are usually non-tender and found on the eyelids, making them less likely in this scenario.\n\n3. **Papilloma** - While papillomas can be firm and mobile, they are not typically tender, which doesn't perfectly match the symptoms.\n\n4. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** - This is less likely due to the absence of ulceration or telangiectasia, which are common features.\n\n5. **Benign Fibrous Histiocytoma** - This is a strong contender as it can be firm, mobile, and tender, aligning well with the described mass.\n\n6. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - Similar to basal cell carcinoma, this usually presents with more aggressive features like ulceration, which are not present here.\n\n7. **Keratoacanthoma** - These often have a central crater and rapid growth, which doesn't match the description.\n\n8. **Pyogenic Granuloma** - Typically more vascular and possibly ulcerated, which doesn't fit the current case.\n\n9. **Lipoma** - Usually soft and non-tender, which doesn't align with the firmness and tenderness of the mass.\n\n10. **Neurofibroma** - While firm and mobile, neurofibromas are not typically tender and are rarely found on the lateral canthus.\n\nAfter considering all possibilities, **Benign Fibrous Histiocytoma** emerges as the most likely diagnosis due to its alignment with the mass being firm, mobile, and tender.

She's also got this rash that's been around for three weeks, and it's not just any rash, it's purpuric. Plus, she's experiencing tingling in her feet. And just recently, she's had eye pain and redness. That's a lot going on.\n\nNow, she's tried prednisone for four days, but no luck there. That's interesting because prednisone usually helps with inflammation. So, what's going on here?\n\nLet's see, she doesn't have any fever, which is good, and no issues like a runny nose or cough. She hasn't traveled anywhere recently or used any drugs. And she's not on any medications. That rules out some possibilities.\n\nHer vital signs are normal, but she's got swelling and tenderness in her joints, and her eyes are red. Hmm, those hemorrhagic vesicles and violaceous papules on her skin are a big clue. They're on her ears, nose, arms, and legs. That's quite a spread.\n\nThe lab results are mostly normal, which is a bit surprising. No issues with her blood count, electrolytes, liver enzymes, or urinalysis. And the urine toxicology screen is clear. So, it's not a systemic infection or a common metabolic issue.\n\nThe biopsy is really telling. It shows a superficial perivascular infiltrate of neutrophils with leukocytoclasia and extravasation of erythrocytes. Plus, there's fibrin in the small blood vessel walls. That's classic for a vasculitis. But, the direct immunofluorescence is negative for immune deposits. So, it's likely a pauci-immune vasculitis.\n\nOkay, let's think about what this could be. Initially, I thought about IgA vasculitis, but that's usually in kids and often has abdominal pain and kidney issues, which she doesn't have. So, that's probably not it.\n\nThen, there's polyarteritis nodosa. It's a medium-vessel vasculitis, but it doesn't usually have this kind of skin or joint involvement. Plus, the biopsy suggests small vessels, not medium. So, that's not a good fit either.\n\nHow about granulomatosis with polyangiitis? It can have joint and skin involvement, and eye issues too. But, it often has respiratory tract problems and kidney issues, which she doesn't have. And, the biopsy didn't show granulomas. So, that's not it.\n\nMicroscopic polyangiitis is another possibility. It's a small-vessel vasculitis and can be pauci-immune. But, it usually has kidney or lung involvement, which she doesn't have. So, that's probably not it either.\n\nErythema elevatum diutinum is interesting. It's a type of vasculitis that can be associated with infections or hematologic disorders. It presents with violaceous papules and plaques, which matches her skin findings. But, she doesn't have any known infections or blood disorders. Still, it's worth considering.\n\nOh, and there's also rheumatoid vasculitis. It's associated with rheumatoid arthritis, and she has joint pain. But, rheumatoid vasculitis usually has a longer history of arthritis and often other systemic features. So, it's possible but not the best fit.\n\nLet's not forget about drug reactions. She hasn't taken any new medications, but could it be something environmental? That's a stretch, but worth thinking about.\n\nRelapsing polychondritis could explain the joint and eye symptoms, but it doesn't usually cause a vasculitic rash. So, that's probably not it.\n\nSweet's syndrome is another idea. It's an acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, but she doesn't have a fever or the typical histology. So, that's not it.\n\nNow, let's think about the biopsy again. It shows leukocytoclasia and extravasation of erythrocytes, which is classic for vasculitis. But, the negative immunofluorescence suggests it's pauci-immune. That's important.\n\nConsidering everything, I think the best fit is erythema elevatum diutinum. It matches the skin findings and can be associated with underlying conditions, even if they're not obvious yet. It's not perfect, but it's the closest match.\n\nSo, after going through everything, I'm sticking with erythema elevatum diutinum as the most likely diagnosis.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnoses for this patient can be considered as follows:\n\n1. **Erythema Elevatum Diutinum**: This condition is characterized by violaceous papules and plaques, often associated with infections or hematologic disorders. The skin findings in this patient match this diagnosis, and it's worth considering despite the absence of known underlying conditions.\n\n2. **Rheumatoid Vasculitis**: Associated with rheumatoid arthritis, this condition can present with joint pain and skin manifestations. However, it typically involves a longer history of arthritis and other systemic features.\n\n3. **IgA Vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein Purpura)**: Although it's more common in children, it can present with purpuric rash, joint pain, and other symptoms. However, the lack of abdominal pain and renal involvement makes it less likely.\n\n4. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegener's Granulomatosis)**: This condition can involve joints, skin, and eyes, but it often includes respiratory tract and kidney involvement, which are absent in this case.\n\n5. **Microscopic Polyangiitis**: A small-vessel vasculitis that can be pauci-immune, but it typically involves the kidneys or lungs, which are not affected here.\n\n6. **Polyarteritis Nodosa**: A medium-vessel vasculitis that doesn't typically present with this pattern of skin and joint involvement, and the biopsy suggests small-vessel involvement.\n\n7. **Relapsing Polychondritis**: This condition can involve joint and eye symptoms but doesn't typically cause a vasculitic rash.\n\n8. **Sweet's Syndrome (Acute Febrile Neutrophilic Dermatosis)**: Characterized by fever and specific histological findings, which are not present in this case.\n\n9. **Drug Reaction**: Although she hasn't taken new medications, environmental exposures could be considered, but it's less likely without a clear trigger.\n\n10. **Undetermined Vasculitis**: Given the pauci-immune nature and lack of systemic involvement, an undetermined or atypical vasculitis could be considered.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Erythema Elevatum Diutinum** emerges as the most likely diagnosis due to the characteristic skin findings and the possibility of underlying, as yet unidentified, associated conditions.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Rheumatology', 'Connective Tissue Disease of the Skin', 'Ophthalmology']"}

Laboratory evaluation demonstrated a mildly elevated D-dimer level at 578 ng/mL fibrinogen-equivalent units, prolonged prothrombin time of 12.7 seconds, elevated phosphorus level at 6.8 mg/dL (of note, phosphorus was 3.1 mg/dL 1 month prior), and normal calcium level and kidney function. Other laboratory tests to note include cryoglobulin and cryofibrinogen, which both had negative results. Within weeks, there was rapid progression with skin necrosis despite treatment initiation with rivaroxaban. Physical examination revealed retiform purpura with areas of necrosis involving the bilateral lower extremities (Figure, A and B). A punch biopsy specimen from the right calf was obtained for histopathologic analysis (Figure, C and D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Calciphylaxis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 65-year-old woman with a painful skin eruption on her legs. She's been on pemigatinib for her cholangiocarcinoma for about two months. That's a fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitor, so it's pretty specific. Now, the skin issue started after she began this treatment, so that's a big clue.\n\nFirst, I'm thinking about the possibility of warfarin-induced skin necrosis. It's a classic condition where warfarin causes skin reactions, but wait, she's on rivaroxaban, not warfarin. So, that's probably not it. But it's good to consider because the skin necrosis is pretty striking.\n\nNext, I'm considering heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. It's a well-known reaction to heparin, but she's on rivaroxaban, which is a different anticoagulant. Still, it's worth keeping in mind because of the thrombotic nature of the skin findings.\n\nNow, let's think about the lab results. The D-dimer is elevated, which suggests some clotting activity. The prothrombin time is prolonged, which is interesting because rivaroxaban is an anticoagulant, but it's not typically associated with prolonged PT. Hmm, that's something to ponder.\n\nThe phosphorus level is elevated too. That's a bit unusual. Could it be related to the pemigatinib? I should look into whether pemigatinib affects phosphorus levels. High phosphorus can cause all sorts of issues, so it's worth exploring.\n\nCalciphylaxis comes to mind because it involves skin necrosis and can be related to abnormal calcium and phosphorus metabolism. But her calcium levels are normal, so that's not quite fitting.\n\nI should also think about vasculitis. It can cause skin necrosis and purpura, but the negative cryoglobulin and cryofibrinogen tests make that less likely. Still, I shouldn't rule it out completely without more information.\n\nParaneoplastic syndromes are another possibility. Her cancer treatment could be influencing her skin condition. Tumor-related processes can lead to all sorts of strange skin reactions.\n\nOh, and what about disseminated intravascular coagulation? It's a bit of a long shot, but the elevated D-dimer and prolonged PT could fit. It's a complex condition, though, and would likely have more systemic symptoms.\n\nNow, let's not forget about the possibility of pemigatinib-related effects. It's a targeted therapy, and these drugs can have unique side effects. I should check if there are any reports of pemigatinib causing skin reactions like this.\n\nFinally, I'm thinking about thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. It's a condition with microvascular thrombosis, which could explain the skin findings. But I'd expect more systemic symptoms and abnormal blood counts, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nSo, after going through all of this, I think the most likely explanation is a pemigatinib-related vascular toxicity. The timing with her starting pemigatinib and the nature of the skin reaction make it the most plausible cause. But I'm going to keep calciphylaxis and paraneoplastic syndromes on the list too, just in case there's more to the story.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the skin condition, considering the patient's treatment with pemigatinib and the laboratory findings:\n\n1. **Warfarin-induced skin necrosis** - Although the patient is on rivaroxaban, the presentation of skin necrosis is reminiscent of this condition.\n2. **Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia** - Despite the patient being on rivaroxaban, the thrombotic nature of the skin findings warrants consideration of this possibility.\n3. **Calciphylaxis** - The skin necrosis and elevated phosphorus levels align with this diagnosis, despite normal calcium levels.\n4. **Vasculitis** - The negative cryoglobulin and cryofibrinogen tests make this less likely, but it should not be entirely ruled out.\n5. **Paraneoplastic syndrome** - The patient's cancer and treatment could be influencing the skin condition.\n6. **Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)** - Elevated D-dimer and prolonged PT could fit this diagnosis, although more systemic symptoms would be expected.\n7. **Pemigatinib-related vascular toxicity** - The timing of the skin reaction with pemigatinib initiation makes this a strong consideration.\n8. **Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)** - Microvascular thrombosis could explain the skin findings, but more systemic symptoms and blood count abnormalities would be expected.\n9. **Antiphospholipid syndrome** - The elevated D-dimer and skin thrombosis could align with this condition.\n10. **Hypercoagulable state** - The elevated D-dimer and skin necrosis suggest a possible underlying hypercoagulable state.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Pemigatinib-related vascular toxicity** - The timing and nature of the skin reaction make this the most plausible cause.\n2. **Calciphylaxis** - Despite normal calcium levels, the elevated phosphorus and skin necrosis keep this diagnosis in consideration.\n3. **Paraneoplastic syndrome** - The patient's cancer treatment could be contributing to the skin condition.\n\nThese diagnoses take into account the unique aspects of the patient's medication, laboratory results, and clinical presentation. Further investigation and consultation with specialists may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide management.", "topic": "['Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology', 'Adverse Drug Events', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology', 'Hepatobiliary Disease', 'Targeted and Immune Therapy']"}

On presentation, the patient appeared anxious with a heart rate of 101 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 151/79 mm Hg, and pulse oximetry of 96% in room air. His cardiopulmonary examination results, complete blood cell count, basic metabolic panel, and cardiac troponins were all within normal limits.

We've got a young guy, almost 20, who's come to the ER with some pretty concerning symptoms. He's been having palpitations, chest pain, and shortness of breath for just a day. That's not something you want to ignore, especially in someone so young.\n\nFirst off, let's consider what could be going on. Palpitations and chest pain make me think of the heart right away. Could it be something like supraventricular tachycardia? That's a common arrhythmia in young people and can definitely cause these symptoms.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. What about other possibilities? Could it be a pulmonary issue, like a pulmonary embolism? That can cause shortness of breath and chest pain too. Although, usually, you'd expect some abnormal findings in the blood tests or imaging, and everything seems normal here.\n\nHmm, anxiety could be playing a role. This guy looks anxious, and anxiety can definitely cause palpitations and chest pain. It's something to keep in mind, especially since his tests are normal.\n\nNow, let's think about the EKG. It showed something, but we don't have the details. Could it be a sign of a ventricular arrhythmia, like ventricular tachycardia? That's more serious and would fit the symptoms.\n\nOh, and what about myocarditis? That's an inflammation of the heart muscle and could cause these symptoms too. But usually, you'd see some changes in the blood tests, like elevated troponins, which aren't present here.\n\nLet's not forget about aortic dissection. That's a serious condition where the layers of the aorta tear, causing severe chest pain. But it's rare in someone this young and usually comes with other signs, like blood pressure differences between arms.\n\nOkay, so what about pericarditis? That's an inflammation of the sac around the heart and can cause chest pain. But you'd often hear a pericardial friction rub on exam, and there's no mention of that.\n\nCould it be something as simple as a musculoskeletal issue, like costochondritis? That's an inflammation of the chest wall and can cause chest pain, but it doesn't usually cause palpitations.\n\nAnd then there's the possibility of a pneumothorax, where air leaks into the space around the lungs, causing chest pain and shortness of breath. But you'd expect to see something on the echocardiogram or other tests.\n\nLastly, let's consider long QT interval syndrome. That's a heart condition that can cause arrhythmias and fits the symptoms. But it's usually diagnosed with specific EKG findings, which we don't have details on.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top possibilities are supraventricular tachycardia, anxiety, and maybe a musculoskeletal issue like costochondritis. Those seem to fit best with what we know. But it's always good to keep an open mind and consider other possibilities too.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the young man's symptoms, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)** - This is a common arrhythmia in young individuals that can cause palpitations, chest pain, and shortness of breath.\n\n2. **Anxiety** - Given the patient's anxious appearance and normal test results, anxiety could be contributing to his symptoms.\n\n3. **Ventricular Tachycardia** - A more serious arrhythmia that could explain the symptoms, especially if the EKG showed any concerning findings.\n\n4. **Pulmonary Embolism** - Although less likely with normal blood tests and imaging, it's an important consideration due to the risk it poses.\n\n5. **Myocarditis** - Inflammation of the heart muscle that could cause these symptoms, though typically accompanied by elevated troponins.\n\n6. **Aortic Dissection** - A serious condition that's rare in young people but could present with severe chest pain; however, other signs are usually present.\n\n7. **Pericarditis** - Inflammation of the heart's sac that can cause chest pain, often accompanied by a pericardial friction rub.\n\n8. **Costochondritis** - A musculoskeletal issue causing chest pain, but it doesn't typically cause palpitations.\n\n9. **Pneumothorax** - Air in the space around the lungs causing chest pain and shortness of breath, usually visible on imaging.\n\n10. **Long QT Interval Syndrome** - A genetic condition causing arrhythmias, identifiable by specific EKG findings.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are **Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)**, **Anxiety**, and **Costochondritis**, as they best fit the clinical presentation and normal test results.

She first noticed swelling that progressed to pressure and dyspnea while supine. She reported fatigue but denied pain, voice change, weight loss, hemoptysis, and dysphagia. A physical examination revealed a visible and palpable fullness to the right neck without overlying cutaneous or sinus tract changes. Results of a complete blood cell count, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, triiodothyronine and levorotatory thyroxine testing, and a complete metabolic panel were normal. Ultrasonography showed a 7.9 × 6.3-cm septate cystic mass lateral to the right thyroid gland. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the neck demonstrated a large, nonenhancing cystic-appearing lesion abutting the lateral and posterior margins of the right thyroid lobe and extending from the level of the piriform sinus to the thoracic inlet (Figure). Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration revealed clear fluid with a parathyroid hormone (PTH) level of 67 pg/mL (reference range, <100 pg/mL; to convert to ng/L multiply by 1.00). A barium swallow study showed no communication between the cyst and the piriform sinus. Excision in the operating room was performed, and right thyroid lobectomy was necessary because of the intimate association of the lesion to the thyroid lobe. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Parathyroid cyst", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 44-year-old woman with a neck mass that's been hanging around for six months. It's on the right side and it's causing some pressure and trouble breathing when she lies down. That's interesting. She's also feeling fatigued, but there's no pain, no voice changes, no weight loss, and no other scary symptoms like hemoptysis or dysphagia. So, it's not screaming infection or cancer right off the bat.\n\nNow, let's see what the tests say. Her blood work is all normal, including thyroid hormones, so we can probably rule out a thyroid storm or something like that. The ultrasound shows a big septate cystic mass sitting next to the right thyroid gland. Hmm, that's a clue. It's not inside the thyroid, but right next to it. The CT scan tells us it's a nonenhancing cystic lesion that's pretty big and it's hugging the thyroid. It stretches from the piriform sinus down to the thoracic inlet. That's quite a span.\n\nThe fine-needle aspiration comes back with clear fluid, and the parathyroid hormone level is 67 pg/mL. That's within normal range, so it's probably not a parathyroid adenoma. Okay, let's think about what this could be. A branchial cleft cyst is possible since it's a lateral neck mass, but they're usually more superficial. A thyroid nodule or goiter could be in the mix, but the normal thyroid function tests make that less likely. A thymic cyst or a parathyroid cyst could fit, but the location and the fact that it's not enhancing makes me think otherwise.\n\nOh, and there's the barium swallow study. It shows no connection between the cyst and the piriform sinus, so that rules out a Zenker's diverticulum. That's good to know.\n\nNow, let's consider a laryngocele. They can extend into the neck and cause some compression symptoms. But, they usually have some air in them, and this one didn't show any air on imaging. So, maybe not that.\n\nWhat about a tracheoesophageal fistula? They can cause some weird symptoms, but they usually show up in kids, and this woman is 44. Plus, there's no sign of a fistula on the imaging. So, that's probably not it.\n\nA neurogenic tumor crossed my mind, but those usually show some enhancement on CT, and this one didn't. So, I'm not leaning that way.\n\nLet's not forget about a cystic schwannoma. They can be nonenhancing and cause compression, but they're not as common in this area. Still, it's worth considering.\n\nNow, what about a lateral thyroglossal duct cyst? They can be off to the side like this one, and they're not always in the midline. That's a possibility.\n\nAnd finally, there's the possibility of a plunging ranula. They can extend into the neck and cause some compression, but they're usually associated with the sublingual gland, and this one's too low for that. So, probably not.\n\nAlright, let's put it all together. Based on the location, the imaging, and the test results, I'm thinking this is most likely a lateral thyroglossal duct cyst. It fits the bill with the location and the fact that it's not enhancing. Yeah, that seems to be the best fit.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnoses for the neck mass in this 44-year-old woman can be considered as follows:\n\n1. **Branchial Cleft Cyst** - Given the lateral neck location and cystic nature, this is a plausible consideration.\n2. **Lateral Thyroglossal Duct Cyst** - Although typically midline, thyroglossal duct cysts can present off-center and fit the description.\n3. **Thyroid Nodule/Goiter** - Despite normal thyroid function tests, a nodule or goiter could still be considered, especially given the proximity to the thyroid.\n4. **Parathyroid Cyst** - The normal parathyroid hormone level makes this less likely, but it remains a possibility.\n5. **Thymic Cyst** - While possible, the location and nonenhancing nature make this less probable.\n6. **Cystic Schwannoma** - A nonenhancing, compressive mass could be consistent with a schwannoma.\n7. **Laryngocele** - Typically contains air, which was not observed in this case, making it less likely.\n8. **Zenker's Diverticulum** - Ruled out by the barium swallow study showing no connection to the piriform sinus.\n9. **Tracheoesophageal Fistula** - Uncommon in adults and not supported by imaging findings.\n10. **Plunging Ranula** - Usually associated with the sublingual gland and higher in the neck, making it unlikely.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the most likely diagnosis is a **Lateral Thyroglossal Duct Cyst**, given the location, cystic nature, and imaging characteristics.", "topic": "['Endocrinology', 'Thyroid Disorders', 'Diabetes and Endocrinology', 'Oncology', 'Endocrine Cancer']"}

Ultrasonography results showed a multinodular goiter with a dominant 4.6-cm right thyroid nodule, 1.6-cm left-sided thyroid nodule, and suspect left level IV lymph node. Ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy results showed papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) (Bethesda VI) with a BRAFV600E variation in the left nodule and lymph node, and atypia of undetermined significance (Bethesda III) with a suspicious Afirma genomic sequence classifier in the right nodule.

We've got a 50-year-old woman with a neck mass that's been hanging around for a couple of months. She's also experiencing hoarseness and that annoying globus sensation. When I hear about a neck mass and these symptoms, my first thought is thyroid issues. Thyromegaly with a noticeable nodule on the right side, that's something to pay attention to. No tenderness or cervical lymphadenopathy, which is interesting. \n\nOkay, so what could this be? My first guess is papillary thyroid carcinoma. It's pretty common, and the symptoms fit. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet. \n\nNow, let's think about the family history. A relative with papillary thyroid cancer at 50? That's a red flag for hereditary cancer syndromes. Medullary thyroid carcinoma could be a possibility here, especially with that family history. \n\nThe ultrasound shows a multinodular goiter with a dominant nodule on the right and a smaller one on the left. Plus, there's a suspicious lymph node. Hmm, that's concerning. \n\nThe biopsy results are in. Papillary thyroid carcinoma on the left with a BRAFV600E mutation. That's a pretty strong indicator. But the right nodule is a bit iffy with atypia of undetermined significance and a suspicious genomic classifier. \n\nSo, what else could this be? Well, follicular thyroid carcinoma is still on the table. It can be tricky because it doesn't show up as clearly on a biopsy. We need to keep that in mind. \n\nAnd let's not forget about Hurthle cell carcinoma. It's a variant of follicular carcinoma and can be sneaky. \n\nOh, and there's the possibility of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, but that's rare and usually comes with more aggressive symptoms. \n\nNow, considering the surgery and histology results, we have more to think about. The right nodule was partially circumscribed and soft. The left nodule was fibrotic, and there was another nodule in the isthmus. \n\nCould this be a benign nodule like a follicular adenoma? It's possible, but the biopsy results lean towards something more sinister. \n\nLet's not forget about metastatic carcinoma. Could this be a secondary cancer? It's rare, but it happens. \n\nAnd what about lymphoma? It's uncommon in the thyroid, but it could explain some of the symptoms. \n\nAfter going through all this, I'm thinking the top possibility is still papillary thyroid carcinoma. The biopsy and family history really point to that. \n\nBut I'm also considering follicular thyroid carcinoma. The atypia in the right nodule keeps it on my radar. \n\nHurthle cell carcinoma is still a contender, given the uncertainty of the right nodule's biopsy. \n\nAnaplastic thyroid carcinoma is less likely, but I'm keeping it in mind due to its aggressive nature. \n\nFollicular adenoma is a possibility, but the suspicious findings make me think it's less likely. \n\nMetastatic carcinoma and lymphoma are my wild cards. They're rare, but they could fit if other things don't add up. \n\nSo, after all this thinking, my top differential diagnosis is papillary thyroid carcinoma, followed closely by follicular thyroid carcinoma, then Hurthle cell carcinoma, and so on. It's a complex case, but that's where the evidence points.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the case:\n\n1. **Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma**  \n2. **Follicular Thyroid Carcinoma**  \n3. **Hurthle Cell Carcinoma**  \n4. **Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma**  \n5. **Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma**  \n6. **Follicular Adenoma**  \n7. **Metastatic Carcinoma**  \n8. **Thyroid Lymphoma**  \n9. **Benign Multinodular Goiter**  \n10. **Hashimoto's Thyroiditis**\n\nAfter considering all the clinical, family, and diagnostic information, the top differential diagnosis is **Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma**, given the biopsy results showing papillary thyroid carcinoma on the left with a BRAFV600E mutation and the family history of thyroid cancer. **Follicular Thyroid Carcinoma** and **Hurthle Cell Carcinoma** are also strong considerations due to the atypia of undetermined significance in the right nodule and the suspicious genomic classifier.

At age 8 months, she was treated with right enucleation and left eye radiotherapy (50.4 Gy). At age 4 years, she developed a recurrence of the retinoblastoma in the nasal cavity and was treated with 4 cycles of vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide followed by 1 cycle of cisplatin, etoposide, and intrathecal cytarabine. Primary care evaluation was prompted by her mother, as the patient had not noticed her lower extremity edema. She had no fevers, weight loss, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, or history of deep vein thrombosis. Her physical examination was notable for firm, nonpitting edema to the hip. She did not have any associated tenderness, inguinal lymphadenopathy, or palpable abdominal masses. Her vital signs were within normal limits and she ambulated comfortably. Laboratory work results, including a complete blood cell count with a differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, and D-dimer levels, were within normal limits. Doppler ultrasonography of her right lower extremity showed no deep vein thrombosis. A computed tomography venogram demonstrated a 4.0 × 3.5 cm mass of likely vascular origin that was extending into the right common iliac vein (Figure). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Leiomyosarcoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 33-year-old woman who's had quite the medical journey since she was a baby. She had retinoblastoma, which is a type of eye cancer, and it was treated pretty aggressively. Now, she's come in with swelling in her right leg. That's a bit concerning, especially with her history.\n\nFirst off, the swelling is firm and doesn't pit when you press on it. That's interesting because pitting edema usually makes you think of fluid retention or something like that. But this is different. And there's no pain or lymph nodes that are swollen, which is good because that might suggest an infection or something more systemic.\n\nThe tests she's had are pretty reassuring too. Her blood work is normal, and her D-dimer, which can hint at blood clots, is also fine. Plus, the ultrasound didn't show any clots in her leg. So, it's not a deep vein thrombosis, which is a relief.\n\nBut then there's this mass they found on the CT venogram. It's about 4 cm and it's in the right common iliac vein. That's a big clue. It's likely vascular in origin, which makes me think of things like a hemangioma or maybe even a leiomyosarcoma. Those are both possibilities because of where it is and what it looks like.\n\nNow, let's not forget her history of retinoblastoma. She's had radiation and chemo, which can increase the risk of other cancers later on. So, I have to consider that this mass could be something malignant, like a leiomyosarcoma or maybe a fibrosarcoma. Those are scary thoughts, but they fit with what we know.\n\nOkay, so what else could it be? A liposarcoma is a possibility too. Those can grow in the soft tissues and might not show a lot of symptoms until they're pretty big. And then there's the chance of a benign tumor, like a schwannoma. Those are usually not aggressive, but they can still cause problems depending on where they are.\n\nI should also think about the possibility of a desmoid tumor. Those are tricky because they're not cancerous, but they can act aggressively and cause a lot of problems locally.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top possibility is a leiomyosarcoma. It fits her history and the imaging. But I'm also considering liposarcoma and fibrosarcoma because they match the profile too. And I can't completely rule out a benign tumor like a schwannoma or a desmoid tumor, just because they can look similar on imaging and might explain the symptoms.\n\nIn the end, I think leiomyosarcoma is the most likely, but I'm keeping an open mind about the others until we get more information.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the mass found in the right common iliac vein, considering the patient's history and test results:\n\n1. **Leiomyosarcoma** - This is a strong consideration given the patient's history of radiation treatment, which increases the risk of secondary malignancies.\n\n2. **Liposarcoma** - This type of soft tissue sarcoma can present as a mass in the extremities or nearby regions and may not be symptomatic until it grows significantly.\n\n3. **Fibrosarcoma** - Another type of soft tissue sarcoma that could fit the profile of the mass found, especially in someone with a history of retinoblastoma and subsequent treatments.\n\n4. **Schwannoma** - A benign nerve sheath tumor that could present as a mass and might explain the symptoms if it is pressing on surrounding structures.\n\n5. **Desmoid Tumor** - Although not malignant, desmoid tumors can be locally aggressive and may present similarly on imaging.\n\n6. **Hemangioma** - A benign vascular tumor that could fit the description of a vascular origin mass.\n\n7. **Angiosarcoma** - A malignant vascular tumor that, although rare, could be considered given the mass's vascular characteristics.\n\n8. **Rhabdomyosarcoma** - A soft tissue sarcoma that could potentially occur in this region, especially in someone with a history of retinoblastoma.\n\n9. **Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma** - An aggressive sarcoma that could present as a mass in the soft tissues.\n\n10. **Neurofibroma** - A benign nerve tissue tumor that could present as a mass, although it's less likely given the vascular characteristics described.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Leiomyosarcoma** remains the top differential diagnosis due to the patient's history of radiation and the imaging findings.

She's not reporting any weight loss or feeling generally unwell, which is a bit unusual for something that's been going on for a while.\n\nFirst off, the combination of fever and skin lesions makes me think of some sort of inflammatory or vascular issue. Erythema nodosum comes to mind because it's pretty common and can cause red, painful nodules on the skin, usually the legs. But wait, she said the lesions are painless, so that doesn't quite fit.\n\nOkay, what about Sweet's syndrome? It's known for causing fever and tender skin lesions, but again, these lesions are supposed to be painful, and hers aren't. So, maybe not that.\n\nLet's think about something else. The presence of telangiectasias is a clue. That makes me consider vascular issues, like Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, which is a hereditary condition with telangiectasias. But, it's usually something you see throughout a person's life, not just suddenly appearing in someone in their 70s.\n\nHmm, what about erythema ab igne? That's caused by repeated heat exposure, leading to telangiectasias and a reticular pattern on the skin. It's possible, but it doesn't explain the fever.\n\nNow, let's not forget about infections. Fever and skin lesions could point to something like infective endocarditis. It can cause fever and vascular phenomena in the skin, like Janeway lesions or splinter hemorrhages. But, those are usually painful and not indurated plaques.\n\nOh, and there's also polyarteritis nodosa. It's a vasculitis that can cause skin lesions and fever, but the lesions are typically painful, and there are often other systemic symptoms, which she doesn't have.\n\nAlright, let's think about the biopsy. If it shows granulomas, that could point to granuloma annulare, which can have telangiectasias. But, it's usually not associated with fever.\n\nWhat about necrobiosis lipoidica? It's another granulomatous condition that can cause lesions with telangiectasias, often on the shins. It's not typically associated with fever either, but it's worth considering.\n\nNow, let's go back to the idea of a paraneoplastic syndrome. Fever and skin lesions could be related to an underlying malignancy. That might explain the systemic symptoms and the specific skin findings.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the most likely diagnosis is a paraneoplastic syndrome. It accounts for the fever, the unique skin lesions, and the lack of other systemic symptoms. Yeah, that seems to fit best with what we know.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Erythema Nodosum** - Although typically painful, it's a common condition that causes red nodules on the legs and can be associated with fever.\n2. **Sweet's Syndrome** - Known for causing fever and tender skin lesions, but the painless nature of the lesions in this case makes it less likely.\n3. **Osler-Weber-Rendu Syndrome** - A hereditary condition characterized by telangiectasias, but it usually presents earlier in life.\n4. **Erythema Ab Igne** - Caused by heat exposure, leading to telangiectasias, but it doesn't explain the fever.\n5. **Infective Endocarditis** - Can cause fever and skin manifestations, but the lesions are typically painful and of a different nature.\n6. **Polyarteritis Nodosa** - A vasculitis that can cause skin lesions and fever, but usually accompanied by other systemic symptoms.\n7. **Granuloma Annulare** - Could explain the telangiectasias if biopsy shows granulomas, but it's not typically associated with fever.\n8. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica** - A granulomatous condition with lesions that can have telangiectasias, but fever is not a common symptom.\n9. **Lupus Vulgaris** - A form of cutaneous tuberculosis that can cause skin lesions, but it's usually associated with other symptoms.\n10. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - Could explain the fever and unique skin lesions, potentially related to an underlying malignancy.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the most likely diagnosis is a **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**, as it accounts for the episodic fever, painless cutaneous lesions with telangiectasias, and the lack of other systemic symptoms. This diagnosis warrants further investigation for an underlying malignancy.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine', 'Hematology', 'Oncology', 'Hematologic Cancer']"}

Initially, he had horizontal diplopia on the first day that was worse at the end of the day, but this resolved when the right eyelid ptosis became complete. He denied any difficulty with his speech, swallowing, weakness, or sensory changes. He presented to the emergency department, and the emergency department physician reported a normal neurological examination result apart from the right-sided ptosis and limited eye movements. He was referred to ophthalmology and had a visual acuity of 20/20 OU. Both pupils were equal sizes and reactive to light. He was found to only have a complete limitation of elevation of his right eye and a limitation of abduction in his left eye (Figure). He was orthophoric in primary position, and there were no eyelid twitches. Orbicularis oculi strength was reduced on both sides. A dilated fundus examination had normal results bilaterally. An initial neurological examination, including assessments of motor strength in the upper and lower extremities and reflexes and a sensory examination, had normal results. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Ocular myasthenia gravis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 54-year-old guy who's suddenly dealing with right ptosis and double vision. That's pretty concerning. He's healthy otherwise and doesn't take any meds regularly, so this is out of the blue. \n\nFirst off, the double vision was horizontal, which makes me think about the muscles that control side-to-side eye movements. Those are typically the medial and lateral rectus muscles, controlled by the sixth cranial nerve, or abducens nerve. So, maybe we're looking at something with the abducens nerve. \n\nBut wait, there's also ptosis involved. That's usually about the third cranial nerve, the oculomotor nerve, which lifts the eyelid. So, it's not just about horizontal eye movement; there's more going on. \n\nThe fact that the ptosis became complete and the double vision resolved when the eyelid drooped is interesting. It suggests that the issue might be with the nerve that controls both eyelid elevation and eye movement. Hmm, that's pointing more towards the oculomotor nerve. \n\nNow, let's think about what could cause this nerve to act up. Aneurysm is a big one, especially since it can compress the nerve and cause these kinds of symptoms. But there's also the possibility of something like a diabetic third nerve palsy, though he didn't mention diabetes. \n\nOh, and there's the reduced orbicularis oculi strength on both sides. That's the muscle for closing the eyelids, controlled by the facial nerve. So, we've got another nerve involved here. This is getting more complex. \n\nWith both the oculomotor and facial nerves affected, I'm thinking about something that could impact both. A cavernous sinus thrombosis could do that since it's a spot where multiple cranial nerves pass through. \n\nBut wait, let's not forget about other possibilities like a brain tumor or central causes like a stroke. Those can affect multiple nerves too. \n\nNow, considering the normal neurological exam otherwise, it's less likely to be a big central nervous system issue. So, maybe we're looking at something more localized, like a neuromuscular junction problem. Myasthenia gravis could fit here, especially with the fluctuating symptoms and orbicularis oculi weakness. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I think myasthenia gravis makes a lot of sense. It explains the ptosis, the double vision, and the weakness in the muscles around the eyes. Plus, it's known for causing symptoms that vary throughout the day. \n\nYeah, that seems to fit well with what's going on. Myasthenia gravis it is.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's symptoms, with a focus on the key details of right ptosis, double vision, and reduced orbicularis oculi strength:\n\n1. **Oculomotor Nerve Palsy** - Given the right ptosis and limitation of eye movements, this is a strong initial consideration.\n\n2. **Abducens Nerve Palsy** - The horizontal double vision and limitation of abduction in the left eye suggest involvement of the sixth cranial nerve.\n\n3. **Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis** - This condition can affect multiple cranial nerves and could explain the involvement of both the oculomotor and facial nerves.\n\n4. **Diabetic Third Nerve Palsy** - Although the patient did not mention diabetes, this is a common cause of isolated third nerve palsy.\n\n5. **Aneurysm** - A posterior communicating artery aneurysm could compress the oculomotor nerve, leading to ptosis and double vision.\n\n6. **Myasthenia Gravis** - The fluctuating symptoms and weakness of the orbicularis oculi muscle are classic for this neuromuscular junction disorder.\n\n7. **Orbital Myositis** - Inflammation of the eye muscles could cause ptosis and limited eye movements.\n\n8. **Stroke** - A central nervous system event affecting the brainstem or cranial nerve nuclei could present with these symptoms.\n\n9. **Multiple Sclerosis** - Demyelinating disease could affect the cranial nerves and cause these neurological symptoms.\n\n10. **Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome** - Another neuromuscular disorder that could cause fluctuating weakness and ptosis.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnosis is **Myasthenia Gravis**, as it best explains the combination of fluctuating ptosis, double vision, and orbicularis oculi weakness.

Her symptoms were more prominent at night and in the quiet and improved when upright. Physical examination demonstrated an intact tympanic membrane with no middle ear mass; there was no neck mass palpated or bruit auscultated. The patient had further workup with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a computed tomographic scan (Figure 1). The patient was taken to the operating room for a right transtemporal biopsy. Operative findings demonstrated extensive tumor extending along the posterior fossa dura and deep to the jugular foramen that filled the area of the skull base. The tumor was debulked and sent for pathologic evaluation. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Plasmacytoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an 80-year-old woman who's been dealing with right pulsatile tinnitus and aural fullness for a year. That's quite a while to be experiencing these symptoms. Pulsatile tinnitus, that's interesting. It's often linked to something vascular, isn't it? And it's worse at night and when it's quiet. That makes sense because when it's quiet, there's less ambient noise to mask the sound. Hmm, and it improves when she's upright. That's a clue too. Maybe something related to pressure or blood flow?\n\nNow, let's consider what could be causing this. Glomus tumors come to mind. They're known for causing pulsatile tinnitus, especially the glomus jugulare or glomus tympanicum types. They're vascular, which fits the bill. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet.\n\nOkay, what about the physical exam? The tympanic membrane is intact, and there's no middle ear mass. That's good information. It means the issue might not be in the middle ear itself. And no neck mass or bruit? That's important too. It suggests we're not dealing with a carotid body tumor, which would likely present with a palpable mass.\n\nNow, let's think about the imaging. The MRI and CT scans must have shown something significant because they decided to go ahead with a biopsy. And the biopsy findings? Wow, extensive tumor along the posterior fossa dura and deep to the jugular foramen. That's pretty specific. This is pointing towards something aggressive and possibly vascular.\n\nSo, what are our options? Glomus jugulare tumor is high on the list. It matches the symptoms and the surgical findings. But we should consider other possibilities too. Meningioma could be a contender. They can be vascular and involve the dura. And what about a schwannoma? They're not usually vascular, but they can be found in this area.\n\nLet's not forget metastatic disease. At her age, we can't rule that out. It could explain the aggressive nature of the tumor. But would it cause pulsatile tinnitus? That's less common.\n\nAfter thinking it through, I'm leaning towards a glomus jugulare tumor. It fits the symptoms, the imaging, and the surgical findings. But I'm keeping meningioma and schwannoma on the list too, just in case. Metastatic disease is a bit further down, but it's still a possibility.\n\nSo, here's the final list: Glomus Jugulare Tumor, Meningioma, Schwannoma, Metastatic Disease, and then maybe things like Chondrosarcoma or Osteosarcoma, but they're less likely. That feels like a well-rounded differential diagnosis.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 80-year-old woman with right pulsatile tinnitus and aural fullness:\n\n1. **Glomus Jugulare Tumor** - This is a strong contender given the symptoms of pulsatile tinnitus, the involvement of the jugular foramen, and the vascular nature of the tumor.\n\n2. **Meningioma** - Meningiomas can be vascular and involve the dura, which aligns with the surgical findings of the tumor extending along the posterior fossa dura.\n\n3. **Schwannoma** - While schwannomas are typically not vascular, they can occur in this region and should be considered.\n\n4. **Metastatic Disease** - Given the patient's age, metastatic disease is a possibility, especially with the aggressive nature of the tumor, but it's less commonly associated with pulsatile tinnitus.\n\n5. **Chondrosarcoma** - This is a type of bone cancer that could involve the skull base, but it's less likely to cause pulsatile tinnitus.\n\n6. **Osteosarcoma** - Another aggressive bone tumor, but it's rare in this location and not typically associated with the described symptoms.\n\n7. **Paraganglioma** - Similar to glomus tumors, paragangliomas can be vascular and occur in the head and neck region.\n\n8. **Hemangioma** - A vascular tumor that could potentially cause pulsatile tinnitus, but it's less aggressive than what was described.\n\n9. **Eosinophilic Granuloma** - Part of Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis, it can involve bone and has variable presentations, but it's rare in this context.\n\n10. **Fibrous Dysplasia** - A bone disorder that can affect the skull, but it's less likely to cause the symptoms described.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top three most likely diagnoses are Glomus Jugulare Tumor, Meningioma, and Schwannoma, with Metastatic Disease and Paraganglioma also being notable considerations.", "topic": "['Otolaryngology', 'Audiology and Hearing', 'Skull Base']"}

Patches were confined to her face and neck and occurred intermittently after her last pregnancy approximately 10 years ago. She had no history of eczema, atopic skin conditions, or autoimmune conditions and denied family history of such. In previous evaluations, the areas were treated with petroleum-based creams, low- to medium-potency topical steroids, pimecrolimus, and topical antifungals, without consistent improvement. Physical examination identified multiple hypopigmented macules and subtle patches symmetrically distributed across the lower aspect of the forehead, cheeks, nasofacial sulci, and nasolabial folds; and along the jawline and neck (Figure, A and B). Many had a slight overlying scale that was tested with potassium hydroxide and was negative for hyphae. No hair or nail abnormalities were noted. A 4-mm punch biopsy of a hypopigmented patch on the right cheek was performed (Figure, C and D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Pemphigus foliaceous", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a Black woman in her 30s with these hypopigmented patches on her face and neck. They're itchy sometimes, and they showed up after her last pregnancy about 10 years ago. That's interesting. She doesn't have any history of eczema or autoimmune issues, and her family doesn't have them either. So, what could this be?\n\nFirst, I'm thinking about pityriasis versicolor. It's pretty common and can cause these kinds of patches. But wait, they treated her with antifungals before, and it didn't really work. Plus, the KOH test was negative for hyphae. So, that's probably not it.\n\nNext up, vitiligo comes to mind. It's known for causing depigmented patches, and it can definitely show up on the face. But, the thing is, vitiligo patches are usually completely white, not just hypopigmented. So, maybe it's not a perfect fit.\n\nThen there's post-inflammatory hypopigmentation. It's possible, especially since it can happen after skin inflammation. But, she didn't mention any inflammation before these patches showed up, so it seems a bit off.\n\nI should also consider leprosy, specifically the indeterminate type. It can cause hypopigmented patches, and it's more common in certain populations. But, there are usually other symptoms like sensory changes, and she didn't mention any of that.\n\nWhat about discoid lupus erythematosus? It can cause skin changes, but it's usually more about red, scaly lesions, not just hypopigmentation. Plus, there's no systemic involvement mentioned, so it doesn't quite add up.\n\nPiezogenic papules? Nah, they're more about papules caused by foot pressure, not hypopigmented patches on the face.\n\nNow, let's think about nevus depigmentosus. It's a possibility because it causes stable, hypopigmented patches. But, these patches usually show up in childhood, not after pregnancy, so that's a bit weird.\n\nChemical leukoderma is another one to consider. It's caused by exposure to certain chemicals, but she didn't mention anything about that kind of exposure.\n\nHow about lichen sclerosus? It can cause changes in skin color, but it's usually more about sclerotic, white patches, and it often affects different areas, like the genitals.\n\nLastly, there's sarcoidosis. It can cause skin changes, including hypopigmentation, but it's usually part of a bigger systemic issue, and she didn't mention any other symptoms.\n\nSo, after going through all of this, I'm leaning towards pityriasis versicolor, even though the KOH was negative. Maybe it was just a bad sample or the wrong time. It's still the best fit for what she's experiencing.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the hypopigmented patches on the face and neck of the patient:\n\n1. **Pityriasis Versicolor** - Despite the negative KOH test, this condition is common and can present with hypopigmented patches, especially in the described areas.\n\n2. **Vitiligo** - Known for causing depigmented patches, but typically these are completely white rather than just hypopigmented.\n\n3. **Post-inflammatory Hypopigmentation** - Possible if there was any preceding inflammation, though none was mentioned.\n\n4. **Indeterminate Leprosy** - Can cause hypopigmented patches, but usually accompanied by other symptoms like sensory changes.\n\n5. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus** - Usually presents with red, scaly lesions rather than just hypopigmentation.\n\n6. **Nevus Depigmentosus** - Causes stable hypopigmented patches, but these typically appear in childhood.\n\n7. **Chemical Leukoderma** - Caused by chemical exposure, which was not reported by the patient.\n\n8. **Lichen Sclerosus** - More commonly causes sclerotic, white patches in different areas.\n\n9. **Sarcoidosis** - Can cause skin changes, including hypopigmentation, but is usually part of a systemic condition with other symptoms.\n\n10. **Piezogenic Papules** - Unlikely, as these are related to pressure-induced papules, not facial hypopigmentation.\n\nAfter considering all the information, pityriasis versicolor seems the most likely diagnosis, despite the negative KOH test, as it aligns well with the symptoms and their distribution.

There was no surrounding erythema or edema. She received topical iodine for 2 weeks, during which time 4 new tense bullae appeared (Figure, left panel). Three bullae subsequently ruptured, while 1 remained intact. Drainage from the ruptured bullae was clear. She was advised to continue using iodine on the affected skin for wound care and was prescribed a 7-day course of oral cephalexin and a tapering regimen of low-dose prednisone.

Superficial cultures of the bullae were negative for bacterial growth. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Bullous pemphigoid", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 71-year-old woman who's been dealing with some itchy blisters around her knee incision site. It's been 8 weeks since her knee surgery, and these blisters are new and a bit unusual for her. She's not on any medications and doesn't have allergies, which is interesting. So, what could be going on here?\n\nFirst, let's consider the possibility of an infection. It's a common issue after surgery, right? But, she doesn't have a fever or any pain, and the cultures are negative. Hmm, that makes a bacterial infection seem less likely. But, let's not rule it out just yet. Maybe it's a less obvious infection, like a fungal one. Candida could be a culprit, especially since it can cause skin issues. But, we'd usually see some other signs, like redness or discharge, which aren't there. So, maybe not Candida.\n\nNow, let's think about allergic reactions. She's not taking medications, but what about something environmental? Could she be reacting to something like the iodine she's been using? Iodine can be irritating, but usually, we'd see more of a rash than these tense blisters. So, maybe it's not that.\n\nAutoimmune issues could be another angle. Bullous pemphigoid comes to mind. It's more common in older adults and can cause these types of blisters. The fact that she's not responding to antibiotics or steroids is interesting. Usually, bullous pemphigoid would respond to steroids, but maybe the dose was too low. Let's keep this one on the list.\n\nWhat about contact dermatitis? That could explain the blisters if she came into contact with an irritant. But, we'd usually see more of a rash, and it wouldn't typically happen weeks after surgery unless she started using something new. So, it's possible but not super likely.\n\nNow, let's consider dermatitis herpetiformis. It's associated with celiac disease and can cause itchy blisters. But, she hasn't mentioned any gut issues, which are usually part of the picture. So, maybe not this one.\n\nOh, and what about impetigo herpetiformis? That's more common in pregnant women, though, and she's not pregnant. So, that's probably not it.\n\nLet's not forget about linear IgA bullous dermatosis. It can cause similar blisters and doesn't always respond to steroids. It's a bit of a wildcard, but it fits some of the symptoms.\n\nNow, thinking about pemphigus vulgaris, it usually causes more widespread blisters and mouth involvement. She doesn't have any of that, so it's probably not this.\n\nLastly, there's epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. It can cause blisters similar to what she's experiencing, and it doesn't always respond to low-dose steroids. This might be a strong contender.\n\nSo, after going through all of this, I think bullous pemphigoid is still a strong possibility. But, I'm also leaning towards linear IgA bullous dermatosis and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita as potential diagnoses. They all fit the symptoms in different ways, and we can't rule them out without more testing.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 71-year-old woman with pruritic bullae around her knee incision site:\n\n1. **Bullous Pemphigoid** - This is a common autoimmune blistering disorder in older adults, characterized by tense blisters, which fits the patient's presentation.\n\n2. **Contact Dermatitis** - Although typically associated with a more acute rash, it could be considered if she came into contact with a new irritant post-surgery.\n\n3. **Linear IgA Bullous Dermatosis** - This condition can present with similar blistering and may not respond to low-dose steroids, making it a potential diagnosis.\n\n4. **Epidermolysis Bullosa Acquisita** - Characterized by trauma-induced blisters, it could be a strong contender given the patient's symptoms and lack of response to treatment.\n\n5. **Dermatitis Herpetiformis** - Associated with celiac disease, this condition causes itchy blisters, but is less likely without gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\n6. **Impetigo Herpetiformis** - More common in pregnant women, this is unlikely given the patient's age and absence of pregnancy.\n\n7. **Pemphigus Vulgaris** - Typically involves more widespread blistering and oral lesions, which are not present in this case.\n\n8. **Fungal Infection** - Although cultures were negative, a fungal infection could still be considered, especially if not all types were tested for.\n\n9. **Irritant Contact Dermatitis** - The use of topical iodine could potentially cause irritation, but the blistering is atypical for this diagnosis.\n\n10. **Autoimmune Progesterone Dermatitis** - Although rare and typically cyclical, it could be considered if there are unexplained hormonal influences.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are **Bullous Pemphigoid**, **Linear IgA Bullous Dermatosis**, and **Epidermolysis Bullosa Acquisita**, as they most closely align with the patient's symptoms and the lack of response to initial treatments.

There were no symptoms, such as tenderness or discharge, associated with the mass. She had no history of underlying medical disease or trauma. On physical examination, a 1.5 × 1.0–cm, firm, nodular, angulated, pinkish, nontender mass was observed in the posterior aspect of the right earlobe (Figure, A). The skin over the mass was semitransparent, and the mass moved freely beneath the skin. Under suspicion of a tumorous lesion, complete excision was performed after the patient received general anesthesia. Histopathologic findings were characteristic for 2 cell types; basaloid cells with a nucleus were present in the periphery, and ghost cells without a nucleus were present in the center (Figure, B). Six months after surgery, the wound had healed well, and there has been no recurrence. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Pilomatricoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an 18-month-old girl with a mass in her earlobe. It's been growing slowly over the past year, and there's no pain or discharge. That's interesting. It's firm, nodular, and has an angulated shape. Plus, it's pinkish and not tender. The fact that it's nontender and freely movable makes me think it's not something too aggressive.\n\nOkay, so what could this be? Let's start with the basics. A lipoma seems like a possibility. They're common, benign, and fit the description of being soft and movable. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet.\n\nNext, I'm thinking about epidermoid cysts. They're pretty common in children and can appear as firm, nodular masses. They're usually not painful unless they get infected, which fits our case since there's no tenderness.\n\nNow, let's consider vascular tumors like hemangiomas. They can be pinkish due to the blood vessels, but they often grow more rapidly or have phases of rapid growth, which doesn't quite match our slow-growing mass.\n\nWhat about dermoid cysts? They're another type of cyst that can occur in kids, often present at birth or early childhood. They can be firm and nodular, but they're not typically pinkish.\n\nOh, and we can't forget about pilomatrixoma. It's a bit less common, but it can present as a firm, nodular mass. The angulated shape and pinkish color could fit, especially since they can occur in the head and neck area.\n\nNow, let's look at the histopathology. We've got basaloid cells at the periphery and ghost cells in the center. That's a big clue. These findings are characteristic of pilomatrixoma. The ghost cells are actually a giveaway, as they're remnants of hair matrix cells.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the clinical presentation and histopathology point towards pilomatrixoma. It's a benign tumor, and the fact that it was completely excised and hasn't recurred in six months supports this diagnosis.\n\nIn the end, after considering all the possibilities and the histopathologic findings, pilomatrixoma is the most likely diagnosis. It's always important to match the clinical and histological findings to ensure accuracy.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the clinical presentation and histopathological findings, the most likely diagnosis for the mass in the earlobe of the 18-month-old girl is pilomatrixoma. The presence of basaloid cells at the periphery and ghost cells in the center is characteristic of this condition.

Dermoid Cyst\n6. Sebaceous Cyst\n7. Neurofibroma\n8. Fibroma\n9. Lymphatic Malformation\n10.

He had been experiencing nasal stuffiness for 2 years, which was aggravated 6 months before his initial visit. Endoscopic examination showed mild septal deviation to the left side and a well-demarcated, pedunculated mass on the posterior wall of the nasopharynx (Figure, A). His medical, surgical, and family histories were unremarkable. In addition, biochemical test and chest radiography results showed no abnormal findings. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Castleman disease", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 19-year-old guy who's been dealing with nasal stuffiness for a couple of years. That's quite a while to be dealing with that. It's gotten worse over the last six months, so something's definitely up. \n\nWhen they checked him out with an endoscopy, they found a mass in his nasopharynx. It's pedunculated, which means it's got a little stalk, and it's well-defined. That's interesting because it suggests it might not be something too aggressive, like cancer, which is often more irregular. \n\nNow, what could this be? The first thing that comes to mind is a nasal polyp. Those are pretty common and can definitely cause obstruction. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet. \n\nConsidering his age and the fact that it's been going on for so long, we should think about other possibilities. Young men can get things like juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. That's a non-cancerous tumor, but it can still cause a lot of issues. \n\nHmm, what about inverted papilloma? That's another one that fits the bill. It's a type of tumor that grows in the nasal passages and can cause blockage. It's more common in adults, but it's worth considering. \n\nOh, and there's also the possibility of a schwannoma. That's a nerve sheath tumor, and while it's not the first thing you'd think of, it can show up in the nasopharynx. \n\nLet's not forget about something like a hemangioma. Those are vascular tumors, and they can appear in the nasal area too. \n\nWait, what about malignant possibilities? It's less likely given the polyp's appearance, but we can't rule out something like a rhabdomyosarcoma, especially in a young person. \n\nNow, thinking about systemic conditions, something like Wegener's granulomatosis could cause nasal masses, but usually, there are other symptoms too. \n\nAlright, let's wrap this up. Based on everything, I'd say the top possibilities are juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma, inverted papilloma, and schwannoma. Those seem to fit his age and the mass's characteristics the best. \n\nBut, let's not forget about nasal polyps and hemangiomas. They're still in the running, just a bit further down the list. \n\nAnd there you have it, a list of possibilities that make sense given what we know.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 19-year-old man with a nasopharyngeal mass:\n\n1. **Nasal Polyp** - A common cause of nasal obstruction, often seen in young adults.\n2. **Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma** - A benign but locally aggressive vascular tumor, common in adolescent males.\n3. **Inverted Papilloma** - A benign epithelial tumor that can cause nasal obstruction and is more common in adults.\n4. **Schwannoma** - A nerve sheath tumor that can occur in the nasopharynx, though less commonly.\n5. **Hemangioma** - A vascular tumor that can appear in the nasal area.\n6. **Rhabdomyosarcoma** - A malignant tumor more commonly seen in children and young adults, though less likely given the mass's appearance.\n7. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)** - A systemic condition that can cause nasal masses, but usually accompanied by other symptoms.\n8. **Antrochoanal Polyp** - A type of nasal polyp that can cause unilateral obstruction.\n9. **Oncocytoma** - A rare, benign tumor that can occur in the nasal cavity.\n10. **Papillary Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - A malignant tumor, less likely given the patient's age and mass characteristics.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are **Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma**, **Inverted Papilloma**, and **Schwannoma**, as they best fit the patient's age and the mass's characteristics. Nasal polyps and hemangiomas are also plausible, though slightly lower on the list. Malignant possibilities like rhabdomyosarcoma and papillary squamous cell carcinoma are less likely but should not be entirely ruled out without further investigation.", "topic": "['Otolaryngology', 'Rhinology and Sinus Disease', 'Pediatrics', 'Adolescent Medicine']"}

Her medical history included kappa light chain multiple myeloma refractory to multiple chemotherapeutic regimens. She had been admitted 4 months earlier with similar symptoms of facial pain and sinus pressure. At that time, she was found to have persistent sinus mucormycosis, which required multiple rounds of surgical debridement. On this admission, her vital signs were stable, and she was afebrile. Laboratory test results showed a white blood cell count of 0.97 × 109 per liter with absolute neutrophil count of 650 × 106 per liter and platelet level of 17 × 109 per liter. A computed tomography scan showed complete opacification of the left paranasal sinuses (Figure, A). The patient underwent surgical debridement, and a prominent erythematous soft-tissue mass was seen in her left nasal vestibule (Figure, B). The nasal mass was resected for pathologic analysis (Figure, C). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Extramedullary plasmacytoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her 50s who's come to the hospital with some pretty concerning symptoms. She's got nasal congestion on the left side, facial pain, and numbness in her cheek. That's definitely not comfortable. Now, she's got a history of kappa light chain multiple myeloma, and it's refractory, meaning it's not responding well to treatments. That's a big red flag because it means her immune system is likely compromised. \n\nNow, let's think about what happened the last time she had similar symptoms. Four months ago, she was admitted with facial pain and sinus pressure, and it turned out she had persistent sinus mucormycosis. That's a serious fungal infection, and it required surgical debridement. That's a pretty big deal. So, could it be mucormycosis again? It's definitely possible, given her history and her current symptoms. \n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions just yet. Her vital signs are stable, and she's not running a fever. That's interesting because you'd expect some signs of infection like a fever, right? But, with her low white blood cell count and neutrophils, she might not be able to mount a typical immune response. That makes sense given her myeloma. \n\nThe CT scan shows complete opacification of the left paranasal sinuses. That sounds pretty serious. It could mean a lot of things, like an infection or maybe even something like a tumor. And then there's this prominent erythematous soft-tissue mass in her left nasal vestibule. That's a new finding, and it's definitely concerning. They resected it for pathology, which is good because we need more information. \n\nSo, what could this be? Well, given her history, mucormycosis is still high on the list. But we should also consider other possibilities. Aspergillosis is another fungal infection that could present similarly. And then there's the possibility of a bacterial infection, maybe even necrotizing fasciitis. That's a severe condition that can progress rapidly. \n\nOh, and let's not forget about the possibility of a tumor. Her myeloma could cause lesions, or maybe even a new malignancy like a squamous cell carcinoma. That would fit with the mass they found. \n\nNow, let's think about the pathology report. It showed necrotic tissue with non-septate hyphae. That's a big clue. Non-septate hyphae are characteristic of mucormycosis. So, it seems like we're back to that again. \n\nBut wait, let's make sure we're not missing anything. We should consider other infections, like aspergillosis, which shows septate hyphae. And bacterial infections could show necrotic tissue too. \n\nIn the end, given her history and the pathology findings, mucormycosis seems like the most likely diagnosis. But we should keep an open mind and make sure we're not missing anything else. \n\nSo, here's where we stand: mucormycosis is at the top of the list, followed by aspergillosis, bacterial infections like necrotizing fasciitis, and then the possibility of a tumor. It's a complex case, and we need to be thorough.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, considering her complex medical history and current symptoms:\n\n1. **Mucormycosis** - Given her history of sinus mucormycosis and the current symptoms, this fungal infection remains highly suspect.\n\n2. **Aspergillosis** - Another fungal infection that could present with similar symptoms, especially in an immunocompromised patient.\n\n3. **Necrotizing Fasciitis** - A severe bacterial infection that can cause rapid tissue necrosis and is a concern given her compromised immune status.\n\n4. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - The mass in the nasal vestibule could potentially be a malignant tumor, which is a possibility in this patient.\n\n5. **Bacterial Sinusitis** - While less severe than mucormycosis or necrotizing fasciitis, bacterial sinusitis could still cause significant symptoms.\n\n6. **Wegener's Granulomatosis** - Now known as Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis, this condition can cause sinus involvement and necrosis.\n\n7. **T-cell Lymphoma** - Given her hematological history, a lymphoma involving the nasal region is a consideration.\n\n8. **Pseudomonas Sinusitis** - A bacterial infection that could be aggressive in an immunocompromised host.\n\n9. **Fusariosis** - Another fungal infection that can occur in patients with compromised immune systems.\n\n10. **Extramedullary Hematopoiesis** - Given her myeloma, this is a possibility where hematopoietic tissue forms outside the bone marrow.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses, in order of likelihood, are:\n\n1. **Mucormycosis** - The history and pathology findings strongly suggest this diagnosis.\n2. **Aspergillosis** - A close second given the similar presentation and the patient's immunocompromised state.\n3. **Necrotizing Fasciitis** - A serious bacterial infection that could rapidly progress in this patient.\n4. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - The nasal mass raises the suspicion of a malignant process.\n5. **Bacterial Sinusitis** - A common infection that could be severe in this context.\n\nThe remaining diagnoses, while possible, are less likely given the specific findings and history in this case.", "topic": "['Myeloma', 'Oncology', 'Hematology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Head and Neck Surgery']"}

Earlier that day she had upper-back muscle spasms while gardening. A few hours later, she developed weakness of both hands and legs, followed by urinary retention and saddle anesthesia. On arrival to the emergency department, the patient was febrile but hemodynamically stable. On physical examination, she had areflexia and weakness affecting all 4 limbs, with a sensory deficit distal to the T4 dermatome. Proprioception and vibratory sensation were intact throughout. Speech, comprehension, and cranial nerves were intact. Laboratory test results revealed elevated levels of inflammatory markers. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, including white and red blood cell counts, protein and glucose levels, infectious studies, and cytologic testing, was unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the total spine showed vertebral body metastases unchanged from a computed tomography scan obtained 8 months prior (Figure 1), multiple areas of new leptomeningeal enhancement around the distal spinal cord, and tumor infiltration of multiple vertebral bodies. An electromyogram showed grossly preserved motor conduction in the upper and lower extremities. F wave latencies (a measure of nerve conduction velocity between the spine and limb) were undetectable in the upper extremities and were normal in the lower extremities, suggesting upper motor neuron disease. Sensory conduction amplitudes of upper and lower extremity peripheral nerves were mildly decreased. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Spinal cord infarct", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 39-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer who's suddenly paralyzed. That's pretty alarming. She was doing some gardening earlier and had muscle spasms in her upper back. Then, things got worse with weakness in her hands and legs, and she couldn't pee. Plus, she's got that saddle anesthesia, which is a big red flag for something neurological.\n\nNow, she's on this anti-ERBB2 chemotherapy, which is pretty specific for her type of breast cancer. I wonder if that could be playing a role here. But let's not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nWhen she gets to the hospital, she's running a fever but otherwise stable. The physical exam shows she's got no reflexes and weakness in all four limbs. That's a lot of neurological stuff going on. But interestingly, her sensation of proprioception and vibration is intact. That's a clue! It means the problem might be more with the motor side of things, maybe the anterior spinal cord.\n\nHer speech and cranial nerves are fine, so it's likely something below the neck. The sensory deficit is below T4, so we're looking at something in the thoracic spine area.\n\nThe lab tests show high inflammatory markers. That could mean infection or inflammation, but let's see what else we've got. The CSF analysis is totally unremarkable. No infection or bleeding there, which is good. It means we can probably rule out things like meningitis or a hemorrhage.\n\nThe MRI shows some concerning stuff. There are vertebral body metastases, which aren't new, but there's also new leptomeningeal enhancement around the distal spinal cord. That sounds like tumor spread, which could definitely cause these symptoms.\n\nThe EMG results are interesting. They suggest an upper motor neuron issue because the F wave latencies are off in the upper extremities. Sensory conduction is a bit decreased, but not dramatically so.\n\nSo, what could this be? Let's start with the obvious. Metastatic spinal cord compression is high on the list. The MRI shows tumor spread, and that's a known complication of metastatic cancer.\n\nBut wait, there's also the possibility of chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. That anti-ERBB2 drug could be causing some nerve damage. But usually, that's more of a gradual process, not this sudden paralysis.\n\nWhat about transverse myelitis? That's an inflammation thing that could cause these symptoms. But the CSF is clear, so no inflammation markers there. Hmm, that makes it less likely.\n\nGuillain-Barré syndrome is another thought. It's an autoimmune reaction that can cause paralysis, but it usually starts in the legs and works its way up. Plus, we'd expect to see more abnormal CSF findings.\n\nLet's not forget about spinal epidural abscess. That's an infection that could compress the spinal cord. But again, the CSF doesn't show any infection signs, and she's not septic.\n\nNow, could this be a conversion disorder? That's a psychological condition that can cause neurological symptoms. But it seems unlikely given the acute onset and the objective findings on MRI.\n\nOkay, what about radiation myelopathy? If she's had radiation therapy, that could cause spinal cord damage. But we don't have any info on radiation, so it's a shot in the dark.\n\nAnd then there's the possibility of a paraneoplastic syndrome. That's when the cancer triggers an autoimmune response. It could fit, but we'd probably see more systemic symptoms.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Based on everything, metastatic spinal cord compression seems like the most likely cause. The MRI shows tumor spread, and it matches her symptoms. But we can't completely rule out chemotherapy-induced neuropathy or a paraneoplastic syndrome. They're less likely, but they could still be contributing factors.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Metastatic Spinal Cord Compression** - Given the patient's history of metastatic breast cancer and the MRI findings of leptomeningeal enhancement and vertebral body metastases, this is a strong contender.\n\n2. **Chemotherapy-induced Neuropathy** - The patient's treatment with anti-ERBB2 chemotherapy could potentially cause nerve damage, although this typically presents more gradually.\n\n3. **Transverse Myelitis** - An inflammatory condition affecting the spinal cord, but the unremarkable CSF analysis makes this less likely.\n\n4. **Guillain-Barré Syndrome** - An autoimmune condition leading to paralysis, but it usually starts in the lower limbs and CSF findings would typically show albuminocytologic dissociation.\n\n5. **Spinal Epidural Abscess** - An infection compressing the spinal cord, but the lack of infection signs in the CSF and absence of sepsis make this unlikely.\n\n6. **Conversion Disorder** - A psychological condition causing neurological symptoms, but the acute onset and objective MRI findings argue against this.\n\n7. **Radiation Myelopathy** - Possible if the patient had prior radiation therapy, but there's no information on this in the history.\n\n8. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - An autoimmune response triggered by cancer, which could fit, but typically involves more systemic symptoms.\n\n9. **Acute Motor Neuron Disease** - Conditions like acute flaccid paralysis could be considered, but the EMG findings and sensory involvement do not fully support this.\n\n10. **Infectious Meningitis** - Although the CSF is unremarkable, atypical or chronic infections could still present subtly, so it remains a consideration.\n\nReranking these based on all available information, the top three most likely diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Metastatic Spinal Cord Compression** - The MRI findings and clinical presentation make this the most probable cause.\n\n2. **Chemotherapy-induced Neuropathy** - While less likely than metastatic compression, it remains a plausible contributor given the treatment history.\n\n3. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - This could be an underlying factor given the cancer history and neurological symptoms, although less directly linked than the top two options.\n\nThese three diagnoses best explain the combination of the patient's symptoms, treatment history, and imaging findings.", "topic": "['Breast Cancer', 'Neurology', 'Oncology', 'Spinal Cord Disorders', \"Women's Health\"]"}

His medical history included alcohol intake of 2 to 4 drinks daily for several years that had stopped 10 years before admission, hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, dilated ischemic cardiomyopathy, and a stroke 12 years earlier and recovered without sequelae. His medications included omeprazole, furosemide, atorvastatin, allopurinol, metformin, levetiracetam, and acenocoumarol. Physical examination revealed confusion, dysarthria, appendicular dysmetria with truncal ataxia, and downbeat nystagmus. He was well nourished. Results of blood tests showed a mild creatinine increase of 1.62 mg/dL (normal range, 0.4-1.2 mg/dL; to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4), serum phosphate levels of 2.4 mg/dL (normal range, 2.5-4.5 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.323), corrected calcium levels of 7.1 mg/dL (normal range, 9.0-10.5 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.25), and serum magnesium levels of 0.3 mg/dL (normal range, 1.8-2.5 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.4114).

Cerebrospinal fluid levels were normal, including proteins, glucose, and cell count; polymerase chain reaction for herpes viruses; and enterovirus.

We've got a 63-year-old man who's been feeling really unsteady, along with some other symptoms like malaise, not wanting to eat, feeling nauseous, and even vomiting. That's been going on for about a month. He's also had some pretty serious stuff happen recently, like pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, a seizure, and these weird episodes with stiffness in his arms. Plus, he had some gastrointestinal bleeding. That's a lot to take in.\n\nNow, looking at his medical history, he used to drink quite a bit but stopped 10 years ago. He's got hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, heart problems, and had a stroke a while back. He's on a bunch of medications too. When we examine him, he's confused, has trouble speaking, can't coordinate his movements, and has this downbeat nystagmus thing going on. He's well-nourished, so it's not like he's malnourished or anything.\n\nHis blood tests show some interesting things. His creatinine is a bit high, which might mean his kidneys aren't working perfectly. His phosphate is on the low side, calcium is really low, and magnesium is super low. But his liver and thyroid tests are normal, and so are his electrolytes and some other vitamins. Hmm, that's something to think about.\n\nThe cerebrospinal fluid tests are all normal, which is good because it rules out some infections or autoimmune issues. And there are no signs of cancer or neuronal antibodies, which is a relief. The whole-body CT and EEG are normal too. But the brain MRI shows some hyperintensity in the cerebellum. That's a clue.\n\nSo, what could be going on here? Let's start with the basics. Hypomagnesemia can cause all sorts of neurological symptoms, so that's a strong contender. But wait, there's also the low calcium. Could it be hypoparathyroidism? That would fit with the low calcium and neurological symptoms. But then, why the low magnesium?\n\nMaybe it's some kind of malabsorption issue. Celiac disease could cause that, but there's no gut symptoms or positive antibodies. What about renal tubular acidosis? That could mess with electrolytes, but it doesn't quite fit with everything.\n\nOh, and what about medications? He's on a proton pump inhibitor, which can cause low magnesium. That might be it. But then, why the low calcium? It's not typical for PPIs to cause that.\n\nLet's think about other possibilities. Could it be some kind of paraneoplastic syndrome? But we didn't find any antibodies or signs of cancer. What about a mitochondrial disorder? They can cause weird neurological symptoms, but usually, there are other signs too.\n\nOkay, let's focus on the electrolytes. The low magnesium and calcium could be from a hormone issue, like hypoparathyroidism or maybe pseudohypoparathyroidism. But then, there's the normal phosphate, which doesn't quite fit.\n\nWait, what if it's something rare like Wilson's disease? That can cause neurological symptoms and affect copper metabolism, but it doesn't explain the electrolytes. Hmm, that's a tough one.\n\nLet's go back to the PPIs. They can definitely cause hypomagnesemia, and maybe the low calcium is secondary to that. It's not perfect, but it fits more than anything else. So, I'm thinking it's likely a side effect of the proton pump inhibitor causing the electrolyte imbalances and symptoms. That seems to be the best fit for now.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnosis for this patient can be developed as follows:\n\n1. **Hypomagnesemia due to Proton Pump Inhibitor Use**: The patient's low magnesium levels and associated neurological symptoms, combined with his use of a proton pump inhibitor, strongly suggest this as a primary consideration.\n\n2. **Hypoparathyroidism**: The low calcium levels, in conjunction with neurological symptoms, raise the possibility of hypoparathyroidism, although the normal phosphate level is somewhat atypical.\n\n3. **Renal Tubular Acidosis**: This condition can cause electrolyte imbalances, but it doesn't fully align with the patient's presentation and normal kidney function tests.\n\n4. **Celiac Disease**: Although there are no gastrointestinal symptoms or positive antibodies, malabsorption could potentially explain the electrolyte abnormalities.\n\n5. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**: The absence of detectable antibodies or cancer makes this less likely, but it remains a consideration given the neurological involvement.\n\n6. **Mitochondrial Disorder**: These disorders can present with neurological symptoms, but typically, there are other systemic signs or abnormal test results.\n\n7. **Pseudohypoparathyroidism**: This could explain the low calcium and magnesium, but the normal phosphate and lack of characteristic physical features make it less likely.\n\n8. **Wilson's Disease**: Although it can cause neurological symptoms, it doesn't typically affect calcium and magnesium levels in this way.\n\n9. **Medication-Induced Electrolyte Imbalance**: Besides PPIs, other medications could contribute to electrolyte disturbances, but none are as strongly linked as PPIs with hypomagnesemia.\n\n10. **Idiopathic Hypocalcemia**: This is a possibility if other causes are ruled out, but it doesn't explain the hypomagnesemia.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the most likely diagnosis is **Hypomagnesemia due to Proton Pump Inhibitor Use**, with secondary effects on calcium levels.

Bedside flexible endoscopy findings revealed a fleshy supraglottic mass obscuring a view of the glottis. The patient’s airway was secured in the operating room with an endotracheal tube over a 0° Hopkins rod. The mass was pedunculated on the lingual surface of the epiglottis and had areas of high vascularity and other areas of thrombosis (Figure, A). The vallecula, aryepiglottic folds, arytenoids, glottis, and subglottis were otherwise uninvolved. A biopsy was obtained, and pathology results revealed relatively high proliferation of small, irregular vessels with plump endothelial cells staining positive for glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) (Figure, B and C). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Infantile hemangioma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 5-month-old boy with some pretty concerning symptoms. He's had oropharyngeal bleeding that stopped on its own, which is already a red flag. Plus, he's been slow at feeding and has had noisy breathing for a while now. That's definitely something to pay attention to.\n\nWhen we examine him, there's inspiratory stridor, especially when he's lying on his back. That's a big clue. Stridor usually means there's some kind of airway obstruction. And then, we do a bedside endoscopy, and there's this fleshy mass in the supraglottic area. It's blocking our view of the glottis, which is not good.\n\nSo, what could this be? Let's start with the obvious. A hemangioma comes to mind. They're pretty common in infants and can definitely cause these kinds of symptoms. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet.\n\nWe take a closer look during surgery, and the mass is pedunculated and on the lingual surface of the epiglottis. It's got areas that are highly vascular and some that look thrombosed. That's interesting. The rest of the airway looks okay, which is a relief.\n\nNow, the pathology report is key. It shows a lot of small, irregular vessels with plump endothelial cells. And they're staining positive for GLUT1. That's a big deal because GLUT1 positivity is pretty specific for infantile hemangiomas.\n\nSo, what else could it be? Let's think about other possibilities. Could it be a lymphatic malformation? They can appear in similar areas, but they usually don't have the same vascular characteristics, and they're not typically GLUT1 positive.\n\nWhat about a congenital vascular malformation? Those are a bit different in terms of their blood vessel structure and usually don't have the same endothelial cell characteristics.\n\nWe should also consider a pyogenic granuloma. They can occur in the oral cavity and have a vascular nature, but they're not common in infants and don't usually stain positive for GLUT1.\n\nAnd then there are other rare tumors, like a rhabdomyoma or even something like a fibroma. But these don't really fit the picture here, especially with the GLUT1 positivity.\n\nSo, after going through all of this, it really seems like an infantile hemangioma is the most likely diagnosis. The symptoms, the surgical findings, and especially the pathology results all point to it. It's the best fit for what we're seeing.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis for the 5-month-old boy is an infantile hemangioma. The symptoms, surgical findings, and pathology results, particularly the GLUT1 positivity, strongly support this diagnosis. Here is a 10-step differential diagnosis list, with each step considering a different potential diagnosis:\n\n1. **Infantile Hemangioma** - This is the most likely diagnosis given the symptoms and GLUT1 positivity.\n2. **Lymphatic Malformation** - While it can appear in similar areas, it typically doesn't have the same vascular characteristics or GLUT1 positivity.\n3. **Congenital Vascular Malformation** - Differs in blood vessel structure and endothelial cell characteristics, and usually not GLUT1 positive.\n4. **Pyogenic Granuloma** - Vascular in nature but not common in infants and typically not GLUT1 positive.\n5. **Rhabdomyoma** - A rare tumor that doesn't fit the pathology findings, especially with GLUT1 positivity.\n6. **Fibroma** - Doesn't align with the vascular nature and pathology results.\n7. **Papilloma** - More associated with HPV and doesn't match the vascular characteristics or GLUT1 staining.\n8. **Teratoma** - A type of tumor that contains several different tissue types, not consistent with the findings.\n9. **Chondroma** - A cartilaginous tumor that doesn't fit the vascular and GLUT1 positive profile.\n10. **Neurofibroma** - Associated with neurofibromatosis, doesn't match the pathology or clinical presentation.\n\nAfter considering all the information, infantile hemangioma remains the most fitting diagnosis.", "topic": "['Pediatrics', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Laryngology', 'Otolaryngology']"}

When playing video games at a distance or when reading, she developed oscillopsia with eyestrain and noted that her right eye turned up and in. She had undergone strabismus surgery for crossed eyes as a young child and more recently had laser in situ keratomileusis performed. She was medically healthy and neurodevelopmentally normal but had been born 4½ weeks premature. There was no family history of strabismus, and she denied diplopia. On examination, corrected visual acuity was 20/30 − 2 OD and 20/15 OS. Both pupils reacted briskly to light with no afferent pupillary defect. She had 1+ apparent overaction of the right inferior oblique and superior rectus muscles. When she was inattentive, her eyes appeared to be straight (Figure 1). Prism and alternate cover testing during near fixation showed a right esotropia and dissociated vertical divergence when fixing with her preferred left eye (Figure 1, left inset) and a larger left esotropia during forced fixation with her right eye (Figure 1, right inset). She had no cycloplegic refractive error, and retinal examination showed no objective torsion. Placement of +3.00 lenses eliminated her esotropia at near but could not be used to alleviate her symptoms at distance, showing a high accommodation-to-convergence ratio. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Dissociated horizontal deviation", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 33-year-old woman who's having some trouble with her eyes. She's experiencing intermittent esotropia, which means her right eye sometimes turns inward, especially when she's doing things like playing video games or reading. That's got to be annoying, and she's also feeling eyestrain. Hmm, she's had strabismus surgery before, so this isn't the first time she's dealt with eye alignment issues. And she's had LASIK, too. That's interesting.\n\nOkay, so she's healthy otherwise and developed normally, but she was born a bit premature. No family history of strabismus, though, which is good. She doesn't have double vision, so that's one less thing to worry about. Her visual acuity is a bit off, with her right eye being 20/30 and her left eye being 20/15. That's a noticeable difference. Pupils are reacting normally, so no issues there.\n\nNow, let's talk about those eye muscles. There's some overaction going on with her right inferior oblique and superior rectus muscles. That could be important. When she's not paying attention, her eyes seem to be straight, which is curious. The prism and alternate cover testing shows she's got a right esotropia when fixing with her left eye and a larger left esotropia when fixing with her right eye. Hmm, that sounds like a typical pattern you might see with dissociated vertical divergence.\n\nOh, and she doesn't have any cycloplegic refractive error, so that's not a factor here. Her retinas look normal, too, with no torsion. That's good. Now, when she uses +3.00 lenses, her esotropia at near disappears, but it doesn't help when she's looking at things far away. That suggests she's got a high accommodation-to-convergence ratio. That's a clue.\n\nSo, what could be going on here? Initially, I thought about decompensated strabismus. It's a common issue in adults with a history of strabismus. But wait, let's not jump to conclusions. Microtropia could be a possibility, too. It's a type of strabismus where the deviation is small and not always obvious. That might fit her situation.\n\nBut then, there's also the possibility of a high AC/A ratio. That could explain why her eyes behave differently at near versus far distances. It's like her accommodation system is overpowering her convergence system. That makes sense given her symptoms.\n\nOh, and what about dissociated vertical divergence? That's something we noticed during the exam. It's often associated with strabismus and could be contributing to her symptoms. But is it the main issue? Hmm, maybe it's more of a secondary thing.\n\nLet's not forget about inferior oblique overaction. That muscle seems to be working overtime, and it could be causing some of her alignment problems. But is it the primary cause? Probably not, but it's definitely playing a role.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? After thinking it through, I'd say the most likely explanation is a high AC/A ratio. It ties together her symptoms and the exam findings pretty neatly. Decompensated strabismus and microtropia are still possibilities, but they seem less likely given everything we've considered. Yeah, I think that's the best conclusion.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Decompensated Strabismus** - This is a common issue in adults with a history of strabismus, where the eye alignment worsens over time.\n\n2. **Microtropia** - A type of strabismus characterized by a small deviation that may not be obvious, which could fit the patient's symptoms.\n\n3. **High Accommodation-to-Convergence (AC/A) Ratio** - This could explain why her eyes behave differently at near versus far distances, with her accommodation system overpowering her convergence system.\n\n4. **Dissociated Vertical Divergence (DVD)** - Noted during the exam, this is often associated with strabismus and could be contributing to her symptoms.\n\n5. **Inferior Oblique Overaction** - The overactivity of this muscle could be causing some of her alignment issues.\n\n6. **Convergence Insufficiency** - Difficulty in converging the eyes, which could lead to eyestrain and alignment problems during near tasks.\n\n7. **Anisometropic Amblyopia** - A possible cause due to the difference in visual acuity between the two eyes, which might contribute to her symptoms.\n\n8. **Sensory Adaptation Disorder** - The brain's adaptation to the misalignment could be affecting her symptoms and eye position.\n\n9. **Latent Nystagmus** - A type of nystagmus that appears when one eye is covered, which could be related to her symptoms of oscillopsia.\n\n10. **Vertical Heterophoria** - A vertical misalignment that could contribute to her symptoms, especially when she's looking at distant objects.\n\nAfter considering all the information and test results, the most likely diagnosis is a **High Accommodation-to-Convergence (AC/A) Ratio**, as it best explains the patient's symptoms and exam findings. Decompensated strabismus and microtropia are also strong possibilities, but they seem less likely given the specifics of her case. Dissociated vertical divergence and inferior oblique overaction are likely secondary factors contributing to her condition.", "topic": "['Ophthalmology']"}

The lesions appeared without an identifiable cause and spread around the neck. The cords eventually covered the entire anterior neck and upper and lower clavicle areas. The skin lesions formed a corrugated pattern at the time of presentation. The patient had previously been treated with moisturizers at a local clinic for 2 months without any signs of improvement. The patient denied any manipulation or trauma at those sites. There was no personal or family history of keloid formation. The girl was otherwise healthy and met normal developmental milestones. On examination of the patient, there were many short, skin-colored, parallel cords on the patient’s anterior neck areas (Figure, A and B). These cords were indurated, slightly raised, and well defined with a shiny surface. The cords had a uniform width of approximately 2 mm, and the lengths varied from 3 mm to 2 cm. During the course of the examination, an ill-defined sclerotic plaque surrounding the underside of the clavicle was found. It had a shiny surface, irregular shape, and measured 10 × 4 cm. No similar lesions were found on any other part of the patient’s body. Inspection of the patient’s skin revealed no abnormal nail fold capillary dilation or hemorrhage; no sclerodactyly, distal digital pitting, or Raynaud disease; and no extracutaneous involvement. A punch biopsy specimen from the affected area was obtained (Figure, C and D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Morphea", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a teenage girl with these strange indurated cords on her neck. They've been there for a year and seem to be spreading. That's a bit unusual. They're skin-colored and have a shiny surface, which is interesting. And there's this large sclerotic plaque under her clavicle. Hmm, that's a new element to consider.\n\nFirst, let's think about what could cause these kinds of skin changes. Keloids come to mind, but she says there was no trauma, and they usually aren't this widespread. Plus, there's no family history of keloids. So, maybe not keloids.\n\nWhat about scleroderma? It can cause hardening of the skin, but usually, you'd expect some other symptoms like Raynaud's phenomenon or nail changes, and she doesn't have those. So, scleroderma seems unlikely.\n\nCould it be lichen sclerosus? That condition can cause shiny, white, or colored lesions, but it's not typically on the neck and doesn't quite match the description of these cords. So, probably not lichen sclerosus.\n\nMaybe it's some kind of connective tissue disorder? But again, we'd expect more systemic symptoms, and she seems healthy otherwise. Hmm, this is tricky.\n\nLet's think about other skin conditions. Epidermal nevi could cause skin changes, but they're usually present from birth or early childhood, and these appeared later. So, that's probably not it.\n\nWhat about dermatomyositis? It can cause skin changes, but we'd expect muscle weakness or other systemic signs, and she doesn't have those. So, dermatomyositis is unlikely.\n\nCould it be a genetic condition like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome? That can cause skin hyperelasticity, but these cords seem more rigid than hyperelastic. So, Ehlers-Danlos doesn't quite fit.\n\nMaybe it's a rare condition like porphyria cutanea tarda? That can cause skin changes, but we'd expect blistering or other specific symptoms, and she doesn't have those. So, probably not porphyria.\n\nLet's not forget about necrobiosis lipoidica. It can cause shiny lesions, but they're usually on the shins, not the neck. And there's no history of diabetes, which is often associated with it. So, that's unlikely.\n\nOkay, what about a foreign body reaction? But she denies any trauma or manipulation, so that doesn't seem to fit either.\n\nAfter considering all these possibilities, I'm leaning towards it being a case of atypical keloids or perhaps a unique presentation of scleroderma, even though it doesn't tick all the boxes. The biopsy results might give us more clues. Let's see what they show.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the teenage girl's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Keloids** - Although the girl denies any trauma and there's no family history, atypical keloids could still be considered due to the indurated and shiny nature of the cords.\n\n2. **Scleroderma** - Despite the lack of systemic symptoms like Raynaud's phenomenon, the presence of sclerotic plaques keeps scleroderma as a potential diagnosis.\n\n3. **Lichen Sclerosus** - This condition can cause shiny, indurated lesions, but the atypical location on the neck makes it less likely.\n\n4. **Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome** - This genetic condition involves skin hyperelasticity, but the rigid nature of the cords doesn't align well with this diagnosis.\n\n5. **Porphyria Cutanea Tarda** - This condition typically involves blistering and skin fragility, which are not present in this case.\n\n6. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica** - Usually occurs on the shins and is associated with diabetes, making it an unlikely diagnosis here.\n\n7. **Foreign Body Reaction** - Denied by the patient, but could be considered if there was unnoticed trauma or manipulation.\n\n8. **Dermatomyositis** - The absence of muscle weakness and systemic symptoms makes this diagnosis unlikely.\n\n9. **Epidermal Nevus** - These are usually present at birth or early childhood, so it's unlikely given the later appearance of the lesions.\n\n10. **Focal Dermal Hypoplasia** - Involves different types of skin defects, but the description doesn't perfectly match this condition.\n\nAfter considering all possibilities and the details provided, the top differential diagnoses would be atypical keloids or a unique presentation of scleroderma.

Macular optical coherence tomography imaging demonstrated trace irregularity to the outer retinal bands. Fundus autofluorescence imaging showed irregularly distributed speckled hypoautofluorescence in the posterior pole of each eye (Figure). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Congenital rubella syndrome", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 58-year-old woman who's been on pentosan polysulfate for a while because of interstitial cystitis. She's not having any vision problems, but we're checking for maculopathy just in case. Her eye exam was fine six months ago, so that's good. But she's been on this medication for 4.5 years, and that's something to consider.\n\nNow, she's got some other health things going on like hearing loss since she was a kid, diabetes, high cholesterol, and thyroid issues. She's on metformin, pravastatin, and levothyroxine for those. Her vision is pretty sharp, 20/20 in both eyes, and the front part of her eyes look normal. She's got some cataracts, but that's not unusual for her age.\n\nWhen we look at the back of her eyes, there's some mild mottling of the retinal pigment and these scattered, deep, hypopigmented spots. That's interesting. The OCT shows a bit of irregularity in the outer retinal bands, and the fundus autofluorescence has these speckled dark spots. Hmm, that sounds like something.\n\nOkay, let's think about what could be going on here. The first thing that jumps out is pentosan polysulfate maculopathy. It's a known issue with this drug, and the pattern of these findings fits. So, that's definitely on the list.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. What about other possibilities? Could this be age-related macular degeneration? It's common in people her age, and those hypopigmented spots could be related. But usually, AMD has more drusen or other signs, so maybe it's not the best fit.\n\nHow about cone dystrophy? That can cause some similar changes, especially with the pigment and autofluorescence patterns. It's a possibility, but it's not as common, and there's no family history mentioned.\n\nWhat about basal laminar drusen? That's another condition that can cause these kinds of changes, especially in older adults. It's characterized by those yellowish lesions, but we didn't see those here. So, maybe not.\n\nOh, and we shouldn't forget about pattern dystrophy. It can present with pigment changes and irregular autofluorescence. It's hereditary, but family history isn't always clear. So, it's still on the table.\n\nNow, let's think about the medication again. Pentosan polysulfate is the main suspect here. The timing and the specific retinal changes make it the most likely cause. But we can't ignore the possibility of other conditions, even if they're less likely.\n\nSo, after going through everything, I'd say the top differential diagnosis is pentosan polysulfate maculopathy. It just fits too well with what we're seeing. But we should also consider age-related macular degeneration, cone dystrophy, and pattern dystrophy as possibilities, even if they're not as strong of a match.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnoses for the retinal findings in this 58-year-old woman are as follows:\n\n1. **Pentosan Polysulfate Maculopathy** - This is the most likely diagnosis given her history of taking pentosan polysulfate for interstitial cystitis and the specific pattern of retinal changes observed.\n\n2. **Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)** - While AMD is common in this age group, the absence of drusen or other characteristic signs makes it less likely.\n\n3. **Cone Dystrophy** - This condition can cause similar retinal pigment changes and autofluorescence patterns, but it is less common and typically has a familial component.\n\n4. **Pattern Dystrophy** - This hereditary condition can present with pigmentary changes and irregular autofluorescence, but the lack of family history makes it less probable.\n\n5. **Basal Laminar Drusen** - Characterized by yellowish lesions which were not observed in this case, making it an unlikely diagnosis.\n\n6. **Retinitis Pigmentosa** - Although it involves retinal pigment changes, the specific pattern and absence of night vision issues make it less likely.\n\n7. **Chronic Central Serous Chorioretinopathy** - Typically presents with serous detachment, which was not noted in the OCT findings.\n\n8. **Stargardt Disease** - An inherited condition with atrophy and autofluorescence changes, but usually presents earlier in life.\n\n9. **Alström Syndrome** - A rare genetic disorder that includes hearing loss and retinal dystrophy, but the age of onset and other systemic features are not consistent.\n\n10. **Usher Syndrome** - Involves hearing loss and retinitis pigmentosa, but the specific retinal findings do not match well.\n\nAfter considering all the information, pentosan polysulfate maculopathy remains the most likely diagnosis due to the strong correlation with the medication and retinal findings.

We've got an 82-year-old woman who's been dealing with diarrhea and a rash for a couple of months. That's quite a while to be experiencing these symptoms. Diarrhea can really mess with your body, especially at her age. I'm thinking about how it can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. That low blood pressure could be a clue here.\n\nNow, about that rash. It's pruritic and has an erythematous, brawny, peeling quality to it. That's pretty distinctive. I've heard that certain nutrient deficiencies, like niacin deficiency, can cause a rash like that. Hmm, could this be related to her diet? She's been eating mostly vegetables, which might be low in certain nutrients.\n\nSpeaking of diet, she's lost quite a bit of weight, 4 kg, and her BMI is really low at 16.8. That's concerning. Malnutrition could definitely be playing a role here. If she's not getting enough protein or calories, that could explain the emaciated appearance and the glossitis.\n\nLet's not forget her medical history. She's got rheumatoid arthritis and hypothyroidism, and she had colon cancer a decade ago. The cancer is a big red flag. Could there be a recurrence or some other gastrointestinal issue causing these symptoms? Maybe something like celiac disease that affects nutrient absorption?\n\nOh, and there's the possibility of medication effects. She's on prednisolone, which can sometimes cause gastrointestinal issues. But would it cause this kind of rash? I'm not so sure.\n\nOkay, so what about other possibilities? Bacterial overgrowth could cause diarrhea, and certain infections can cause a rash. But would they explain everything we're seeing here?\n\nI'm also thinking about autoimmune issues, like dermatomyositis. That can cause a rash and muscle weakness, but would it cause this much diarrhea?\n\nLet's not forget about zinc deficiency. It can cause a rash and diarrhea, especially in someone who's malnourished. That could fit.\n\nAnd then there's the possibility of a paraneoplastic syndrome. Her history of cancer makes me think about that. Could this be related to some kind of tumor?\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the most likely explanation is pellagra, which is caused by niacin deficiency.

Slitlamp examination of the cornea of the right eye revealed multiple, discrete nodular opacities in the superior and inferior quadrants without neovascularization or surface elevation. Similar findings were seen in the left eye, but the superior lesions were notable for possessing well-circumscribed, plaquelike features located in the posterior stroma without involvement of the anterior surface (Figure, A). No crystalline changes were noted with these deposits. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 70-year-old woman with some interesting corneal lesions. They're bilateral and asymmetric, which is a bit unusual. She's got a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, but nothing that jumps out as related to corneal issues. Her vision is great, 20/20 with glasses, so these lesions aren't really bothering her sight. \n\nFirst off, the lesions are nodular and in the stroma. That makes me think of something like Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy, but usually, that's more about corneal guttata and affects the endothelium, not the stroma. So, maybe not that. \n\nNext, the lesions are well-circumscribed and plaquelike. That sounds a bit like a corneal dystrophy, maybe something like lattice corneal dystrophy. But lattice dystrophy usually has amyloid deposits and can affect the anterior surface, which doesn't quite match what we're seeing here. \n\nThe fact that these lesions are in the posterior stroma is intriguing. It's not typical for most corneal dystrophies, which usually involve the anterior layers. This makes me think of something like pre-Descemet's corneal dystrophy, which affects deeper layers. \n\nBut wait, pre-Descemet's typically involves more diffuse changes, not these distinct nodules. So, maybe that's not it either. \n\nLet's consider other possibilities. Could this be something like a lipid keratopathy? That would fit with her hyperlipidemia, but usually, lipid deposits are more superficial and associated with corneal vascularization, which isn't the case here. \n\nWhat about corneal degenerations like Terrien's marginal degeneration? That's more peripheral and doesn't match the central, nodular pattern we're seeing. \n\nSalzmann's nodular degeneration could be a possibility, but that's usually more anterior and involves the epithelium and Bowman's layer, not the stroma. \n\nI'm also thinking about Schnyder corneal dystrophy, which involves lipid deposits, but that's typically more diffuse and crystalline, which doesn't match our findings. \n\nCould this be a rare form of corneal dystrophy, like Francois-Neetens speckled corneal dystrophy? That affects the stroma and can present with nodular lesions, which sounds closer to what we're seeing. \n\nAfter going through all this, I think Francois-Neetens speckled corneal dystrophy fits the best.

Here is the differential diagnosis list, considering all the possibilities discussed:\n\n1. **Francois-Neetens Speckled Corneal Dystrophy** - This is the most likely diagnosis given the stromal, nodular lesions.\n2. **Pre-Descemet's Corneal Dystrophy** - Involves deeper corneal layers but typically presents with more diffuse changes.\n3. **Lattice Corneal Dystrophy** - Usually involves amyloid deposits and affects the anterior cornea.\n4. **Fuchs' Endothelial Dystrophy** - Primarily affects the endothelium with corneal guttata, not the stroma.\n5. **Schnyder Corneal Dystrophy** - Involves lipid deposits, typically more diffuse and crystalline.\n6. **Lipid Keratopathy** - Associated with corneal vascularization and more superficial deposits.\n7. **Salzmann's Nodular Degeneration** - Affects the anterior cornea, involving the epithelium and Bowman's layer.\n8. **Terrien's Marginal Degeneration** - More peripheral and does not match the central, nodular pattern.\n9. **Kayser-Fleischer Ring** - Associated with Wilson's disease, typically involves copper deposits in Descemet's membrane.\n10. **Corneal Amyloidosis** - Can involve the stroma but is often associated with systemic conditions or other ocular findings.\n\nEach of these conditions has distinct characteristics that help in differentiating them from one another, based on the location, appearance, and associated features of the corneal lesions.", "topic": "['Cornea', 'Ophthalmology', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Risk Factors', 'Hypertension']"}

He had previously lived for a few years in Uganda and frequently swam in the Nile River. After returning to the US, he experienced recurrent diarrhea. In April 2018, he had an appendectomy for acute appendicitis. In February 2019, 22 months after his return from Uganda, he developed intermittent hematochezia. He had no vomiting, fever, or weight loss during this time. On evaluation, vital signs were normal and abdominal examination showed a soft, nontender abdomen. Rectal examination was normal. A complete blood cell count and comprehensive metabolic panel were notable for a normal hemoglobin level and an absolute eosinophil count of 304 cells/μL. Results of testing including stool microscopy, HIV fourth-generation assay, hepatitis B serologies, and a rectal swab for gonorrhea and chlamydia were negative. A colonoscopy demonstrated granular mucosa in the rectum. Internal hemorrhoids were present, but there were no masses, vascular malformations, or other abnormalities. A biopsy of rectal tissue was obtained; histopathologic features are shown in the Figure. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Schistosomiasis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 28-year-old guy who's been having some rectal bleeding. He's been back in the US for about two years after living in Uganda, where he spent a lot of time swimming in the Nile. That's interesting because the Nile is known for schistosomiasis, which is caused by a parasite. So, that's definitely something to keep in mind.\n\nNow, he's had recurrent diarrhea since coming back, and about 22 months after his return, he started having intermittent bleeding. But he doesn't have any other symptoms like vomiting, fever, or weight loss, which is good. His vital signs are normal, and his abdomen is soft and not tender. That's a relief because it rules out some more acute conditions.\n\nThe rectal exam didn't show anything alarming, which is good. But his blood work shows an elevated eosinophil count. Eosinophilia can be a sign of a parasitic infection or an allergic reaction. Given his travel history, a parasite seems likely.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests—stool microscopy, HIV, hepatitis B, and even checked for gonorrhea and chlamydia. All negative. So, we can rule out those infections. The colonoscopy showed granular mucosa in the rectum, which could indicate some inflammation or infection. They also found internal hemorrhoids, but no masses or vascular issues.\n\nA biopsy was taken, and the histopathology report is key here. If it shows any eggs or granulomas, that would be a big clue. Schistosomiasis can cause granulomas, especially if the eggs are present.\n\nSo, let's think about what this could be. Given his time in the Nile, schistosomiasis is a strong contender. But let's not jump to conclusions. What else could it be? Ulcerative colitis can cause rectal bleeding and granular mucosa, but usually, there are more symptoms like diarrhea and abdominal pain. And what about infectious colitis? That's possible, but the negative stool tests make it less likely.\n\nHow about amebiasis? It can cause intestinal issues, but again, the stool test was negative. Maybe it's a bacterial infection like Salmonella or Shigella? But those usually cause more acute symptoms, and the tests didn't show anything.\n\nAngiodysplasia could cause bleeding, but it's more common in older adults, and the colonoscopy didn't show any vascular abnormalities. Lymphoid hyperplasia is another thought, but it's not as common in adults, and we don't have any other signs pointing to that.\n\nSo, after considering all of this, schistosomiasis still seems like the most likely cause. The elevated eosinophils, his travel history, and the colonoscopy findings all fit. But let's keep an open mind. Ulcerative colitis and infectious colitis are still possibilities, even if they're less likely. And we can't completely rule out things like amebiasis or bacterial infections, even with the negative tests. It's a complex case, but schistosomiasis is the strongest contender.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with a focus on one potential diagnosis per step, without repetition:\n\n1. **Schistosomiasis** - Given the patient's history of swimming in the Nile River, where schistosomiasis is endemic, and the elevated eosinophil count, this is a strong contender.\n\n2. **Ulcerative Colitis** - The presence of granular mucosa in the rectum and intermittent hematochezia could suggest ulcerative colitis, although the absence of other typical symptoms like diarrhea and abdominal pain makes it less likely.\n\n3. **Infectious Colitis** - Despite negative stool tests, infectious colitis remains a possibility, especially with the history of recurrent diarrhea.\n\n4. **Amebiasis** - Although the stool test was negative, amebiasis can cause similar symptoms and should be considered given the patient's travel history.\n\n5. **Salmonella or Shigella Infection** - These bacterial infections can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, but the lack of acute symptoms and negative tests make them less probable.\n\n6. **Angiodysplasia** - While this condition can cause bleeding, it is more common in older adults, and the colonoscopy did not show vascular abnormalities.\n\n7. **Lymphoid Hyperplasia** - This is less common in adults and not strongly suggested by the findings, but it remains a consideration.\n\n8. **Crohn's Disease** - Although not as likely as ulcerative colitis given the findings, Crohn's could present with similar symptoms.\n\n9. **Diverticular Disease** - This could cause bleeding, but the colonoscopy did not show diverticula.\n\n10. **Ischemic Colitis** - This condition can cause bleeding, but it is more common in older adults and not suggested by the patient's history or test results.\n\nAfter considering all the information, schistosomiasis remains the most likely diagnosis due to the combination of the patient's travel history, elevated eosinophil count, and colonoscopy findings.

She was adamant that the lesion had been present since early childhood but had gradually increased with a recent appearance of foul-smelling otorrhea. On examination, the auricle was markedly enlarged, edematous, and encircled by an erythematous, indurated plaque partially covered with a fine scale (Figure 1A). Diascopy revealed an “apple jelly” appearance. There was no local or distant lymphadenopathy; general physical examination findings were unremarkable. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Lupus vulgaris", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her 50s with a really enlarged and swollen right ear. She's had this since childhood, but it's been getting worse and now there's some smelly discharge. That's quite a mix of symptoms.\n\nFirst off, the fact that it's been there since childhood makes me think of something congenital or a condition that starts young. Maybe something like a congenital cholesteatoma? Those can hang around for a long time and cause problems later.\n\nBut wait, there's also this apple jelly appearance when you use a diascope. That's a classic sign of lupus vulgaris, which is a form of cutaneous tuberculosis. And she did move to Israel, which might have different health considerations. So, lupus vulgaris is definitely on the table.\n\nNow, let's not forget the smell. Foul-smelling otorrhea usually means some kind of infection or necrosis. Could this be related to the cholesteatoma? Those can get infected and cause a pretty bad smell.\n\nBut then again, the apple jelly sign is pretty strong for lupus vulgaris. And the indurated plaque with scaling? That could be a granulomatous reaction, which fits with tuberculosis.\n\nOh, and what about other possibilities? Could it be a basal cell carcinoma? Those can be persistent and cause local changes, but they don't usually smell or have that apple jelly sign.\n\nHmm, let's think about other infections. Chronic fungal infections like chromoblastomycosis could cause these kinds of changes, especially in someone who's lived in different climates. But do they match the apple jelly sign? Not really.\n\nWhat about discoid lupus erythematosus? It can cause scarring and changes in the skin, but usually not with this kind of smell or history.\n\nOkay, let's not forget benign necrotizing otitis externa. It's not common, but it could explain the smell and some of the skin changes. But would it have that apple jelly sign? Probably not.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? I think lupus vulgaris is still the strongest contender. It matches the apple jelly sign and the patient's background. But let's not completely rule out other possibilities like a congenital cholesteatoma or even a chronic fungal infection.\n\nIn the end, I'm leaning towards lupus vulgaris as the most likely diagnosis. It just fits too well with the symptoms and the patient's history. But I'm keeping an open mind about those other possibilities.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the condition described:\n\n1. **Lupus Vulgaris** - The apple jelly appearance on diascopy is a classic sign of this form of cutaneous tuberculosis.\n\n2. **Congenital Cholesteatoma** - The long-standing nature of the lesion since childhood aligns with this possibility, though it doesn't typically present with an apple jelly sign.\n\n3. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** - While it can cause persistent local changes, it doesn't usually present with foul-smelling discharge or the apple jelly sign.\n\n4. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus** - Can cause scarring and skin changes, but not typically with this kind of smell or history.\n\n5. **Chromoblastomycosis** - A chronic fungal infection that could cause skin changes, especially in someone who has lived in different climates, but it doesn't match the apple jelly sign.\n\n6. **Benign Necrotizing Otitis Externa** - Could explain the smell and some skin changes, but not the apple jelly sign.\n\n7. **Tuberculosis Verrucosa Cutis** - A form of cutaneous tuberculosis that can present with warty lesions, but not typically with the apple jelly sign.\n\n8. **Lichen Simplex Chronicus** - Could cause chronic skin changes due to scratching, but doesn't fit the apple jelly sign or smell.\n\n9. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - Can cause persistent lesions, but not typically with the apple jelly sign or this kind of smell.\n\n10. **Malignant Otitis Externa** - A severe infection that can cause significant symptoms, but not typically the apple jelly sign.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Lupus Vulgaris** remains the most likely diagnosis due to the strong correlation with the apple jelly sign and the patient's background.

He had a history of Philadelphia chromosome–positive acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (attributable to treatment with the tyrosine-kinase inhibitor [TKI] imatinib), and diabetes. He had senile dementia but did not complain of constitutional symptoms. His visual acuity was 20/80 OD and 20/32 OS, and his intraocular pressures were 31 mm Hg OD and 16 mm Hg OS. A slitlamp examination of the right eye showed redness, with small, white, nongranulomatous keratic precipitate as well as a cataract. His iris was diffusely thickened and the anterior chamber was slightly shallow, with 4+ cells and white hypopyon, which did not change position with head movements (Figure 1). There was also an extensive rubeosis iridis (Figure 1) with posterior synechiae in the right eye. The left anterior chamber was normal. A fundus examination had unremarkable results in both eyes. A complete blood cell count had normal results, and his hemoglobin A1c level was 16.5%. A syphilis test result was negative. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Intraocular relapse of ALL", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 78-year-old man who's having trouble seeing out of his right eye, and there's a hypopyon. That's a big clue. Hypopyon usually means inflammation in the eye, like anterior uveitis. But there's more to consider. He's got a history of leukemia, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and diabetes. These could all play a role here.\n\nFirst, let's think about infections. With hypopyon, we can't ignore the possibility of an infectious cause. Bacterial endophthalmitis is a serious one. It's known for causing a hypopyon and can happen after surgery or even without any obvious entry point for bacteria. Given his age and health issues, this is a real possibility.\n\nBut wait, there's also fungal endophthalmitis. Fungal infections can be more common in people with diabetes, and his blood sugar levels are pretty high. That's something to keep in mind.\n\nNow, let's not forget about his leukemia. It's a type of blood cancer, and that can lead to leukemic infiltrates in the eye. That could explain the hypopyon and the thickened iris. It's not as common, but it's definitely something to consider.\n\nOh, and there's the rubeosis iridis. That's when new blood vessels grow on the iris, often because of ischemic conditions in the eye. This could be linked to diabetic retinopathy or even a central retinal vein occlusion. Both are possible given his diabetes and age.\n\nHmm, what about masquerade syndromes? These are conditions that mimic uveitis but aren't inflammatory. Leukemia can do this, but so can lymphoma. We should keep that in mind too.\n\nNow, let's think about the negative syphilis test. That's good because it rules out syphilitic uveitis, which can also cause a hypopyon.\n\nPutting it all together, bacterial endophthalmitis seems like a strong contender. But we can't ignore fungal endophthalmitis, especially with his diabetes. Leukemic infiltrates are also up there, given his history. And we should keep lymphoma in the back of our minds as a masquerade syndrome.\n\nSo, in order, I'd say bacterial endophthalmitis is the top suspect, followed closely by fungal endophthalmitis. Leukemic infiltrates are next, and then lymphoma. Rubeosis iridis is likely a result of underlying issues like diabetic retinopathy. And let's not forget about central retinal vein occlusion as a possible cause of the rubeosis.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Bacterial Endophthalmitis** - This is a serious infection that can cause hypopyon and is a strong contender given the patient's age and health issues.\n\n2. **Fungal Endophthalmitis** - This is more common in individuals with high blood sugar levels, like the patient, and should be considered.\n\n3. **Leukemic Infiltrates** - The patient's history of leukemia makes this a plausible cause of the hypopyon and iris thickening.\n\n4. **Lymphoma** - This can masquerade as uveitis and should be kept in mind, especially with the patient's history of hematological malignancy.\n\n5. **Diabetic Retinopathy** - The patient's high hemoglobin A1c level and rubeosis iridis suggest underlying diabetic retinopathy.\n\n6. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)** - This could lead to rubeosis iridis and should be considered given the patient's age and diabetes.\n\n7. **Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma** - The shallow anterior chamber and high intraocular pressure in the right eye raise this possibility.\n\n8. **Iridocorneal Endothelial Syndrome** - This condition can cause a shallow anterior chamber and iris changes.\n\n9. **Chronic Uveitis** - This could be related to his history of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or another underlying inflammatory process.\n\n10. **Neovascular Glaucoma** - This is linked to rubeosis iridis and could be secondary to diabetic retinopathy or CRVO.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses, in order, are: Bacterial Endophthalmitis, Fungal Endophthalmitis, Leukemic Infiltrates, and Lymphoma. These are followed by Diabetic Retinopathy, Central Retinal Vein Occlusion, and Neovascular Glaucoma, which are interconnected with the patient's diabetic status and rubeosis iridis. Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma and Iridocorneal Endothelial Syndrome are also possibilities due to the anterior segment findings.

A flexible fiberoptic nasal endoscopy was performed, and its findings showed bilateral and symmetric inferior turbinate hypertrophy without erythema, exudate, or ulceration, and without mucoid rhinorrhea (Figure 1A). There were no intranasal masses, lesions, or polyps.

We've got a 15-year-old guy who's been dealing with nasal congestion and loss of smell for a while now. That's a pretty long time to be stuffed up! He's not reporting any big red flags like facial pain or changes in his vision, which is good. And he hasn't had any injuries or recent sinus infections, so we can probably rule those out.\n\nHe does have some allergy-like symptoms, like sneezing and itchy eyes. That makes me think of allergies right away. But he's never been tested for them, so we don't know for sure if that's the issue. Hmm, could it be something like allergic rhinitis? That would fit with the sneezing and itchy nose.\n\nNow, let's talk about what we saw during the nasal endoscopy. His inferior turbinate bones are enlarged, but there's no swelling, no pus, and no weird growths. That's interesting. Turbinate hypertrophy can definitely cause nasal congestion, and it's often linked to allergies. So, that's another point in favor of allergic rhinitis.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions too fast. There are other things that could cause these symptoms. What about chronic rhinosinusitis? That can cause long-term congestion and smell issues too. Although, usually, you'd expect some nasal polyps or more obvious inflammation, and we didn't see any of that.\n\nOh, and there's also the possibility of a nasal septal deviation. That could cause congestion without any big inflammatory signs. But we didn't hear anything about that during the exam, so maybe it's less likely.\n\nLet's not forget about environmental factors. If he's around something irritating, like pollution or strong smells, that could cause his symptoms too. But we don't have any info on that, so it's hard to say.\n\nOkay, so what about other less common things? Like, could it be a benign tumor or something? That seems unlikely without any visible masses or growths.\n\nAnd then there's the possibility of a systemic issue, like a granulomatous disease. But those usually come with more widespread symptoms, and he seems pretty healthy otherwise.\n\nSo, putting it all together, it really seems like allergic rhinitis is the most likely culprit here. The turbinate hypertrophy and his allergy-like symptoms fit well with that. But we can't completely rule out things like chronic rhinosinusitis or a septal deviation without more info.\n\nIn the end, I think we're on the right track with allergic rhinitis, but it's always good to keep an open mind and consider other possibilities.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's symptoms, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Allergic Rhinitis** - This is a strong contender given the patient's symptoms of sneezing, itchy eyes, and nasal congestion, along with the findings of turbinate hypertrophy.\n\n2. **Chronic Rhinosinusitis** - Although typically associated with more pronounced inflammatory signs, it can present with long-term congestion and hyposmia.\n\n3. **Nasal Septal Deviation** - This could cause unilateral or bilateral congestion without overt inflammatory signs, but it wasn't noted during the examination.\n\n4. **Environmental Irritant Exposure** - Irritants like pollution or strong odors could contribute to symptoms, but there's no information on the patient's environment.\n\n5. **Inverted Papilloma** - A benign tumor that could cause nasal obstruction, but usually, there would be a visible mass, which was not seen.\n\n6. **Nasal Polyps** - These can cause congestion and anosmia, but none were observed during endoscopy.\n\n7. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis** - A systemic condition that can affect the nose, but it typically presents with more widespread symptoms.\n\n8. **Sarcoidosis** - Another systemic disease that can involve the nose, but it often has broader systemic manifestations.\n\n9. **Turbinate Bone Osteoma** - A benign growth that could cause obstruction, but no mass was seen on examination.\n\n10. **Hormonal Rhinitis** - Can cause persistent congestion, but it's less likely in this young patient without other hormonal symptoms.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnosis remains **Allergic Rhinitis**, given the symptom profile and examination findings.

Her medical history included systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and external hemorrhoids. Six months before admission, she underwent a deceased donor kidney transplant. One month before presentation, she was hospitalized for acute cellular transplant rejection managed with systemic corticosteroids, belatacept, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus therapies. Her immunosuppressive regimen at the time of dermatologic evaluation consisted of prednisone, 5 mg daily, and mycophenolate mofetil, 500 mg twice daily. On admission, she was afebrile and normotensive; laboratory results were notable for an elevated creatinine level of 1.43 mg/dL (reference range, 0.40-1.30 mg/dL) (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 92 × 103/μL [reference range, 140-440 × 103/μL] [conversion to ×109 per liter is 1:1). She developed diarrhea 1 day after admission. Fecal leukocytes were absent. Stool antigen test results for cryptosporidium, giardia, and rotavirus were negative. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results for campylobacter, norovirus, salmonella, shigella, Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli 1 and 2, Vibrio cholerae, and Yersinia enterocolitica in the stool were negative. Antigen and toxin test results for Clostridium difficile in the stool were positive. Total body skin examination was notable for 1- and 3-cm tender, round perianal ulcers with a clean base. Another 4-mm round ulcer was present at the superior intergluteal cleft (Figure, A). There were no ocular or oral ulcers. A biopsy specimen of a perianal ulcer border was obtained for histopathologic analysis (Figure, B-D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cytomegalovirus infection", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her late 30s who's been dealing with some pretty uncomfortable perianal pain for the last four days. She's got a history of systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and she's also had some issues with external hemorrhoids. Oh, and she had a kidney transplant about six months ago. That's a big deal because it means she's on immunosuppressive meds to prevent rejection. \n\nNow, she was hospitalized about a month ago for acute transplant rejection and was treated with some heavy-duty meds like corticosteroids, belatacept, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus. Currently, she's on prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil. These drugs can really mess with the immune system, making her more vulnerable to infections. \n\nWhen she was admitted, she didn't have a fever, and her blood pressure was normal. But her lab results showed an elevated creatinine level, which might be a sign of kidney stress, and she's also got thrombocytopenia, meaning low platelet count. That's something to keep in mind. \n\nThe day after she was admitted, she started having diarrhea. That's not fun, especially with perianal pain. They checked her stool for a bunch of pathogens like cryptosporidium, giardia, and rotavirus, but all those tests came back negative. They also did PCR tests for a bunch of bacteria, and those were negative too. But, they did find Clostridium difficile toxins in her stool. That's a nasty bug that can cause diarrhea, especially in hospitals. \n\nNow, let's talk about these ulcers. She's got a couple of tender, round ulcers around her perianal area, and another small one at the superior intergluteal cleft. They're clean-based, which is interesting. They took a biopsy from one of the ulcers to get a closer look under the microscope. \n\nSo, what could be causing these ulcers? Given her history of lupus and immunosuppression, I'm thinking about autoimmune issues. Lupus can cause skin ulcers, right? But wait, those are usually more discoid or have some other characteristic appearance. These ulcers are round and clean-based, which doesn't quite fit the typical lupus profile. \n\nHmm, what about infections? She's got C. difficile in her gut, but that's more associated with diarrhea, not skin ulcers. Could it be something like herpes simplex virus? HSV can cause ulcers, but they're usually vesicular, and we didn't see any vesicles here. \n\nOh, and there's also the possibility of a bacterial infection. With her immunocompromised state, she's at higher risk for those. But the clean bases of the ulcers don't scream infection to me. \n\nLet's not forget about drug reactions. Mycophenolate mofetil can cause gastrointestinal issues, but skin ulcers? That's not typical. \n\nOkay, what about vasculitis? That's a possibility with lupus. Vasculitis can cause ulcers, but they're often more widespread and have a different appearance. \n\nNow, let's think about the biopsy. If it shows necrotizing vasculitis, that would point towards an autoimmune process. But if it's more like a pyoderma gangrenosum, that's a different story. \n\nSo, where does that leave us? Initially, I thought it might be lupus-related, but the ulcer characteristics don't quite match. HSV seems unlikely without vesicles. Bacterial infections are possible, but the clean bases don't fit. Drug reactions, maybe, but not typical for mycophenolate. Vasculitis could be it, but let's see what the biopsy says. \n\nAfter reconsidering everything, I'm leaning towards pyoderma gangrenosum. It can happen in immunocompromised patients and fits the ulcer description. Yeah, that seems to make the most sense given all the information.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the perianal ulcers in this patient:\n\n1. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum** - This condition is characterized by painful skin ulcers and can occur in immunocompromised individuals, which aligns with the patient's current state.\n\n2. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection** - Although typically vesicular, HSV can present atypically in immunocompromised patients, making it a consideration.\n\n3. **Bacterial Infection** - Given the patient's immunosuppressed state, bacterial infections could present with atypical features, including clean-based ulcers.\n\n4. **Lupus-Related Vasculitis** - The patient's history of systemic lupus erythematosus raises the possibility of vasculitis, which can cause skin ulcers.\n\n5. **Drug Reaction (Mycophenolate Mofetil)** - While not typical, mycophenolate mofetil can cause skin reactions, although ulcers are rare.\n\n6. **Fungal Infection** - Opportunistic fungal infections can occur in immunocompromised patients and may present with ulcerative lesions.\n\n7. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection** - CMV can cause ulcers in immunocompromised individuals, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, and could potentially affect the perianal area.\n\n8. **Behçet's Disease** - This condition can cause mucocutaneous ulcers and may be considered, especially with the patient's autoimmune history.\n\n9. **Crohn's Disease** - Perianal involvement is common in Crohn's disease, and the patient's immunocompromised state could exacerbate symptoms.\n\n10. **Aphthous Ulcers** - Simple aphthous ulcers can occur in anyone but may be more severe or recurrent in immunocompromised patients.\n\nAfter considering all the information, pyoderma gangrenosum emerges as the most likely diagnosis given the patient's immunocompromised state and the characteristics of the ulcers. However, the biopsy results will be crucial in confirming this diagnosis.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology', 'Gastroenterology', 'Surgery']"}

Six weeks prior, he fell from a ladder and had right nondisplaced medial malleolar and comminuted talar fractures. The fractures were managed nonsurgically in a controlled ankle movement boot, with resolution of swelling and bruising. On current presentation, his temperature was 38.2 °C (100.8 °F); heart rate, 88/min; respiratory rate, 18/min; and blood pressure, 102/65 mm Hg. He was well appearing with normal cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations. There was trace right lower extremity edema localized to the ankle and normal pedal pulses. Erythema without warmth was present over the right ankle and dorsomedial foot, along with nontender, nonpalpable purpura over the dorsum of the foot and scattered petechiae over the right lower leg (Figure). When the leg was elevated above the level of the heart, the surrounding erythema faded. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Deep venous thrombosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 48-year-old guy who's been dealing with a rash on his right foot. He's also been having fevers, sweating a lot, and getting headaches for about a week. That's quite a mix of symptoms. He had a fall six weeks ago and hurt his right ankle, but that was supposed to be healing okay in a boot. \n\nFirst off, the rash is interesting. It's over his right foot and ankle, and there's some purpura and petechiae. Those are little red or purple spots caused by bleeding under the skin. Hmm, that makes me think about blood clotting or vessel issues right away. \n\nThe fever and headaches could be a sign of something infectious, like maybe endocarditis. That's when an infection happens in the heart, often on the valves, and it can send little clots and bacteria into the bloodstream, causing all sorts of problems, including fever and a rash. \n\nBut wait, there's more to consider. The rash fades when his leg is elevated. That's a clue! It suggests that maybe the problem is related to blood flow or pressure in the leg itself, rather than something like endocarditis, which wouldn't really change with leg position. \n\nLet's think about the trauma he had. He fell and fractured his ankle, and even though it was nondisplaced, that kind of injury can cause complications. Maybe there's a deep vein thrombosis, or DVT. That's when a blood clot forms in a deep vein, often in the leg, and it can cause swelling and redness. \n\nBut, the thing is, he doesn't have a lot of swelling, and the erythema fades when the leg is up. That's not super typical for a DVT, which usually causes more persistent swelling and warmth. \n\nOkay, so what about this fading rash? It might be something like reactive erythema, where the blood vessels are reacting to being dependent and then easing up when elevated. That could be linked to the trauma and the body's response to it. \n\nNow, let's not forget about the possibility of an infection. The fever and headaches could still mean there's something infectious going on. Maybe it's not endocarditis, but something related to the fracture or the boot he's been wearing. \n\nOh, and there's always the chance of a systemic issue, like a vasculitis. That's when the blood vessels themselves get inflamed, which can cause rashes and other symptoms. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the most likely explanation is a local vascular issue, maybe a mix of reactive changes from the trauma and a bit of inflammation. But we can't completely rule out infection or something like endocarditis without more tests. \n\nIn the end, I'm leaning towards a local reaction, but I'm keeping an open mind about other possibilities until we get more information.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's symptoms, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Endocarditis** - The combination of fever, headache, and a vascular rash could suggest an infectious process affecting the heart valves, leading to embolic phenomena.\n\n2. **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)** - Although the symptoms aren't entirely typical, DVT could cause a rash and fever if there's significant inflammation or infection.\n\n3. **Reactive Erythema** - This is a possible response to the dependent position of the leg, causing increased blood flow and erythema that fades upon elevation.\n\n4. **Vasculitis** - Inflammation of the blood vessels could explain the rash and systemic symptoms like fever and headache.\n\n5. **Infectious Cellulitis** - An infection in the soft tissue could cause erythema, fever, and headache, especially if related to the previous trauma or immobilization in a boot.\n\n6. **Immune Complex-Mediated Hypersensitivity Reaction** - This could be a reaction to the trauma or immobilization, leading to a rash and systemic symptoms.\n\n7. **Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)** - A complex disorder involving both clotting and bleeding, which could explain the purpura and petechiae.\n\n8. **Thrombophlebitis** - Inflammation of veins due to a clot could cause the rash and fever, especially if related to the recent immobilization.\n\n9. **Erythema Nodosum** - An inflammatory reaction that could cause redness and pain, often related to infections or systemic diseases.\n\n10. **Fat Embolism Syndrome** - A possibility following a fracture, where fat globules enter the bloodstream and cause systemic symptoms, including a rash.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses would be:\n\n1. **Reactive Erythema** - Given the fading of erythema upon elevation, this seems likely.\n2. **Endocarditis** - The systemic symptoms and rash make this a strong consideration.\n3. **Vasculitis** - The combination of rash and systemic symptoms could indicate vessel inflammation.\n4. **Infectious Cellulitis** - Especially if there's an infection related to the previous trauma.\n5. **Immune Complex-Mediated Hypersensitivity Reaction** - A possible response to trauma or immobilization.\n\nThese diagnoses take into account the unique characteristics of the rash and the systemic symptoms, while also considering the patient's history of trauma and immobilization.

Following an upper respiratory tract infection 1 month prior, he developed disseminated red, scaly patches and a progressive eruption of hyperpigmented and hypopigmented patches of skin. He had occasional nonbloody loose stools but no fevers or vomiting. Although he was otherwise well, his growth had fallen from the 75th to the 25th percentile for height and weight over the preceding 9 months, and he could speak only 2 words. His medical history was notable for atopic dermatitis and diarrhea in infancy that prompted allergy testing at age 6 months; he was subsequently diagnosed with milk, egg, and peanut allergies. His parents avoided feeding him these foods, providing him only soy-based milk and formula, with improvement of dermatitis, until age 1 year. Since then his diet had consisted of multiple rice milk feeds daily, supplemented only with pureed fruits and vegetables, pasta, snack puffs, and sunflower butter. The patient had no history of meconium ileus or family history of cystic fibrosis. There was no recent travel and no changes to the home environment. On presentation, the patient was irritable, with normal vital signs. He displayed prominent scrotal swelling and pitting edema of the legs bilaterally. Skin examination was notable for erythematous, denuded patches with peeling scale and reticulate hyperpigmentation, accentuated on the abdomen, back, diaper area, and extensor extremities (Figure; left panel). Notably, his skin also demonstrated widespread patches of hypopigmentation, with an accompanying band of hypopigmentation proximally at the site of newest hair growth (Figure; right panel). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Kwashiorkor", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 19-month-old boy with widespread edema and a skin condition that's really acting up. He's had this issue since an upper respiratory infection a month ago. That's interesting. He's got these red, scaly patches all over, and now there are these strange hyperpigmented and hypopigmented patches too. Hmm, that's a lot going on with the skin.\n\nHe's also having some loose stools, but they're not bloody, and he hasn't had a fever or been vomiting. That's good, at least. But his growth has been a concern; he's dropped from the 75th to the 25th percentile in height and weight over the last 9 months. That's a big drop. And he's only speaking two words. That's definitely a red flag for a developmental issue.\n\nHe's got a history of atopic dermatitis and was diagnosed with milk, egg, and peanut allergies as an infant. His parents have been careful with his diet, but it seems like his diet is pretty limited now. He's mostly on rice milk, fruits, vegetables, pasta, and sunflower butter. That doesn't sound very balanced.\n\nOn examining him, he's irritable, but his vital signs are okay. He's got scrotal swelling and pitting edema on his legs. The skin findings are striking—erythematous patches, peeling, and that reticulate hyperpigmentation. Plus, there are patches of hypopigmentation. That's a lot to take in.\n\nSo, what could be going on here? Let's start with the skin. The combination of hyperpigmented and hypopigmented patches is unusual. I've heard of a condition called incontinentia pigmenti, which has similar skin findings. It's a genetic disorder, but it doesn't quite fit with the nutritional and developmental issues.\n\nThe edema and nutritional deficiencies make me think about his diet. Rice milk is low in protein and nutrients, so maybe he's not getting enough protein or calories. That could explain the edema and growth delay.\n\nBut wait, there's more. The skin changes and nutritional issues together point towards a metabolic disorder. Glucocorticoid deficiency could cause some of these symptoms, like the skin changes and growth delay. But it doesn't explain everything.\n\nLet's not forget about the possibility of an allergy-related condition. His history of allergies is significant. Could this be a severe food allergy causing malabsorption and skin issues? But then, why the specific pattern of skin changes?\n\nOh, and what about zinc deficiency? It can cause skin lesions and growth delays. The reticulate hyperpigmentation could fit. But does it explain the hypopigmentation and developmental delay?\n\nI should also consider Langerhans cell histiocytosis. It can cause skin changes and developmental issues, but it's rare and usually has other symptoms like bone lesions.\n\nAnother thought is kwashiorkor, which is caused by protein malnutrition. It can lead to edema and skin changes, but it doesn't usually cause the specific hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation pattern.\n\nLet's not overlook the possibility of a genetic disorder like Menkes disease, which affects copper levels and can cause skin and hair changes. But it's rare and usually has other distinct features.\n\nI should also think about autoimmune enteropathy, which can cause malabsorption and skin issues. But it's rare in such a young child.\n\nLastly, there's the possibility of a mitochondrial disorder. It could explain the developmental delay and skin changes, but it's a bit of a stretch without more symptoms.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the most likely diagnosis is zinc deficiency. It fits the skin changes, growth delay, and nutritional deficiencies. But I should keep an open mind and consider other possibilities as more information becomes available.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 19-month-old boy, with a focus on conditions that could explain his symptoms:\n\n1. **Incontinentia Pigmenti** - A genetic disorder that matches the skin findings of hyperpigmented and hypopigmented patches.\n2. **Kwashiorkor** - A form of malnutrition characterized by protein deficiency, which can lead to edema and skin changes.\n3. **Zinc Deficiency** - Can cause skin lesions, growth delays, and may explain the reticulate hyperpigmentation.\n4. **Glucocorticoid Deficiency** - Could cause skin changes and growth delay, but doesn't explain all symptoms.\n5. **Severe Food Allergy** - Could lead to malabsorption and skin issues, but may not explain the specific skin pattern.\n6. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis** - A rare condition that can cause skin changes and developmental issues.\n7. **Menkes Disease** - A genetic disorder affecting copper levels, leading to skin and hair changes.\n8. **Autoimmune Enteropathy** - Can cause malabsorption and skin issues, though rare in young children.\n9. **Mitochondrial Disorder** - Could explain developmental delay and skin changes, but is a less likely option.\n10. **Multiple Carboxylase Deficiency (Biotinidase Deficiency)** - A metabolic disorder that can cause skin rashes, developmental delays, and nutritional deficiencies.\n\nAfter considering all the symptoms and test results, the top differential diagnosis is **Zinc Deficiency**, as it aligns well with the skin changes, growth delay, and nutritional deficiencies observed in the child.

Red-to-brown dome-shaped papules coalescing into plaques were present on the upper extremities. The lesions were nontender and nonpruritic. Cervical and axillary lymph nodes were palpable. The patient had a muffled voice and reported shortness of breath with exertion. Results of laboratory investigation demonstrated marked leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 77.5 × 103/uL with 76.5% lymphocytes. No blasts were present on peripheral smear. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis demonstrated multiple enlarged mediastinal, axillary, subpectoral, abdominopelvic, and inguinal lymph nodes.

We've got a man in his 60s with some pretty distinctive skin issues. He's got these red-to-brown papules that are forming plaques, and he's losing hair from his eyebrows. That's interesting. Plus, there's an eschar on his nose. That's a bit concerning.\n\nNow, he's also got swollen lymph nodes in his neck and armpits, and he's experiencing some shortness of breath. That's pointing towards something systemic, maybe a blood disorder or a type of lymphoma.\n\nThe lab results show a really high white blood cell count with a lot of lymphocytes. That's a big clue. It's making me think of a lymphoproliferative disorder. Maybe something like chronic lymphocytic leukemia or a non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nThe CT scan adds more to the picture. There are a lot of enlarged lymph nodes all over, and some small nodules in the lungs. This is definitely a widespread issue, not just skin-deep.\n\nSo, what could this be? Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, like mycosis fungoides, is on my mind because of the skin lesions and lymph node involvement. But I'm not sure it explains the blood findings.\n\nLet's consider other possibilities.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia could explain the blood results, but it doesn't usually cause these specific skin changes.\n\nMaybe it's a rare condition like Sézary syndrome, which is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. It can cause skin changes, lymphadenopathy, and abnormal blood cells.\n\nBut wait, let's not forget about other lymphomas, like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. It can present aggressively with skin involvement and lymphadenopathy.\n\nI should also consider angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. It can cause skin changes, lymphadenopathy, and abnormal blood tests.\n\nNow, what about something like adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma? It can cause skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, and leukocytosis with lymphocytes.\n\nAfter thinking it through, I'm leaning towards Sézary syndrome. It fits the skin changes, the blood abnormalities, and the lymph node involvement. It seems to tie everything together.\n\nBut I should double-check. Let's see if there's anything else that fits better. Hmm, maybe I should reconsider adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. It also matches the presentation, especially with the blood involvement.\n\nAlright, after going through everything again, I think adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma is a strong contender.

Previously, he had been well, with morphological remission found on a recent bone marrow biopsy. The patient had no significant dermatological history, except an allergy to cashew nuts and a prior episode (6 mo) of urticaria during a platelet transfusion that had resolved with 1 dose of oral antihistamine. The patient’s medications included ondansetron, aprepitant, prednisolone, and oxycodone (supportive care initiated with chemotherapy), and long-term posaconazole and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole treatment. Lesions were noted on day 2 of the fourth cycle of a chemotherapy regimen comprising fludarabine, cytarabine, and filgrastim (G-CSF). Initially present over the distal limbs, palms, and soles, the lesions progressed to the proximal limbs and lower trunk during 24 hours (Figure, A and B). The patient developed a fever, which we extensively investigated. Intravenous cefotaxime was commenced, but because no infectious source was identified, the fever was thought to be secondary to cytarabine. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 16-year-old boy with acute leukemia, and he's developed these tender, red plaques and nodules during chemotherapy. That's interesting. He's on a bunch of medications, including fludarabine, cytarabine, and filgrastim. Hmm, these lesions showed up on day 2 of his chemotherapy cycle. They started on his hands and feet and then spread. That's pretty quick progression.\n\nOkay, so what could be causing this? Well, the timing is key here. It's happening during chemotherapy, so maybe it's a reaction to one of the drugs. I've heard of something called Sweet's syndrome, which can cause similar skin issues and is sometimes linked to leukemia and medications like G-CSF. That seems like a strong possibility.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. What about other potential causes? The patient is on several medications, so a drug rash is possible. Drugs like trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are known to cause skin reactions. Could it be that?\n\nOh, and there's the fever. They thought it might be from cytarabine, but what if it's related to the skin issue? Infections are always a concern, especially in someone with leukemia. Could this be an infection like cellulitis or erysipelas? But then, there's no clear infectious source, so maybe not.\n\nHmm, let's think about other conditions. Vasculitis could cause skin lesions and fever, right? And leukemia could make him more susceptible to that. But would vasculitis present this acutely during chemotherapy?\n\nWhat about neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis? It's another condition that can happen in people with leukemia during chemotherapy. The symptoms fit, with tender skin lesions and fever. This might be a strong contender.\n\nOkay, let's not forget about drug-induced interstitial lung disease. Some chemotherapy drugs can cause lung issues, which might lead to fever and skin reactions. But would it present with distinct skin lesions like this?\n\nAnd then there's systemic lupus erythematosus. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including skin lesions and fever. But it seems less likely given the acute onset during chemotherapy.\n\nAlright, let's rank these possibilities. Sweet's syndrome seems like a strong candidate because of the leukemia and G-CSF use. Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis is also a good fit because it matches the symptoms and the context of chemotherapy. A drug rash from something like trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is possible but seems less likely given the specific presentation. Vasculitis and lupus seem less likely due to the acute nature and context. And drug-induced lung disease doesn't quite fit the skin lesion pattern.\n\nSo, after thinking it through, Sweet's syndrome and neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis are the top contenders.

He had emigrated from Ghana 2 years before but denied any illness there. His visual acuity without correction was 20/20 OD and 20/20 OS, although he had to manually elevate his eyelids to see the Snellen chart. He had no movement of the right eye past midline in elevation, adduction, depression, and abduction and no movement of the left eye past midline in elevation, depression, and abduction, with 50% deficit of adduction. His external examination results were notable for a margin reflex distance 1 of −4 mm OU and a levator function of 0 OU. On funduscopic examination, his optic nerves were sharp and pink without atrophy, maculae and retinal vasculature were normal, and peripheral retina appeared normal without pigment abnormalities. A review of systems was negative for fatigue, generalized muscle weakness, or neurologic deficits. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Kearns-Sayre syndrome", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an 18-year-old guy with progressive ptosis and ophthalmoplegia in both eyes. That's been going on for a couple of years now. Hmm, he's from Ghana but doesn't mention being sick there. His vision is perfect when he lifts his eyelids, so that's interesting. No movement past midline in either eye for most directions, and his levator function is zero. That's a big clue. \n\nOkay, so what could this be? My first thought is myasthenia gravis. It's known for causing muscle weakness that worsens with use, but usually, you'd expect some fluctuating weakness or fatigue, and he doesn't have that. Still, it's worth considering. \n\nNext, let's think about chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia, or CPEO. This condition often comes with ptosis and eye movement issues, and it's mitochondrial, so it fits the gradual progression. Plus, there's no mention of systemic symptoms here, which aligns with CPEO. \n\nNow, could it be a congenital myopathy? Those can cause muscle weakness, but they usually show up earlier in life. Still, some types might present later, so it's something to keep in mind. \n\nWhat about ocular myasthenia gravis? It's like myasthenia gravis but limited to the eyes. The lack of systemic symptoms could fit, but again, we'd expect some fluctuating weakness. \n\nKearns-Sayre syndrome is another possibility. It's a mitochondrial disorder with similar eye symptoms, and it often includes other issues like pigmentary retinopathy. But this guy's retinas look normal, so that's a strike against it. \n\nWe should also think about orbital myositis. It causes eye movement problems, but it's usually painful and comes with swelling, neither of which he has. So, that's probably not it. \n\nHow about a third cranial nerve palsy?

Let’s think step by step.\n### INPUT:\nAn otherwise healthy man in his 50s was referred to the Department of Dermatology with a 5-year history of an asymptomatic, gradually enlarging, reddish hematomalike plaque with a brownish peripheral border in his left axilla (Figure 1). The patient described the spontaneous onset of the lesion and reported no previous history of trauma or any other systemic symptoms; he had previously applied a topical antifungal cream but observed no lesion improvement. Physical examination revealed a nonindurated and well-defined 10 × 8-cm reddish-brown annular plaque with peripheral ecchymosis. No local lymphadenopathy was observed. Two biopsy specimens were obtained from different areas of the lesion for immunohistochemical studies; vascular channel endothelial cells were positive for CD31, CD34, and D2-40 and negative for human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) (latent nuclear antigen) and Wilms tumor 1 (WT1). Serologic tests for HIV and hepatitis B and C were negative. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Benign lymphangioendothelioma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a man in his 50s with a reddish, hematomalike plaque in his left armpit. It's been there for 5 years, and it's slowly getting bigger. He says it doesn't hurt, and he hasn't had any trauma there. Hmm, that's interesting. He tried an antifungal cream, but no luck. So, it's probably not a fungal infection.\n\nWhen I look at the description, it's a well-defined, reddish-brown plaque with a brownish border. It's not hard to the touch, and there's no swelling in the nearby lymph nodes. That's good to know because it might rule out something more serious like a malignancy.\n\nNow, let's think about what this could be. A hemangioma comes to mind first. They're often red and can grow over time. But, let's not jump to conclusions just yet.\n\nThe biopsy results are key here. The endothelial cells are positive for CD31, CD34, and D2-40. These are markers we often see in vascular tumors. But, they're negative for HHV-8 and WT1. That's important because it helps us rule out Kaposi's sarcoma, which is often linked to HHV-8.\n\nOkay, so what else could it be? Spindle cell hemangioma is a possibility. It's a benign vascular tumor that can match this description. But, wait, let's not forget about other options.\n\nAngiosarcoma is a consideration, but it's usually more aggressive and would likely show different biopsy results. So, that's probably not it.\n\nHow about targetoid hemosiderotic hemangioma? It's a bit of a mouthful, but it fits the description of a reddish plaque with a brownish border. And the biopsy results could align with this too.\n\nLet's think about other possibilities. A tufted angioma could be in the running. It's a benign vascular tumor that can appear as a reddish-brown plaque. But, does it match the biopsy results perfectly? Maybe not.\n\nWhat about a verrucous hemangioma? It's usually more warty in appearance, so that might not be the best fit here.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about a cherry angioma. They're common, but they're usually smaller and more circular, not like this large plaque.\n\nNow, considering everything, I think the most likely diagnosis is a targetoid hemosiderotic hemangioma. It matches the appearance and the biopsy results. But, I'm going to keep spindle cell hemangioma and tufted angioma in mind as possibilities too, just in case.\n\nSo, after going through everything, my top differential diagnoses are targetoid hemosiderotic hemangioma, spindle cell hemangioma, and tufted angioma. I feel pretty confident about this conclusion.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnoses for the lesion in the man's left axilla are as follows:\n\n1. **Targetoid Hemosiderotic Hemangioma** - This condition matches the description of a reddish plaque with a brownish border and aligns with the biopsy results showing positivity for CD31, CD34, and D2-40.\n\n2. **Spindle Cell Hemangioma** - A benign vascular tumor that could fit the clinical and histological presentation.\n\n3. **Tufted Angioma** - A benign vascular tumor that can appear as a reddish-brown plaque, although it may not perfectly match the biopsy results.\n\n4. **Cherry Angioma** - Common vascular lesions, but typically smaller and more circular than the described plaque.\n\n5. **Verrucous Hemangioma** - Usually more warty in appearance, which doesn't perfectly match the smooth plaque described.\n\n6. **Hemangioma** - A general term for vascular tumors, which could fit the clinical appearance but is less specific.\n\n7. **Angiosarcoma** - A more aggressive vascular malignancy, unlikely given the benign biopsy results.\n\n8. **Kaposi's Sarcoma** - Ruled out by negative HHV-8 staining.\n\n9. **Bacillary Angiomatosis** - Typically associated with systemic symptoms and positive staining for Bartonella species, not mentioned here.\n\n10. **Pseudo-Kaposi's Sarcoma (Acroangiodermatitis)** - Usually associated with other systemic conditions or trauma, not applicable in this case.\n\nThese diagnoses are ranked based on how well they align with the clinical presentation and biopsy findings, with targetoid hemosiderotic hemangioma being the most likely.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Oncology', 'Surgery', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine']"}

Emergency department evaluation noted a heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure of 173/90 mm Hg, and a temperature of 37.1 °C. An electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm with complete heart block (CHB) and a narrow QRS junctional escape at 65 beats per minute (Figure, A). Investigation revealed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 30 mm/h (normal limits, 0-15 mm/h) and a C-reactive protein level of 6.3 mg/dL (reference range, 0.0-1.0 mg/dL [to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10.0]). Tests for kidney function, hepatic function, a complete blood cell count, troponin T levels, creatine kinase levels, thyrotropin levels, antinuclear antibodies, and rheumatoid factor had normal results, and tests for anti–streptolysin O and anti–DNAse B titers, Lyme IgG and IgM titers, Coxiella burnetti and Bartonella serologies, Epstein-Barr virus serology, and cytomegalovirus quantification had negative results. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no structural abnormalities, while fluorine 18–labeledfluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography (FDG-PET–CT) showed a small focal area of FDG uptake in the region of the membranous septum (Figure, B). Systemic FDG uptake was absent. A CT showed no hilar adenopathy or pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities. Over the next 48 hours, the patient’s junctional rhythm accelerated to 90 beats per minute with ventriculoatrial block before acutely degenerating to a narrow complex escape rhythm of 45 beats per minutes associated with lightheadedness (Figure, C). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Viral myocarditis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a young adult who's been feeling really tired, having heart palpitations, and getting out of breath easily. That's been going on for about a week. Before all this started, they had a fever, muscle aches, a sore throat, and a cough. So, it sounds like they had some kind of viral infection first.\n\nNow, when they went to the emergency room, their heart rate was 64 beats per minute, which is a bit slow, and their blood pressure was 173/90 mm Hg, which is on the high side. Their temperature was almost normal, just slightly elevated at 37.1 °C. The ECG showed something interesting - a complete heart block with a narrow QRS complex at 65 beats per minute. That's not something you see every day.\n\nThe lab tests showed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level, which means there's some inflammation going on. But all the other tests, like kidney and liver function, blood counts, and even tests for specific infections like Lyme disease or strep, came back normal. So, we can rule out a lot of common causes.\n\nThe echocardiogram didn't show any structural heart problems, which is good. But the FDG-PET-CT scan showed a small area of uptake in the membranous septum. That suggests some inflammation right there, which could explain the heart block.\n\nOver the next couple of days, things changed. The junctional rhythm sped up to 90 beats per minute and then suddenly dropped to 45 beats per minute, which made the patient feel lightheaded. That's a significant change and suggests the heart's conduction system is really being affected.\n\nSo, what could be causing all this? Initially, I thought about Lyme carditis because it can cause heart block. But the Lyme tests were negative, so that's out. What about sarcoidosis? It can cause heart block and show up on a PET scan, but usually, you'd see more widespread uptake or other symptoms. It's possible, but not the best fit.\n\nInfective endocarditis crossed my mind, but there are no vegetations on the echo, and the blood cultures aren't mentioned, so it seems unlikely. Rheumatic fever could cause heart block, but the lack of other symptoms or positive tests makes it less likely.\n\nCould it be a viral cause? Viral myocarditis can cause conduction issues, and the initial viral symptoms fit. But the PET findings are more localized, which isn't typical for myocarditis.\n\nNeurocardiogenic syncope was considered, but the conduction abnormalities are too significant for that. What about aortic regurgitation? It can cause conduction issues if the aorta is involved, but the echo didn't show any valve problems.\n\nTuberculosis is a possibility. It can cause localized inflammation and show up on PET scans. But without more systemic symptoms or risk factors, it's a bit of a stretch.\n\nAutoimmune disorders like lupus or ANCA-associated vasculitis could cause inflammation, but the tests for those were negative, so they're unlikely.\n\nIn the end, I'm thinking it might be sarcoidosis. Even though the presentation is atypical, it fits the inflammation and PET findings better than the other options. But I'm not completely convinced, and we might need more information to be sure.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Lyme Carditis** - Initially considered due to the heart block, but ruled out by negative Lyme tests.\n\n2. **Sarcoidosis** - A possibility due to the inflammation and PET scan findings, but atypical presentation makes it less convincing.\n\n3. **Viral Myocarditis** - Fits the initial viral symptoms and conduction issues, but the localized PET findings are not typical.\n\n4. **Infective Endocarditis** - Unlikely due to the lack of vegetations on the echocardiogram and no mention of positive blood cultures.\n\n5. **Rheumatic Fever** - Considered due to the potential for heart block, but lacks supporting symptoms or positive tests.\n\n6. **Neurocardiogenic Syncope** - Unlikely as the conduction abnormalities are too significant for this diagnosis.\n\n7. **Aortic Regurgitation** - Possible if the aorta was involved, but the echo showed no valve abnormalities.\n\n8. **Tuberculosis** - A possibility due to localized inflammation and PET findings, but lacks systemic symptoms or risk factors.\n\n9. **Autoimmune Disorders (e.g., Lupus, ANCA-associated Vasculitis)** - Unlikely due to negative tests for these conditions.\n\n10. **Idiopathic Focal Conduction System Disease** - A consideration given the localized PET uptake and progressive conduction disturbance without clear systemic disease evidence.\n\nAfter reviewing all the information, the top differential diagnoses, in order of consideration, are:\n\n1. **Sarcoidosis** - Despite the atypical presentation, it aligns with the inflammation and PET findings.\n2. **Viral Myocarditis** - Fits the initial symptoms and conduction issues, though the PET findings are atypical.\n3. **Idiopathic Focal Conduction System Disease** - Considered due to the localized PET uptake and conduction disturbances without systemic evidence.\n4. **Tuberculosis** - Possible due to localized inflammation, but lacks systemic symptoms or risk factors.\n5. **Lyme Carditis** - Although initially considered, it remains a possibility if there was a false negative test.\n\nThese diagnoses are prioritized based on the combination of clinical presentation, investigation findings, and the nature of the conduction disturbances.

In the emergency department, the patient’s temperature was 36.7 °C (98.1 °F); blood pressure, 121/82 mm Hg; pulse, 74/min; respiratory rate, 15/min; and oxygen saturation, 99% on room air. Physical examination revealed petechiae within a poorly demarcated erythematous patch on the left dorsal foot (Figure 1, left panel), splinter hemorrhages on the right thumbnail (Figure 1, center panel), and petechial macules on the palms and soles, most numerous on the distal digits. There was no murmur or plop on cardiac auscultation. Neurologic examination findings were significant for left eye nystagmus and inability to adduct the right eye on left gaze, consistent with right-sided internuclear ophthalmoplegia. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head showed 2 acute infarcts in the right cerebellum. Results of laboratory testing were notable for mild leukocytosis (12.2 × 109/L), mild thrombocytosis (439 × 109/L), and elevated troponin level (4.4 ng/mL); results of a comprehensive metabolic panel and the remainder of the complete blood cell count were normal. An electrocardiogram showed T-wave inversions in lead V2, consistent with a non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Transthoracic echocardiogram and cardiac CT angiography (Figure 1, right panel) were performed. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Left atrial myxoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 40-year-old woman who's come in with a bunch of symptoms. She's feeling dizzy, has weakness in her legs, blurred vision, and even chest pain. Plus, there's a painful rash on her foot. That's quite a mix of things going on.\n\nFirst off, the rash is interesting. It's a painful one with petechiae, which are those small red or purple spots. That makes me think of something like vasculitis, where the blood vessels get inflamed. But let's not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nNow, she's also got these neurological symptoms. Dizziness and imbalance could point to something going on in the brain or nervous system. The blurred vision and the specific eye movement problem, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, are pretty telling. That's often linked to problems in the brainstem, maybe a stroke or something similar.\n\nOh, and there's the chest pain. That's always concerning. Her troponin levels are elevated, which suggests some heart muscle damage. The EKG shows T-wave inversions, which could mean a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, or NSTEMI. That's a type of heart attack.\n\nPutting this all together, we've got a rash, neurological issues, and heart problems. That's a pretty broad range of symptoms. I'm thinking this could be something that affects the blood vessels throughout the body, like a systemic vasculitis.\n\nPolyarteritis nodosa comes to mind. It's a condition where medium-sized arteries get inflamed, and it can cause a wide range of symptoms like this. But wait, let's not settle on that just yet.\n\nThe combination of skin, neurological, and cardiac symptoms is also making me think of other possibilities, like infective endocarditis. That's when bacteria infect the heart valves, leading to emboli that can cause strokes and other issues. The petechiae and splinter hemorrhages fit that picture too.\n\nBut, there's no obvious heart murmur, which you often get with endocarditis. And the echocardiogram didn't show any vegetations on the heart valves. Hmm, that makes it less likely.\n\nWhat about something like systemic lupus erythematosus? It's an autoimmune disease that can affect multiple systems, including the skin, nervous system, and heart. The symptoms could fit, but we don't have any specific lupus-related lab results to back that up.\n\nLet's not forget about antiphospholipid syndrome. It's another condition that can cause clotting issues, leading to strokes and heart problems, along with skin manifestations. But again, we'd need more lab results to confirm that.\n\nOh, and there's also Buerger's disease, which affects the small and medium-sized arteries and veins, often linked to smoking. It can cause skin and neurological symptoms, but it's more common in the limbs.\n\nAfter thinking it through, I'm leaning towards infective endocarditis. Even without the murmur or vegetations, the combination of symptoms and lab findings fit. But I'm keeping polyarteritis nodosa and antiphospholipid syndrome in mind as possibilities too.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the symptoms and test results provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Infective Endocarditis** - This condition involves bacterial infection of the heart valves, leading to embolic phenomena that can cause strokes and other systemic issues. The presence of petechiae, splinter hemorrhages, and elevated troponin levels aligns with this diagnosis.\n\n2. **Polyarteritis Nodosa** - A systemic vasculitis affecting medium-sized arteries, which can lead to a wide range of symptoms including skin manifestations, neurological issues, and cardiac involvement.\n\n3. **Antiphospholipid Syndrome** - An autoimmune disorder that can cause clotting issues, leading to strokes and cardiac problems, along with skin manifestations like livedo reticularis.\n\n4. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus** - A systemic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organ systems, including the skin, nervous system, and heart, presenting with varied symptoms.\n\n5. **Buerger's Disease (Thromboangiitis Obliterans)** - A condition that affects small and medium-sized arteries and veins, often related to smoking, leading to skin and neurological symptoms.\n\n6. **Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)** - A complex disorder involving both clotting and bleeding due to overactivation of the clotting cascade, which can lead to skin and organ involvement.\n\n7. **Meningococcemia** - A severe bacterial infection caused by Neisseria meningitidis, which can present with a rash, fever, and neurological symptoms.\n\n8. **Giant Cell Arteritis** - A type of vasculitis affecting large vessels, which can lead to neurological symptoms and vision changes, though it typically presents in older adults.\n\n9. **Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)** - A blood disorder characterized by clotting in small blood vessels throughout the body, leading to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and neurological symptoms.\n\n10. **Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome** - A group of disorders that affect connective tissues, which can lead to skin hyperelasticity and vascular fragility, though it's more of a genetic condition.\n\nAfter considering all the symptoms and test results, the top differential diagnoses are **Infective Endocarditis**, **Polyarteritis Nodosa**, and **Antiphospholipid Syndrome**, as they most closely align with the patient's presentation. However, further testing and clinical correlation would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.", "topic": "['Valvular Heart Disease', 'Neurology', 'Stroke', 'Dermatology', 'Cardiology']"}

The intraocular pressure (IOP) was raised (26 mm Hg) and was treated with a topical β-blocker. Otherwise, her condition was managed conservatively for presumed viral conjunctivitis. She self-presented 6 days later with intermittent visual blurring, mild eyelid swelling, and conjunctival chemosis. The IOP remained raised (24 mm Hg). An inflammatory or allergic etiology was suspected; therefore, topical corticosteroids and a prostaglandin analogue were also prescribed. One week later at planned follow-up, the patient had dilated and tortuous bulbar blood vessels (Figure 1). Further interrogation of the history revealed a left-sided nonspecific dull headache, constant for the previous 2 months, and an annoying “whooshing” noise in the patient’s left ear. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Carotid-cavernous fistula", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 68-year-old woman who's been dealing with some pretty uncomfortable symptoms in her left eye. It's been red and bothering her for about three weeks now, and it's not getting better with the usual treatments like antibiotics or lubricants. That's a bit odd, isn't it? Usually, if it were a simple infection, we'd expect some improvement by now.\n\nNow, her intraocular pressure is on the higher side, 26 mm Hg. That's definitely something to keep in mind. They gave her a topical β-blocker for that, which makes sense. But the fact that her condition isn't improving makes me think there's more going on here.\n\nShe comes back after six days, and things aren't looking great. She's got some visual blurring, her eyelid is a bit swollen, and there's chemosis, which is when the conjunctiva gets all puffy. The pressure is still high at 24 mm Hg. Hmm, that's not good. They're thinking it might be something inflammatory or allergic, so they add corticosteroids and a prostaglandin analogue. But wait, wouldn't that typically help if it were inflammation?\n\nA week later, she's back again, and now there are these dilated and tortuous blood vessels on the surface of her eye. That's a big clue. And then we find out she's had a dull headache on the left side for two months and a 'whooshing' sound in her left ear. That's really interesting.\n\nThe 'whooshing' noise makes me think of a vascular issue, like something causing abnormal blood flow. Could it be a carotid-cavernous fistula? That would fit with the eye symptoms and the headache. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet.\n\nLet's consider other possibilities. Could it be something like a dural arteriovenous fistula? That could explain the headache and the whooshing sound too. Or maybe even a cavernous sinus thrombosis? That would cause some serious symptoms, including the eye findings and headache.\n\nBut wait, there's also the raised intraocular pressure to think about. That could be linked to neovascular glaucoma, especially with those abnormal blood vessels in the eye. And what about a retinal vein occlusion? That could cause some of these symptoms too.\n\nOh, and we shouldn't forget about temporal arteritis. It's a bit of a wildcard, but it can cause headaches and vision problems. And then there's the possibility of a brain tumor, like a meningioma. That could explain the headache and some of the other neurological symptoms.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Let's rank these possibilities. I think a carotid-cavernous fistula is still high on the list because it explains the eye symptoms and the whooshing sound. But dural arteriovenous fistula is up there too. Cavernous sinus thrombosis is a strong contender, especially with the severity of the symptoms.\n\nNeovascular glaucoma and retinal vein occlusion make sense with the eye findings, but they don't explain the headache and whooshing sound as well. Temporal arteritis and meningioma are less likely, but we can't completely rule them out.\n\nIn the end, I think a carotid-cavernous fistula is the most likely diagnosis. It ties together the key symptoms in a way that makes sense. But we should definitely keep dural arteriovenous fistula and cavernous sinus thrombosis in mind as we move forward.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the symptoms and findings described, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the condition, with each step presenting a unique potential diagnosis:\n\n1. **Carotid-Cavernous Fistula** - This condition can explain the combination of eye symptoms, headache, and the \"whooshing\" sound due to abnormal blood flow.\n\n2. **Dural Arteriovenous Fistula** - Similar to a carotid-cavernous fistula, this could account for the headache and whooshing sound, along with the eye findings.\n\n3. **Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis** - This condition could cause severe symptoms including the eye findings, headache, and possibly the whooshing sound.\n\n4. **Neovascular Glaucoma** - This could explain the raised intraocular pressure and abnormal blood vessels in the eye, but not the headache or whooshing sound.\n\n5. **Retinal Vein Occlusion** - This might cause some of the eye symptoms, but it doesn't account for the headache or whooshing noise.\n\n6. **Temporal Arteritis** - Although it can cause headaches and vision problems, it's less likely to cause the specific eye symptoms and whooshing sound.\n\n7. **Meningioma** - A brain tumor could explain the headache and some neurological symptoms, but it's less likely to cause the specific eye findings.\n\n8. **Orbital Cellulitis** - This could cause eye redness and swelling, but it doesn't typically cause a whooshing sound or the specific vascular changes.\n\n9. **Vascular Tumor of the Orbit** - This could explain some of the eye symptoms and vascular changes, but it's less common and doesn't fully account for the headache.\n\n10. **Inflammatory Pseudotumor of the Orbit** - This could cause some of the eye symptoms, but it's less likely to cause the whooshing sound or specific vascular findings.\n\nAfter considering all the symptoms and test results, the top three most likely diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Carotid-Cavernous Fistula**\n2. **Dural Arteriovenous Fistula**\n3. **Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis**\n\nThese conditions best explain the combination of eye symptoms, headache, and the distinctive \"whooshing\" sound.

She was born in 1973 at 38th week of gestation followed by a normal delivery (weight, 3.15 kg and head circumference, 42 cm) to nonconsanguineous parents. The head size was normal at birth, and no other abnormalities were seen during her infancy. At age 2 years, her parents noticed that she had delayed motor and language milestones. She experienced a progressive developmental delay such as reduction of head growth, loss of acquired communication, and loss of motor functions between ages 9 and 12 years. The severity of scoliosis increased with age, and she became a wheelchair user at age 18 years. She was referred to us at age 40 years with the characteristic features of growth deceleration (height, 142 cm; weight, 22 kg; body mass index, 11 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]), apraxia, left-sided hemiplegia, spasticity, sleep apnea, constipation, osteoporosis, hypoalgesia, and repetitive hand tapping (Video). Blood reports showed anemia (hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL; to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10) and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (47 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259). There was no history of autistic behavior, vision or hearing impairments, or epilepsy. The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with T wave inversion (V3-V6), and echocardiography showed mild cardiomegaly. The brain magnetic resonance imaging studies showed a diffuse reduction in the corpus callosum involving splenium and enlarged right ventricle, resulting in cerebral lateral ventricular asymmetry (Figure, C). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Rett syndrome", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 42-year-old woman with a bunch of symptoms like microcephaly, short stature, intellectual disability, and scoliosis. She's also got some neurological stuff going on, like encephalopathy and gait abnormalities. Hmm, that's quite a list.\n\nFirst off, Rett syndrome comes to mind. It's known for causing developmental issues, especially in girls, with symptoms like microcephaly and loss of motor skills. But wait, Rett syndrome usually starts earlier, and she didn't have any symptoms at birth. Plus, there's no mention of the classic hand-wringing behavior. So, maybe it's not Rett syndrome after all.\n\nLet's think about some other possibilities. What about Mucopolysaccharidosis type I? It can cause developmental delays and skeletal abnormalities like scoliosis. But, there's no mention of coarse facial features or corneal clouding, which are pretty typical for this condition. So, that's probably not it either.\n\nNow, could it be Ataxia-Telangiectasia? It's got some overlapping symptoms like intellectual disability and neurological decline. But, there's no mention of telangiectasias or immunodeficiency, which are kind of hallmark features. So, I'm not convinced it's that.\n\nOh, and what about Angelman syndrome? It can cause developmental delays and neurological issues, but it usually has distinct behavioral characteristics, like a happy demeanor and little to no speech, which aren't mentioned here. So, that's probably not a match.\n\nLet's not forget about mitochondrial disorders. They can cause a wide range of symptoms, including encephalopathy and muscle issues. The T wave inversion on the ECG could be a hint towards a mitochondrial problem. This is starting to seem more likely.\n\nNow, considering the brain MRI findings, the reduced corpus callosum and ventricular asymmetry are interesting. These could point towards a neurodegenerative disorder. Hmm, maybe something like Adrenoleukodystrophy? It can cause cerebral abnormalities and neurological decline. But, there's no mention of adrenal issues, which are usually part of the package. So, I'm not sure.\n\nLet's think about other genetic disorders. Could it be a chromosomal deletion syndrome, like 1p36 deletion syndrome? It can cause developmental delays, intellectual disability, and some of the neurological symptoms she's experiencing. But, there are usually distinct facial features and other systemic issues. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWhat about a metabolic disorder like Glutaric acidemia type II? It can cause developmental delays and some neurological symptoms. But, there's no mention of any metabolic crises or specific odor, which are typical for this condition. So, that's probably not it.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about environmental factors. Could it be something like Fetal Alcohol Syndrome? It can cause developmental delays and some physical abnormalities. But, there's no history of maternal alcohol use, so that's unlikely.\n\nFinally, what about a condition like MECP2 duplication syndrome? It's known to cause intellectual disability and neurological symptoms in females, though it's more commonly seen in males. The symptoms kind of fit, but it's a bit of a long shot without more specific information.\n\nSo, after going through all of this, I think the most likely diagnosis is a mitochondrial disorder. The combination of encephalopathy, muscle issues, and the ECG findings make it a strong contender. But, I'm also considering MECP2 duplication syndrome as a possibility. It's not a perfect fit, but it could explain some of the neurological symptoms. Yeah, that's where I'm landing for now.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnoses for the 42-year-old woman with microcephaly, short stature, intellectual disability, scoliosis, and neurological symptoms are as follows:\n\n1. **Mitochondrial Disorder** - This is a strong contender given the combination of encephalopathy, muscle issues, and the ECG findings.\n2. **MECP2 Duplication Syndrome** - Although more commonly seen in males, it can cause intellectual disability and neurological symptoms in females.\n3. **Rett Syndrome** - Known for causing developmental issues, especially in girls, but typically starts earlier and includes hand-wringing behavior.\n4. **Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I** - Can cause developmental delays and skeletal abnormalities, but usually includes coarse facial features and corneal clouding.\n5. **Ataxia-Telangiectasia** - Overlapping symptoms like intellectual disability and neurological decline, but typically includes telangiectasias and immunodeficiency.\n6. **Angelman Syndrome** - Causes developmental delays and neurological issues, but usually has distinct behavioral characteristics.\n7. **Adrenoleukodystrophy** - Can cause cerebral abnormalities and neurological decline, but usually includes adrenal issues.\n8. **1p36 Deletion Syndrome** - Can cause developmental delays and intellectual disability, but usually includes distinct facial features.\n9. **Glutaric Acidemia Type II** - Can cause developmental delays and neurological symptoms, but typically includes metabolic crises and a specific odor.\n10. **Fetal Alcohol Syndrome** - Causes developmental delays and physical abnormalities, but requires a history of maternal alcohol use.\n\nThese diagnoses are ranked based on the combination of symptoms and test results, with mitochondrial disorder and MECP2 duplication syndrome being the most likely possibilities.

Multiple prior office visits with referring ophthalmologists during which eyes were dilated showed normal results. Clinical examination revealed 180° of left interior subconjunctival hemorrhage with overlying conjunctival elevation and mild fullness of the left lower eyelid (Figure 1A). Fixation was central, steady, and maintained bilaterally, with full ocular motility and absence of appreciable proptosis. Penlight anterior segment examination demonstrated normally formed anterior segment structures without inflammation or hyphema in either eye, although the left eye exhibited a small intraocular lightly pigmented lesion at the 5-o'clock limbus. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) was deemed appropriate and further demonstrated normal intraocular pressures bilaterally. Handheld slitlamp examination localized the left eye 2-mm limbal lesion on the posterior corneal surface. The surrounding corneal and iris structures were normal appearing without evidence of vascularization. Ultrasound biomicroscopy was used to further evaluate both the intraocular lesion and better characterize the left lower eyelid fullness. This demonstrated no iris, angle, or ciliary body involvement by the intraocular lesion. A 10-MHz contact B-scan examination showed a large inferior orbital lesion measuring more than 17 mm in the anterior-to-posterior dimension (Figure 1B). Doppler ultrasonography did not demonstrate significant flow to suggest a vascular cause. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Metastatic neuroblastoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 14-month-old girl with recurrent subconjunctival hemorrhages on the left eye. That's a bit unusual, especially since it's been happening more often since she was 7 months old. Hmm, what could be causing this? Let's start with the basics. Subconjunctival hemorrhages can happen for a few reasons. One common cause in kids is trauma, but it keeps happening, so maybe it's not just from bumping into things. \n\nOh, there's also that conjunctival elevation and fullness in the lower eyelid. That's interesting. Could it be something more than just a simple hemorrhage? Let's think about other possibilities. Vascular lesions like a capillary hemangioma could cause these symptoms. They're pretty common in young kids and can cause fullness or swelling. \n\nBut wait, there's also a small pigmented lesion on the limbus. That's a new piece of the puzzle. Limbal lesions can be a few things. One possibility is a nevus, which is usually benign. But we should also consider a melanoma, although that's rare in someone this young. \n\nNow, let's talk about the ultrasound findings. There's a large orbital lesion, more than 17 mm, and it's not very vascular. That rules out some of the more vascular tumors like a hemangioma. Could it be a dermoid cyst? Those are common in kids and can cause some of the symptoms we're seeing. \n\nBut let's not jump to conclusions. We should also think about other possibilities like a rhabdomyosarcoma. It's a type of orbital tumor that can occur in children and might explain the fullness and hemorrhages. \n\nOh, and what about a lymphangioma? Those can cause recurrent hemorrhages and have a cystic nature. They're not as common, but they fit some of the symptoms. \n\nLet's not forget about neuroblastoma. It can present with orbital involvement and might cause some of the symptoms we're seeing. But it's usually more aggressive, so maybe it's less likely. \n\nNow, considering everything, let's rank these possibilities. A dermoid cyst seems likely because of the orbital lesion and the child's age. But we can't ignore rhabdomyosarcoma because of its potential to cause these symptoms. Lymphangioma is also up there because it explains the hemorrhages. \n\nIn the end, after thinking it all through, I'd say the top three are dermoid cyst, rhabdomyosarcoma, and lymphangioma. They all fit the clinical picture, but we need more tests to be sure.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 14-month-old girl with recurrent left subconjunctival hemorrhages and associated findings:\n\n1. **Capillary Hemangioma** - A common vascular tumor in young children that can cause fullness and recurrent hemorrhages.\n2. **Dermoid Cyst** - A possible cause of the orbital lesion and could be related to the subconjunctival hemorrhages.\n3. **Rhabdomyosarcoma** - A type of orbital tumor in children that could explain the fullness and hemorrhages.\n4. **Lymphangioma** - Can cause recurrent hemorrhages and has a cystic nature that fits some symptoms.\n5. **Neuroblastoma** - Can present with orbital involvement, but typically more aggressive.\n6. **Nevus** - A benign limbal lesion, but less likely to cause recurrent hemorrhages.\n7. **Melanoma** - Rare in young children, but could explain the pigmented limbal lesion.\n8. **Orbital Varix** - A vascular anomaly that could cause intermittent hemorrhages.\n9. **Fibrous Dysplasia** - A bone disorder that can affect the orbit, but less likely in this case.\n10. **Teratoma** - A type of tumor that could present as an orbital mass, but less common.\n\nAfter considering all the clinical findings and test results, the top three differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Dermoid Cyst** - Fits the age and presentation of the orbital lesion.\n2. **Rhabdomyosarcoma** - A plausible cause of the fullness and recurrent hemorrhages.\n3. **Lymphangioma** - Explains the recurrent hemorrhages and cystic nature.\n\nFurther diagnostic testing, such as an MRI or biopsy, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.", "topic": "['Intraocular Tumors', 'Oncology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Pediatrics']"}

She reported a few episodes of dizziness in the couple days prior to presentation but denied chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or the recent use of illicit drugs or new medications. Shortly after arrival at the emergency department, she had a 50-second run of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Her vital signs and the results of her physical examination were normal.

The results of imaging studies, including echocardiography, computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography, and brain CT, were also unremarkable. Coronary angiography found no evidence of obstructive coronary disease. The results of the urine toxicology test were negative. An initial electrocardiogram (ECG) at presentation was reviewed (Figure). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Drug-induced QT prolongation", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 27-year-old woman who fainted, and she's had a history of heroin use. That's a big clue right there. Heroin can mess with your heart, so we should keep that in mind. But she didn't have any warning signs before she passed out, which is interesting. And she's had some dizziness lately too. No chest pain or anything like that, which is good, but still concerning.\n\nOkay, so she had a run of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in the ER. That's a type of irregular heart rhythm that can be serious. It makes me think about conditions like torsades de pointes, which can happen if your heart's electrical system is off. And that can be caused by something like a long QT interval. Hmm, let's keep that in mind.\n\nHer tests are mostly normal, which is a bit surprising. No issues with her heart structure on the echo, and her blood work is fine. No drugs showing up on the toxicology screen either, so it doesn't look like recent drug use is the culprit. But wait, her ECG might tell us more. Let's focus on that.\n\nThe ECG could show a prolonged QT interval, which would fit with torsades de pointes. That's something to check for sure. But let's not jump to conclusions yet. What else could cause fainting and this kind of heart rhythm?\n\nWell, there are other possibilities. How about some kind of structural heart problem that didn't show up on the echo? Like, maybe arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy? That's a mouthful, but it's a condition where the heart muscle is replaced by fat and scar tissue, and it can cause arrhythmias.\n\nOr could it be something with her autonomic nervous system? Like, maybe she has a vasovagal response that's causing these episodes. That's when your heart rate and blood pressure drop suddenly, making you faint. It's pretty common, actually.\n\nAnd we shouldn't forget about other substances. Even if heroin isn't showing up, could there be something else in her system? Maybe something that's affecting her heart's electrical system, like an unknown medication or a supplement.\n\nOh, and what about electrolyte imbalances? Those can definitely cause heart rhythm problems. Maybe something like hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia? Even if her blood work looks normal, there might be something subtle going on.\n\nLet's not forget about genetic conditions. Long QT syndrome can run in families, and it can cause exactly this kind of situation. So, that's another strong possibility.\n\nAnd then there's the idea of aortic dissection. That's when the layers of the aorta tear, and it can cause some crazy symptoms, including fainting. But usually, you'd see more signs on the imaging, so maybe that's not it.\n\nLastly, could it be something psychological? Like, maybe a conversion disorder where stress or emotions are causing physical symptoms? That's a bit of a stretch, but let's consider it.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the most likely explanation is torsades de pointes caused by a prolonged QT interval, maybe from a genetic condition like long QT syndrome. But we should also think about arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and the possibility of an unknown substance causing the problem. Those seem like the top contenders here.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 27-year-old woman who presented with syncope and a history of heroin use:\n\n1. **Torsades de Pointes** - This condition is characterized by a specific type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and is often associated with a prolonged QT interval on ECG.\n\n2. **Long QT Syndrome** - A genetic condition that affects the heart's electrical system, leading to episodes of fainting and potentially dangerous arrhythmias.\n\n3. **Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)** - A heart condition where the muscle in the right ventricle is replaced by fat and scar tissue, leading to arrhythmias.\n\n4. **Vasovagal Syncope** - A common cause of fainting triggered by a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure, often in response to stress or standing for long periods.\n\n5. **Electrolyte Imbalance (e.g., Hypokalemia or Hypomagnesemia)** - Although her blood work was normal, subtle electrolyte disturbances can contribute to arrhythmias.\n\n6. **Substance-Related Effects** - Despite a negative toxicology screen, the possibility of an unknown substance affecting her heart's electrical system should be considered.\n\n7. **Aortic Dissection** - Although unlikely given the normal imaging, it's a serious condition where the aorta's layers tear, potentially causing fainting and other symptoms.\n\n8. **Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT)** - A genetic disorder that can cause arrhythmias during physical or emotional stress.\n\n9. **Brugada Syndrome** - A genetic condition that affects the heart's electrical system and can cause arrhythmias, although it's more common in males.\n\n10. **Conversion Disorder** - A psychological condition where stress or emotional issues manifest as physical symptoms, including fainting.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are **Torsades de Pointes** likely caused by **Long QT Syndrome**, followed by **Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy** and the possibility of an **Unknown Substance** affecting her heart. These conditions align with her symptoms and the findings from her tests.", "topic": "['Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Adverse Drug Events', 'Rhythm Disorders', 'Cardiology']"}

That's a bit odd for a simple infection, which would usually be painful and maybe have some fluctuance if it were an abscess. So, I'm thinking this could be something more chronic or systemic.\n\nNow, let's look at the lab results. There's leukocytosis with a high neutrophil count, which could mean infection or inflammation. But there's also anemia and really high ESR and CRP levels. Anemia and these inflammatory markers make me think of something more systemic, maybe a chronic disease.\n\nThe ultrasound shows multiple enlarged lymph nodes that are hyperemic. They're getting bigger and losing their normal shape, which isn't typical for a simple reactive process. This makes me think of a more serious underlying condition, maybe a hematologic or autoimmune issue.\n\nShe didn't get better with antibiotics, which makes me doubt a bacterial infection. So, what else could it be? Lymphoma is a possibility because it can cause painless lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms like anemia and weight loss.\n\nBut wait, there's more. The MRI shows not just the neck nodes but also a destructive mass in the maxillary malar eminence and lesions in the T4 vertebra and sternum. This is getting more interesting. These bone lesions are pretty significant and make me think of Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) because it can cause bone lesions and lymphadenopathy.\n\nThe PET/CT scan shows extensive FDG-avid lymphadenopathy and lytic bone lesions. This suggests a metabolically active process, which fits with something like LCH or maybe even a malignancy like lymphoma.\n\nSo, what's the most likely diagnosis? Initially, I thought lymphoma because of the lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms. But the bone lesions and lack of response to antibiotics make me reconsider. LCH is a strong contender because it explains the bone lesions, lymphadenopathy, and systemic symptoms.\n\nBut let's not forget other possibilities. Neuroblastoma could present with lymphadenopathy and bone lesions, but it's more common in younger kids and usually has other distinct features. Osteosarcoma is unlikely because it typically presents as a single bone lesion rather than multiple.\n\nIn the end, considering all the evidence, Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis seems to be the best fit. It ties together the lymphadenopathy, bone lesions, and systemic symptoms in a way that makes sense. Yeah, that's what I'm going with.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnoses for the 7-year-old girl with progressive painless neck swelling, systemic symptoms, and imaging findings are as follows:\n\n1. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH)**: This condition is characterized by the presence of lymphadenopathy, bone lesions, and systemic symptoms such as anemia and weight loss, which align well with the patient's presentation.\n\n2. **Lymphoma**: Painless lymphadenopathy, anemia, and systemic symptoms could suggest a lymphoma, particularly given the extensive lymphadenopathy and bone involvement seen on imaging.\n\n3. **Neuroblastoma**: Although more common in younger children, it can present with lymphadenopathy and bone lesions. However, it often has other distinct features such as abdominal masses or specific metabolic markers.\n\n4. **Osteosarcoma**: Typically presents as a single bone lesion rather than multiple, making it less likely in this case.\n\n5. **Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)**: Could present with systemic symptoms, anemia, and lymphadenopathy, but usually includes other features like hepatosplenomegaly and specific laboratory findings.\n\n6. **Tuberculosis**: Can cause lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms, but the lack of response to antibiotics and specific imaging findings make it less likely.\n\n7. **Sarcoidosis**: Rare in children, but can cause lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms. However, the bone lesions are not typical for sarcoidosis.\n\n8. **Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis**: Can cause systemic symptoms and lymphadenopathy, but the bone lesions and specific imaging findings are not characteristic.\n\n9. **Chronic Osteomyelitis**: Could cause bone lesions, but the lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms are not typical.\n\n10. **Leukemia**: Can present with anemia, systemic symptoms, and lymphadenopathy, but the specific bone lesions and imaging findings are more suggestive of LCH or lymphoma.\n\nAfter considering all the clinical information and imaging findings, Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) is the most likely diagnosis, as it best explains the combination of lymphadenopathy, bone lesions, and systemic symptoms.", "topic": "['Head and Neck Surgery', 'Radiology', 'Neuroimaging', 'Neurology', 'Otolaryngology']"}

Despite having taken multiple courses of oral antibiotics, he saw no improvement in his symptoms. Over the course of 3 months, the patient went on to notice swelling and redness of his left ear (Figure 1A) that would resolve and recur every few weeks. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Relapsing polychondritis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 21-year-old guy who's been dealing with a sore throat and hoarseness for a while now, like three months. That's quite a long time to be dealing with something like this, especially since antibiotics haven't helped. So, it's probably not a simple bacterial infection. \n\nFirst off, the fact that he's had no luck with antibiotics makes me think of something viral. Viruses can definitely cause persistent throat issues, and they don't respond to antibiotics, so that's a possibility. Maybe something like mononucleosis? It's common in young adults and can cause a sore throat. \n\nBut wait, there's also this ear issue. He's got swelling and redness that comes and goes. That's weird. Ear problems can sometimes be linked to throat issues, so maybe there's a connection here. Could it be something like a viral infection affecting both the throat and the ear? \n\nNow, let's not forget about allergies. Seasonal allergies can cause throat irritation and maybe even affect the ear somehow. It's possible, but it doesn't quite explain why antibiotics didn't work. \n\nOh, and there's the possibility of something more serious, like a tumor. A tumor in the throat could definitely cause these symptoms, and it would explain why antibiotics haven't helped. But, it seems a bit unlikely in someone so young without other symptoms. \n\nHmm, what about something autoimmune? Those can cause persistent symptoms and don't respond to antibiotics. Maybe something like lupus? It's a bit of a stretch, but it could explain the recurring ear swelling too. \n\nThen there's the chance of a fungal infection. Those can be stubborn and don't respond to antibiotics. Candidiasis comes to mind, especially if there's some immune issue at play. \n\nBut let's not jump to conclusions. We should also think about non-infectious causes. Maybe it's something structural, like a Zenker's diverticulum. That could cause throat issues and maybe even affect the ear somehow. \n\nOh, and we can't ignore the possibility of a psychological component. Sometimes symptoms can be exacerbated or even caused by psychological factors. It's not common, but it's worth considering. \n\nFinally, let's think about less common infections. Tuberculosis can cause persistent throat symptoms and might explain the ear issues too. It's not typical, but it's worth considering given the chronic nature of the symptoms. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I'd say the top possibilities are a viral infection, a structural issue like a Zenker's diverticulum, and maybe even tuberculosis. Each of these could explain the symptoms in a different way, and they fit with the fact that antibiotics haven't worked.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's symptoms, ensuring that each step presents a unique hypothesis:\n\n1. **Mononucleosis** - This viral infection is common in young adults and can cause a sore throat and hoarseness.\n\n2. **Viral Pharyngitis** - A viral infection could be causing the persistent throat symptoms, as viruses do not respond to antibiotics.\n\n3. **Allergic Rhinitis** - Seasonal allergies could contribute to throat irritation and potentially affect the ear.\n\n4. **Tumor of the Throat** - A growth in the throat could cause persistent symptoms unresponsive to antibiotics.\n\n5. **Lupus** - An autoimmune disorder that could explain the recurring symptoms and ear swelling.\n\n6. **Candidiasis** - A fungal infection that might be persistent and unresponsive to antibiotics, especially if there's an underlying immune issue.\n\n7. **Zenker's Diverticulum** - A structural issue that could cause throat problems and potentially affect the ear.\n\n8. **Psychological Factors** - Symptoms could be exacerbated or caused by psychological stress or disorders.\n\n9. **Tuberculosis** - A less common infection that can cause chronic throat symptoms and might explain the ear issues.\n\n10. **Lemierre's Syndrome** - A rare condition involving a throat infection leading to complications such as ear issues.\n\nAfter considering all the information and test results, the top differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Zenker's Diverticulum** - This structural issue could explain the persistent throat symptoms and potential ear involvement.\n\n2. **Tuberculosis** - This chronic infection could account for the persistent throat symptoms and ear issues.\n\n3. **Viral Pharyngitis** - A viral infection remains a strong possibility given the lack of response to antibiotics.\n\nThese diagnoses take into account the chronic nature of the symptoms, the lack of response to antibiotics, and the unique combination of throat and ear issues.", "topic": "['Laryngology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Head and Neck Surgery']"}

Following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, low anterior resection, and 6 cycles of adjuvant FOLFOX therapy (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin), he had developed a lung metastasis (KRAS wild type) 1 year later. He subsequently developed multiple lung metastases treated with palliative local interventions (lobectomy, radiofrequency ablation) and 4 lines of chemotherapy. Owing to symptomatic lung disease, he was enrolled in a clinical trial (NCT03502733) following informed consent and achieved a confirmed partial response. After 9 months, contrast computed tomography restaging scans noted a new, 1-cm posterior subglottic lesion of unclear origin (Figure, A). He had no shortness of breath or noisy breathing, dysphagia, voice change, or hemoptysis. A partial response was maintained without evidence of progression of lung disease. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 48-year-old guy who had rectal cancer a while back. It was pretty serious, stage III, and he went through quite a bit of treatment for it. He had chemo, radiation, and surgery, and then some more chemo just to be safe. But then, a year later, he found out he had a lung metastasis. That's tough, but he's been fighting it with more treatments, including surgery and different chemo drugs. He even joined a clinical trial and had a good response to it for a while. \n\nNow, there's this new 1-cm lesion in his throat area, right below the vocal cords. It's kind of mysterious because he's not having any symptoms like trouble breathing, swallowing issues, or voice changes. That's interesting because you'd expect some symptoms with a lesion in that area. \n\nSo, what could this be? Let's start with the obvious. It could be a metastasis from his original rectal cancer. Cancer can spread, and it's not unheard of for rectal cancer to show up in unexpected places. But, he's had a good response to treatment so far, so maybe it's not that. \n\nThen there's the possibility of a second primary tumor. People who have had cancer before are at higher risk for new cancers, especially in areas exposed to similar risk factors, like the lungs and throat. This could be a new cancer unrelated to his rectal cancer. \n\nWhat about a benign tumor? It's possible, but less likely given his history. Benign tumors don't usually show up out of the blue in someone with a history like his. \n\nInfections are another thought. Maybe something like pneumonia or an abscess, but again, he's not showing symptoms you'd expect, like fever or difficulty breathing. \n\nLymphoma is another consideration. It's a type of cancer that can show up in the lymph nodes or other tissues, and it might not always cause symptoms right away. \n\nOh, and there's the chance of a neurogenic tumor. These can develop in the throat area and might not cause symptoms until they're larger. \n\nWe should also think about the possibility of a thyroid lesion. The thyroid is nearby, and nodules or tumors there can be asymptomatic. \n\nGranulomas are another possibility. These can form from inflammation or infection and might not cause symptoms. \n\nFinally, there's the chance of a carotid body tumor. These are rare, but they can show up in the neck area and might not cause symptoms right away. \n\nSo, when we put it all together, the top possibilities are a second primary tumor, a metastasis from his rectal cancer, and lymphoma. These make the most sense given his history and the fact that he's not showing symptoms. We should keep the other possibilities in mind, but they seem less likely right now.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the new subglottic lesion in the patient, considering his history of rectal cancer and lung metastasis:\n\n1. **Metastasis from Rectal Cancer**: Given the patient's history, a metastasis from his original rectal cancer is a strong consideration.\n\n2. **Second Primary Tumor**: The development of a new primary tumor in the subglottic region is plausible, especially in someone with a history of cancer.\n\n3. **Lymphoma**: Lymphomas can develop in various tissues, including the throat area, and may not present with immediate symptoms.\n\n4. **Benign Tumor**: Although less likely, a benign tumor could be present, but it's uncommon in someone with this cancer history.\n\n5. **Infection or Abscess**: An infectious process could cause a lesion, but the lack of symptoms like fever or breathing difficulty makes this less likely.\n\n6. **Neurogenic Tumor**: These can occur in the throat area and might not cause symptoms until they grow larger.\n\n7. **Thyroid Lesion**: A thyroid nodule or tumor could be asymptomatic and is a possibility given the proximity to the subglottic area.\n\n8. **Granuloma**: Granulomatous disease can result in asymptomatic lesions and should be considered.\n\n9. **Carotid Body Tumor**: Although rare, these can occur in the neck region and may not present with immediate symptoms.\n\n10. **Papilloma**: A benign growth caused by viral infection, which could be asymptomatic.\n\nReranking these possibilities based on the patient's history and lack of symptoms, the top three differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Second Primary Tumor**\n2. **Metastasis from Rectal Cancer**\n3. **Lymphoma**\n\nThese options are most consistent with the patient's history and the asymptomatic nature of the lesion.

Her medical history was unremarkable, and she had no allergies. She had been well until 2 hours before the flight home, when at the Havana airport, she developed generalized weakness, increased sweating, severe nausea, and vomiting. In flight, she had lethargy, vomiting, and urinary incontinence. On arrival to the emergency department, she was stuporous and required intubation. Initial laboratory tests showed a hemoglobin level of 10.9 g/dL (reference range, 12.0-15.2 g/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10.0]), a creatinine level of 1.31 mg/dL (reference range, 0.51-1.08 [to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4]), and a pH of 7.22 with a normal anion gap. Serum electrolyte levels; a white blood cell count; levels of glucose, creatine kinase, lactic acid, and thyrotropin; coagulation studies; and liver function tests had normal results. An electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia at 53 bpm and borderline QT interval prolongation (QTc; 465 milliseconds). A urine toxicology screen had negative results for acetaminophen, salicylates, opiates, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, and ethanol. Cerebrospinal fluid was clear, with normal levels of glucose, total protein, and white blood cells and negative microbiology and cytology testing results. A malaria smear and antigen test, respiratory viral assay, and cultures of cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and urine had negative results. Computed tomography of the head showed bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi (Figure 1). Within several hours, her level of consciousness improved spontaneously, and she was extubated. Her blood pressure was 99/61 mm Hg; pulse, 80 bpm; temperature, 37.6 °C; and oxygen saturation, 99% on room air. The patient was alert but disoriented. The pupils were 2 mm and reactive. Involuntary facial muscle twitching was noted. Her muscle tone was normal, and she had mild proximal muscle weakness with occasional bilateral upper extremity and lower extremity fasciculations and jerky movements. Deep tendon reflexes were normal, with flexor plantar responses. Her sensations to pain and vibration were normal. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Organophosphate poisoning", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 69-year-old woman who just got back from Cuba and suddenly felt weak, sweaty, and nauseous at the airport. That's quite a mix of symptoms. And then on the flight, things got worse with vomiting, lethargy, and even urinary incontinence. By the time she got to the hospital, she was stuporous and needed to be intubated. That's serious.\n\nOkay, let's look at the lab results. Her hemoglobin is a bit low, and her creatinine is slightly elevated. But what's really catching my eye is the low pH with a normal anion gap. That suggests there's some kind of non-anion gap metabolic acidosis going on. Hmm, what could cause that?\n\nThe ECG shows sinus bradycardia and a borderline QT interval prolongation. That's interesting. And the urine toxicology screen is negative for a bunch of common substances. So, it's not the usual suspects like drugs or alcohol.\n\nThe clear cerebrospinal fluid and negative tests for infections and malaria are good news, I guess. They rule out some scary possibilities like meningitis or encephalitis. But what about that CT scan showing bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi? That's a big clue. It makes me think of carbon monoxide poisoning or something else that affects the brain in a similar way.\n\nWait, she improved quickly after being intubated. That's a good sign, right? It suggests whatever was affecting her was maybe reversible. And now she's alert but disoriented, with some muscle twitching and weakness. Those are important details.\n\nSo, what could cause all of this? Let's think. The sudden onset at the airport, the symptoms during the flight, and the quick improvement make me suspect something she was exposed to environmentally. Could it be carbon monoxide from the flight or something else in the air?\n\nOh, and the bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi is really sticking out. That's classic for carbon monoxide poisoning, but it could also be cyanide poisoning. Both can cause hypoxic brain injury.\n\nLet's not forget about other possibilities. Could it be something she ate? Like, what if it was a foodborne toxin? Maybe something like tetrodotoxin from pufferfish? That could cause neurological symptoms too.\n\nBut wait, there's no mention of her eating fish, and pufferfish poisoning usually has a different set of symptoms. So, maybe that's not it.\n\nWhat about other toxins? Organophosphates could cause some neurological symptoms, but they usually have a distinct set of signs like muscle fasciculations and they weren't mentioned in the toxicology screen.\n\nAnd then there's methanol poisoning. It can cause metabolic acidosis and those CNS symptoms. But wouldn't the anion gap be elevated? Hmm, that's a bit of a problem.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Considering everything, I think cyanide poisoning is a strong contender. It fits the rapid onset, the CNS symptoms, and the quick recovery. Plus, it can cause that hyperdensity in the globus pallidi.\n\nYeah, I'm leaning towards cyanide poisoning. It just makes the most sense with all the clues we have.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Carbon Monoxide Poisoning** - The bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi on the CT scan is a classic sign of carbon monoxide exposure, which can cause hypoxic brain injury.\n\n2. **Cyanide Poisoning** - Similar to carbon monoxide, cyanide can cause rapid onset of symptoms due to hypoxia, and the quick improvement after intubation aligns with this diagnosis.\n\n3. **Methanol Poisoning** - Although typically associated with an elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis, the presence of metabolic acidosis and CNS symptoms could still suggest methanol.\n\n4. **Organophosphate Poisoning** - This could explain some neurological symptoms, but usually presents with a broader range of signs like muscle fasciculations and is often detected in toxicology screens.\n\n5. **Tetrodotoxin Poisoning** - From ingestion of pufferfish, this toxin can cause neurological symptoms, but the absence of specific mentions of seafood consumption makes it less likely.\n\n6. **Acute Porphyria** - This condition can cause neurological symptoms and abdominal pain, but the specific CT findings don't align well with porphyria.\n\n7. **Hypoglycemia** - Although the glucose level was normal, a transient hypoglycemic event could have caused the symptoms, especially with the rapid recovery.\n\n8. **Acute Dystonia** - The involuntary muscle movements could suggest a reaction to a medication or toxin, but the CT findings are not typical for dystonia.\n\n9. **Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome** - This condition involves severe muscle rigidity and altered mental status, but it's usually associated with medication use and fever, which are not present here.\n\n10. **Serotonin Syndrome** - Caused by excess serotonin, this can lead to neurological symptoms, but the absence of typical signs like hyperthermia and autonomic instability makes it less likely.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Cyanide Poisoning** emerges as the most likely diagnosis due to the rapid onset of symptoms, CNS involvement, and the characteristic findings on the CT scan. The quick improvement after supportive treatment also supports this diagnosis.", "topic": "['Emergency Medicine', 'Global Health', 'Toxicology', 'Neurology', 'Geriatrics']"}

The patient’s pediatrician diagnosed him with reactive airway disease and adenotonsillar hypertrophy. He was referred to the otolaryngology clinic, where flexible laryngoscopy revealed diffuse upper airway lymphoid hyperplasia and supraglottic edema. He was sent to the emergency department, where he was stridulous and afebrile with a normal white blood cell count and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. A computed tomography scan of the neck revealed diffuse edema and contrast enhancement of the nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and supraglottis. A chest radiograph was normal. The patient was taken urgently to the operating room for direct microlaryngoscopy (Figure 1A and B) and intubated. Results of biopsies and cultures of the tonsils, adenoids, and supraglottis revealed diffuse non-necrotizing granulomas (Figure 1C) and oropharyngeal flora with negative acid-fast bacilli and Grocott methenamine silver stains. He remained intubated, and treatment with systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics was initiated. During this time, he had a normal angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level and normal titers for antinuclear antibody (ANA), cytoplasmic antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody, perinuclear antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody, antimyeloperoxidase antibody, antiproteinase 3 antibody, anti–double-stranded DNA antibody, Smith antibody, Sjogren antibodies, and histoplasma antibodies. He also had normal results on tuberculin purified protein derivative and interferon-γ release assay (QuantiFERON; Qiagen). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Sarcoidosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 9-year-old boy who's been having a tough time with breathing, snoring, swallowing, and even losing weight for a month. That's quite a while to be dealing with these issues. His parents both had latent TB, but it was treated, so that's something to keep in mind but maybe not the main focus right now.\n\nThe pediatrician thought it might be reactive airway disease and big tonsils and adenoids, which makes sense at first glance. But then, when they looked closer with that laryngoscopy, they found a lot of lymphoid tissue and swelling in the upper airway. That's a bit more complicated.\n\nIn the ER, he didn't have a fever, and his white blood cell count was normal, but his ESR was high. That suggests some kind of inflammation or infection, but not necessarily a simple bacterial one. The CT scan showed a lot of swelling and enhancement all through the upper airway. Hmm, that's pretty extensive.\n\nThey did a chest X-ray, and it was normal, so at least we're not dealing with anything in the lungs. That's a relief. But they had to take him to surgery to get a better look and intubate him because of the stridor. The biopsies showed non-necrotizing granulomas. That's interesting because it points towards something granulomatous.\n\nThe cultures didn't show any acid-fast bacilli, and the special stains were negative too. So, it doesn't look like TB or fungal infections. And his ACE levels were normal, which makes sarcoidosis less likely. All those antibody tests came back normal, so it's not looking like any of the typical autoimmune diseases either.\n\nThe PPD and QuantiFERON tests were negative, so TB is really unlikely now. With all this info, let's think about what it could be. At first, I thought about TB, but the tests don't support that. Sarcoidosis was another idea, but the normal ACE levels and lack of systemic symptoms make it less likely.\n\nCould it be a fungal infection? But the stains and cultures didn't show anything. Maybe it's some kind of autoimmune issue, but all the tests were negative. So, what's left? Non-necrotizing granulomas could point to something like sarcoidosis or even a reaction to something in the environment.\n\nWait, let's not forget about his G6PD deficiency and β-thalassemia trait. Could these be playing a role? Maybe there's some kind of chronic process going on. The negative tests make infections less likely, so maybe it's an unusual immune response.\n\nAfter thinking it through, I'm leaning towards sarcoidosis, even though the ACE levels are normal. The granulomas fit, and it's not uncommon for ACE to be normal in sarcoidosis. But I'm also considering the possibility of an unusual reaction or an undiagnosed condition related to his hematological issues. It's a tough case, but that's where the evidence points.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 9-year-old boy, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Tuberculosis** - Given the family history of latent TB, this is an initial consideration, but negative tests make it less likely.\n2. **Sarcoidosis** - Non-necrotizing granulomas and normal ACE levels could still fit with sarcoidosis, despite the lack of systemic symptoms.\n3. **Fungal Infection** - Although cultures and stains were negative, atypical fungal infections can sometimes present subtly.\n4. **Autoimmune Disorder** - Despite negative antibody tests, unusual autoimmune reactions could still be a factor.\n5. **Reactive Airway Disease** - Initially considered by the pediatrician, but the granulomas suggest a more complex issue.\n6. **Adenotonsillar Hypertrophy** - While present, this doesn't fully explain the granulomatous findings.\n7. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis** - Negative antibody tests make this less likely, but it's worth considering due to granulomatous inflammation.\n8. **Primary Immune Deficiency** - The boy's hematological conditions could predispose him to unusual immune responses.\n9. **Environmental Granuloma** - Exposure to environmental antigens could cause non-necrotizing granulomas.\n10. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis** - Although rare, it can present with granulomatous lesions and systemic involvement.\n\nReranking these based on all the information, **Sarcoidosis** remains a strong contender due to the presence of non-necrotizing granulomas, despite normal ACE levels. **Primary Immune Deficiency** related to his hematological conditions is also a consideration, given the negative tests for infections and autoimmune diseases. **Environmental Granuloma** is another possibility, considering potential exposures.

That sounds like some kind of inflammatory arthritis to me.\n\nNow, let's think about what could be going on. Ankylosing spondylitis comes to mind first because of the back pain and the fact that it often involves the sacroiliac joints. But, oh wait, his HLA-B27 test is negative. That makes ankylosing spondylitis less likely, but not impossible. I'll keep it in mind for now.\n\nNext, I'm thinking about osteoarthritis. He's got these hook-like osteophytes in his hands, which are pretty characteristic of osteoarthritis. But, usually, osteoarthritis doesn't cause prolonged morning stiffness like this. And the sacroiliac joint involvement is a bit unusual for osteoarthritis too. Hmm, it's possible, but I'm not entirely convinced.\n\nRheumatoid arthritis is another one to consider. It often affects the hands, especially the MCP and PIP joints, just like in this guy. But, rheumatoid arthritis typically has more systemic symptoms and elevated inflammatory markers, which he doesn't have. His ESR and CRP are normal, so that's not really fitting.\n\nPsoriatic arthritis could be another contender. It can involve the spine and sacroiliac joints, and it can also affect the hands. But, I don't see any mention of skin or nail changes, which often go along with psoriasis. Without that, it's harder to make the case for psoriatic arthritis.\n\nOkay, what about gout? It can cause joint pain and swelling, but it usually hits the big toe first, not the MCP and PIP joints. Plus, there's no mention of tophi or any acute attacks, so gout seems unlikely.\n\nI should also think about reactive arthritis. It can follow an infection and cause arthritis, but it often involves the knees and ankles more than the hands. And there's no history of a recent infection here, so that doesn't seem to fit either.\n\nEnteropathic arthritis is associated with inflammatory bowel disease, but there's no mention of any gut symptoms, so that's probably not it.\n\nNow, let's not forget about DISH, or diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis. It's known for causing back pain and can involve the sacroiliac joints. The hook-like osteophytes in his hands could fit with this too. Plus, it doesn't typically cause elevated inflammatory markers, which matches his lab results.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think DISH makes the most sense here. It explains the back and hand findings, and it fits with the negative HLA-B27 and normal inflammatory markers. Yeah, I'm feeling pretty good about DISH as the top diagnosis.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for this 44-year-old man is Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis (DISH). This condition can explain the combination of his symptoms, including the long-standing lower back pain, hip pain, and hand pain, along with the specific radiographic findings such as hook-like osteophytes in the hands and sacroiliac joint involvement. The negative HLA-B27 test and normal inflammatory markers further support this diagnosis, as DISH typically does not present with elevated inflammatory markers. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis (DISH)**\n2. Osteoarthritis\n3. Ankylosing Spondylitis\n4. Psoriatic Arthritis\n5. Rheumatoid Arthritis\n6. Gout\n7. Reactive Arthritis\n8. Enteropathic Arthritis\n9. Osteophytosis\n10. Spondyloarthritis\n\nEach of these conditions was considered based on the patient's symptoms and test results, but DISH most comprehensively accounts for the presented clinical picture.", "topic": "['Osteoarthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Radiology']"}

The patient denied systemic symptoms, including oral ulcers, sicca, photosensitivity, dermatitis, or arthralgias. Her medical history had negative results for allergic rhinitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, epistaxis, nasal trauma, or surgery. Her family history was noncontributory. An in-office nasal endoscopy demonstrated synechiae bridging from the septum to the lateral nasal walls, polypoid changes, and yellow crusting bilaterally. Her immune workup showed elevated complement C3 (200 mg/dL) and total hemolytic complement (CH50; >60 U/mL) levels, with otherwise unremarkable levels of C4, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, rheumatoid factor, Sjögren antibodies, angiotensin-converting enzyme, antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, bullous pemphigoid IgG antibodies, and quantitative immunoglobulins and IgG subclasses (IgG4, 53 mg/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 0.01]). Nasal cultures had positive results for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides. Preoperative computed tomography showed no evidence of paranasal mucosal disease or bone erosion. An operative endoscopy with elevation of the mucoperichondrial flaps revealed an absence of the quadrangular cartilage caudal struts and irregular, friable tissue along the cartilage and perichondrium. Surgical pathology examination demonstrated prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate (Figure, A), angiocentric fibrosis with a relative lack of eosinophils (Figure, B), and increased IgG4 absolute count (up to 50 cells per high-power field), although an IgG4-IgG ratio that was only slightly elevated (0.2) (Figure, C and D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "IgG4-related disease", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 19-year-old woman who's been dealing with some pretty uncomfortable symptoms. She's got this progressive nasal obstruction, crusting, and even a saddle nose deformity. That's a lot going on in the nose! And it's been happening over six months, so it's not just a quick bug or something. \n\nNow, she's not reporting any of those systemic symptoms like oral ulcers or joint pain, which is interesting. That might help us narrow things down a bit. And her medical history doesn't show anything like allergies or asthma, which can often cause nasal issues. So, we can probably rule those out. \n\nThe nasal endoscopy showed some pretty telling signs: synechiae, polypoid changes, and yellow crusting. That's not your run-of-the-mill nasal congestion. And the lab work is intriguing. Elevated complement C3 and total hemolytic complement? That's something to consider. \n\nThe immune workup is mostly unremarkable, but those complement levels stand out. And the nasal cultures showing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides? That's a unique combination. \n\nThe CT scan doesn't show any bone erosion or significant paranasal disease, which is good. But the operative findings are really telling. The absence of the quadrangular cartilage caudal struts and that irregular, friable tissue? That's significant. \n\nThe pathology report is where things get really interesting. There's a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, angiocentric fibrosis, and not many eosinophils. Plus, there's an increased IgG4 count, although the IgG4/IgG ratio isn't super high. \n\nSo, what could this be? Let's start with the obvious. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a strong contender. It can cause nasal obstruction and crusting, and it fits with the lack of systemic symptoms. \n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. Could it be cocaine-induced nasal changes? That's a possibility, but she denies drug use, and there's no other evidence pointing to that. \n\nHow about IgG4-related disease? The increased IgG4 count is a hint, but the ratio isn't that high. It's possible, but not definitive. \n\nWe should also consider sarcoidosis. It can cause nasal issues, but usually, there are more systemic symptoms or findings on imaging. \n\nAnd there's lupus. It can cause a saddle nose deformity, but we'd expect more systemic involvement or positive autoantibodies. \n\nWhat about necrotizing sialometaplasia? That's usually a benign condition, but it could mimic some of these findings. \n\nRelapsing polychondritis is another option. It can cause cartilage destruction, but we'd expect more systemic symptoms or other cartilage involvement. \n\nNow, let's think about infectious causes. With that nasal culture showing MRSA and Bacteroides, could this be an infectious process? Maybe, but the lack of systemic symptoms makes that less likely. \n\nAnd finally, could it be a lymphoma? The lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate is a red flag. We should definitely consider that. \n\nSo, where does that leave us? Based on everything, granulomatosis with polyangiitis seems like the most likely diagnosis. But we can't completely rule out IgG4-related disease or lymphoma. Those are still possibilities. \n\nIn the end, it's a complex case, and we need to keep an open mind. But for now, granulomatosis with polyangiitis is the top contender.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis**: This condition is a strong contender given the nasal obstruction, crusting, and saddle nose deformity, along with the lack of systemic symptoms and specific pathological findings.\n\n2. **IgG4-Related Disease**: The increased IgG4 count and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate suggest this possibility, although the IgG4/IgG ratio is not markedly elevated.\n\n3. **Cocaine-Induced Nasal Changes**: Despite the patient's denial of drug use, this remains a consideration due to the nature of the nasal symptoms and structural changes.\n\n4. **Relapsing Polychondritis**: This condition can cause cartilage destruction and might explain the saddle nose deformity, but typically involves more systemic symptoms.\n\n5. **Sarcoidosis**: Although it can present with nasal symptoms, the lack of systemic findings or typical imaging results makes this less likely.\n\n6. **Lupus**: The saddle nose deformity could be consistent with lupus, but the absence of systemic symptoms or positive autoantibodies reduces its likelihood.\n\n7. **Necrotizing Sialometaplasia**: This benign condition could mimic some findings but is usually self-limiting and less likely to cause progressive symptoms.\n\n8. **Infectious Etiologies**: The presence of MRSA and Bacteroides in nasal cultures suggests a possible infectious component, but the lack of systemic symptoms makes this less probable.\n\n9. **Lymphoma**: The lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate raises the possibility of a lymphoproliferative disorder, which should be considered seriously.\n\n10. **Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps**: This could explain some symptoms, but the specific pathological findings and systemic considerations make it less likely.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis, IgG4-Related Disease, and Lymphoma. These conditions best fit the combination of clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and pathological results.

This lesion had started as a light erythema a few months before, initially oriented as a bacterial paronychia or herpetic whitlow and treated with an oral antibiotic (amoxicillin) and antiviral (acyclovir) without improvement. There was no relevant medical history. The family reported living in a rural area on the Mediterranean coast. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a young girl with a persistent inflammatory plaque on her finger. It's been there for 7 months, and it started as a light redness. Hmm, that's quite a while for something like this to stick around. It didn't improve with antibiotics or antivirals, so we can probably rule out a simple bacterial infection or a herpes infection. \n\nNow, let's think about where she lives. She's in a rural area on the Mediterranean coast. That's interesting because certain fungal infections are more common in rural areas. Maybe we're dealing with something like sporotrichosis, which is known to occur in places with a lot of vegetation. It's caused by a fungus that can enter through the skin, especially if there's a small injury. \n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions too quickly. We should consider other possibilities too. What about other types of skin conditions that could cause a persistent plaque? Granuloma annulare comes to mind. It's a skin condition that can cause these kinds of lesions, and it's not uncommon in children. \n\nOh, and we shouldn't forget about other infections. Mycobacterial infections, like tuberculosis verrucosa cutis, could also present like this. They're not as common, but they can definitely cause persistent skin lesions. And the fact that she didn't respond to antibiotics makes me think of something atypical like that. \n\nLet's also think about the possibility of a congenital condition. Could this be something like a congenital hemangioma? Those can appear as red marks on the skin and might be mistaken for other types of lesions. \n\nBut then again, the rural location keeps bringing me back to sporotrichosis. It's just so common in those areas and fits the description well. \n\nWait, what about other fungal infections? Tinea corporis, or ringworm, could cause a persistent plaque too. It's more common in children and could definitely occur on the finger. \n\nAnd let's not forget about bacterial infections that didn't respond to the initial treatment. Maybe it's something like a Mycobacterium marinum infection. It's not as common, but it can cause skin lesions that don't respond to regular antibiotics. \n\nOh, and there's also the possibility of a viral wart. Those can be persistent and might not respond to antiviral treatments if they're not the right kind. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I think we have a few strong possibilities. Sporotrichosis is still high on the list because of the location and the nature of the lesion. But we should also consider granuloma annulare, mycobacterial infections like tuberculosis verrucosa cutis, and even viral warts. Each of these has some features that match what we're seeing. \n\nIn the end, I think sporotrichosis is the most likely diagnosis, but we can't rule out the others without further testing.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the persistent inflammatory plaque on the girl's finger, considering her age, the lesion's characteristics, and her rural Mediterranean environment:\n\n1. **Sporotrichosis** - A fungal infection common in rural areas, often related to vegetation and soil exposure.\n2. **Granuloma Annulare** - A benign skin condition that can cause persistent plaques and is not uncommon in children.\n3. **Tuberculosis Verrucosa Cutis** - A mycobacterial infection that can cause skin lesions and may not respond to standard antibiotics.\n4. **Mycobacterium Marinum Infection** - A type of bacterial infection that can cause skin lesions and is resistant to regular antibiotics.\n5. **Viral Wart** - Caused by human papillomavirus, these can be persistent and may not respond to antiviral treatments.\n6. **Tinea Corporis (Ringworm)** - A fungal infection that can cause circular plaques and is common in children.\n7. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus** - An autoimmune condition that can cause chronic skin lesions, though less common in very young children.\n8. **Keratoacanthoma** - A skin growth that can appear as a persistent plaque, often in sun-exposed areas.\n9. **Lichen Planus** - An inflammatory condition that can cause skin lesions, though it's rare in children this young.\n10. **Congenital Hemangioma** - A vascular birthmark that could be mistaken for other types of lesions.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Sporotrichosis** remains the most likely diagnosis due to the rural environment and the nature of the lesion.

Biopsy of the mass demonstrated metastatic p16-positive (human papillomavirus [HPV]-related) squamous cell carcinoma. Examination revealed a large left base of tongue mass filling the vallecula. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated an enhancing mass within the left base of tongue and bilateral cervical adenopathy. The patient was treated with concurrent radiation therapy and cetuximab, completing treatment without breaks in November 2018. His 3-month posttreatment fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography/CT (FDG-PET/CT) imaging results demonstrated resolution of the activity at the base of tongue mass and the involved cervical lymph nodes, consistent with complete treatment response. In July 2019, the patient presented with a palpable left supraclavicular lymph node. Restaging FDG-PET/CT demonstrated avid supraclavicular and anterolateral neck adenopathy. Additionally, there was moderately intense activity isolated to the left thyroid lobe. Ultrasonography of the thyroid demonstrated a 4-cm mass within the gland, and subsequent biopsy was performed with immunohistochemistry staining positive for p16, CK5, and p40 and negative for thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) (Figure, A, B). After multidisciplinary review of the case, the patient was offered salvage left modified radical neck dissection and total thyroidectomy. Surgical pathology confirmed the diagnosis (Figure, C). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 71-year-old man who's been dealing with a neck mass for a while. It's been there for six months, and he doesn't smoke. That's interesting because smoking is a big risk factor for a lot of head and neck cancers. So, this might be something different.\n\nThe biopsy shows it's a metastatic p16-positive squamous cell carcinoma. P16 positivity often points to an HPV-related cancer. That's common in oropharyngeal cancers, especially the base of the tongue. So, it's likely the primary site is there.\n\nHe got treated with radiation and cetuximab, and it seemed to work well. The post-treatment PET scan showed everything had cleared up. But then, a few months later, there's a new issue - a palpable left supraclavicular lymph node. That's concerning because it could mean the cancer is back or has spread.\n\nThe restaging PET scan shows activity in the supraclavicular and neck areas, and also in the left thyroid lobe. That's a surprise. Thyroid involvement isn't what you'd typically expect with a base of the tongue primary.\n\nThe biopsy of the thyroid mass is really telling. It's positive for p16, CK5, and p40, but negative for TTF-1. That rules out a primary thyroid cancer because TTF-1 would usually be positive. This looks more like a metastasis from the original base of tongue cancer.\n\nSo, what's going on here? The most likely explanation is that the base of tongue squamous cell carcinoma has metastasized to the thyroid. That's not common, but it can happen.\n\nLet's think about other possibilities. Could it be a second primary cancer? That's possible, but the p16 positivity and the staining pattern make it more likely to be a metastasis from the original site.\n\nWhat about other head and neck sites? The base of the tongue is the most likely primary, given the HPV association and the initial presentation.\n\nCould it be something else entirely, like a sarcoma or a lymphoma? The biopsy results don't support that. The markers are specific for squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nIn the end, it seems clear. The thyroid mass is a metastasis from the base of tongue squamous cell carcinoma. That's the most logical conclusion based on everything we've seen.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is a metastasis to the thyroid from the original base of tongue squamous cell carcinoma. The p16 positivity and the immunohistochemical staining pattern strongly suggest that the thyroid mass is a metastatic lesion from the primary oropharyngeal cancer rather than a new primary thyroid cancer or another type of malignancy. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Metastasis to the thyroid from base of tongue squamous cell carcinoma** - This is the most likely diagnosis given the p16 positivity and the immunohistochemical profile.\n2. **Second primary squamous cell carcinoma of the thyroid** - Although less likely, it's possible for a second primary squamous cell carcinoma to develop in the thyroid, but the staining pattern suggests a metastatic origin.\n3. **Poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma** - This could have been considered if TTF-1 was positive, but the negative result makes it less likely.\n4. **Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma** - Typically has a more aggressive clinical presentation and different immunohistochemical markers.\n5. **Sarcoma of the thyroid** - Unlikely given the specific markers for squamous cell carcinoma.\n6. **Lymphoma of the thyroid** - Does not match the immunohistochemical profile presented.\n7. **Direct extension from adjacent structures** - Possible but less likely given the distinct mass in the thyroid.\n8. **Ectopic thyroid tissue with squamous metaplasia** - Unlikely as it doesn't explain the p16 positivity and aggressive behavior.\n9. **Branchial cleft cyst carcinoma** - Unlikely given the age and presentation.\n10. **Thyroglossal duct cyst carcinoma** - Unlikely due to the location and immunohistochemical findings.\n\nThe most logical conclusion, based on the clinical presentation and test results, is that the thyroid mass represents a metastasis from the base of tongue squamous cell carcinoma.", "topic": "['Endocrinology', 'Oncology', 'Surgery', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Thyroid Disorders']"}

Immediately following workup with noncontrast abdominal ultrasonography, he experienced intense flushing and vomiting. Subsequent contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging identified a 5-cm thoracic paraspinal mass (Figure, A). Computed tomography–guided biopsy of the paraspinal mass revealed a dense cellular infiltrate on histopathology composed of cells with round nuclei and abundant pale cytoplasm (Figure, B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Mastocytoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 41-year-old guy who's been dealing with some pretty uncomfortable symptoms for the past 7 months. He's experiencing back and abdominal pain, and it's not just that. He's also having nausea, vomiting, and flushing. That's quite a mix of symptoms. \n\nFirst off, the combination of these symptoms makes me think of something related to the autonomic nervous system or maybe a neuroendocrine tumor. Neuroendocrine tumors can be tricky because they release hormones, which could explain the flushing and nausea. \n\nNow, let's talk about the imaging. The MRI shows a 5-cm thoracic paraspinal mass. That's a decent size, and it's located near the spine, which makes me think of a neurogenic tumor. These types of tumors often originate from nerve tissue, and they can definitely cause the symptoms he's experiencing. \n\nThe biopsy results are interesting. They show a dense cellular infiltrate with cells that have round nuclei and abundant pale cytoplasm. This histological description is ringing some bells. It sounds like a paraganglioma, which is a type of neuroendocrine tumor. These tumors can secrete catecholamines, leading to symptoms like flushing and abdominal pain. \n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions too quickly. We should consider other possibilities. The location and histology could also point towards a schwannoma. Schwannomas are nerve sheath tumors, and while they're usually benign, they can cause similar symptoms due to compression or irritation of nearby tissues. \n\nOh, and there's also the possibility of a neuroblastoma. Although neuroblastoma is more common in children, it can occur in adults, and it's known for causing a range of symptoms due to catecholamine secretion. \n\nNow, let's think about the patient's reaction to the imaging procedures. He had intense flushing and vomiting right after the ultrasound and biopsy. This suggests that the tumor might be secreting hormones in response to manipulation. That's a big clue pointing towards a paraganglioma or a pheochromocytoma, both of which are known for this kind of behavior. \n\nBut, we shouldn't ignore other neurogenic tumors like ganglioneuromas. These are also derived from nerve tissue and could potentially cause similar symptoms, although they're usually less aggressive. \n\nHmm, what about a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor? These are aggressive tumors that arise from nerve tissue, and they can cause significant symptoms due to their location and potential to invade nearby structures. \n\nLet's not forget about the possibility of a metastatic tumor. The thoracic region is a common site for metastasis from other primary cancers, and this could explain the mass and symptoms. \n\nAlso, we should consider a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). Although GISTs are more commonly found in the abdomen, they can occasionally be found in the thoracic region. They might not perfectly match the histology, but they're worth considering. \n\nFinally, there's the possibility of a desmoid tumor. These are rare, non-cancerous tumors that can occur in various locations, including the thoracic region. They might not secrete hormones, but they can cause symptoms due to their size and location. \n\nSo, after going through all the possibilities, I think the top differential diagnosis is a paraganglioma. It fits well with the symptoms, imaging, and histology. But we should also keep schwannoma, neuroblastoma, and ganglioneuroma on our list, as they could also explain the findings. \n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 41-year-old man with a thoracic paraspinal mass and associated symptoms:\n\n1. **Paraganglioma** - This neuroendocrine tumor fits well with the symptoms of flushing, abdominal pain, and the histological findings.\n2. **Schwannoma** - A nerve sheath tumor that could explain the paraspinal mass and symptoms due to compression.\n3. **Neuroblastoma** - Although more common in children, it can occur in adults and cause similar symptoms due to catecholamine secretion.\n4. **Ganglioneuroma** - A neurogenic tumor that could cause symptoms similar to paraganglioma, though usually less aggressive.\n5. **Pheochromocytoma** - Known for secreting catecholamines, leading to symptoms like flushing and abdominal pain.\n6. **Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor** - An aggressive tumor arising from nerve tissue, potentially causing significant symptoms.\n7. **Metastatic Tumor** - The thoracic region is a common site for metastasis, which could explain the mass and symptoms.\n8. **Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)** - Though more commonly abdominal, GISTs can occasionally be found in the thoracic region.\n9. **Desmoid Tumor** - A rare, non-cancerous tumor that could cause symptoms due to its size and location.\n10. **Neurofibroma** - A benign nerve sheath tumor that could explain the paraspinal mass, though less likely to cause hormonal symptoms.\n\nAfter considering all the information, paraganglioma remains the top differential diagnosis, followed closely by schwannoma, neuroblastoma, and ganglioneuroma, as they could also align with the clinical and histological findings.", "topic": "['Allergy and Clinical Immunology', 'Hematology', 'Oncology', 'Hematologic Cancer']"}

On initial examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Intraocular pressure, ocular motility, and confrontational visual fields were normal. There was no axial proptosis or enophthalmos by exophthalmometry. The pupil was 5 mm OD and 4 mm OS. No afferent pupillary defect was observed.

We've got a 56-year-old man who's dealing with some sudden drooping of his left eyelid. That's been going on for a couple of weeks now. And before that, he had some pretty bad pain on the left side of his face. Hmm, that's interesting. He's not seeing double or having any vision problems, and there's no history of trauma. So, what's going on here?\n\nFirst off, the ptosis makes me think about something going on with the nerves that control the eyelid. The oculomotor nerve, or cranial nerve III, is a big player here. If that nerve was really affected, we'd probably see more symptoms, like the pupil being bigger or problems moving the eye. But that's not happening, so maybe it's something else.\n\nThe facial pain he had before the ptosis is a big clue. It could be linked to the trigeminal nerve, which is responsible for sensation in the face. Trigeminal neuralgia comes to mind, but that usually causes sharp, stabbing pains, not a constant ache. So, maybe it's not that.\n\nNow, let's think about Horner's syndrome. That's when you get ptosis, a constricted pupil, and sometimes a lack of sweating. Our guy has the ptosis and the smaller pupil, but no sweating issues. Still, it's worth considering.\n\nWhat about a carotid artery dissection? That can cause Horner's syndrome and facial pain. But usually, you'd see more symptoms, like a headache or neck pain. And the tests didn't show anything. Hmm, maybe not that.\n\nCould it be something like a brain tumor? They can cause all sorts of neurological symptoms. But you'd think with a big workup like he had, they'd find something if that were the case. So, probably not a tumor.\n\nLet's not forget about migraines. They can cause facial pain and sometimes visual symptoms, but not usually ptosis. Still, migraines can be weird, so it's possible.\n\nWhat about temporal arteritis? That can cause headaches and vision problems, but our guy doesn't have those. Plus, he's a bit young for that. So, probably not.\n\nNow, could it be something psychological? Sometimes symptoms don't have a clear physical cause. But that seems unlikely here, given the clear physical symptoms.\n\nOkay, let's think about multiple sclerosis. That can cause a wide range of neurological symptoms. But usually, you'd see more going on, like other neurological signs. And the tests didn't show anything. So, probably not that.\n\nFinally, let's consider a Raeder's paratrigeminal syndrome. That's a rare condition that can cause facial pain and ptosis without pupil involvement. It fits pretty well with what we're seeing here.\n\nSo, after going through all of this, Raeder's paratrigeminal syndrome seems like the best fit. It explains the facial pain and the ptosis, and it doesn't require pupil involvement. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnoses for the 56-year-old man with acute ptosis and prior facial pain are as follows:\n\n1. **Raeder's Paratrigeminal Syndrome** - This condition can cause unilateral facial pain and ptosis without pupil involvement, aligning well with the symptoms presented.\n\n2. **Horner's Syndrome** - Characterized by ptosis, miosis, and sometimes anhidrosis. While the patient exhibits ptosis and a smaller pupil, the absence of anhidrosis makes this less likely.\n\n3. **Carotid Artery Dissection** - Can cause Horner's syndrome and facial pain, but typically presents with additional symptoms like headache or neck pain, which are not present here.\n\n4. **Trigeminal Neuralgia** - Usually involves sharp, stabbing facial pain, which doesn't match the severe, constant pain described.\n\n5. **Migraine Variant** - Can cause facial pain and occasionally ptosis, but this is less common and usually accompanied by other migraine symptoms.\n\n6. **Temporal Arteritis** - Typically presents with headaches and vision changes in older individuals, making it less likely in this case.\n\n7. **Brain Tumor** - Would likely present with more extensive neurological symptoms and abnormalities on imaging, which were not found.\n\n8. **Multiple Sclerosis** - Can cause varied neurological symptoms, but additional signs or positive findings on MRI would be expected.\n\n9. **Cervical Sympathetic Chain Dysfunction** - Could cause Horner's syndrome, but the lack of anhidrosis and other symptoms makes this less probable.\n\n10. **Psychogenic Causes** - Unlikely given the distinct physical symptoms.\n\nAfter considering all the information, Raeder's paratrigeminal syndrome emerges as the most fitting diagnosis, as it accounts for the facial pain and ptosis without requiring pupil involvement.", "topic": "['Hypertension', 'Neuro-ophthalmology', 'Neurology', 'Vascular Surgery', 'External Eye Disease']"}

The hypoesthesia was limited to the distribution of the mandibular branch of the left trigeminal nerve (V3). On review of systems, the patient denied experiencing visual changes, dizziness, headaches, oral or neck pain, voice changes, weight or appetite changes, or swallowing dysfunction; however, he did report biting his lip occasionally due to the numbness. On examination, there were no palpable masses noted in the head, neck, or face. Aside from the V3 sensory deficit, the patient had no cranial nerve deficits. The patient had no significant medical history; prior surgical history was notable for tonsillectomy. Magnetic resonance imaging of the face revealed a T1 isointense, T2 hyperintense 5.9-cm lesion in the left masticator space, which appeared to be centered in the lateral pterygoid muscle with benign-appearing remodeling of the posterior maxillary wall (Figure). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Schwannoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 34-year-old guy who's been dealing with numbness in his lower lip and chin for a few months now. That's a pretty specific area, and it's all on one side of his face. Hmm, that sounds like it's related to the mandibular nerve, which is part of the trigeminal nerve. So, something's going on with the V3 branch.\n\nNow, he's also got some facial fullness on the same side. That's interesting. It makes me think there could be something going on in the masticator space, since that's where the mandibular nerve runs. Let's see what the MRI says. Oh, there's a 5.9-cm lesion in the left masticator space. It's T1 isointense and T2 hyperintense. That sounds like it could be something benign, maybe a tumor or a cyst.\n\nOkay, let's brainstorm some possibilities. A pleomorphic adenoma comes to mind. Those are pretty common in the salivary glands and can show up in the masticator space. Schwannomas are another option. They're nerve sheath tumors, so they could definitely cause numbness if they're pressing on the nerve.\n\nWhat about a malignant tumor? Well, something like a mucoepidermoid carcinoma could be possible. Those can show up in the salivary glands too. But usually, you'd expect some more aggressive features on imaging or maybe some symptoms like pain or weight loss. This guy doesn't have any of that, so maybe it's less likely.\n\nLet's not forget about less common things like ameloblastomas. Those are odontogenic tumors, and they can occur in the jaw area. They might not be the first thing that comes to mind, but they're worth considering.\n\nOh, and what about vascular lesions like a hemangioma? Those can be T2 hyperintense too. But usually, you'd expect to see some flow voids or other signs of vascularity on the MRI. I don't see any mention of that here, so maybe it's not a hemangioma.\n\nNow, let's think about the patient's history. He had a tonsillectomy, but that's not really related to what's going on here. He doesn't have any significant medical history that would point us in a certain direction.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think a pleomorphic adenoma is a strong possibility. It fits the imaging characteristics and the patient's symptoms. Schwannoma is another contender because it could explain the nerve involvement. Ameloblastoma is a bit of a wild card, but it's possible given the location.\n\nIn the end, I'm going to rank pleomorphic adenoma as the most likely diagnosis, followed by schwannoma, and then ameloblastoma. Those seem to fit the best with what we know.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the lesion in the masticator space, along with a final ranking of the most likely diagnoses:\n\n1. **Pleomorphic Adenoma** - A common benign tumor of the salivary glands that can present in the masticator space.\n2. **Schwannoma** - A nerve sheath tumor that could explain the numbness in the distribution of the mandibular nerve.\n3. **Ameloblastoma** - An odontogenic tumor that can occur in the jaw area and may present as a cystic lesion.\n4. **Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma** - A malignant salivary gland tumor, though typically more aggressive features would be expected.\n5. **Hemangioma** - A vascular lesion that can be T2 hyperintense, but usually shows signs of vascularity on imaging.\n6. **Odontogenic Keratocyst** - A cystic lesion of odontogenic origin that can occur in the jaw.\n7. **Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma** - A malignant tumor that can extend into the masticator space, though usually with more symptoms.\n8. **Rhabdomyosarcoma** - A soft tissue sarcoma that can occur in the head and neck region.\n9. **Lipoma** - A benign tumor composed of fat tissue, which can occur in various locations.\n10. **Chondrosarcoma** - A malignant cartilaginous tumor, less likely given the imaging characteristics.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top three most likely diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Pleomorphic Adenoma** - Fits the imaging characteristics and the patient's symptoms well.\n2. **Schwannoma** - Could explain the nerve involvement and the patient's numbness.\n3. **Ameloblastoma** - Possible given the location and imaging findings, though less common.\n\nThese diagnoses align with the clinical presentation and imaging features, making them the most probable explanations for the lesion in the masticator space.", "topic": "['Otolaryngology', 'Rhinology and Sinus Disease', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Radiology', 'Neuroimaging']"}

The medical history was unremarkable, and findings of a review of systems were negative. The patient had been treated in the past with topical steroids without improvement, and the size of the lesion had continued to grow slowly. Physical examination findings revealed a solitary, well-circumscribed pink plaque with overlying yellow-white micaceous scale with interspersed punctate hemorrhagic crusts (Figure, A). Lymphadenopathy was not identified. Punch biopsy for histopathologic examination was performed, with representative sections shown (Figure, B and C). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Sporotrichosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an older adult with a plaque on their elbow. It's been there for a while, and it's itchy. Hmm, it's at the site of an old injury. That's interesting. The plaque is pink with some kind of yellow-white scale on it, and there are these little blood crusts. That's pretty specific.\n\nOkay, so what could this be? Let's start with the basics. Psoriasis comes to mind first. It's pretty common and can show up with those scaly plaques. But, usually, psoriasis is more widespread, not just one solitary spot. And those blood crusts, they're not super typical for psoriasis. Hmm, maybe it's not psoriasis.\n\nNext, let's think about discoid eczema. It can cause itchy plaques, but they're usually not scaly like this, and you don't often see those punctate hemorrhagic crusts. So, probably not eczema.\n\nNow, what about lichen planus? It can cause purplish plaques, but they're usually flat-topped papules, not scaly like this. And again, the blood crusts don't really fit. So, lichen planus is unlikely.\n\nOh, and there's seborrheic keratosis. These are usually waxy, brown lesions. They don't really match the description of a pink plaque with scaling and crusts. So, that's probably not it.\n\nLet's think about something more serious, like basal cell carcinoma. It can have pearly, scaling appearance, and sometimes crusts. But, it's usually more translucent and pearly, not pink with micaceous scales. So, maybe not BCC.\n\nHmm, what about actinic keratosis? These are rough, scaly spots from sun damage. They can crust, but they're usually more sandpaper-like and not pink. So, probably not actinic keratosis.\n\nNow, let's consider Bowen's disease, which is a form of squamous cell carcinoma in situ. It can present as a persistent, scaly plaque, and it's often solitary. The location on the elbow fits, and it can appear in areas of previous trauma. This is starting to sound more likely.\n\nOh, and there's also the possibility of a granuloma, like a granuloma annulare. These can be solitary and appear at trauma sites, but they're usually flesh-colored and don't have the scaling or crusting. So, probably not a granuloma.\n\nLet's not forget about infections like tinea corporis. It can cause scaling plaques, but they're usually more annular and have a distinct border. Plus, it doesn't explain the blood crusts. So, tinea is unlikely.\n\nFinally, there's the possibility of a rare condition like discoid lupus erythematosus. It can cause scaly, discoid lesions, but they're usually more erythematous and don't have the punctate crusts. So, probably not discoid lupus.\n\nAlright, let's put it all together. Considering the solitary, slowly growing nature of the plaque, the specific scaling, and the punctate hemorrhagic crusts, Bowen's disease is the most likely diagnosis. It fits the clinical picture and the fact that it's on a sun-exposed area like the elbow. Yeah, Bowen's disease makes the most sense here.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis for the lesion on the elbow is Bowen's disease. This condition, a form of squamous cell carcinoma in situ, can present as a persistent, scaly plaque and is often solitary, which aligns with the description given. The location on the elbow, a sun-exposed area, and the history of slow growth also support this diagnosis. While other conditions like psoriasis, discoid eczema, and infections were considered, they do not fit the clinical picture as closely as Bowen's disease does, especially considering the presence of punctate hemorrhagic crusts.

He denied having any symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (ICP), including headaches, pulsatile tinnitus, and transient visual obscurations. Findings on computed tomography of the brain without contrast were unremarkable. He was then seen by an ophthalmologist who confirmed bilateral severe optic nerve edema and requested magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits without contrast. It demonstrated signs of increased ICP, including empty sella, posterior flattening of the globes, and widened optic nerve sheaths, but no other abnormalities (Figure 1A). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Papilledema", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 64-year-old man who was doing just fine until he was told he had bilateral optic nerve head edema during a routine eye check-up. That's a bit concerning. Optic nerve edema can be a sign of increased pressure in the skull, but he's not having any of the usual symptoms like headaches or that annoying pulsatile tinnitus. That's interesting.\n\nSo, the CT scan of his brain didn't show anything unusual. That's good, but it doesn't rule out everything. Sometimes, you need a more detailed look, which is where the MRI comes in. The MRI shows signs of increased intracranial pressure, like the empty sella and flattening of the back of the eyes. Hmm, that's something to consider.\n\nLet's think about what could cause this. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension, or pseudotumor cerebri, is a common cause of increased pressure, especially in younger, overweight women, but it can happen in anyone. This guy doesn't fit the typical profile, but we can't rule it out just yet.\n\nNow, what about other possibilities? There's the chance of a dural arteriovenous fistula. These can cause increased pressure and don't always come with obvious symptoms. It's something to keep in mind.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. That can definitely increase pressure, but usually, you'd expect some more symptoms or findings on the MRI.\n\nWhat about a brain tumor? Well, the scans didn't show a mass, but what if there's something sneaky, like a tumor that's not obvious on a scan without contrast? That's a thought.\n\nThere's also the possibility of systemic conditions, like hypervitaminosis A. Too much vitamin A can cause increased pressure, and it might not show on scans. That's a bit unusual, but it's worth considering.\n\nAnd then there's chronic kidney disease. It can cause changes in the body that lead to increased pressure, though it's not the most common cause.\n\nLet's not forget about sleep apnea. It's not the first thing that comes to mind, but it can increase carbon dioxide levels, leading to increased pressure. It's a possibility.\n\nNow, what about a condition like neurosarcoidosis? It can cause all sorts of neurological issues, including increased pressure, and might not show up clearly on scans.\n\nOkay, let's put it all together. Based on what we know, idiopathic intracranial hypertension seems like a strong possibility, even if he's not the typical patient. But we should also consider dural arteriovenous fistula and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, as they can be sneaky. And let's not completely rule out things like hypervitaminosis A or neurosarcoidosis.

Her Snellen visual acuities were 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. Her intraocular pressures were 21 mm Hg OD and 14 mm Hg OS. The right eye had a relative afferent pupillary defect and mild optic nerve edema. To rule out optic neuritis, a magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain and orbits was obtained; the results were unremarkable. Six days after symptom onset, her visual acuity decreased to 20/70 OD and the disc edema increased. In addition, the right eye had developed 2+ anterior chamber cell, keratic precipitates, and a possible branch vein occlusion. At this time the patient was referred to our clinic. On presentation 1 day later, visual acuity was light perception OD and still 20/20 OS. The right eye had 3+ anterior chamber cell, inferior keratic precipitates, and 1+ vitreous cell. The right optic nerve had grade 4 disc edema with flame-shaped peripapillary hemorrhages. The fundus examination results of the right eye revealed the following superior quadrant retinal findings: extensive intraretinal and preretinal hemorrhages along vessels, arteriolar attenuation and sheathing, venous engorgement, and tortuosity. The inferior midperiphery had numerous small areas of deep retinal whitening (Figure 1). Examination results of the left eye were normal. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Acute retinal necrosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. A woman in her 40s is having some trouble with her vision. She's got this inferior scotoma in her right eye that's been bugging her for a few days. Her vision isn't great in that eye, 20/25, while the other eye is perfect at 20/20. Hmm, and the pressure in her right eye is a bit high at 21 mm Hg, while the left is normal at 14 mm Hg. There's also this relative afferent pupillary defect in the right eye, which isn't a good sign, and some mild optic nerve edema. That's already a lot to consider.\n\nThe doctor thought it might be optic neuritis, so they did an MRI, but it came back unremarkable. That's a bit of a head-scratcher. So, a few days later, things get worse. Her vision in that eye drops to 20/70, and the optic nerve edema is more pronounced. Now there's also some inflammation in the eye with 2+ anterior chamber cell and keratic precipitates. And they're thinking it might be a branch vein occlusion. Okay, that's a new twist.\n\nBy the time she gets to our clinic, her vision in the right eye is down to light perception. That's pretty severe. The inflammation is worse too, with 3+ anterior chamber cell and vitreous cell. The optic nerve edema is now grade 4, and there are these flame-shaped hemorrhages. The retina in that eye is showing some serious signs of trouble: lots of hemorrhages, arteriolar attenuation, venous engorgement, and some retinal whitening in the inferior midperiphery.\n\nSo, what's going on here? Initially, I thought about central retinal vein occlusion because of the hemorrhages and optic nerve edema. But the superior quadrant findings and the deep retinal whitening make me think it's more like a branch retinal vein occlusion. But wait, there's more to consider.\n\nThe inflammation is a big clue. It's not typical for a vein occlusion to cause this much anterior chamber activity. So, I'm thinking about other possibilities. Could it be Behçet's disease? That would explain the inflammation and the retinal findings. Or maybe it's Eale's disease, which can cause retinal vasculitis and neovascularization.\n\nBut then, the rapid progression of symptoms makes me think of something more acute, like a retinal artery occlusion. The retinal whitening could fit that. Yet, the lack of a clear artery occlusion on examination makes me hesitant.\n\nI should also consider if this could be a combined artery and vein problem, like a simultaneous occlusion. That would explain the mixed findings. Or perhaps it's a case of Susac's syndrome, which involves microvascular occlusions and can cause similar symptoms.\n\nOh, and I can't forget about infections. Sympathetic ophthalmia could cause this type of inflammation and retinal issue. It's rare, but it fits some of the symptoms.\n\nAfter thinking it through, I'm leaning towards Susac's syndrome. It explains the microvascular issues and the inflammation. But I'm also keeping Behçet's disease and Eale's disease on the list because they fit some aspects of the case. And I can't completely rule out a combined arterial and venous occlusion. It's a complex case, and the final response needs to reflect that.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the condition described, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)** - Initially considered due to the presence of optic nerve edema and extensive retinal hemorrhages.\n2. **Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO)** - The superior quadrant retinal findings and deep retinal whitening suggest a localized vascular issue.\n3. **Behçet's Disease** - The significant inflammation and retinal vasculitis point towards this systemic condition.\n4. **Eale's Disease** - Characterized by retinal vasculitis and neovascularization, which align with some of the findings.\n5. **Retinal Artery Occlusion** - The rapid progression and retinal whitening could indicate an arterial blockage.\n6. **Simultaneous Arterial and Venous Occlusion** - Mixed findings of hemorrhages and whitening suggest a combined vascular problem.\n7. **Susac's Syndrome** - Microvascular occlusions and inflammation fit the presentation, including the optic nerve involvement.\n8. **Sympathetic Ophthalmia** - A rare inflammatory condition that could explain the severe uveitis and retinal findings.\n9. **Viral Retinitis** - Inflammatory response and retinal changes could be due to a viral infection.\n10. **Purtscher's Retinopathy** - Sudden vision loss and retinal whitening with a traumatic or inflammatory cause.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are:\n- **Susac's Syndrome**\n- **Behçet's Disease**\n- **Simultaneous Arterial and Venous Occlusion**\n- **Eale's Disease**\n- **Sympathetic Ophthalmia**\n\nThese conditions best explain the combination of inflammation, vascular changes, and rapid vision loss in the patient.

She had been diagnosed with hormone receptor–positive right breast cancer 8 years prior and underwent lumpectomy and treatment with an aromatase inhibitor, with remission since. Five years later, she subsequently developed left inguinal adenopathy, which biopsy results showed was follicular lymphoma. At that time, she was treated with a course of bendamustine and rituximab with subsequent maintenance treatment with rituximab for 2 years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed, demonstrating T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity in the left occipital and temporal lobes, crossing the corpus callosum and extending into the right occipital lobe without enhancement (Figure). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 75-year-old woman who's been dealing with some pretty concerning symptoms. She's been losing her vision over the past three months, and more recently, she's been confused and having trouble finding words. That's definitely not something to take lightly.\n\nNow, she's got a history of both breast cancer and follicular lymphoma. The breast cancer was hormone receptor-positive, and she had that under control for a while after surgery and treatment. Then, she developed follicular lymphoma, which was treated with bendamustine and rituximab. So, she's been through quite a bit already.\n\nThe MRI findings are really interesting. There's T2 hyperintensity in the left occipital and temporal lobes, and it's crossing the corpus callosum into the right occipital lobe. But here's the thing—it's not enhancing. That's a big clue. When something doesn't enhance, it makes me think it's not your typical tumor that's well-defined. It could be something more diffuse or maybe even treatment-related.\n\nOkay, let's start with the possibility of a primary brain tumor. Glioblastoma multiforme comes to mind because it can be pretty aggressive and cross the midline. But usually, you'd expect some enhancement with that, so maybe it's not the best fit here.\n\nHow about metastatic brain disease? Given her history of breast cancer, that's definitely something to consider. But again, you'd usually see some enhancement or multiple lesions. So, I'm not completely sold on that idea either.\n\nLet's think about treatment-related possibilities. She's had quite a bit of treatment for her lymphoma, including rituximab. Could this be related to that? Maybe something like progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)? That's a possibility because it can cause demyelinating lesions without enhancement. But, it's usually associated with more severe immunocompromise, so I'm not sure that's it.\n\nWhat about autoimmune encephalitis? That could cause some of these symptoms and MRI findings. It's known to cause issues like confusion and language problems. But, I'm not sure it fits perfectly with the MRI findings.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about Alzheimer's disease. It can cause cognitive decline, but it doesn't usually cause these kinds of MRI findings. So, that's probably not it.\n\nNow, what about a subacute stroke? That could cause some of these symptoms, but the MRI findings don't quite match up. I'd expect to see more of a vascular pattern.\n\nCould it be time to consider something like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease? It's a prion disease that can cause rapid cognitive decline and has characteristic MRI findings. That might actually fit pretty well with what we're seeing here.\n\nOkay, let's think about lymphomatous involvement of the brain. That's a possibility given her history of lymphoma. But, I'd expect to see some enhancement or more mass-like lesions.\n\nFinally, let's not forget about gliomatosis cerebri. It's a diffuse type of glioma that can cause these kinds of MRI findings without enhancement. That might actually be a good fit here.\n\nSo, after going through all of this, I think gliomatosis cerebri makes the most sense. It matches the MRI findings and her symptoms. But, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is also a strong contender. I think those two are the most likely possibilities.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Glioblastoma Multiforme** - This aggressive brain tumor can cross the midline, but typically shows some enhancement on MRI.\n\n2. **Metastatic Brain Disease** - Given her history of breast cancer, this is a consideration, but usually presents with enhancing lesions.\n\n3. **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)** - A possibility due to her treatment with rituximab, but usually associated with more severe immunocompromise.\n\n4. **Autoimmune Encephalitis** - Can cause confusion and language problems, but the MRI findings are not typical.\n\n5. **Alzheimer's Disease** - Can cause cognitive decline, but doesn't usually present with these MRI findings.\n\n6. **Subacute Stroke** - Could cause similar symptoms, but the MRI doesn't show a vascular pattern.\n\n7. **Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease** - A prion disease that can cause rapid cognitive decline and has characteristic MRI findings, making it a strong contender.\n\n8. **Lymphomatous Involvement of the Brain** - Possible given her lymphoma history, but would expect enhancement or mass-like lesions.\n\n9. **Gliomatosis Cerebri** - A diffuse glioma that matches the non-enhancing MRI findings and symptoms, making it a likely possibility.\n\n10. **Radiation Necrosis** - A late effect of previous cancer treatments, but would typically show enhancement or a mass.\n\nAfter considering all the possibilities and the patient's history, **Gliomatosis Cerebri** and **Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease** emerge as the most likely diagnoses, given the MRI findings and clinical presentation.

We've got a man in his 60s with some skin lesions on his chest. They're green-gray nodules and plaques, and they've been there for about 4 months without changing. That's interesting. He's also got a history of hyperlipidemia, familial polyposis, and he had a stem cell transplant for AML 13 months ago. That's quite a medical history.\n\nFirst, let's consider what these lesions could be. Given his age and history, I'm thinking about conditions that could be related to his transplant or his other health issues. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder comes to mind. It's a possibility because it can show up as skin lesions after a transplant.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. We should think about other possibilities too. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is another one. It can cause skin lesions, and it might be more likely given the chronic nature of these nodules.\n\nNow, let's not forget about infections. He's immunocompromised from the transplant, so he's more vulnerable. Cutaneous aspergillosis could be a possibility. It can cause nodular lesions, and it's more common in people with weakened immune systems.\n\nOh, and what about drug reactions? He's probably on a bunch of medications post-transplant. Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome could cause skin lesions, but usually, there are other symptoms like fever or organ involvement.\n\nLet's think about his history of familial polyposis. That's associated with Gardner's syndrome, which can cause skin changes like epidermoid cysts. Could these lesions be related to that? It's a stretch, but it's worth considering.\n\nNow, considering his age and the green-gray color of the lesions, I'm thinking about dysplastic nevi. They can appear as nodular lesions, but they're usually more common in younger people.\n\nWhat about leukemia cutis? It's a possibility given his history of AML. It can cause nodular skin lesions, and it might be more likely than we think.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about lymphomatoid papulosis. It's related to lymphoma and can cause similar skin lesions. It's worth considering, especially with his history.\n\nNow, thinking about infections again, cryptococcosis is another one. It's more common in immunocompromised patients and can cause skin lesions, but it's usually associated with other symptoms.\n\nFinally, let's consider mycosis fungoides. It's a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and it can cause lesions like these. It's a possibility, especially given the chronic nature of the lesions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top differential diagnosis is post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. It fits with his history and the nature of the lesions. But we should also consider cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, leukemia cutis, and lymphomatoid papulosis. They all have some features that match what we're seeing.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the skin lesions on the patient's chest, considering his medical history and the nature of the lesions:\n\n1. **Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder** - This condition is a strong consideration given the patient's history of allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant and the presence of green-gray nodules and plaques.\n\n2. **Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma** - This is a possibility due to the chronic nature of the lesions and the patient's age.\n\n3. **Leukemia cutis** - Given the patient's history of acute myelogenous leukemia, this is a plausible differential diagnosis.\n\n4. **Lymphomatoid papulosis** - This condition is related to lymphoma and can present with similar skin lesions, making it a reasonable consideration.\n\n5. **Cutaneous aspergillosis** - As an opportunistic infection in immunocompromised individuals, this could present as nodular lesions.\n\n6. **Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome** - Although typically associated with other symptoms, the patient's post-transplant medication regimen makes this a potential cause.\n\n7. **Gardner's syndrome-associated skin changes** - The patient's history of familial polyposis raises the possibility of associated skin manifestations.\n\n8. **Dysplastic nevi** - While more common in younger individuals, the green-gray color of the lesions could align with this diagnosis.\n\n9. **Cryptococcosis** - Another opportunistic infection that can cause skin lesions in immunocompromised patients.\n\n10. **Mycosis fungoides** - A type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that could present with similar lesions.\n\nUpon reviewing all the information, the top differential diagnoses are post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, leukemia cutis, and lymphomatoid papulosis, as they most closely align with the patient's history and the characteristics of the lesions.", "topic": "['Hematology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Sarcomas', 'Dermatology']"}

Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a large right upper lobe cavitary mass. She was treated empirically with intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsy was performed. Lung tissue was sent for bacterial, fungal, mycobacterial, and Nocardia cultures and for histopathology. BAL cultures grew 100 colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL of group B streptococci and 1 CFU/mL of Aspergillus niger. Results of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and GeneXpert MTB/RIF testing were negative. Voriconazole was added to her treatment. Transbronchial biopsy histopathology showed acute and chronic inflammation, granulation tissue and necrosis, and negative fungal and AFB stains. Two weeks later, the patient reported worsening right-sided chest pain provoked by palpation, right arm movement, and deep inspiration. Repeat chest CT demonstrated cavitary mass enlargement with possible pleural invasion (Figure 1, left). She developed hypoxemia and required intubation. A right-sided tension pneumothorax developed and required emergency chest tube placement, which yielded charcoal-colored pleural fluid (Figure 1, right). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Fungal empyema", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 55-year-old woman from the Southeastern US. She's been dealing with a productive cough for four months, lost a significant amount of weight, and has been experiencing fevers. Plus, she's had some worsening chest pain recently. That's quite a bit to unpack.\n\nFirst off, the cavitary mass in her right upper lobe is a big red flag. Cavities in the lung can be caused by infections like tuberculosis or fungal infections. Given her location in the Southeast, histoplasmosis is something to consider. It's pretty common in that area.\n\nNow, let's think about her background. She's a smoker and has poorly controlled diabetes. Both of these factors can make her more susceptible to infections. Smoking can damage the lungs, and diabetes can weaken the immune system. That's not a great combination.\n\nThe cultures from her bronchoalveolar lavage are interesting. They show group B streptococci and Aspergillus niger. Group B streptococci isn't something you'd typically expect in the lungs, so that's a bit odd. Aspergillus can cause problems, especially in someone with compromised health.\n\nThe histopathology results show acute and chronic inflammation, granulation tissue, and necrosis. There are no fungal or acid-fast bacilli stains, which is good, but it doesn't rule everything out.\n\nShe's getting worse, with the cavitary mass enlarging and possibly invading the pleura. That's concerning. And then there's the charcoal-colored pleural fluid. That's really unusual. It makes me think of an aspergilloma, also known as a fungus ball. Aspergillus can cause that kind of thing.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. We should consider other possibilities too. The charcoal-colored fluid could also be from a black mold, like Aspergillus niger. That fits with the culture results.\n\nNocardia is another possibility. It can cause cavitary lesions, especially in someone with a compromised immune system. But the cultures didn't show Nocardia, so maybe that's less likely.\n\nWhat about tuberculosis? It's a classic cause of cavitary lesions. But the tests for acid-fast bacilli and the GeneXpert MTB/RIF were negative, so TB seems unlikely.\n\nLet's not forget bacterial causes. Anaerobic bacteria can cause necrotizing infections, but we didn't see that in the cultures. And then there's actinomycosis, which can cause chronic inflammation and necrosis. It's not as common, but it fits some of the findings.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Based on everything, aspergilloma seems like a strong possibility. But we should also consider actinomycosis and other fungal infections, like those caused by black molds. It's a complex case, and we need to keep an open mind.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step presenting a unique potential diagnosis:\n\n1. **Tuberculosis** - A classic cause of cavitary lung lesions, especially with the patient's symptoms and weight loss.\n2. **Aspergilloma** - The presence of Aspergillus niger in cultures and the cavitary mass suggest a fungal ball could have formed.\n3. **Nocardiosis** - This bacterial infection can cause cavitary lesions, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.\n4. **Histoplasmosis** - Common in the Southeastern US, this fungal infection can present with cavitary lesions.\n5. **Actinomycosis** - This chronic bacterial infection can cause necrotizing lesions and fits some of the histopathological findings.\n6. **Black Mold Infection** - The charcoal-colored pleural fluid raises the suspicion of a black mold, such as Aspergillus niger.\n7. **Lung Cancer** - Cavitary lesions can be malignant, especially in a smoker, and should be considered.\n8. **Anaerobic Bacterial Infection** - These bacteria can cause necrotizing pneumonia, which might explain some findings.\n9. **Chronic Pulmonary Aspergillosis** - This condition involves a progressive fungal infection that can cause cavitary lesions.\n10. **Pulmonary Syphilis** - A less common cause of cavitary lesions, but should be considered in the differential diagnosis.\n\nAfter considering all the patient's information and test results, the top three most likely diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Aspergilloma** - Given the presence of Aspergillus niger and the cavitary mass.\n2. **Actinomycosis** - Fits the chronic inflammation, necrosis, and granulation tissue seen in histopathology.\n3. **Black Mold Infection** - The charcoal-colored pleural fluid is highly suggestive of this.\n\nThese diagnoses align with the clinical presentation and test results, but continued diagnostic workup and possibly a biopsy would be needed for a definitive diagnosis.", "topic": "['Fungal Infections', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Radiology', 'Diabetes and Endocrinology', 'Diabetes']"}

He was seen by an outside ophthalmologist and prescribed oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (675 mg/125 mg) and ophthalmic tobramycin for presumed bacterial infection without improvement. The lesion was not painful but was associated with ipsilateral facial numbness. On examination, he manifested a 9 × 6-mm ulcerated marginal lesion of the central right lower eyelid with surrounding edema and erythema (Figure 1). There was no associated lash loss and the region was nontender to palpation. There was notable hypoesthesia in the distribution of the trigeminal maxillary branch. On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. The pupils were round and brisk without an afferent pupillary defect. He manifested full extraocular movements. The anterior segment examination, applanation tonometry, and dilated fundus examination results were within normal limits. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Varicella-zoster virus", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 66-year-old man with a growing lesion on his right lower eyelid. It's been there for 9 days and isn't painful, but it's not going away with antibiotics. That's interesting. The lesion is ulcerated and has some surrounding swelling and redness. Plus, he's got some facial numbness. That's a bit concerning.\n\nFirst, let's consider what's common. A bacterial infection like a stye or hordeolum could cause a lump on the eyelid, but it should be painful and would usually get better with antibiotics. Since this isn't the case, let's put that aside for now.\n\nHow about a chalazion? It's another lump-like condition, but it's typically not ulcerated and doesn't cause facial numbness. So, that's probably not it either.\n\nBasal cell carcinoma is a possibility. It's a common skin cancer that can appear on the eyelid and might look like an ulcerated lesion. The fact that it's not painful fits, and it could explain the numbness if it's invading nearby tissues. This is starting to make sense.\n\nBut wait, there's also squamous cell carcinoma. It's another type of skin cancer that can ulcerate. It's less common than basal cell carcinoma, but it's more aggressive. The ulceration and facial numbness could match this too.\n\nLet's not forget about malignant melanoma. It's less likely on the eyelid, but it can be very aggressive. The ulceration and numbness could fit, but we'd usually expect some pigmentation changes.\n\nSebaceous gland carcinoma is another option. It can appear on the eyelid and be quite aggressive. The ulceration and numbness could fit, but it often involves the meibomian glands, and we don't have information about that.\n\nNow, what about something less obvious, like a metastatic tumor? It's rare for cancer to spread to the eyelid, but it could explain the rapid growth and numbness. This is a long shot, but it's worth considering.\n\nOh, and there's Merkel cell carcinoma. It's a rare skin cancer that can grow quickly and cause numbness. The ulceration and rapid growth fit this diagnosis.\n\nLet's also think about benign conditions. A papilloma is a benign growth, but it's usually not ulcerated and doesn't cause numbness. Still, it's possible, so let's keep it in mind.\n\nHow about a keratoacanthoma? It's a benign skin growth that can look like a ulcerated lesion. It grows quickly, which fits, but it's not typically associated with numbness.\n\nFinally, let's consider an angiosarcoma. It's a rare and aggressive cancer that can appear on the eyelid. The rapid growth and ulceration fit, and it could explain the numbness if it's invading tissues.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top possibilities are basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, and angiosarcoma. These all fit the ulceration, growth pattern, and numbness. Sebaceous gland carcinoma and metastatic tumor are also in the mix, but they're a bit less likely. Papilloma and keratoacanthoma are benign options, but they don't quite fit as well. Alright, that's my take.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the lesion on the patient's right lower eyelid, considering the ulceration, growth pattern, and associated facial numbness:\n\n1. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** - A common skin cancer that can appear as an ulcerated lesion on the eyelid, often painless and capable of causing numbness if it invades nearby tissues.\n\n2. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - Another type of skin cancer that can present as an ulcerated lesion, known for being more aggressive than basal cell carcinoma.\n\n3. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma** - A rare and aggressive skin cancer that can grow rapidly and cause numbness, fitting the ulceration and growth pattern.\n\n4. **Angiosarcoma** - A rare and aggressive cancer that can appear on the eyelid, characterized by rapid growth and ulceration, potentially causing numbness through tissue invasion.\n\n5. **Sebaceous Gland Carcinoma** - A cancer that can appear on the eyelid, often aggressive, but typically involves the meibomian glands, which isn't specified here.\n\n6. **Metastatic Tumor** - Although rare, cancer can metastasize to the eyelid, explaining rapid growth and numbness, but it's a less common occurrence.\n\n7. **Malignant Melanoma** - While less likely on the eyelid, it can be aggressive; however, pigmentation changes are usually expected.\n\n8. **Keratoacanthoma** - A benign skin growth that can resemble an ulcerated lesion, growing quickly, but typically not associated with numbness.\n\n9. **Papilloma** - A benign growth, usually not ulcerated and not causing numbness, making it less likely in this case.\n\n10. **Chalazion** - A lump-like condition that is typically not ulcerated and doesn't cause facial numbness, making it an unlikely diagnosis here.\n\nThese possibilities are ranked based on the likelihood of matching the clinical presentation, with basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, and angiosarcoma being the top considerations due to their alignment with the ulceration, growth pattern, and associated numbness. Sebaceous gland carcinoma and metastatic tumor are also plausible, though less likely, while papilloma and keratoacanthoma are benign options that don't fit as well with the symptoms.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'External Eye Disease', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Ophthalmology']"}

She had no prior medical or surgical history and took no medications. Ultrasonography demonstrated a solid and hypoechoic mass, 1.5 × 1.0 × 0.9 cm, in the inferior right parotid gland with minimal vascularity and without extraparotid extension. No lymph node abnormality was observed. Fine-needle aspiration was performed, and the smear was extremely cellular and showed sheets and clusters of bland polygonal epithelial cells admixed with bright pink filamentous matrix. Because of the size and location, extracapsular dissection II was carried out.1 The final pathology of the lesion showed histologic findings compatible with salivary gland carcinoma, with microcystic and papillary architecture (Figure, A and B). Abundant bubbly secretion was present within these microcystic spaces, and this material was positive for periodic acid–Schiff (Figure, C). Immunohistochemically, there was positivity for epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin (CK) 7 and CK19, S100 protein, and gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP-15). Stains for gastrointestinal stromal tumors 1 (DOG1) and p63 were negative. The tumor appeared to be contained within the surgical excision margins. There was perineural invasion without evidence of neoplastic emboli in the peritumoral lymphovascular spaces. The patient underwent a right parotidectomy I to IV1 and a level II superselective neck dissection. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Secretory carcinoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 44-year-old woman with a parotid mass that's been growing for six years. That's quite a while for a mass to be just hanging out, so it's probably not something too aggressive, right? I mean, if it were highly malignant, we'd likely see more symptoms or faster growth.\n\nNow, the ultrasound shows it's solid and hypoechoic. Solid and hypoechoic could mean a few things, but in the parotid gland, we often think of pleomorphic adenoma or something like a Warthin's tumor. But let's not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nThe fine-needle aspiration results are interesting. There are these bland polygonal epithelial cells and some bright pink filamentous matrix. That sounds a lot like a pleomorphic adenoma to me. They're known for having both epithelial and stromal components.\n\nBut wait, the final pathology says it's a salivary gland carcinoma. That's a twist. It has microcystic and papillary features, and there's this bubbly secretion that's positive for periodic acid–Schiff. That's a bit unusual. And the immunohistochemistry shows positivity for things like epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin 7 and 19, S100 protein, and GCDFP-15. Hmm, GCDFP-15 is often linked with mammary analog secretory carcinoma.\n\nSo, let's think about what this could be. The initial thought was pleomorphic adenoma, but the carcinoma diagnosis throws a wrench in that. Given the immunohistochemical profile, mammary analog secretory carcinoma is a strong contender. It fits the GCDFP-15 positivity and the overall histological picture.\n\nBut, we should consider other possibilities too. Could it be a mucoepidermoid carcinoma? They can have a varied presentation, but the specific immunohistochemical markers we see don't strongly support that.\n\nWhat about adenoid cystic carcinoma? It can have a similar perineural invasion pattern, but the marker profile isn't quite matching up here.\n\nLet's not forget about Warthin's tumor. It's a common benign tumor in the parotid gland, but the carcinoma diagnosis rules this out.\n\nAnd then there's oncocytoma, another benign tumor. But again, the malignant features don't align with that.\n\nAcinic cell carcinoma could be considered, but the histology and marker profile don't quite fit.\n\nSebaceous lymphadenoma and lymphadenoma are other possibilities, but they don't match the malignant characteristics described.\n\nSo, after going through all of this, mammary analog secretory carcinoma seems to be the best fit. It aligns with the histological and immunohistochemical findings. That's our top differential diagnosis.\n\n### FINAL RESPONSE:\n\nBased on the provided information, the differential diagnoses for the parotid mass can be considered as follows:\n\n1. **Mammary Analog Secretory Carcinoma**: This is the most likely diagnosis given the histological features, including microcystic and papillary architecture, and the immunohistochemical profile with positivity for GCDFP-15, epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin 7 and 19, and S100 protein.\n\n2. **Pleomorphic Adenoma**: Initially considered due to the fine-needle aspiration findings of bland polygonal epithelial cells and bright pink filamentous matrix, but the final diagnosis of carcinoma rules this out.\n\n3. **Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma**: A possible consideration, but the specific immunohistochemical markers present do not strongly support this diagnosis.\n\n4. **Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma**: Could be considered due to perineural invasion, but the immunohistochemical marker profile does not align well.\n\n5. **Warthin's Tumor**: A common benign tumor of the parotid gland, but the malignant features described do not support this diagnosis.\n\n6. **Oncocytoma**: Another benign tumor, but the malignant characteristics are not consistent with this.\n\n7. **Acinic Cell Carcinoma**: The histology and marker profile do not fit well with this diagnosis.\n\n8. **Sebaceous Lymphadenoma**: Does not match the malignant features described.\n\n9. **Lymphadenoma**: Also does not align with the malignant characteristics.\n\n10. **Basal Cell Adenocarcinoma**: Could be considered, but the specific features and marker profile are more suggestive of mammary analog secretory carcinoma.\n\nAfter considering all the information, mammary analog secretory carcinoma is the most fitting diagnosis.", "topic": "['Otolaryngology', 'Salivary Gland Disorders', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Oncology', 'Head and Neck Cancer']"}

The results of a graded exercise stress test at 22 years were unremarkable. On examination, he was afebrile. His heart rate was 68 beats per minute, his blood pressure was 114/77 mm Hg, and his examination was notable for an absence of jugular venous distension, peripheral edema, and murmurs or extra heart sounds. His electrocardiogram, shown in Figure 1, was notable for right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block, unchanged from his electrocardiogram at age 14 years. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction of 40%. An exercise nuclear stress test revealed a fixed, severe apical defect, a partially reversible severe anterior wall defect, moderate global hypokinesis, and severe hypokinesis of the distal anterior wall and apex. His ejection fraction was estimated to be 32%. Given these findings, left-sided heart catheterization was performed. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "An anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 32-year-old guy who's been dealing with dilated cardiomyopathy for quite a while. He's having more trouble with chest pain and shortness of breath when he's active. That's not good. His heart issues started when he was just 14, after some kind of myocarditis. That's a long time to be dealing with this.\n\nOkay, so his ejection fraction was 30% back then, and now it's 40% on the echo but 32% on the stress test. That's a bit of a discrepancy, but it's still not great. The stress test showed some fixed and reversible defects, which makes me think about ischemia. But wait, he's only 32. Could it be coronary artery disease? Seems a bit early without any major risk factors mentioned.\n\nLet's see, the ECG shows a right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block. Those have been the same since he was 14. That's interesting. It suggests some long-standing conduction issue, maybe related to the myocarditis.\n\nNow, what could be causing these symptoms and test results? Initially, I thought about coronary artery disease because of the ischemic patterns, but then I remembered his age and the history of myocarditis. Maybe it's more about the ongoing effects of that.\n\nOh, and there's the possibility of an arrhythmogenic cause. With those conduction issues, could it be arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy? But the symptoms and test findings don't quite fit perfectly.\n\nHmm, what about dilated cardiomyopathy itself? It's a progressive condition, and his symptoms could just be a natural worsening over time. That makes sense given the chronic nature of his condition.\n\nBut wait, let's not forget about other potential causes. Could it be something like sarcoidosis or hemochromatosis affecting the heart? Those can cause cardiac issues too, but there's no specific indication of that here.\n\nAnd then there's the fixed defect on the stress test. That could mean scarring or something chronic. Maybe it's from an old myocardial infarction, but without obvious coronary disease, that's a stretch.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? I think the most likely explanation is still the progression of his dilated cardiomyopathy. It fits his history and the test results. But I can't completely rule out other possibilities without more information.\n\nIn the end, I'm going with dilated cardiomyopathy as the main issue, but keeping an open mind about other potential contributing factors.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Dilated Cardiomyopathy** - Given the patient's long history of cardiomyopathy and progressive symptoms, this remains a strong contender.\n\n2. **Coronary Artery Disease** - Although the patient is young, the stress test findings of fixed and reversible defects raise the possibility of ischemic heart disease.\n\n3. **Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy** - The ECG findings and conduction issues could suggest this condition, but the symptoms and test results don't fully align.\n\n4. **Sarcoidosis** - This could cause cardiac involvement, but there's no specific indication of systemic symptoms or other organ involvement.\n\n5. **Hemochromatosis** - Iron overload could lead to cardiomyopathy, but there's no mention of other typical symptoms or lab findings.\n\n6. **Post-Myocarditic Scarring** - The fixed defect on the stress test might indicate scarring from his past myocarditis.\n\n7. **Congenital Coronary Artery Anomaly** - Anomalies could lead to ischemic symptoms, but this would likely have been identified earlier.\n\n8. **Cardiac Sarcoidosis** - Similar to sarcoidosis, this could cause conduction disturbances and cardiac symptoms.\n\n9. **Familial Cardiomyopathy** - A genetic component could be contributing to the progression of his cardiomyopathy.\n\n10. **Chronic Myocardial Ischemia** - Ongoing ischemic changes could be contributing to his symptoms and test results.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnosis is **Dilated Cardiomyopathy**, as it best explains the chronic and progressive nature of the patient's symptoms and test findings.

We've got a man in his 30s with untreated HIV and syphilis. That's already a lot on his plate. He's been dealing with worsening dysphonia, dyspnea, and biphasic stridor for three weeks. Those symptoms are pretty concerning, especially the stridor, which makes me think of something obstructing his airway.\n\nNow, the CT scan shows an obstructive laryngeal mass. No local invasion or lymphadenopathy, which is interesting. It's not behaving like a typical aggressive cancer, so that's something to keep in mind.\n\nIn the operating room, they found violaceous nodules at the base of the tongue and a mass in the infraglottis and subglottis. These nodules are a big clue. Violaceous color often makes me think of vascular lesions or something related to a viral infection.\n\nOh, and there are similar nodules on his lower extremities. That's a pretty strong hint towards a systemic condition, maybe something that involves the skin and other organs.\n\nThe biopsy results are really telling. We've got a subepithelial spindle cell lesion with extravasation of erythrocytes. And it stains strongly for human herpesvirus-8. That's a big red flag for Kaposi's sarcoma, which is common in people with HIV.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the most likely diagnosis is Kaposi's sarcoma. It fits with the patient's HIV status, the appearance of the lesions, and the biopsy results. Everything lines up perfectly.\n\nBut let's not stop there. We should consider other possibilities, just in case. Could it be something like non-Hodgkin lymphoma? It's a possibility, given the HIV status and the mass, but the biopsy results don't really support it.\n\nWhat about squamous cell carcinoma? It's a common cause of laryngeal masses, but the lack of invasion and the violaceous nodules don't quite fit.\n\nAngiosarcoma could be another option. It's a vascular tumor, which matches the nodules, but the strong staining for human herpesvirus-8 pulls us back to Kaposi's sarcoma.\n\nHmm, maybe we should think about infectious causes too. Histoplasmosis or cryptococcosis could be possible in someone with low CD4 counts, but they don't usually present with these types of lesions.\n\nLet's not forget about bacillary angiomatosis. It's related to HIV and can cause vascular lesions, but it doesn't usually involve the larynx like this.\n\nOh, and what about Castleman disease? It's associated with HIV and can cause lymphadenopathy, but we didn't see any of that here.\n\nSo, after considering all these options, Kaposi's sarcoma is still the most likely diagnosis. It just fits too well with everything we're seeing.\n\nBut wait, let's think about this again. Could it be that we're missing something? Maybe something like a spindle cell carcinoma? It could explain the spindle cell lesion, but it doesn't quite match the rest of the findings.\n\nWhat if it's a fibrosarcoma? It's a type of spindle cell tumor, but it doesn't fit with the violaceous nodules or the HHV-8 staining.\n\nOh, and there's always the possibility of a benign condition like a hemangioma. But it's unlikely given the aggressive nature of the mass and the systemic involvement.\n\nAfter going through all of this, I'm confident that Kaposi's sarcoma is the right diagnosis. It's the only one that ties everything together neatly.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is Kaposi's sarcoma. This diagnosis aligns with the patient's untreated HIV status, the presence of violaceous nodules, and the biopsy results showing a subepithelial spindle cell lesion with extravasation of erythrocytes that stains strongly for human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8). Kaposi's sarcoma is known to be associated with HIV and presents with lesions that match the description provided. \n\nHere is a ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Kaposi's Sarcoma** - This is the most likely diagnosis given the patient's HIV status, the characteristic violaceous nodules, and the biopsy results positive for HHV-8.\n2. **Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma** - While possible in someone with HIV, the biopsy findings do not support this diagnosis.\n3. **Angiosarcoma** - This is a vascular tumor that could match some findings, but the strong association with HHV-8 points more towards Kaposi's sarcoma.\n4. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - Common for laryngeal masses, but the lack of invasion and violaceous color of the nodules make it less likely.\n5. **Bacillary Angiomatosis** - Associated with HIV and causes vascular lesions, but typically doesn't involve the larynx.\n6. **Castleman Disease** - Related to HIV, but usually involves lymphadenopathy, which is not present here.\n7. **Spindle Cell Carcinoma** - Could explain the spindle cell lesion, but doesn't fit well with the other findings.\n8. **Fibrosarcoma** - A type of spindle cell tumor, but doesn't align with the HHV-8 staining or nodules.\n9. **Hemangioma** - A benign vascular tumor, unlikely given the aggressive nature and systemic involvement.\n10. **Infectious Causes (e.g., Histoplasmosis, Cryptococcosis)** - Possible in someone with low CD4 counts, but doesn't typically present with these types of lesions.\n\nKaposi's sarcoma remains the most fitting diagnosis given the combination of clinical presentation and biopsy results.", "topic": "['HIV', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Allergy and Clinical Immunology', 'Laryngology']"}

Her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/30 + 2 OD and 20/20 OS. Her intraocular pressure, extraocular motility, and pupillary light reactions were normal. An examination demonstrated trace anterior cells in the right eye; otherwise, the examination had normal results. No vitreous cells were present. Topical prednisolone was started for presumed acute anterior uveitis. One week later, the photophobia had improved. However, unnoticed by the patient, her BCVA had worsened to 20/200 OD and 20/40 OS. An examination demonstrated new subretinal fluid in the macula in the right eye (Figure 1A). Fluorescein angiography showed peripapillary speckled pinpoint areas of hyperfluorescence in the right eye. Indocyanine green showed early choroidal vessel hyperfluorescence and several posterior focal hypofluorescent spots in the midphase in both eyes. Autofluorescence showed patchy hyperautofluorescence in both eyes. Tuberculosis and syphilis testing had negative results. A complete blood cell count was unremarkable. A diagnosis of central serous retinopathy (CSR) was made. The topical prednisolone was stopped. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 46-year-old Hispanic woman who's been dealing with photophobia in her right eye for a couple of days. Her vision in that eye isn't great, 20/30, while the other eye is perfect at 20/20. Everything else seems normal, like her eye pressure and how her eyes move. The pupils react normally too. There's just a bit of inflammation in the front part of her right eye, but nothing in the back. So, they started her on some steroid eye drops thinking it might be uveitis.\n\nA week later, the photophobia is better, but strangely, her vision in that eye has gotten worse, dropping to 20/200. That's a big jump. And now there's fluid under the retina in the macula. That's not good. They did some imaging tests, and the fluorescein angiography shows these tiny bright spots around the optic nerve. The indocyanine green angiography is a bit more revealing, showing some early bright spots in the choroidal vessels and then some dark spots. Autofluorescence is showing some patchy bright areas too.\n\nHmm, they thought it might be central serous retinopathy, so they stopped the steroids. But let's think about this. CSR usually happens in stressed-out guys, not so much in women, and it doesn't usually come with inflammation in the front of the eye. Plus, the tests show some unusual patterns, like those dark spots on the indocyanine green angiography. That's not typical for CSR.\n\nOkay, let's consider other possibilities. The inflammation and these test results could point to something like APMPPE. It's known for causing similar issues and can have these kinds of angiographic findings. But wait, APMPPE usually resolves on its own, and this got worse with steroids. That's something to think about.\n\nMaybe it's something related to autoimmune disorders, like sarcoidosis. It can cause uveitis and retinal issues, but usually, you'd see more systemic symptoms or other signs, and the blood tests didn't show anything unusual.\n\nInfections could be a cause too. Tuberculosis or syphilis can cause eye problems, but the tests for those came back negative. So, it's probably not that.\n\nCould it be Harada's disease? That's another name for Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, which can cause uveitis and retinal fluid. It fits with the patient's Hispanic background and the test findings. Plus, it can get worse with steroids, which matches what happened here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, it seems like VKH disease is the most likely cause. It explains the inflammation, the fluid under the retina, and the angiographic findings. And it's consistent with the worsening after steroid treatment. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\n### FINAL RESPONSE:\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease. This condition can cause uveitis and the accumulation of subretinal fluid, and it is consistent with the patient's Hispanic background and the angiographic findings. The worsening of symptoms after steroid treatment also aligns with VKH disease, as it can exacerbate the condition. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease** - This is the most likely diagnosis given the patient's symptoms, test results, and response to treatment.\n2. **Acute Posterior Multifocal Placoid Pigment Epitheliopathy (APMPPE)** - While APMPPE can present with similar angiographic findings, it typically resolves on its own and doesn't usually worsen with steroids.\n3. **Central Serous Retinopathy (CSR)** - Although initially considered, CSR is less likely due to the patient's gender, the presence of anterior inflammation, and atypical angiographic patterns.\n4. **Sarcoidosis** - This could be a possibility, but there are no systemic symptoms or abnormal blood test results to support it.\n5. **Tuberculosis** - Negative test results make this less likely.\n6. **Syphilis** - Also unlikely due to negative test results.\n7. **Idiopathic Juxtafoveal Telangiectasia** - This condition involves retinal changes but doesn't match the systemic and inflammatory aspects seen here.\n8. **Choroidal Neovascularization** - Typically associated with age-related macular degeneration, which doesn't fit this patient's age or presentation.\n9. **Posterior Scleritis** - Could cause similar symptoms, but the angiographic findings are more suggestive of VKH.\n10. **Birdshot Chorioretinopathy** - This condition involves distinct choroidal and retinal changes, but it doesn't align well with the patient's symptoms and test results.", "topic": "['Ophthalmology']"}

When at full term, a planned vaginal delivery was complicated by breached position of the fetus, fetal distress, and new onset of fever. The delivery was converted to a cesarean birth, which was uncomplicated. Perioperatively, she had an episode of chest pain that resolved spontaneously. Troponin levels were normal. A vascular ultrasound study ruled out deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremities. A non–electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated computed tomography angiogram showed no pulmonary embolism but was otherwise not diagnostic owing to motion artifacts (Figure 1A). She had progressive dyspnea, mild pulmonary congestion noted on chest radiography, and an elevated brain-type natriuretic peptide level greater than 800 pg/mL (conversion to ng/L is 1:1). Physical examination findings showed a new heart murmur. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed, which showed a normal-sized left ventricle and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, severe aortic regurgitation (AR), and a mildly dilated aortic root (Figure 1B and Video). The patient was transferred to our institution for further treatment. The patient was afebrile at that point, and her white blood cell count was within normal limits. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Type A aortic dissection", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 38-year-old woman who just had a baby a week ago, and she's having a tough time with breathing and some swelling in her legs. That's definitely not something to ignore, especially so soon after giving birth. Hmm, she also had some chest pain right after delivery, but it went away on its own. That's interesting. Her troponin levels are normal, so it's probably not a heart attack or anything like that. They checked for blood clots in her legs and lungs, and that's not it either. So, what's going on?\n\nOkay, let's see. She's got a high BNP level, which makes me think her heart might be struggling a bit. And there's a new heart murmur. That's a big clue. The echocardiogram shows severe aortic regurgitation and a slightly stretched-out aortic root. That's definitely something to pay attention to.\n\nSo, what could cause this kind of heart issue right after having a baby? Postpartum cardiomyopathy is one possibility. It's a type of heart failure that can happen towards the end of pregnancy or after delivery. But wait, her heart's pumping ability is still normal, so that doesn't quite fit.\n\nHow about aortic dissection? That's when the layers of the aorta tear, and it can cause some serious problems, including aortic regurgitation. But usually, you'd expect more dramatic symptoms, like severe chest pain, and the ultrasound didn't show anything like that.\n\nPeripartum cardiomyopathy is still on my mind, though. It's a bit strange that her heart function is okay, but maybe it's early stages or something atypical. I should keep this one in mind.\n\nOh, and what about myocarditis? That's inflammation of the heart muscle, and it can happen after viral infections. But she doesn't have a fever or high white blood cell count, so that's probably not it.\n\nLet's not forget about rheumatic heart disease. It can cause valve problems, but she's not showing signs of a strep infection or anything like that. So, it's unlikely.\n\nMarfan syndrome could be a possibility. It's a genetic disorder that affects connective tissue, and it can lead to aortic root issues. But she hasn't mentioned any family history or symptoms like tall stature or stretchy skin.\n\nAutoimmune disorders like lupus can cause all sorts of problems, including heart issues. But again, there's no sign of other lupus symptoms, so it's a stretch.\n\nWhat about Takayasu arteritis? It's a type of vasculitis that can affect the aorta. But she's not showing other symptoms like fever or fatigue, so it's probably not that.\n\nAnd then there's the idea of a spontaneous coronary artery dissection. That's when a tear happens in one of the heart's arteries, and it can cause all sorts of heart problems. It's rare, but it happens in women who have just had babies. This could explain the chest pain and maybe even the aortic regurgitation if it affected the aortic root.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top possibility is peripartum cardiomyopathy. It's not a perfect fit, but it's the closest match given her symptoms and test results. Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is a close second, just because it's a rare but possible cause of these symptoms in postpartum women. Aortic dissection and Marfan syndrome are also up there, but they're less likely without more typical symptoms or findings.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with a focus on the key details of postpartum status, a new heart murmur, severe aortic regurgitation, and a mildly dilated aortic root:\n\n1. **Postpartum Cardiomyopathy** - This condition is a type of dilated cardiomyopathy that occurs towards the end of pregnancy or in the months following delivery. It could explain the heart failure symptoms and new murmur.\n\n2. **Aortic Dissection** - Although typically presenting with severe chest pain, aortic dissection can lead to aortic regurgitation and a dilated aortic root. The lack of severe pain makes this less likely but not impossible.\n\n3. **Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD)** - This rare condition can occur in postpartum women and may lead to cardiac complications, including those affecting the aortic root.\n\n4. **Marfan Syndrome** - A genetic disorder affecting connective tissue, which can lead to aortic root dilation and regurgitation. The absence of other typical features makes this less likely.\n\n5. **Rheumatic Heart Disease** - Although it can cause valve issues, the lack of a history of streptococcal infection or other symptoms makes this unlikely.\n\n6. **Myocarditis** - Inflammation of the heart muscle, often viral in origin, but the absence of fever or elevated white blood cell count makes this less probable.\n\n7. **Takayasu Arteritis** - A type of vasculitis that can affect the aorta, but the lack of systemic symptoms like fever or fatigue makes it less likely.\n\n8. **Autoimmune Disorders (e.g., Lupus)** - Can cause various cardiac manifestations, but there are no other typical symptoms or findings.\n\n9. **Pregnancy-Associated Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy** - A rare condition that can develop during or after pregnancy, potentially leading to cardiac complications.\n\n10. **Traumatic Injury During Delivery** - Although the cesarean delivery was uncomplicated, any trauma during the birthing process could potentially affect the heart or aorta.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are **Postpartum Cardiomyopathy** and **Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection**, given the postpartum context and cardiac findings. **Aortic Dissection** and **Marfan Syndrome** are also considered, though less likely without more typical symptoms.", "topic": "['Radiology', 'Obstetrics and Gynecology', 'Pregnancy', 'Obstetrics', \"Women's Health\"]"}

The patient’s visual acuity, color vision, and pupillary examination results were within normal limits, and intraocular pressures were 28 mm Hg OD and 20 mm Hg OS.

The remainder of the slitlamp and dilated fundus examination results were within normal limits. Computed tomography of the orbits and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits showed a large lesion of the right greater wing of the sphenoid bone extending toward the orbital apex with edema and enhancement of the right temporal lobe of the brain (Figure 1). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Langerhans cell histiocytosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 4-year-old girl with some right-sided swelling around her eye that's been going on for 10 days. It's painless, which is interesting, and she's already been on antibiotics without any luck. That's a bit of a red flag for a simple infection, isn't it? \n\nSo, what's going on here? The swelling is periorbital, and there's some proptosis, but it's only 3 mm. Not huge, but definitely something. And the eyelids aren't tender. That's making me think it's not your run-of-the-mill cellulitis. \n\nNow, let's talk about the eye itself. Her vision, color vision, and pupil reactions are all normal. That's good, but the pressure in her eye is a bit high on that side, 28 mm Hg. Hmm, that's something to keep in mind. \n\nThe CT and MRI are really telling us a lot. There's a lesion on the greater wing of the sphenoid bone, heading towards the orbital apex, and it's affecting the temporal lobe too. That sounds pretty serious. \n\nOkay, so what could this be? Let's start with the obvious. Orbital cellulitis was my first thought, but the lack of response to antibiotics is making me second guess that. \n\nHow about a dermoid cyst? They can cause swelling, but I'd expect more of a defined mass and maybe some symptoms earlier in life. \n\nAn orbital lymphangioma could be possible. They can cause proptosis and swelling, but usually, there's more of a vascular component. \n\nA capillary hemangioma might fit, but again, I'd expect more signs earlier on, and it doesn't quite explain the bone lesion. \n\nNow, let's think about something more aggressive. Could it be Langerhans cell histiocytosis? It can cause bone lesions and proptosis, and it fits the age group. \n\nOr maybe it's an orbital glioma? They're associated with neurofibromatosis, but there's no mention of café-au-lait spots or other signs. \n\nEwing's sarcoma is another possibility. It's aggressive and can involve bones, but it's rare in this area. \n\nWhat about a meningioma? They can have orbital involvement and affect nearby structures. That might explain the MRI findings. \n\nOh, and let's not forget rhabdomyosarcoma. It's a common orbital tumor in kids and can present like this. \n\nAfter going through all of this, I think rhabdomyosarcoma is the most likely. It matches the age, the symptoms, and the imaging. \n\nBut wait, let's not rule out Langerhans cell histiocytosis yet. The bone involvement is a strong point in its favor. \n\nAnd meningioma, while less common in kids, could still fit given the extent of the lesion. \n\nSo, after considering everything, I'd say rhabdomyosarcoma is top of the list, followed closely by Langerhans cell histiocytosis and then meningioma. That seems to make the most sense given all the information.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the condition described, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Orbital Cellulitis** - Although the lack of response to antibiotics makes this less likely.\n2. **Dermoid Cyst** - Possible, but typically presents earlier in life with more defined characteristics.\n3. **Orbital Lymphangioma** - Could be considered, but usually involves more vascular components.\n4. **Capillary Hemangioma** - Possible, but often presents with earlier signs and doesn't fully explain the bone lesion.\n5. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis** - A strong contender given the bone involvement and age group.\n6. **Orbital Glioma** - Associated with neurofibromatosis, but lacks characteristic signs like café-au-lait spots.\n7. **Ewing's Sarcoma** - Aggressive and can involve bones, but rare in this location.\n8. **Meningioma** - Possible, as it can involve orbital structures, but less common in children.\n9. **Rhabdomyosarcoma** - A common orbital tumor in children that matches the symptoms and imaging.\n10. **Fibrous Dysplasia** - Could explain the bone lesion, but less likely given the other symptoms.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top three differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Rhabdomyosarcoma** - Fits the age, symptoms, and imaging findings well.\n2. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis** - Strongly considered due to bone involvement and age appropriateness.\n3. **Meningioma** - Less common in children, but could explain the extent of the lesion and orbital involvement.", "topic": "['Hematology', 'Pediatrics', 'Ophthalmology']"}

She was initially treated for presumed shingles with valacyclovir, cephalexin, gabapentin, and hydrocortisone 2.5% topical ointment with no improvement in appearance or symptoms.

A punch biopsy specimen of the left medial forehead was obtained, and histological and immunohistochemical analyses were performed (Figure, B and C). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Angiosarcoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 55-year-old woman with a 6-week history of a growing, tender, itchy, red patch on her forehead. It's 4 cm big and has these little inflammatory bumps in the center. She's tried treatments for shingles, but nothing's working. That's interesting because shingles usually responds to antivirals like valacyclovir. So, shingles is probably not the case here.\n\nFirst, let's consider what this could be. Given the location and the fact that it's tender and itchy, maybe it's something like discoid lupus erythematosus. That's known for causing red, inflamed patches, especially on the face. It's a possibility.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. We should think about other conditions too. What about eczema, or atopic dermatitis? It's common and can cause itchy, red patches. But usually, eczema is more widespread or appears in different areas over time. This seems a bit too localized for eczema, but it's still worth considering.\n\nNow, what about insect bites? They can cause itchy bumps, but they're usually more transient and don't typically persist for six weeks without spreading or changing. So, that seems less likely.\n\nHmm, let's think about other possibilities. Lupus tumidus is another form of lupus that can cause red, indurated plaques. It's less common, but it fits the description of a solitary, persistent lesion on the forehead.\n\nOh, and we can't forget about lymphoma, like cutaneous B-cell lymphoma. It can cause persistent, enlarging lesions that don't respond to regular treatments. That's something to keep in mind, especially with the lack of response to previous treatments.\n\nNow, let's consider rosacea. It causes redness and papules on the face, but it's usually more diffuse and accompanied by other symptoms like telangiectasia. This lesion seems too localized for rosacea, but it's still a possibility.\n\nWhat about sarcoidosis? It can cause skin lesions that are persistent and might not respond to usual treatments. It's a bit of a wildcard, but it fits some of the symptoms.\n\nLet's not forget about basal cell carcinoma. It can cause persistent, growing lesions on the face, but it's usually not tender or itchy. Still, it's something to consider given the persistence of the lesion.\n\nNow, let's think about the biopsy results. If they show granulomas, that might point towards lupus tumidus or sarcoidosis. If there are atypical lymphocytes, that could indicate lymphoma. These results are crucial in narrowing down the diagnosis.\n\nAfter considering everything, I think the top differential diagnosis is lupus tumidus. It fits the solitary, persistent nature of the lesion, and the biopsy results could support this if they show granulomas. Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma is also high on the list, given the lack of response to treatment and the possibility of atypical lymphocytes in the biopsy. Discoid lupus erythematosus is still a consideration, but it usually has more scaling and other characteristic features. Rosacea and sarcoidosis seem less likely given the lesion's localized nature, but they can't be completely ruled out without further investigation.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the condition described:\n\n1. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus** - This condition is known for causing red, inflamed patches, especially on the face, and could fit the description of the lesion.\n\n2. **Lupus Tumidus** - A form of lupus that can cause solitary, persistent, red, indurated plaques, which aligns with the lesion on the forehead.\n\n3. **Cutaneous B-cell Lymphoma** - Persistent, enlarging lesions that don't respond to regular treatments could suggest a lymphoma, especially if biopsy results show atypical lymphocytes.\n\n4. **Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis)** - While less likely due to the localized nature, eczema can cause itchy, red patches and should be considered.\n\n5. **Insect Bites** - Though typically transient, insect bites can cause itchy bumps, but persistence for six weeks is unusual.\n\n6. **Rosacea** - Causes redness and papules on the face, but usually more diffuse and with other symptoms like telangiectasia.\n\n7. **Sarcoidosis** - Can cause persistent skin lesions that don't respond to usual treatments, though it's a bit of a wildcard.\n\n8. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** - Persistent, growing facial lesions, though usually not tender or itchy, should be considered given the persistence.\n\n9. **Granuloma Faciale** - A rare skin condition causing persistent red-brown plaques, which could fit the description.\n\n10. **Folliculitis** - Inflammation of hair follicles could cause papules, but usually not a single large lesion.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are **Lupus Tumidus** and **Cutaneous B-cell Lymphoma**, given the solitary, persistent nature of the lesion and the lack of response to previous treatments.

And she's not taking any medications or having other health issues, which is helpful.\n\nThe doctor did an endoscopy, and they saw some vertical furrows and rings in her esophagus. Hmm, that sounds like it could be a condition called esophageal ring or Schatzki ring. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet.\n\nThey also took some biopsies from her esophagus. I wonder if they were looking for something like eosinophilic esophagitis. That's a condition where you get a lot of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, in the esophagus, and it can cause similar symptoms.\n\nSo, what else could it be? There's achalasia, which is when the esophagus has trouble relaxing, but usually, you'd see more difficulty with both solids and liquids, and sometimes it comes with other symptoms.\n\nThen there's diffuse esophageal spasm, which can cause chest pain and trouble swallowing, but it's not as common, and the endoscopy findings don't really match.\n\nWhat about esophageal cancer? That's scary, but she's pretty young, and there's no weight loss or other alarming symptoms, so it seems less likely.\n\nOh, and there's GERD, but she's not having heartburn, which is usually a big part of that. Plus, the rings and furrows don't really fit.\n\nSo, putting it all together, it seems like eosinophilic esophagitis is a strong possibility. The biopsy results would really help confirm that. But we shouldn't completely rule out a Schatzki ring or even celiac disease, which can cause similar issues and might show up in biopsy results.\n\nIn the end, I think eosinophilic esophagitis is the most likely diagnosis, followed by Schatzki ring, and then celiac disease. Those all fit with what we're seeing, and they make sense given her symptoms and the test results.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Eosinophilic Esophagitis** - This condition is characterized by a high concentration of eosinophils in the esophagus, often leading to dysphagia and food impaction, which aligns with the patient's symptoms and the endoscopic findings of vertical furrows and rings.\n\n2. **Schatzki Ring** - A ring of tissue that forms at the lower end of the esophagus can cause intermittent dysphagia, particularly with solid foods, matching the patient's experience.\n\n3. **Celiac Disease** - While primarily associated with gastrointestinal symptoms, celiac disease can cause dysphagia due to esophageal involvement, and the biopsy results could reveal supportive evidence.\n\n4. **Achalasia** - Although typically involving difficulty with both solids and liquids, achalasia is a motility disorder that could present with similar symptoms, especially in early stages.\n\n5. **Diffuse Esophageal Spasm** - This condition involves abnormal esophageal contractions that can cause chest pain and dysphagia, but it's less common and may not align perfectly with the endoscopic findings.\n\n6. **Esophageal Cancer** - While less likely due to the patient's age and lack of alarming symptoms like weight loss, it remains a consideration in cases of progressive dysphagia.\n\n7. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)** - Although the patient doesn't report heartburn, GERD can cause esophageal irritation and strictures, potentially leading to dysphagia.\n\n8. **Esophageal Stricture** - This can result from chronic inflammation or injury, causing narrowing of the esophagus and difficulty swallowing.\n\n9. **Motility Disorders** - Other esophageal motility disorders, like nutcracker esophagus or hypertensive lower esophageal sphincter, could cause similar symptoms and may be considered.\n\n10. **Food Allergy** - In some cases, food allergies can cause esophageal symptoms, including dysphagia, especially if there is an allergic reaction to certain foods like meats.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top three differential diagnoses, in order of likelihood, are:\n\n1. **Eosinophilic Esophagitis**\n2. **Schatzki Ring**\n3. **Celiac Disease**\n\nThese diagnoses align with the patient's symptoms, the endoscopic findings, and the potential biopsy results, providing a comprehensive view of the possible underlying conditions.", "topic": "['Allergy and Clinical Immunology', 'Gastroenterology', 'Swallowing and Dysphagia', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine']"}

The patient had previously been treated with topical corticosteroid therapy, which provided temporary relief of his symptoms. Visual acuity was 20/20 OU with normal intraocular pressures. The results from the slitlamp examination of the right eye were within normal limits (Figure 1A). Examination results of the left eye demonstrated 2+ diffuse conjunctival hyperemia, 1+ anterior chamber cell, and a vascularized iris infiltrate (Figure 1B). Results of the dilated fundus examination were within normal limits in both eyes. Ultrasound biomicroscopy of the left eye demonstrated areas of ciliary body thickening 360° and a thickened iris pupillary margin superiorly and nasally. A full review of systems was negative for other abnormalities including skin lesions. Test results for tuberculosis and syphilis were negative. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Juvenile xanthogranuloma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 19-year-old guy who's been dealing with this annoying redness and sensitivity to light in his left eye for about a year now. He's been using some topical corticosteroids, and they help for a bit, but the problem keeps coming back. That's a clue right there. Recurrent issues often mean something inflammatory or maybe even autoimmune is going on.\n\nOkay, so his vision is perfect, and the pressures in his eyes are normal. That's good, it rules out glaucoma for now. But when we look at his left eye with the slit lamp, there's definitely something up. There's redness, some cells in the anterior chamber, and this weird vascularized iris infiltrate. That's a bit of a red flag for inflammation.\n\nThe right eye looks fine, which is interesting. Whatever's going on is mostly targeting the left eye. And the back of the eye, the retina and all that, looks normal too. So, it's more of a front-of-the-eye problem.\n\nNow, let's think about that ultrasound biomicroscopy. It shows thickening of the ciliary body and the iris. That's a sign of inflammation, maybe even some structural changes. This is pointing towards something like iridocyclitis or a related condition.\n\nSo, what could be causing this? Well, there are a few things that come to mind. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is common in young people and can cause uveitis. Then there's HLA-B27 associated anterior uveitis, which is another possibility. And we can't forget about infections like tuberculosis or syphilis, but the tests for those came back negative, so we can probably rule them out.\n\nOh, and there's also Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis. That's known for causing chronic inflammation and could fit the bill here, especially with that iris infiltrate.\n\nLet's not forget about sarcoidosis. It can cause uveitis too, but usually, there are other symptoms or signs, and this guy's review of systems was negative.\n\nSo, if we put it all together, Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis seems like a strong contender. It matches the chronic, recurrent pattern and the ultrasound findings. Plus, the negative test results for other infections make it more likely.\n\nYeah, I think that's our best bet. Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis explains what's going on here.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 19-year-old man's eye condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis**: This is a common cause of uveitis in young individuals and can lead to recurrent eye inflammation.\n\n2. **HLA-B27 Associated Anterior Uveitis**: This condition is known for causing recurrent anterior uveitis and is often seen in younger patients.\n\n3. **Fuchs' Heterochromic Iridocyclitis**: This condition is characterized by chronic, low-grade inflammation and could explain the vascularized iris infiltrate and ciliary body thickening.\n\n4. **Tuberculosis**: Although the test results were negative, tuberculosis can sometimes present with atypical results and should be considered, especially if the patient is in a high-risk group.\n\n5. **Syphilis**: Similar to tuberculosis, syphilis can have varied presentations, and a negative test does not completely rule it out in the context of uveitis.\n\n6. **Sarcoidosis**: This condition can cause uveitis, but it often presents with additional systemic symptoms, which were not noted in this patient.\n\n7. **Herpes Simplex Virus Iridocyclitis**: This viral infection can cause recurrent inflammation and could be considered given the patient's age and symptoms.\n\n8. **Intermediate Uveitis**: This condition can cause inflammation in the middle layer of the eye and may present with similar symptoms.\n\n9. **Lens-Induced Uveitis**: This is a rare condition caused by a reaction to lens proteins and could be considered if other causes are ruled out.\n\n10. **Masquerade Syndrome**: This refers to conditions like intraocular lymphoma that can mimic uveitis and should be considered in cases with atypical presentations.\n\nAfter reviewing all the information, the top differential diagnosis is **Fuchs' Heterochromic Iridocyclitis**, as it aligns well with the chronic, recurrent nature of the symptoms and the ultrasound findings.

His primary care physician initially obtained an ultrasonographic image, which demonstrated a left, level 2 lymph node measuring 4.0 × 1.5 × 2.8 cm. The patient then underwent several courses of antibiotic treatment, but the mass persisted. After a period of conservative management, he developed a sore throat and fever. He subsequently underwent a computed tomographic scan of the neck and chest with contrast, which demonstrated an isolated, enlarged, homogenously enhancing left-neck level 2B lymph node measuring 3.4 × 2.8 × 2.1 cm (Figure 1A). When he presented to our facility, he was found to have an asymptomatically enlarged left level 2/5A neck mass that was nontender and fixed. The patient had an unremarkable medical, surgical, and social history and no known infectious exposures. A white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level were both elevated, at 11 310 cells/μL (to convert to cells × 109 per liter, multiply by 0.001) and 56.2 mg/L (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 9.524), respectively. Studies for influenza A and B, HIV, cytomegalovirus, American foulbrood, Bartonella henselae, infectious mononucleosis, and Epstein-Barr virus had negative results. An ultrasonography-guided needle biopsy was performed. Fine-needle aspiration and flow cytometry had negative results for lymphoproliferative disorders or a malignant condition. A tissue culture had negative results. Given the inconclusive diagnosis, the patient underwent a left neck dissection of levels 2A, 2B, and 5A. Intraoperative frozen sections did not show a malignant process.

We've got a 17-year-old guy with a persistent neck mass. It's been there for six months, and antibiotics haven't helped. That's a red flag for something more than just a simple infection. \n\nFirst, let's consider the usual suspects. Lymphoma comes to mind. It's pretty common in young people and can cause these kinds of masses. But wait, the biopsy and flow cytometry didn't show anything suspicious for lymphoma. Hmm, that's a setback for that theory. \n\nNext up, let's think about infections. He's had a sore throat and fever, so maybe something like infectious mononucleosis? But the tests for that, and other infections like HIV and CMV, all came back negative. That's a strike against the infection theory. \n\nWhat about something a bit more unusual, like cat scratch disease? It's caused by Bartonella henselae, but the test for that was negative too. Okay, scratch that off the list. \n\nNow, let's consider some rarer possibilities. Kikuchi disease, also known as histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis, could fit the bill. It's not common, but it can cause persistent lymphadenopathy in young people. And it wouldn't necessarily show up in a simple biopsy. \n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. We should think about other autoimmune issues like sarcoidosis or even TB, although the latter seems less likely without any exposure history or typical symptoms. \n\nOh, and what about Kimura disease? It's rare, but it could cause these kinds of symptoms. Although, it often comes with other signs like eosinophilia or IgE elevation, which weren't mentioned here. \n\nLet's not forget about Castleman disease. It can cause similar lymph node changes and might not be picked up in initial biopsies. \n\nSo, where does that leave us? After considering everything, Kikuchi disease seems like a strong contender. It matches the age, symptoms, and the fact that initial tests were inconclusive. \n\nBut we can't completely rule out Castleman disease or other rare conditions without more information. For now, Kikuchi disease is the most likely diagnosis, but we should keep an open mind.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 17-year-old male with a persistent neck mass:\n\n1. **Lymphoma** - Given the age and persistent nature of the mass, lymphoma is a common consideration.\n2. **Infectious Mononucleosis** - The sore throat and fever could suggest a viral infection like mononucleosis, but tests were negative.\n3. **Cat Scratch Disease** - Caused by Bartonella henselae, but the test for this was negative.\n4. **Tuberculosis** - Although less likely without exposure history or typical symptoms, it remains a consideration.\n5. **Kikuchi Disease (Histiocytic Necrotizing Lymphadenitis)** - Fits the age and presentation, with persistent lymphadenopathy and negative initial tests.\n6. **Sarcoidosis** - An autoimmune condition that can cause lymphadenopathy, although it's less common in this age group.\n7. **Kimura Disease** - A rare condition that can cause lymphadenopathy, often with eosinophilia or IgE elevation, which weren't noted here.\n8. **Castleman Disease** - Can cause similar lymph node changes and may not be detected in initial biopsies.\n9. **Hodgkin Lymphoma** - Another type of lymphoma that can present with persistent lymphadenopathy.\n10. **Rosai-Dorfman Disease** - A rare condition that can cause lymphadenopathy, often with systemic symptoms.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are Kikuchi disease and Castleman disease, as they align with the patient's age, symptoms, and the fact that initial tests were inconclusive.

The patient’s medical history was notable for severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) diagnosed in the fall of 2017, when he presented with snoring, progressive daytime fatigue, and several years of migraines. Since his diagnosis, he had been adherent to use of nightly continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). However, he had persistent daytime fatigue and morning headaches. Several months before presentation, the patient noticed that his bite changed from an overbite to an underbite (Figure, A), which had been attributed to dental malocclusion from his CPAP machine. Examination findings of the oropharynx showed an oropharynx score of a Mallampati 4, with 3-plus tonsils and macroglossia without scalloping of the tongue (Figure, B). Nasopharyngolaryngoscopic examination findings showed that the tonsils did not approximate at midline, with a narrow anterior-to-posterior dimension of the airway owing to macroglossia and no retrognathia. On further review of systems, the patient reported growth in his tongue and feet and intermittent swelling with numbness in his hands over the past year. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Acromegaly", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 44-year-old guy who's been dealing with some pretty tough sleep issues. He's got severe obstructive sleep apnea, and even though he's been using his CPAP machine every night, he's still feeling really tired during the day and has those pesky morning headaches. That's not great. \n\nNow, he's also noticed something weird with his bite. It's changed from an overbite to an underbite, and that's been blamed on the CPAP. But there's more. He's also mentioned that his tongue has been growing, and he's had some strange symptoms with his feet and hands, like growth and numbness. That's definitely something to pay attention to. \n\nWhen we look at his throat, we see a lot going on. His tonsils are really big, and there's macroglossia, which means his tongue is enlarged. But there's no scalloping on the tongue, which is interesting. And when they did the nasopharyngolaryngoscopy, they found that his airway is narrow because of that big tongue, but there's no retrognathia, so his jaw isn't set back. \n\nSo, what could be causing all of this? Let's start with the obvious. Acromegaly comes to mind because it can cause changes in facial structure and soft tissue growth. That could explain the tongue growth and the changes in his bite. \n\nBut wait, there's more to consider. Sleep apnea can be related to other issues too. Maybe something like hypothyroidism? It can cause macroglossia and sleep problems. \n\nAnd then there's the possibility of a tumor. A lingual thyroid or something similar could be causing the tongue to enlarge and might be contributing to his airway issues. \n\nWe should also think about other less common conditions. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome causes macroglossia, but it's usually seen in kids, so it's a bit of a stretch for a 44-year-old. \n\nAnd what about amyloidosis? It can cause tongue enlargement too, but it's not as common. \n\nOh, and there's Down syndrome, which can have macroglossia as a feature, but it doesn't quite fit with the rest of his symptoms. \n\nNow, let's not forget about lymphangioma. It can cause tongue enlargement, but it's rare in adults. \n\nAnd then there's the idea of a metabolic or genetic syndrome. Maybe something like Prader-Willi? It can cause sleep apnea and changes in body composition. \n\nFinally, let's consider mucopolysaccharidoses. They can cause macroglossia and sleep issues too. \n\nSo, when we put it all together, acromegaly seems like a strong contender. It explains the facial changes, tongue growth, and sleep issues. But we shouldn't completely rule out hypothyroidism or a lingual thyroid tumor yet. They both fit some of the symptoms too. \n\nIn the end, acromegaly is at the top of the list, followed closely by hypothyroidism and lingual thyroid tumor. The others, like Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and amyloidosis, are less likely but still worth considering.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Acromegaly** - This condition is characterized by excessive growth hormone, leading to changes in facial structure and soft tissue growth, which aligns with the patient's symptoms of tongue growth and changes in bite.\n\n2. **Hypothyroidism** - This can cause macroglossia and sleep apnea, contributing to the patient's persistent fatigue and airway issues.\n\n3. **Lingual Thyroid Tumor** - A tumor in the tongue could cause enlargement and contribute to airway obstruction, fitting the patient's symptoms of macroglossia and sleep disturbances.\n\n4. **Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome** - Although typically identified in children, this genetic disorder can cause macroglossia, but it's less likely in a 44-year-old.\n\n5. **Amyloidosis** - This condition can result in tongue enlargement, but it's a less common cause of the patient's symptoms.\n\n6. **Down Syndrome** - While it features macroglossia, it doesn't fully align with the patient's other symptoms and is typically diagnosed at birth.\n\n7. **Lymphangioma** - A benign tumor that can cause tongue enlargement, but it's rare in adults and less likely in this case.\n\n8. **Prader-Willi Syndrome** - This genetic disorder can cause sleep apnea and changes in body composition, but it's usually diagnosed earlier in life.\n\n9. **Mucopolysaccharidoses** - These metabolic disorders can cause macroglossia and sleep issues, but they often have other distinctive features.\n\n10. **Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma with Metastasis** - Although less directly linked to macroglossia, it could potentially cause changes if there's related tissue involvement.\n\nUpon reviewing all the information, acromegaly emerges as the most likely diagnosis, given the combination of symptoms such as tongue growth, changes in facial structure, and persistent sleep issues despite CPAP use. Hypothyroidism and a lingual thyroid tumor are also strong considerations due to their alignment with the patient's symptoms. The other conditions, while possible, are less likely given the patient's age and symptom profile.", "topic": "['Endocrine Surgery', 'Endocrinology', 'Neurosurgery', 'Pulmonary Medicine', 'Sleep Medicine']"}

A dermoscopic examination of the patient showed a translucent lesion with arborizing vessels and erosion (Figure, B). A punch biopsy was performed. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a man in his 70s with a nodule on his nipple. It's slightly eroded and translucent. That's interesting. Nipple changes can be a sign of something going on with the breast tissue. Could it be something like Paget's disease of the breast? That's known for causing changes to the nipple.\n\nNow, let's consider the family history. There's a strong history of melanoma and breast cancer in the family. That's a red flag for hereditary cancer syndromes. But, they did genetic testing and found no BRCA1, BRCA2, or other related mutations. That's surprising. So, maybe it's not directly linked to those genes, but the family history still makes me think of breast cancer.\n\nThe dermoscopic exam shows arborizing vessels and erosion. Hmm, arborizing vessels can be a sign of malignancy. This is making me think of something more serious, like melanoma or even a breast cancer manifestation on the skin.\n\nLet's not forget about the age. Being in his 70s puts him at higher risk for various skin and breast-related issues. Could this be a basal cell carcinoma? It's common in older adults and can present with translucent nodules.\n\nBut wait, the family history of melanoma is strong. Even without the typical genetic mutations, I can't rule out melanoma. It's possible there's another genetic factor at play that wasn't tested.\n\nNow, considering the erosion and vessels, it could also be squamous cell carcinoma. That's another skin cancer that can show up in older adults.\n\nI should also think about benign conditions. Could it be something like a seborrheic keratosis? Those are usually harmless, but they can look a bit worrying sometimes.\n\nOh, and what about Bowen's disease? That's an early form of squamous cell carcinoma that can appear on the skin.\n\nLet's not forget about the possibility of a breast cancer-related skin change, like a nipple adenoma. Those can cause nipple changes too.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I'm thinking the top possibilities are Paget's disease of the breast, melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and Bowen's disease. The family history and genetic factors make me lean towards Paget's disease or melanoma, but I can't rule out the others without a biopsy.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, considering the family history, genetic testing results, and clinical findings:\n\n1. **Paget's Disease of the Breast** - This condition can cause changes to the nipple and is associated with underlying breast cancer, which aligns with the family history of breast cancer.\n\n2. **Melanoma** - Despite no genetic mutations found, the strong family history of melanoma keeps this as a significant consideration, especially with the dermoscopic findings.\n\n3. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** - Common in older adults, this skin cancer can present with translucent nodules and should be considered given the patient's age and dermoscopic findings.\n\n4. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - This type of skin cancer is also common in older adults and can present with erosion and abnormal vessels, as seen in the dermoscopy.\n\n5. **Bowen's Disease** - An early form of squamous cell carcinoma in situ, which can appear on the skin and is consistent with some of the clinical findings.\n\n6. **Nipple Adenoma** - A benign breast condition that can cause nipple changes, although less likely given the family history and malignant features on dermoscopy.\n\n7. **Seborrheic Keratosis** - A benign skin lesion that can sometimes appear worrisome but is usually harmless.\n\n8. **Intraductal Papilloma** - A benign breast tumor that can cause nipple changes, although typically not with the malignant features observed.\n\n9. **Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)** - A non-invasive form of breast cancer that could present with nipple changes, especially in the context of family history.\n\n10. **Malignant Melanoma In Situ** - Given the family history and dermoscopic findings, this remains a consideration even without genetic predisposition evidence.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses, in order of suspicion, are Paget's disease of the breast, melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and Bowen's disease.

Over 2 years, he was prescribed various therapies including prednisone, methotrexate, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, abatacept, and anakinra; he experienced intermittent improvement in his joint pain but had persistently elevated levels of inflammatory markers. He continued to experience asymmetric small- and large-joint polyarthralgias and later developed intermittent fevers (temperatures up to 38.3°C [101°F]) along with a 50-lb (22.7-kg) unintentional weight loss over the course of a few months. On examination, there was subtle synovitis in bilateral metacarpophalangeal joints. Findings on cardiac, pulmonary, and neurologic examinations were unremarkable. Laboratory evaluation was notable for a normocytic anemia and elevated C-reactive protein level (7.7 mg/dL [73.3 nmol/L]). Results of esophagogastroduodenoscopy with gastric biopsies and bone marrow biopsy were unremarkable. Findings on further workup including transthoracic echocardiography to assess for endocarditis, carotid magnetic resonance angiography to assess for vasculitis, and abdominal fat pad biopsy for amyloidosis were also unremarkable. Tocilizumab was initiated. Over the next several months, he developed intermittent abdominal pain, steatorrhea, protein-losing enteropathy, and symmetric bilateral lower extremity edema requiring diuresis. Results of infectious stool studies, celiac serology, and fecal elastase testing were normal. Repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy (Figure, panel A) was performed, with gastric and duodenal biopsies (Figure, panels B and C). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Whipple disease", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 61-year-old man who's been dealing with some pretty tough symptoms. He's got seronegative rheumatoid arthritis, and he's been on quite a few medications for it. But despite all that, he's still having joint pain and his inflammatory markers are high. That's a bit concerning.\n\nNow, he's also having fevers and has lost a significant amount of weight. That's not something you see with just rheumatoid arthritis. It makes me think there's something more systemic going on. Could it be an infection or maybe a malignancy? Those are usually the big players when you see weight loss and fevers.\n\nThe lab results show normocytic anemia and high CRP. Anemia could be from chronic disease, but it could also be from something like a bone marrow issue. And that high CRP just screams inflammation.\n\nThey've done a bunch of tests, including a bone marrow biopsy, and everything's come back normal. That's a bit puzzling. You'd think with symptoms like these, something would show up. But maybe we're just not looking in the right place yet.\n\nOh, and he started on tocilizumab, which is an IL-6 inhibitor. That's interesting because it's used for some pretty specific conditions. Could this be related to an IL-6 issue?\n\nAfter starting tocilizumab, he developed abdominal pain, steatorrhea, and protein-losing enteropathy. That's a new twist. It sounds like his gut is really unhappy. And the symmetric lower extremity edema is strange too. It's like his body is leaking protein or something.\n\nThe repeat endoscopy and biopsies showed something, but we don't know what yet. Could it be related to the tocilizumab? Maybe it's uncovering an underlying issue.\n\nSo, what could this be? Let's think about autoimmune disorders. Autoimmune enteropathy could fit, but it's rare. And there's systemic capillary leak syndrome, which could explain the edema and protein loss. Castleman disease is another possibility because it involves IL-6 and can cause systemic symptoms.\n\nHmm, let's rank these possibilities. Castleman disease seems likely because it matches the systemic symptoms and the response to tocilizumab. But we can't ignore systemic capillary leak syndrome or autoimmune enteropathy. They both have some features that fit.\n\nIn the end, Castleman disease feels like the best fit. It's got the systemic inflammation, the response to IL-6 inhibition, and it could explain the gut symptoms. Yeah, that seems like the most likely diagnosis.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Castleman Disease** - This condition is characterized by systemic inflammation, which aligns with the patient's symptoms and his response to tocilizumab, an IL-6 inhibitor.\n\n2. **Systemic Capillary Leak Syndrome** - This syndrome could explain the patient's edema and protein-losing enteropathy, as it involves increased capillary permeability leading to fluid and protein loss.\n\n3. **Autoimmune Enteropathy** - This rare condition could account for the gastrointestinal symptoms, including steatorrhea and protein loss, especially if there's an autoimmune component.\n\n4. **Lymphoma** - Given the systemic nature of the symptoms, including fevers, weight loss, and anemia, a lymphoproliferative disorder like lymphoma is a consideration.\n\n5. **Chronic Infection** - Persistent fevers and weight loss could suggest a chronic infectious process, although the normal test results make this less likely.\n\n6. **Sarcoidosis** - This condition can cause systemic symptoms and gastrointestinal involvement, but usually, there are more respiratory or skin findings.\n\n7. **Celiac Disease** - Although celiac serology was normal, the presence of steatorrhea and malabsorption could still raise suspicion, especially if there was a false-negative result.\n\n8. **Whipple's Disease** - This rare bacterial infection can cause malabsorption and systemic symptoms, but it would likely show characteristic findings on biopsy.\n\n9. **Primary Immunodeficiency** - An underlying immunodeficiency could lead to recurrent infections and systemic symptoms, but the normal test results do not strongly support this.\n\n10. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - The systemic symptoms could be paraneoplastic manifestations of an underlying malignancy, although no tumor has been identified.\n\nReranking these possibilities based on all the information, Castleman disease remains the most likely diagnosis due to the systemic inflammation, response to IL-6 inhibition, and gastrointestinal involvement. Systemic capillary leak syndrome and autoimmune enteropathy follow closely, as they also explain key features of the patient's presentation. Lymphoma and chronic infection, while possible, are less likely given the normal biopsy and infectious workup results. The remaining conditions, such as sarcoidosis, celiac disease, Whipple's disease, primary immunodeficiency, and paraneoplastic syndrome, are considered less probable based on the provided information.", "topic": "['Infectious Diseases', 'Rheumatology', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology']"}

The patient first presented to her dentist with a complaint of “it feels like there is something on the roof of [her] mouth.” She was never aware of the palatal lesion before her initial presentation. She denied any pain or discomfort from the site, and stated that the increasing size of the mass was what first alerted her to its presence. The extraoral examination results were within normal limits, with no evidence of swelling, expansion, trismus, or lymphadenopathy. Intraoral examination revealed a focally ulcerated, fluctuant 2.5 × 2 × 1-cm pink-red submucosal swelling in the right palatal mucosa (Figure, A). The lesion involved almost the entire right side of the hard palatal mucosa and soft palate and terminated at the palatal midline. Imaging studies were unremarkable. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her 60s with a swelling on the roof of her mouth. It's been there for who knows how long, but it's only now catching her attention because it's getting bigger. She's not in any pain, which is interesting. So, what could this be? \n\nFirst off, let's consider something like a pleomorphic adenoma. It's a common benign tumor in the salivary glands, and the palate is a possible spot for it. It's slow-growing and usually painless, which fits her situation. \n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. What about a lipoma? It's another benign option that could show up as a soft, movable lump. They're not typically ulcerated, though, so maybe that's not it. \n\nNow, could it be something vascular, like a hemangioma? These can appear as red, soft swellings, and they're often found on the mucosa. The ulceration is a bit odd, but it's not impossible. \n\nWe should also think about something like a mucocele. These are pretty common and can happen anywhere in the oral cavity. They're usually painless and can be fluctuant, but they tend to be more translucent or blue-ish. \n\nOh, and let's not forget about salivary gland malignancies, like a mucoepidermoid carcinoma. These can be sneaky, presenting as slow-growing, painless masses. They might ulcerate if they get large enough. \n\nWhat about a schwannoma? These are nerve sheath tumors that can show up in the palate. They're usually slow-growing and painless, which matches what we're seeing. \n\nNow, could it be an inflammatory issue, like a palatal abscess? These are typically painful, but maybe this one is just odd. They can be fluctuant and might ulcerate. \n\nLet's also consider a giant cell granuloma. These can appear as slow-growing, painless masses, and they might ulcerate. They're more common in the gingiva, but the palate isn't out of the question. \n\nOh, and we shouldn't ignore the possibility of a necrotizing sialometaplasia. This can mimic a neoplasm and often appears in the palate. It's usually self-limiting, but it can be confusing. \n\nFinally, let's think about a fibroma. These are common benign tumors in the oral cavity. They're usually firm, but maybe this one is different. They're often painless and can be ulcerated if irritated. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I'd say pleomorphic adenoma is still a strong contender. But we should also keep mucoepidermoid carcinoma, schwannoma, and necrotizing sialometaplasia on our list. They all fit the bill in different ways. Let's make sure to consider all these possibilities as we move forward.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the palatal swelling, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Pleomorphic Adenoma** - A common benign salivary gland tumor that is slow-growing and usually painless.\n2. **Lipoma** - A benign tumor composed of fat tissue, which can present as a soft, movable lump.\n3. **Hemangioma** - A vascular lesion that can appear as a red, soft swelling, often found on mucosal surfaces.\n4. **Mucocele** - A mucus-containing cystic lesion that is usually painless and can be fluctuant.\n5. **Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma** - A salivary gland malignancy that can present as a slow-growing, painless mass with potential ulceration.\n6. **Schwannoma** - A nerve sheath tumor that is typically slow-growing and painless.\n7. **Palatal Abscess** - An inflammatory lesion that, while typically painful, could present atypically as a painless, fluctuant mass.\n8. **Giant Cell Granuloma** - A reactive lesion that can appear as a slow-growing, painless mass with possible ulceration.\n9. **Necrotizing Sialometaplasia** - A self-limiting condition that can mimic a neoplasm, often appearing in the palate.\n10. **Fibroma** - A common benign tumor in the oral cavity, usually firm but can be ulcerated if irritated.\n\nAfter considering all the possibilities and the details provided, the top differential diagnoses are:\n- **Pleomorphic Adenoma**\n- **Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma**\n- **Schwannoma**\n- **Necrotizing Sialometaplasia**\n\nThese options best fit the characteristics of the lesion: its slow growth, painless nature, and potential for ulceration.

The lesions initially started over the trunk and subsequently progressed to involve the face, hands, and feet. The episodes of skin blisters were accompanied by pruritus and redness all over the body. There was no history of oral erosions or difficulty in feeding. Bowel and bladder movements were normal. The child had an older sibling who had no skin ailments, and none of the other family members were affected. On examination, multiple tense, angulated vesicles and bullae on a background of erythema were seen over the face, trunk, and extremities (Figure, A and B). Few urticated papules and wheals were seen in isolation over the trunk. The ruptured bullae were healing with hypopigmentation with accompanying scarring and discrete milia formation. The mucosae and nails were normal. No contractures or webbing of fingers was noted. There was no organomegaly. A punch biopsy from a vesicle was subsequently performed (Figure, C and D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Bullous mastocytosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an infant boy with these recurrent skin blisters. They started when he was just 2 months old, and now they're all over his trunk, face, hands, and feet. That's quite a spread. He's also got some itching and redness. Hmm, no oral issues or feeding problems, so that's something to note. His bowel and bladder movements are normal too. And it's just him in the family with this issue, no one else is affected. \n\nOkay, let's look at the examination findings. There are these tense, angulated vesicles and bullae on a red background. That's interesting. And there are some urticated papules and wheals too. The blisters are healing with some hypopigmentation, scarring, and milia. That's a clue. Mucosae and nails are normal, so we can probably rule out some conditions that affect those areas. No contractures or webbing of fingers, and no organomegaly. \n\nNow, let's think about what this could be. Epidermolysis bullosa comes to mind first. It's known for causing blisters, and there are different types. Maybe it's the simplex type since the mucosae are fine, but let's not jump to conclusions yet. \n\nWhat about bullous impetigo? It's common in infants, but it usually comes with some crusts and bacteria involvement. We don't have any signs of infection here, so maybe not. \n\nDermatitis herpetiformis could be another possibility. It's linked to gluten sensitivity and causes itchy blisters. But, it usually has a different distribution pattern and is rare in infants. \n\nLet's not forget about incontinentia pigmenti. It's a genetic condition with distinct skin changes, but it usually affects girls, and we don't have the typical pigmentary changes here. \n\nAcropustulosis? It causes pustules mainly on the extremities, but we've got vesicles and bullae here, not pustules. \n\nWhat about miliaria? It's a heat rash that can cause vesicles, but it doesn't usually scar or cause milia. \n\nErythema toxicum neonatorum is another thought, but it's a transient condition in newborns and doesn't fit the chronic nature here. \n\nNow, let's think about linear IgA bullous dermatosis. It can cause blisters and is autoimmune, but it's not very common in infants. \n\nAnd finally, there's Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. It causes widespread redness and blisters, but usually, there's a clear history of fever or infection, which we don't have here. \n\nSo, after going through all of this, I'm leaning towards Epidermolysis bullosa simplex. The age of onset, blister characteristics, and healing with scarring and milia all point towards it. It seems to fit the best with what we're seeing.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the infant boy is Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS). This condition is characterized by the onset of blisters shortly after birth, which matches the age of onset in this case. The presence of tense, angulated vesicles and bullae on an erythematous background, along with healing that results in hypopigmentation, scarring, and milia, are classic features of EBS. Additionally, the lack of mucosal involvement supports this diagnosis, as EBS typically spares the mucous membranes. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Epidermolysis bullosa simplex** - The clinical presentation and histological findings strongly support this diagnosis.\n2. **Bullous impetigo** - Although common in infants, the absence of crusts and signs of bacterial infection make this less likely.\n3. **Dermatitis herpetiformis** - Rare in infants and typically has a different distribution pattern.\n4. **Incontinentia pigmenti** - Usually affects females and lacks the typical pigmentary changes.\n5. **Acropustulosis** - Presents with pustules, not vesicles or bullae.\n6. **Miliaria** - Does not typically scar or result in milia.\n7. **Erythema toxicum neonatorum** - A transient condition that doesn't fit the chronic nature of the case.\n8. **Linear IgA bullous dermatosis** - Less common in infants and often has distinct immunological findings.\n9. **Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome** - Usually associated with fever or signs of infection, which are absent here.\n10. **Other rare genetic blistering disorders** - Less likely given the specific features that align with EBS.", "topic": "['Allergy and Clinical Immunology', 'Pediatrics', 'Dermatology']"}

When emergency responders arrived, the patient was responsive but groggy. An electrocardiogram (ECG) in the field demonstrated a regular wide complex tachycardia. En route to the hospital, 6 mg of adenosine followed by 12 mg of adenosine were administered intravenously, without a change in her rhythm. On arrival to the emergency department, she was in a regular wide complex tachycardia with a heart rate of 225 beats per minute (Figure, A), with an initial blood pressure of 108/77 mm Hg. She was oriented but slow to respond. After sedation, a synchronized, biphasic, 200-J shock converted her to sinus rhythm with bigeminy (Figure, B), which settled to normal sinus rhythm. An intravenous amiodarone infusion was administered. Her initial laboratory evaluation revealed hypokalemia (2.8 mEq/L; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1.0), hypomagnesemia (3.6 mEq/L; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.50), and an elevated serum troponin (0.13 nanograms per milliliter; to convert to micrograms per milliliter, multiply by 1.0). Potassium and magnesium replacement was administered orally and intravenously. She reported no family history of sudden cardiac death or unexplained premature death. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal biventricular size and function. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her 30s who has bulimia, and she fainted after having palpitations and feeling lightheaded. That's pretty concerning. The ECG showed a wide complex tachycardia, which is a big deal. They tried adenosine, but it didn't work. That's interesting because adenosine usually works for certain types of SVTs. So, maybe this isn't your run-of-the-mill SVT. \n\nNow, let's think about the wide complex tachycardia. It could be something like ventricular tachycardia, or maybe it's a supraventricular tachycardia with some kind of conduction issue, like a bundle branch block. But adenosine didn't help, so we might be dealing with ventricular tachycardia. \n\nOh, and she has bulimia. That's important because it can cause electrolyte imbalances. And look, her potassium and magnesium are low. Those electrolytes are crucial for heart function, and being low can definitely cause arrhythmias. So, hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia could be contributing here. \n\nThe fact that she responded to a shock also points towards a ventricular issue. SVTs usually break with adenosine, but this needed a shock. That's a big clue. \n\nNow, let's think about other possibilities. Could it be something like Brugada syndrome? That's a condition that can cause abnormal ECGs and arrhythmias. But, we don't have any information about her having a Brugada pattern on the ECG, so maybe that's not it. \n\nWhat about anticholinergic toxicity? That can cause arrhythmias too, but we don't have any history of medication or substance use that would suggest that. So, it's probably not the case here. \n\nLet's not forget about long QT interval syndrome. That can cause torsades de pointes, a type of polymorphic VT. But, we don't have any ECG info showing a long QT interval, and her symptoms don't quite match. \n\nOkay, so what's the most likely cause? Considering everything, it seems like ventricular tachycardia due to her electrolyte imbalances from bulimia is the best fit. The low potassium and magnesium can definitely cause VT. \n\nBut wait, let's make sure we're not missing anything. Could it be a different type of arrhythmia, like those seen in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome? That can cause wide complex tachycardias too. But, there's no delta wave on the ECG, so that's probably not it. \n\nHmm, what about other less common causes? Like, could it be an arrhythmia from a congenital heart defect? But, she's in her 30s, and there's no history of such defects, so it's unlikely. \n\nLet's also think about acquired conditions, like myocarditis. That can cause arrhythmias, but we don't have any signs of inflammation or heart failure, so it's probably not that. \n\nOh, and we should consider if it could be drug-induced. Maybe something like cocaine use? That can cause arrhythmias and wide complex tachycardias. But, there's no history of drug use, so it's speculative at best. \n\nSo, after thinking it all through, ventricular tachycardia due to electrolyte imbalances from bulimia seems like the most likely cause. But, we should keep an open mind about other possibilities like drug effects or congenital heart issues, just in case.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely cause of the wide complex tachycardia in this patient is ventricular tachycardia due to electrolyte imbalances, specifically hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, which are common complications of bulimia. The fact that adenosine was ineffective and the patient responded to a shock further supports this diagnosis. Here is a ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Ventricular Tachycardia due to Electrolyte Imbalance** - The patient's hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, likely caused by bulimia, can lead to ventricular arrhythmias.\n2. **Torsades de Pointes** - Although there's no mention of a long QT interval, this polymorphic VT can occur with electrolyte imbalances.\n3. **Antidromic Atrial Flutter in Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome** - Wide complex tachycardia can occur, but the absence of a delta wave makes this less likely.\n4. **Brugada Syndrome** - Could cause VT, but there's no specific ECG pattern mentioned to support this.\n5. **Drug-Induced Arrhythmia (e.g., Cocaine)** - Possible, but there's no history of drug use.\n6. **Myocarditis** - Can cause arrhythmias, but there are no signs of inflammation or heart failure.\n7. **Congenital Heart Defect** - Unlikely given the patient's age and lack of history.\n8. **Supraventricular Tachycardia with Aberrancy** - Less likely since adenosine was ineffective.\n9. **Bundle Branch Reentrant Ventricular Tachycardia** - Possible, but less common.\n10. **Anticholinergic Toxicity** - Unlikely without a history of medication or substance use.\n\nThese differential diagnoses are ranked based on the likelihood of causing the patient's symptoms and the response to treatment. The top diagnosis, ventricular tachycardia due to electrolyte imbalance, is the most consistent with the clinical presentation and treatment outcomes.", "topic": "['Cardiology', 'Challenges in Clinical Electrocardiography', 'Rhythm Disorders', 'Feeding and Eating Disorders', 'Psychiatry and Behavioral Health']"}

The patient had a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome with insulin resistance and a migraine disorder and reported experiencing 1 to 2 migraine episodes per week since early high school. She believed that the neck mass made these episodes worse than normal. The patient was otherwise previously healthy until she developed an upper respiratory infection. Her physician noted visible swelling in the right neck and clinically interpreted the finding as enlarged lymph nodes associated with the infection. After 2 weeks, the neck swelling persisted despite the resolution of other symptoms. She was subsequently treated with a course of antibiotics, which did not result in any improvement. The mass slowly enlarged over the next 6 months. The patient reported new symptoms, including waxing and waning pain that radiated to the back of her neck, headaches, and intermittent dysphagia. She also noted periods during which the mass would fluctuate in size. Otolaryngologic examination findings were within normal limits except for a single, nontender, compressible right neck mass deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and extending into level V. The patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan prior to presentation at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center’s otolaryngology clinic. The scan showed a fatty-appearing tumor within the right carotid space. The patient underwent surgical excision, and a mass measuring 8.0 × 6.5 × 4.7–cm was removed from the carotid space (Figure, A). Additional material from the mass was excised at the level of the base of the skull. Gross pathologic examination demonstrated yellowish-brown, homogenous, lobular adipose tissue covered by a thin, tan, transparent membrane (Figure, A). Histopathologic examination showed relatively uniform univacuolar and multivacuolated, granular eosinophilic cells with centrally placed nucleoli (Figure, B and C). In addition, several level II and level III lymph nodes were excised, all of which were found to be benign. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Hibernoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 25-year-old woman with a neck mass that's been growing for six months. That's quite a while for a mass to just hang around, especially after an infection cleared up. So, what could this be? My first thought is lymphadenopathy, just because it's common and often related to infections. But, the fact that it didn't go away with antibiotics is a red flag.\n\nNow, let's consider other possibilities. Lipomas are pretty benign and can grow slowly, so that's a thought. But, usually, they don't cause pain or change size, and this mass is doing both. Hmm, what about a neurogenic tumor? Those can happen in the neck and might explain the pain and fluctuating size. They're not too uncommon in young adults either.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about carotid body tumors. They're paragangliomas that can show up in this area and might cause some of these symptoms too. But, they're rare, so maybe that's a stretch.\n\nWait, the CT scan shows a fatty-appearing tumor in the carotid space. That's interesting. This could point towards a lipomatous tumor, like a lipoma or a liposarcoma. But, liposarcomas are usually more aggressive, so maybe not that.\n\nThe histology is key here. We've got univacuolar and multivacuolated adipocytes with granular eosinophilic cells. That sounds like a lipoma, but let's not jump to conclusions. We should consider other adipocytic tumors too, like an angiolipoma or even a pleomorphic lipoma.\n\nAngiolipomas have a vascular component, which could explain the pain and fluctuating size. And pleomorphic lipomas can occur in the neck and have a more varied appearance under the microscope.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Initially, I thought lymphadenopathy, but that doesn't fit. Then, I considered a neurogenic tumor or a carotid body tumor, but the fatty nature of the mass doesn't support those. Now, I'm leaning towards a lipomatous tumor, maybe an angiolipoma or a pleomorphic lipoma. Those seem to fit the symptoms and histology best.\n\nBut, let's not forget to consider everything. We've got a young woman with a slow-growing, painful, fluctuating mass. The imaging and histology point towards a benign adipocytic tumor. So, angiolipoma or pleomorphic lipoma makes sense. But, we should also think about other rare possibilities, like a chondrolipoma or a spindle cell lipoma.\n\nIn the end, after looking at all the evidence, I think a pleomorphic lipoma is the most likely diagnosis. It matches the clinical presentation and the histological findings. Yeah, that seems to be the best fit.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnoses for the neck mass in this 25-year-old woman can be considered as follows:\n\n1. **Lipoma**: A benign tumor composed of adipose tissue, which aligns with the fatty appearance on the CT scan and the histological findings of univacuolar and multivacuolated adipocytes.\n\n2. **Angiolipoma**: A variant of lipoma with a vascular component, which could explain the pain and fluctuating size of the mass.\n\n3. **Pleomorphic Lipoma**: A benign adipocytic tumor that can occur in the neck region and may present with more varied histological features, including the presence of granular eosinophilic cells.\n\n4. **Neurogenic Tumor**: Such as a schwannoma or neurofibroma, which can occur in the neck but typically does not have a fatty appearance on imaging.\n\n5. **Carotid Body Tumor (Paraganglioma)**: A rare tumor that can occur in the carotid space but usually has a more vascular nature and different histological characteristics.\n\n6. **Spindle Cell Lipoma**: A variant of lipoma that can present in the neck and has a distinct histological appearance with spindle-shaped cells.\n\n7. **Chondrolipoma**: A rare benign tumor consisting of cartilage and adipose tissue, which could potentially match some of the histological findings.\n\n8. **Liposarcoma**: A malignant adipocytic tumor, which is less likely given the benign nature of the mass and the lack of aggressive features.\n\n9. **Hibernoma**: A rare lipomatous tumor composed of brown adipose tissue, which could align with some of the histological features.\n\n10. **Fibrolipoma**: A benign tumor consisting of fibrous and adipose tissue, which might match some of the clinical and histological findings.\n\nAfter considering all the clinical, imaging, and histological information, the most likely diagnosis is a **Pleomorphic Lipoma**. This diagnosis aligns well with the slow growth, painful nature, fluctuating size, and the specific histological features observed in the mass.", "topic": "['Otolaryngology']"}

A rhinoscopy revealed normal mucosa with a submucosal, round, firm, tender lesion, measuring approximately 1 cm and located on the right anterior nasal septum. No drainage was visualized. Her turbinates appeared normal. The patient underwent surgical excision of the septal lesion under general anesthesia for definitive diagnosis. The specimen measured 1.1 × 0.7 × 0.2 cm and was erythematous, soft, vascular, and adherent, with a broad base to the anterior superior nasal septal mucosa just inferior to the upper lateral cartilage (Figure 1A and B). The lesion was excised down through the perichondrium. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Glomus tumor", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 31-year-old woman who's been dealing with right nasal pain and facial pain for three years. That's quite a while to be in pain. She's also feeling something like a mass in her right nostril, but it hasn't grown. That's interesting. And she's got nasal tenderness, especially when it's cold. That's a peculiar detail. She's been sneezing a lot too. Hmm, she was given fluticasone and loratadine, which are usually for allergies, but they didn't help. So, it's probably not just allergic rhinitis. \n\nNow, let's think about what this could be. A nasal polyp could be a possibility, but they're usually not painful. So, maybe not that. Could it be a tumor? But she's not reporting any breathing issues or nasal discharge, which are common with tumors. So, maybe not a tumor either. \n\nThe fact that the pain gets worse with cold is really sticking out. That's not typical for most nasal issues. Hmm, what about a vascular issue?

That seems to match. \n\nOh, and during the exam, there's this firm, tender lesion on the nasal septum. It's round and hasn't changed size, which is odd. Most infections or malignant growths would have some other symptoms or growth. So, I'm thinking it's not an infection or cancer. \n\nThe lesion is also described as vascular. That's another clue pointing towards something like a glomus tumor. They're vascular and known to be painful, which fits her symptoms perfectly. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I'm really leaning towards this being a glomus tumor. It explains the pain, the temperature sensitivity, and the vascular nature of the lesion.

Glomus tumors, also known as glomangiomas, are benign vascular tumors that can occur in the nasal region. They are known for being painful and highly sensitive to temperature changes, which aligns with the patient's symptoms of right nasal pain and radiating facial pain that worsens with cold exposure. The presence of a firm, tender, and vascular lesion on the nasal septum further supports this diagnosis. \n\nHere is a 10-step differential diagnosis list, with each step considering a different potential condition based on the symptoms and findings:\n\n1. **Glomus Tumor** - Given the painful nature and temperature sensitivity, this is the most likely diagnosis.\n2. **Nasal Polyp** - Typically not painful, but can cause obstruction; less likely in this case.\n3. **Inverted Papilloma** - Usually presents with nasal obstruction or discharge; not consistent with this patient's symptoms.\n4. **Mucosal Cyst** - Could present as a mass, but usually not painful or vascular.\n5. **Hemangioma** - Vascular like a glomus tumor, but often presents differently in the nasal cavity.\n6. **Osteoma** - A bony growth that is usually painless; unlikely given the patient's pain.\n7. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - Would likely present with more aggressive symptoms such as bleeding or a growing mass.\n8. **Melanoma** - Typically pigmented and more aggressive; not consistent with this case.\n9. **Fibroma** - A benign tumor, but usually not painful or vascular.\n10. **Pyogenic Granuloma** - A vascular lesion, but often associated with trauma or infection, which is not indicated here.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the glomus tumor remains the most fitting diagnosis given the combination of symptoms and lesion characteristics.", "topic": "['Otolaryngology', 'Rhinology and Sinus Disease', 'Oncology', 'Soft-Tissue Tumors']"}

At presentation, he was experiencing psychosis and being treated in an inpatient psychiatric ward. He was nonadherent with medications and denied drug and alcohol abuse. On examination, he appeared comfortable. His blood pressure was 150/67 mm Hg; heart rate, 77/min; temperature, 36.7°C (98.1°F); respiratory rate, 16/min; and oxygen saturation, 99% on room air. On both lower extremities, there was peripheral edema with widespread hematomas, scattered ecchymosis, petechiae, and diffuse perifollicular purpura (Figure). The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. Laboratory test results showed a normocytic anemia (hemoglobin level, 5.2 g/dL [reference, 13.5-17.5 g/dL]; mean corpuscular volume, 85 fL [reference, 80-100 fL]); normal platelet count (thrombocytes, 285 ×109/L [reference, 150-400 ×109/L]); and a mild leukopenia (leukocytes, 3.9 ×109 [reference, 4.3-10 ×109/L]). Folic acid level was low (3 nmol/L [reference, ≥5 nmol/L]) and vitamin B12 level was normal (478 pg/mL [reference, 193-982 pg/mL]). Results for iron panel, reticulocyte count, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), international normalized ratio, liver function tests, and levels of indirect bilirubin, haptoglobin, fibrinogen, and creatine kinase were all within reference range. Chest radiographs and computed tomography of the head were negative for any acute pathology. A 12-lead electrocardiogram revealed no abnormalities. Ultrasound of both lower legs showed no thromboembolism. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy)", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 61-year-old man who's been dealing with some tough symptoms. He's feeling really tired, weak, and has joint pain. Plus, he had a fall, which is a bit concerning. He's been in the psychiatric ward, so there's definitely some psychosis going on. And he's not been taking his meds like he should. He denies any drug or alcohol issues, so let's keep that in mind.\n\nNow, looking at his physical condition, he's got some pretty noticeable signs. There's peripheral edema and these widespread hematomas, ecchymosis, petechiae, and even perifollicular purpura. That's a lot of bruising and bleeding under the skin. His vitals seem okay, though. Blood pressure is a bit high, but his heart rate and temperature are normal.\n\nThe lab results are interesting. He's got normocytic anemia, which means his red blood cells are smaller than usual. His platelet count is normal, but there's mild leukopenia. Hmm, that's a low white blood cell count. Folic acid is low, but vitamin B12 is fine. Iron levels, clotting times, liver function, and other tests are all normal. So, it's not looking like a typical bleeding disorder or liver problem.\n\nLet's start thinking about what could be going on. First, the bruising and bleeding make me think of a vascular issue, like vasculitis. That could cause the purpura and hematomas. But wait, the normal platelet count throws a wrench in that. Maybe it's not the platelets, but something else causing the bleeding.\n\nNext, I'm considering a nutrient deficiency. The low folic acid could be a clue. Folate deficiency can cause anemia and maybe some of these other symptoms. But would it cause bruising? That's not as clear.\n\nNow, let's not forget about his psychiatric history. Psychosis could be linked to something metabolic or even a paraneoplastic syndrome. That's when a cancer somewhere in the body causes strange symptoms. Could that be causing the bleeding and anemia?\n\nOh, and what about his history of venous thromboembolism? That makes me think of antiphospholipid syndrome. It can cause clotting, but also maybe some bleeding issues due to endothelial damage. But the normal clotting tests don't really support that.\n\nI should also think about infections. HIV or hepatitis could cause some of these symptoms, like the anemia and leukopenia. But there's no fever or other signs of infection. And the normal liver tests don't really point to hepatitis.\n\nNow, let's consider some kind of hematologic disorder. Aplastic anemia could cause the anemia and leukopenia, but usually, the platelets would be low too. Maybe it's early, and that's why they're still normal.\n\nOh, and there's the possibility of a medication effect. He's not been taking his meds, but maybe there's a lingering effect or interaction causing these symptoms. Some drugs can cause bruising and anemia.\n\nI should also think about something like amyloidosis. It can cause purpura and anemia, but usually, there are other signs like organ dysfunction. We don't have any evidence of that here.\n\nLastly, let's not forget about senile purpura. It's common in older adults and can cause bleeding under the skin. But would it cause anemia and leukopenia? That's not typical.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the most likely explanation is some kind of paraneoplastic syndrome. It could explain the bleeding, anemia, and psychiatric symptoms. But I'm not completely ruling out the other possibilities. This is a tough case, and we might need more tests to figure it out for sure.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct potential diagnosis:\n\n1. **Vasculitis** - The presence of widespread purpura and hematomas suggests a possible vascular issue, such as vasculitis, which could cause bleeding under the skin.\n\n2. **Folate Deficiency** - The low folic acid level could contribute to the normocytic anemia and potentially some of the other symptoms, although it's less clear if it would cause bruising.\n\n3. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - The combination of psychiatric symptoms, anemia, and bleeding manifestations could be linked to a paraneoplastic syndrome, where a malignancy causes distant symptoms.\n\n4. **Antiphospholipid Syndrome** - Given the history of venous thromboembolism, antiphospholipid syndrome could be considered, although the normal clotting tests do not strongly support this.\n\n5. **HIV or Hepatitis** - These infections can cause anemia and leukopenia, but the absence of fever or liver dysfunction makes them less likely.\n\n6. **Aplastic Anemia** - This condition can cause anemia and leukopenia, but typically the platelet count would also be low, which is not the case here.\n\n7. **Medication Effect** - Although the patient is nonadherent with medications, a lingering effect or drug interaction could potentially cause these symptoms.\n\n8. **Amyloidosis** - This condition can cause purpura and anemia, but usually, there would be signs of organ dysfunction, which are not present here.\n\n9. **Senile Purpura** - Common in older adults, this could explain the bleeding under the skin, but it typically does not cause anemia or leukopenia.\n\n10. **Psychotic Disorder with Nutritional Deficiencies** - The psychiatric history combined with nutritional deficiencies like folate could contribute to the overall clinical picture.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnosis is **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**, as it could encompass the psychiatric symptoms, anemia, and bleeding manifestations. However, further investigation is necessary to confirm this or any other diagnosis.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Emergency Medicine']"}

The patient first noted an erythematous, tender swelling with yellow discharge, which later evolved to the pigmented mass. Her ocular history was unremarkable. Her medical history revealed hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. On examination, her visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/30 OS. There was a sausage-shaped, darkly pigmented (black), focally ulcerated nodule involving the medial upper eyelid margin and measuring 8 × 6 × 4 mm. Associated madarosis, eyelid margin notching, and telangiectasia were noted (Figure 1). The remainder of the anterior segment and a dilated fundus examination were unremarkable. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Pigmented basal cell carcinoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 73-year-old African American woman with a pigmented lesion on her eyelid. It's been there for about 6 weeks, and it started off as a red, tender bump with some yellow discharge. That sounds like it could be an infection or maybe some kind of inflammation, right? But then it turned into a pigmented mass, which is a bit unusual.\n\nNow, the lesion is dark, almost black, and it's got a funny shape—sausage-shaped, they say. It's also ulcerated, which isn't a great sign. And there's hair loss around it, the eyelid looks notched, and there are some dilated blood vessels. Hmm, that's quite a few concerning features.\n\nLet's think about what this could be. The pigmented nature makes me think of melanoma, especially since it's on the eyelid. But the way it started as a swollen, tender area with discharge is odd for melanoma. That sounds more like an infection, maybe a stye or a chalazion. But those usually don't turn into pigmented masses.\n\nWhat about basal cell carcinoma? It can have a pigmented appearance sometimes and often has those telangiectatic blood vessels. But it typically doesn't start off looking infected. And then there's squamous cell carcinoma, which can ulcerate, but it's not usually pigmented like this.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about benign things like a nevus or a seborrheic keratosis. But those don't usually have this kind of troublesome history or cause madarosis.\n\nSo, what's the most likely diagnosis? It's tricky, but the pigmented and ulcerated nature, along with the madarosis and telangiectasia, is really pointing towards something malignant, like melanoma. But I can't shake off the idea that it started like an infection. Maybe it's something that started benignly and then changed, or maybe there's an infectious process on top of something else.\n\nAlright, let's rank the possibilities. First, I'd say malignant melanoma is top of the list. It fits the pigmented and ulcerated characteristics. Then comes basal cell carcinoma, because of the telangiectasia and the ulceration. Next, I'd put sebaceous carcinoma, as it can mimic these features and is known for being tricky. After that, squamous cell carcinoma, since it can ulcerate, even if it's less likely to be pigmented. And finally, I'd consider benign options like a nevus or seborrheic keratosis, but they seem less likely given the symptoms.\n\nSo, in the end, I'm leaning towards malignant melanoma as the most likely diagnosis, with basal cell carcinoma and sebaceous carcinoma as close contenders. It's a complex case, and we'd definitely need a biopsy to be sure.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the pigmented lesion on the eyelid, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Malignant Melanoma** - Given the pigmented and ulcerated nature of the lesion, along with madarosis and telangiectasia, this is a strong contender.\n\n2. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** - The presence of telangiectasia and ulceration makes this a plausible diagnosis, despite the atypical pigmented presentation.\n\n3. **Sebaceous Carcinoma** - Known for its ability to mimic other lesions and its occurrence on the eyelid, this is a significant consideration.\n\n4. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - Although less likely to be pigmented, its potential to ulcerate keeps it in the differential.\n\n5. **Nevus** - A benign pigmented lesion, but the lesion's history and characteristics make this less likely.\n\n6. **Seborrheic Keratosis** - Typically benign and non-ulcerated, but could be considered due to the pigmented aspect.\n\n7. **Chalazion** - Started as a swollen, tender area, but usually doesn't become a pigmented mass.\n\n8. **Stye (Hordeolum)** - Similar to a chalazion in presentation, but also unlikely to result in a pigmented lesion.\n\n9. **Keratoacanthoma** - A rapidly growing lesion that can ulcerate, but not typically pigmented.\n\n10. **Pigmented Basal Cell Carcinoma Variant** - A specific type of basal cell carcinoma that can present with pigmentation.\n\nAfter considering all the information and test results, the top three differential diagnoses, in order of likelihood, are:\n\n1. **Malignant Melanoma**\n2. **Basal Cell Carcinoma**\n3. **Sebaceous Carcinoma**\n\nA biopsy would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'External Eye Disease', 'Ophthalmology', 'Skin Cancer']"}

Otherwise, the patient had no family history or exposure to tobacco or alcohol. On physical examination, a 2-cm, nontender, mobile retroauricular mass with superficial excoriations was palpable over the right mastoid cortex. The patient had no hearing deficits and no fistula into the external auditory canal. There was no palpable head and neck lymphadenopathy. Serologic studies revealed an elevated absolute eosinophil count of 790/μL  (reference range, <700/μL; to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001) and an eosinophilia percentage of 9.7% (reference range, <6.0%). The T1-weighted postcontrast magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck showed a heterogeneously enhancing mass with irregular borders in the right retroauricular space, with a tract coursing anteriorly toward the parotid gland (Figure, A). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Kimura disease", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 31-year-old Hispanic woman with a 3-year history of a mass behind her right ear. It's been growing steadily, and it's itchy but not painful. That's interesting. She's had eczema, which might be relevant, but let's not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nFirst, let's consider what kind of mass this could be. A lipoma seems like a possibility. It's common, usually painless, and can grow slowly. But, let's not stop here.\n\nNext, I'm thinking about an epidermoid cyst. These can occur in the retroauricular area and might become pruritic if they get irritated. It's a reasonable hypothesis, but let's keep going.\n\nNow, the mass is nontender and mobile, which makes me think of a sebaceous cyst. These are also common behind the ear and can become inflamed, causing itchiness. Hmm, this is a strong contender.\n\nOh, and there's the elevated eosinophil count. That's a clue we can't ignore. Eosinophilia can be linked to allergic reactions or parasitic infections, but there's no mention of systemic symptoms. Could it be related to her eczema? Maybe.\n\nLet's not forget about the MRI results. The mass has irregular borders and a tract toward the parotid gland. This sounds more complex than a simple cyst. Could it be a dermoid cyst or something more unusual?\n\nI should also consider the possibility of a pilomatrixoma. These can occur in the head and neck region and might explain the eosinophilia if there's an inflammatory response. It's a bit of a stretch, but let's keep it in mind.\n\nWhat about an angiolipoma? These can be painful if they have a high vascular component, but this one isn't painful. Still, it's worth considering.\n\nNow, let's think about a neurofibroma. These are usually solitary and can occur almost anywhere. The irregular borders on the MRI could fit, but there's no other signs of neurofibromatosis.\n\nI should also think about the possibility of a branchial cleft cyst. These can occur in the lateral neck or near the ear and might have an irregular appearance on imaging. It's a reasonable idea.\n\nFinally, let's consider a Langerhans cell histiocytosis. This can cause eosinophilia and might explain the MRI findings. It's rare, but it fits some of the unusual features here.\n\nSo, after going through all this, I think the top differential diagnosis is a pilomatrixoma. It explains the mass, the eosinophilia, and the MRI findings pretty well.

Her mental state had deteriorated progressively over the previous 12 months, following the death of her father. After a period living alone, she had returned to the family home 4 months prior to her presentation and had been noted to be socially withdrawn, preoccupied, and distractible. Her family physician, suspecting a depressive episode, had prescribed citalopram up to a dosage of 40 mg once daily, to no effect. Her family subsequently sought advice from the family physician when the patient was noted to be speaking to herself, expressing concerns about people meaning her harm, and professing the belief that she could hear other peoples’ thoughts. The patient had been born in Sierra Leone after a complicated delivery and had traveled to the United Kingdom as a child with her family, who were fleeing from a civil war. On arrival in the United Kingdom, her family claimed asylum and moved into a small apartment in a high-rise building in central London. Although there was no reported developmental delay, she had struggled academically at school and was bullied for having overweight. She left school without qualifications at age 16 years and worked as a shop assistant. She left this job about a year prior to her referral to psychiatry after a period of sick leave following the death of her father. She was a nonsmoker, did not drink alcohol, and denied illicit drug use. A paternal relative was reported to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia. There was no comorbid physical illness. On review, the patient was kempt and had overweight. Eye contact was fleeting, and she presented as anxious, with a degree of psychomotor agitation. Her speech was normal in rate, volume, and tone, although tangential. There was no other evidence of thought disorder. She denied feeling low in mood or suicidal and was objectively euthymic. There was some sleep disturbance, with the patient reporting being fearful to go to sleep owing to persecutory beliefs regarding her neighbors. She reflected that over the preceding few months, she had experienced a sensation of detachment from her immediate environment, as though it was not real, making her world similar to that of a video game. She reported that in the apartment where she had previously been living, she had realized that something was amiss and had become convinced that the door number of her neighbor’s flat, number 6, signified that they meant her harm. She explained this was because 6 was associated with the number of the devil. She reported hearing her neighbors commenting negatively about her appearance. These distressing experiences prompted her to return to her family home, but she continued to hear her neighbors’ voices making derogatory comments about her appearance and began to hear them commenting on her actions and thoughts in the third person as well. On returning home, her paranoia regarding her previous neighbors worsened, resulting in her rarely leaving the house. The volume and frequency of derogatory auditory hallucinations also worsened, and she reported hearing the thoughts of others as well. There was a degree of insight, and although the patient was convinced of the reality of her experiences, she also saw the stress of losing her father as associated with her experiences and was accepting of input from mental health services. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Schizophrenia", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 20-year-old woman who's been having a tough time since her dad passed away. She's been withdrawn, hearing voices, and thinks people are out to get her. That's pretty distressing. Her doctor tried her on citalopram, but it didn't help. Hmm, that's interesting because citalopram is an antidepressant, so maybe this isn't just depression.\n\nShe's got a history of trauma, having fled a civil war with her family. That's a lot for anyone to deal with, and it can definitely have long-term effects. Plus, she's been struggling in school and was bullied. That could contribute to her mental health issues too.\n\nNow, about these voices she's hearing. They're not just random sounds; they're voices commenting on her, which sounds like auditory hallucinations. And she thinks she can hear other people's thoughts. That's a bit more complex. These are positive symptoms of psychosis, like what you might see in schizophrenia.\n\nBut wait, she's also had some depersonalization, feeling like her world isn't real, like a video game. That's a bit different. It's more of a dissociative symptom. So, we've got a mix of psychotic and dissociative symptoms here.\n\nCould this be schizophrenia? It's possible, especially with the hallucinations and delusions. But, the depersonalization throws a wrench in that. Schizophrenia isn't really known for that kind of symptom.\n\nWhat about schizoaffective disorder? That could fit if we're seeing a mix of mood disorder symptoms and psychosis. But, she doesn't really seem to have a mood component right now. She's not reporting feeling low or high, so that's less likely.\n\nOh, and there's the trauma aspect. Her symptoms could be a reaction to all the stress and trauma she's been through. Maybe something like a stress-related disorder or even PTSD with psychotic features? That could explain the hallucinations and paranoia as a response to her past experiences.\n\nBut then again, the way she's experiencing these symptoms—like the voices and delusions—seems pretty consistent with a psychotic disorder. It's not just a stress reaction; it feels more ingrained.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Considering everything, it seems like an atypical psychosis or a brief psychotic disorder could be a good fit. It captures the psychotic symptoms without requiring a full schizophrenia diagnosis.

Laryngoscopic examination revealed right vocal cord paralysis (Figure 1B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cerebral vein thrombosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her 30s who's had a pretty rough time with a severe head injury. She's also got epilepsy and has been dealing with alcohol use disorder. She's on lamotrigine, which is something to keep in mind. When she came in, her Glasgow Coma Score was 11, which isn't great. They did a CT scan and found a right frontal epidural hematoma. It was 19 mm thick and had a volume of 30 cm3, so that's significant. The neurosurgeons stepped in and evacuated the hematoma, and thankfully, her GCS improved to 14 after surgery. \n\nBut then, on the second day after her surgery, she starts having trouble swallowing and with her voice. That's concerning. They did a laryngoscopy and found that her right vocal cord is paralyzed. Hmm, that's interesting. Vocal cord paralysis usually makes me think of something going on with the vagus nerve, the recurrent laryngeal nerve to be specific. \n\nNow, let's think about how this could happen. The surgery was on the right side, and the vagus nerve runs pretty close to the brainstem and down the neck. Could the surgery have affected it? It's possible, but let's not jump to conclusions yet. \n\nFirst, let's consider some other possibilities. Could it be a neurological issue related to her head trauma? I mean, head injuries can cause all sorts of problems, including cranial nerve injuries. The trauma itself could have affected the brainstem or the nerves. \n\nBut wait, there's also the fact that she has epilepsy. Could her medication, lamotrigine, be playing a role here? I don't think so, since it's primarily for seizures and not really known for causing vocal cord paralysis. \n\nWhat about her alcohol use? Chronic alcohol use can lead to nutritional deficiencies, like vitamin B1 deficiency, which can cause Wernicke's encephalopathy. That can lead to neurological issues, but vocal cord paralysis isn't typically one of them. \n\nOkay, let's think about the surgery again. Epidural hematomas are usually related to arterial bleeding, and the middle meningeal artery is often involved. The surgery to evacuate the hematoma could have affected nearby structures, but would it directly cause vocal cord paralysis? That's a stretch unless there was some complication. \n\nOh, and what about a cerebral venous thrombosis? That could happen with head trauma and might affect the brain areas controlling the vagus nerve. It's a possibility, but I'm not sure it's the best fit here. \n\nLet's not forget about the possibility of a brainstem stroke. That could definitely cause vocal cord paralysis if it affected the area where the vagus nerve originates. Given her head injury, a stroke could have occurred due to the trauma. \n\nNow, considering all of this, I think the most likely cause of her vocal cord paralysis is a brainstem stroke related to her head trauma. It fits with the symptoms and the timing. But I'm going to keep an open mind and consider other possibilities, like a surgical complication or even a cerebral venous thrombosis, just in case. \n\nSo, after thinking it through, here are my top 10 differential diagnoses: \n\n1. Brainstem stroke\n2. Surgical complication\n3. Cerebral venous thrombosis\n4. Cranial nerve injury from trauma\n5. Wernicke's encephalopathy\n6. Central nervous system infection\n7. Cervical spine injury\n8. Carotid artery dissection\n9. Hypoxic brain injury\n10. Medication effect\n\nI feel pretty confident about this list. It covers the main possibilities and takes into account her medical history and the circumstances of her injury.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely cause of the woman's vocal cord paralysis is a brainstem stroke related to her head trauma. This is supported by the timing of the symptoms and the nature of her injury. However, it's important to consider other possibilities, such as a surgical complication or cerebral venous thrombosis, given the complexity of her case. Here is a list of differential diagnoses, in order of consideration:\n\n1. **Brainstem stroke** - This is the most likely cause given the head trauma and the timing of the vocal cord paralysis.\n2. **Surgical complication** - The surgery to evacuate the epidural hematoma could have affected nearby structures, potentially leading to nerve damage.\n3. **Cerebral venous thrombosis** - This could occur due to the head trauma and affect brain areas controlling the vagus nerve.\n4. **Cranial nerve injury from trauma** - Direct injury to the vagus nerve or brainstem from the initial trauma.\n5. **Wernicke's encephalopathy** - Although less likely, chronic alcohol use could lead to nutritional deficiencies causing neurological issues.\n6. **Central nervous system infection** - A potential postoperative complication that could affect neurological function.\n7. **Cervical spine injury** - Possible injury to the cervical spine affecting the vagus nerve.\n8. **Carotid artery dissection** - Could result from the trauma and lead to neurological deficits.\n9. **Hypoxic brain injury** - If there was a period of reduced oxygen supply during the trauma or surgery.\n10. **Medication effect** - Although lamotrigine is unlikely to cause vocal cord paralysis, medication effects should be considered.\n\nEach of these possibilities should be evaluated in the context of her medical history and clinical presentation. Further diagnostic testing, such as an MRI or vascular studies, may be necessary to determine the exact cause.", "topic": "['Otolaryngology', 'Swallowing and Dysphagia', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Neurology', 'Substance Use and Addiction Medicine']"}

She had a left vocal fold polyp that was removed 2 months earlier at an outside institution, with benign pathology reported. Subsequent stroboscopy revealed a hemorrhagic-appearing polyp (2-3 mm). She was sent for preoperative voice therapy, with plans for excision. However, her voice worsened with therapy, and she returned to the otolaryngology clinic after a few weeks. A larger, 6- to 7-mm, irregular, left vocal fold mass was noted. Preoperative imaging was nonspecific, revealing a small soft-tissue density along the true vocal fold. The patient was taken to the operating room for excision (Figure, A). After the final pathology results were obtained, the patient was taken back to the operating room for cordectomy with negative margins. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 45-year-old woman who's been dealing with hoarseness. She had a vocal fold polyp removed a couple of months ago, and it was supposed to be benign. But now, she's back with a new issue. Her voice has actually gotten worse, and there's a new mass on her vocal fold. It's bigger and looks kind of irregular. That's a red flag.\n\nFirst, I'm thinking about the possibility of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. This condition can cause benign tumors to grow back, and they often come back in the same area. It's a reasonable first guess given her history.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. The mass is irregular, and it's grown pretty quickly. That makes me think of something more serious, like squamous cell carcinoma. This type of cancer is pretty common in the larynx, and an irregular mass could definitely be a sign of that.\n\nNow, what about other possibilities? There's also the chance of a vocal fold cyst. These can happen after trauma or surgery, and they might cause hoarseness. But would a cyst grow this quickly and become irregular? It seems less likely.\n\nHmm, let's consider granulomas. They can develop on the vocal folds, especially after some kind of trauma or intubation. They're usually benign, but they can cause problems with the voice. Still, the rapid growth and irregularity are making me skeptical.\n\nOh, and there's the possibility of a hemangioma. These are benign vascular tumors, and they could explain the hemorrhagic appearance. But would they grow this fast? I'm not so sure.\n\nNow, let's think about the imaging results. They showed a small soft-tissue density, but nothing too specific. That could fit with a few different things, like a cyst, a polyp, or even a small tumor. It's not giving us a clear answer.\n\nGiven all this, I'm leaning towards squamous cell carcinoma. The irregular mass, the rapid growth, and her worsening symptoms all point in that direction. It's the most concerning possibility, and it fits the evidence we have.\n\nBut wait, let's not forget about other rare possibilities. There's spindle cell carcinoma, which is a type of cancer that can appear on the vocal folds. It's not as common, but it could match what we're seeing.\n\nAnd then there's the chance of a malignant transformation of her previous polyp. Sometimes benign lesions can turn into something more serious. It's a possibility we can't ignore.\n\nSo, after thinking it all through, I'm going to rank squamous cell carcinoma as the most likely diagnosis. It just fits too well with what's going on. Spindle cell carcinoma and malignant transformation are also up there on the list, given the irregularity and rapid growth of the mass.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 45-year-old woman with the vocal fold mass, along with a final ranking of the most likely diagnoses:\n\n1. **Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis** - This condition involves the recurrence of benign tumors in the air passages, which could explain the reappearance of a mass on the vocal fold.\n\n2. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - The irregularity and rapid growth of the mass raise concerns about a malignant process, with squamous cell carcinoma being a common type of cancer in the larynx.\n\n3. **Vocal Fold Cyst** - Although less likely given the rapid growth and irregularity, a cyst could form after trauma or surgery and cause hoarseness.\n\n4. **Granuloma** - These can develop on the vocal folds following trauma or intubation, but the rapid growth and irregular shape are atypical.\n\n5. **Hemangioma** - A benign vascular tumor that could explain the hemorrhagic appearance, but the rapid growth is unusual for this type of lesion.\n\n6. **Spindle Cell Carcinoma** - A rare type of cancer that could match the irregularity and growth pattern of the mass.\n\n7. **Malignant Transformation of a Polyp** - The possibility that a previously benign polyp has turned malignant cannot be ignored, especially with the changes observed.\n\n8. **Laryngeal Chondrosarcoma** - A rare malignant tumor of cartilaginous origin that could present as an irregular mass.\n\n9. **Laryngeal Adenocarcinoma** - A less common type of cancer in the larynx that could present with similar features.\n\n10. **Kaposi's Sarcoma** - A rare vascular tumor associated with immune suppression, which could present as a mass on the vocal fold.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top three most likely diagnoses, in order, are:\n\n1. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - The irregular mass, rapid growth, and worsening symptoms align most closely with this diagnosis.\n\n2. **Spindle Cell Carcinoma** - The atypical features of the mass and its growth pattern make this a plausible diagnosis.\n\n3. **Malignant Transformation of a Polyp** - The history of a previous polyp with new aggressive features raises the suspicion of malignant transformation.\n\nThese diagnoses take into account the clinical presentation, the nature of the mass, and the patient's history, providing a comprehensive view of the possible underlying conditions.", "topic": "['Laryngology', 'Otolaryngology']"}

He had had 2 episodes of seizures that were characterized by tonic head and eye deviation to the left, followed by a brief period of tonic-clonic activity of all 4 limbs and postictal confusion for 10 to 15 minutes. He denied a history of fever, head trauma, limb weakness, or vomiting. He was a vegetarian, nonsmoker, and nondrinker. He denied a history of drug addiction. On examination, he was confused. He had facial flushing and grade III clubbing in his fingers and toes. His chest and cardiovascular examination results were normal. He had ptosis in his right eye. The right eye was deviated laterally secondary to right-medial rectus palsy. His pupil size and pupillary light reactions were normal. He also had grade II papilledema. His motor and sensory examination results were normal; however, he had brisk deep-tendon jerks and extensor planter responses. There were no meningeal signs. His cranial magnetic resonance image showed 2 ring-enhancing lesions in the right frontal and left parietal cortexes, along with surrounding brain edema and mass effects. Both lesions showed a thin-walled, contrast-enhancing rim with a central liquefaction (Figure, A). The central liquefaction showed restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Pulmonary arteriovenous shunt", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 34-year-old guy who's been dealing with headaches, double vision, and seizures for about a month. And now, his consciousness is getting worse. That's pretty concerning. Seizures with head and eye movements to one side, followed by some confusion, definitely point to something neurological. \n\nNow, he doesn't have a fever or any history of trauma, which makes me think this isn't your typical infection or injury. He's a vegetarian, doesn't smoke or drink, and no drugs either. That's interesting because it rules out some lifestyle-related causes. \n\nOn examining him, he's confused, which fits with the altered consciousness. He's got facial flushing and clubbing of the fingers and toes. Clubbing? That's a big clue. It's often linked to chronic conditions, maybe even something like cancer. \n\nHis eye is drooping, and the right eye is stuck looking to the side. That sounds like a nerve issue, maybe the oculomotor nerve. But the pupils react to light, so it's not a full palsy. Hmm, that's something to think about. \n\nHe's also got papilledema, which means there's increased pressure in his head. That's not good. His motor and sensory exams are normal, but those reflexes are brisk, and he's got extensor plantar responses. That suggests some upper motor neuron issue. \n\nThe MRI shows two ring-enhancing lesions with surrounding edema. These look like they could be metastases or maybe abscesses. But the restricted diffusion in the center of these lesions is interesting. That could mean something necrotic or infectious. \n\nSo, what could this be? Let's start with the obvious. Brain metastases are a possibility. They can cause multiple lesions like this. Lung cancer is known for causing clubbing, so that's a strong contender. \n\nBut wait, there's also the possibility of an infection. Bacterial brain abscesses can look like this on MRI, especially with the ring enhancement and restricted diffusion. Maybe something like a bacterial abscess? \n\nThen there's the idea of a parasitic infection, like neurocysticercosis. It's common in certain regions and can cause multiple lesions. But would it cause clubbing? That's unlikely. \n\nOh, and let's not forget about primary brain tumors. Glioblastomas can be pretty aggressive and cause similar symptoms. But they usually don't cause clubbing. \n\nMultiple sclerosis crossed my mind too, but it doesn't usually cause ring-enhancing lesions like this. \n\nSo, where does that leave us? Considering the clubbing and the MRI findings, lung cancer with brain metastases seems like the most likely cause. But bacterial brain abscesses are a close second. \n\nAfter thinking it through, I'd say lung cancer with metastases is the top suspect, followed by bacterial abscesses, then neurocysticercosis, and glioblastoma further down the list. That seems to fit the evidence best.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Lung Cancer with Brain Metastases** - This is a strong contender given the presence of clubbing, a common paraneoplastic syndrome associated with lung cancer, and the MRI findings of multiple ring-enhancing lesions.\n\n2. **Bacterial Brain Abscesses** - The ring-enhancing lesions with restricted diffusion are suggestive of abscesses, which can occur due to bacterial infections.\n\n3. **Neurocysticercosis** - This parasitic infection can cause multiple brain lesions and is common in certain regions, but it typically does not cause clubbing.\n\n4. **Glioblastoma Multiforme** - A primary brain tumor that can present with aggressive features similar to those seen on the MRI, but it usually does not cause clubbing.\n\n5. **Melanoma with Brain Metastases** - Known for causing skin changes and potentially clubbing, melanoma can also lead to brain metastases with similar MRI findings.\n\n6. **Renal Cell Carcinoma with Brain Metastases** - This type of cancer can cause paraneoplastic syndromes and may present with multiple brain lesions.\n\n7. **Tuberculoma** - A form of brain infection caused by tuberculosis, which can present as ring-enhancing lesions, but clubbing is not typically associated.\n\n8. **Toxoplasmosis** - Common in immunocompromised patients, it can cause brain lesions, but clubbing is not a typical feature.\n\n9. **Choriocarcinoma with Brain Metastases** - A rare tumor that can cause metastases to the brain and may present with neurological symptoms.\n\n10. **Hypertensive Encephalopathy** - Although less likely, it can cause changes in consciousness and neurological symptoms, but not typically clubbing or the specific MRI findings.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are lung cancer with brain metastases and bacterial brain abscesses, followed by neurocysticercosis and glioblastoma.

The patient did not require positive pressure or intubation, but he had intermittent stridor associated with desaturations. He had feeding difficulty and failure to thrive. On physical examination, the newborn had facial dysmorphism, including a broad and flat nasal dorsum and mild micrognathia. Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed a cystic lesion consistent with a vallecular cyst. A modified barium swallow study demonstrated laryngeal penetration and aspiration of thin and nectar-thick liquids. A diffuse, soft, palpable mass was present along the right neck. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a multispatial mildly enhancing mass within the bilateral retropharyngeal, parapharyngeal, and carotid spaces, with a mildly hyperintense signal relative to muscle on T1-weighted and T2-weighted images and associated restricted diffusion. The mass was largest on the right side, with convex borders, mild superior displacement of the right parotid gland, and posterior displacement of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle (Figure, A, B). The T2-weighted MRI also demonstrated a hyperintense, nonenhancing lesion within the base of the tongue consistent with a vallecular cyst. The thyroid appeared normal and in its expected location, but no thymus was present in the mediastinum. The patient was taken to the operating room for excision of the vallecular cyst, and a fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the right neck mass was performed for cytopathological analysis (Figure, C, D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Ectopic thymus", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an 11-day-old baby with a right neck mass and some breathing issues. He's also got 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, which is known for causing all sorts of issues, including heart problems and immune system troubles. Oh, and he's got tetralogy of Fallot and only one kidney. That's a lot going on for such a little guy.\n\nNow, about that neck mass. It's soft and you can feel it along the right side of his neck. The MRI shows it's a multispatial mass, which means it's spread across different areas in the neck. It's mildly enhancing, which suggests it might be vascular or have some fluid content. And it's pushing some things around, like the parotid gland and the sternocleidomastoid muscle. That's definitely something to consider.\n\nGiven his 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, I'm thinking about the thymus. This syndrome often causes thymic aplasia, which means the thymus might be missing or underdeveloped. And guess what? The MRI shows no thymus in the mediastinum. That's a big clue.\n\nSo, what could this neck mass be? Let's start with the obvious. Lymphatic malformation is a common cause of neck masses in babies. They're often cystic and can be quite large. But wait, the MRI shows this mass has restricted diffusion. That's not typical for a lymphatic malformation, which usually has free diffusion. Hmm, maybe not that.\n\nHow about a neuroblastoma? It's a common tumor in infants, and it can have a similar appearance on MRI. But, neuroblastomas often have calcifications and may have a different enhancement pattern. Plus, they're usually more aggressive. I'm not sure this fits perfectly.\n\nLet's think about other possibilities. Could it be a vascular tumor, like a hemangioma? They can be enhancing and have a soft tissue mass. But, they usually have a more distinct blood flow pattern on imaging. I'm not entirely convinced.\n\nWhat about a thymic cyst or ectopic thymic tissue? Given the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and the absent thymus, this could be a strong contender. Ectopic thymic tissue can present as a neck mass, and it might explain the MRI findings. This is starting to make sense.\n\nBut wait, let's not forget about other cystic lesions, like a branchial cleft cyst. They can appear in the neck and have a similar cystic nature. But, they usually don't have the same enhancement pattern or restricted diffusion. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nLet's also consider a dermoid cyst. They can be cystic and appear in the neck, but they often have different contents, like fat or keratin, which would show up on the MRI. I don't see that here.\n\nHow about a teratoma? They can be cystic and have solid components, but they often have a more complex appearance on imaging with different tissue types. I'm not seeing that level of complexity here.\n\nLet's not forget about a cystic hygroma. They're lymphatic in origin and can appear in the neck, but they usually have a different appearance on MRI, with more septations and fluid levels. I don't think this matches.\n\nFinally, could it be a laryngeal cleft cyst? The baby has a vallecular cyst, which is related to the larynx. Maybe there's a connection? But, laryngeal cleft cysts don't usually present as a large neck mass. I'm skeptical.\n\nAfter thinking through all of this, I'm leaning towards ectopic thymic tissue or a thymic cyst. It fits with the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, the absent thymus, and the MRI findings. That seems like the most plausible explanation for the neck mass.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the neck mass in the 11-day-old boy with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome:\n\n1. **Lymphatic Malformation** - A common cause of neck masses in infants, often cystic and can be quite large.\n2. **Neuroblastoma** - A tumor that can appear in infancy, potentially with a similar MRI appearance.\n3. **Hemangioma** - A vascular tumor that can present as a soft tissue mass with enhancement on MRI.\n4. **Ectopic Thymic Tissue/Thymic Cyst** - Given the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and absent thymus, this is a strong contender.\n5. **Branchial Cleft Cyst** - A cystic lesion that can appear in the neck, but typically with different MRI characteristics.\n6. **Dermoid Cyst** - A cystic lesion that can appear in the neck, often with different contents visible on MRI.\n7. **Teratoma** - A mass that can have cystic and solid components, often with a more complex MRI appearance.\n8. **Cystic Hygroma** - A lymphatic malformation that can appear in the neck, but usually with distinct MRI features.\n9. **Laryngeal Cleft Cyst** - Related to the larynx, but unlikely to present as a large neck mass.\n10. **Vascular Malformation** - A broad category that includes various non-lymphatic vascular anomalies.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Ectopic Thymic Tissue/Thymic Cyst** is the most plausible explanation for the neck mass, given the context of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and the imaging findings.", "topic": "['Neonatology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Pediatrics', 'Congenital Defects']"}

Examination revealed numerous, pink-purple dermal papules on the trunk and extremities, with preference for the extensor surfaces of the arms (Figure, A) and legs. No lymphadenopathy was noted. The patient reported a 5- to 7-kg weight loss without fever or sweats. His pulmonary and joint symptoms were relieved by daily oral prednisone and flared with taper below 10 mg. Other medications prescribed included hydroxychloroquine, 400 mg, daily for 18 months and weekly adalimumab injections for 7 months, without improvement. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a man in his 50s who's been dealing with some skin issues and joint pain. He's already been told he has granuloma annulare, but let's not jump to conclusions just yet. \n\nFirst off, those pink-purple papules on his skin are catching my attention. They're on the extensor surfaces of his arms and legs, which is interesting. That kind of distribution can be a clue. \n\nNow, he's also got polyarticular inflammatory arthritis. That's a fancy way of saying his wrists, knuckles, and other joints are inflamed. And it's not just the joints; he's feeling fatigued and gets short of breath easily. \n\nHe's lost some weight too, but there aren't any fevers or night sweats, so we can probably rule out some of the more common infections. \n\nHe's been on prednisone, and it's been helping with his symptoms. That suggests there's some inflammation going on that steroids can calm down. But when he tries to lower the dose, his symptoms flare up again. That's a bit of a red flag. \n\nHe's also been on hydroxychloroquine and adalimumab, but they haven't done much for him. That's a bit surprising, as they're often used for autoimmune issues. \n\nSo, what could this be? Let's start with the skin. Those papules could be something like lichen planus or psoriasis. They both can have skin and joint involvement. \n\nBut wait, there's more to consider. The combination of skin lesions, joint pain, and systemic symptoms like fatigue and shortness of breath makes me think of something more systemic. \n\nDermatomyositis is popping into my mind. It's known for skin rashes and muscle weakness, which could explain the fatigue. \n\nHowever, we don't have any mention of muscle weakness here, so maybe that's not it. \n\nLet's think about autoimmune diseases like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. They can have joint and skin involvement, but the specific pattern of skin lesions doesn't quite fit. \n\nSarcoidosis could be another possibility. It can cause skin lesions, joint pain, and systemic symptoms. But usually, you'd expect to see lymphadenopathy or more lung issues. \n\nHmm, what about infections like HIV or syphilis? They can cause skin rashes and joint pain, but we don't have any other symptoms that typically go along with those. \n\nLet's not forget about drug reactions. Hydroxychloroquine can cause skin issues, but it's unlikely to cause joint pain and systemic symptoms like this. \n\nSo, where does that leave us? I'm thinking the most likely explanation is still dermatomyositis. The skin findings are pretty classic, and the systemic symptoms fit. \n\nBut I'm not completely convinced. We should also consider lupus, sarcoidosis, and even drug-induced causes. They all have some features that match what's going on here. \n\nIn the end, I think dermatomyositis is the best fit, but we should keep an open mind and consider those other possibilities too.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Dermatomyositis** - The presence of pink-purple papules on the extensor surfaces, combined with fatigue and joint pain, aligns with this condition.\n\n2. **Lupus (SLE)** - This autoimmune disease can present with skin rashes, joint pain, and systemic symptoms like fatigue and shortness of breath.\n\n3. **Sarcoidosis** - Known for causing skin lesions, joint pain, and systemic symptoms, although lymphadenopathy is often present.\n\n4. **Psoriatic Arthritis** - Characterized by skin psoriasis and joint inflammation, but typically involves different types of skin lesions.\n\n5. **Rheumatoid Arthritis** - Can involve skin nodules and joint inflammation, but the specific skin findings here are atypical.\n\n6. **Lichen Planus** - Can present with skin papules and sometimes joint pain, but systemic symptoms are less common.\n\n7. **Granuloma Annulare** - Already diagnosed, but the systemic symptoms and joint involvement are not typical for this condition.\n\n8. **HIV-associated Arthropathy** - Can cause joint pain and skin rashes, but usually accompanied by other symptoms.\n\n9. **Syphilis** - Can present with skin rashes and systemic symptoms, but joint pain is less common.\n\n10. **Drug-induced Lupus** - Hydroxychloroquine is unlikely to cause this, but it's important to consider given the medication history.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnosis is **Dermatomyositis**, given the characteristic skin findings and systemic symptoms.

We've got a 53-year-old man who's been dealing with patchy numbness in his right arm for about 10 months. That's quite a while to be experiencing this, and it's spreading too. Now it's not just his right arm, but also parts of his left arm and even his lower extremities. That's a pretty significant progression. And he's got some incoordination in his right hand and imbalance issues. That's definitely pointing towards something neurological.\n\nFirst off, multiple sclerosis comes to mind. It's known for causing numbness and neurological symptoms, and it can definitely progress over time like this. But, hmm, let's not jump to conclusions just yet.\n\nNext, I'm thinking about peripheral neuropathy. It's a common cause of numbness and can affect the arms and legs. But usually, it's more widespread, not so patchy. Plus, the incoordination and imbalance make me think it's more centralized, not just peripheral nerves.\n\nNow, let's consider CNS lymphoma. It's a type of brain tumor that could cause these symptoms, especially if there's a lesion in a strategic area. But, wait, wouldn't we expect to see something in the CSF? Like elevated protein or white blood cells? And the MRI should show something more distinct, right?\n\nOkay, how about syphilis? Neurosyphilis can cause a range of neurological symptoms. But, the tests for rapid plasma reagin were unremarkable, so that's probably not it.\n\nLet's think about vitamin deficiencies.

It's a condition that can cause progressive numbness and weakness, but usually, the CSF would show elevated protein, which isn't the case here.\n\nOh, and there's also the possibility of a paraneoplastic syndrome. These are conditions related to cancers elsewhere in the body that can cause neurological symptoms. But, we'd likely see some abnormal lab results or imaging findings, which we don't have here.\n\nLastly, let's consider hereditary spastic paraplegia. It's a genetic condition that causes progressive stiffness and weakness in the legs. But, it usually starts earlier in life and doesn't typically cause numbness in the arms.\n\nSo, after going through all these possibilities, I'm leaning towards multiple sclerosis. It fits the symptoms and the timeline, even though the CSF is normal. Sometimes MS can present like this, with minimal changes in the CSF. Yeah, that seems like the most likely explanation.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's symptoms, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Multiple Sclerosis** - This condition is known for causing progressive numbness and neurological symptoms, which aligns with the patient's experience.\n\n2. **Peripheral Neuropathy** - While it can cause numbness, it typically presents more diffusely and is less likely to cause the specific pattern of incoordination and imbalance seen here.\n\n3. **CNS Lymphoma** - A brain tumor that could cause these symptoms, but would likely show abnormalities in the CSF or distinct findings on MRI.\n\n4. **Neurosyphilis** - Can cause a range of neurological symptoms, but the negative rapid plasma reagin test makes this less likely.\n\n5. **Vitamin B12 Deficiency** - Can cause neurological issues, but the normal vitamin B12 levels rule this out.\n\n6. **Lyme Disease** - Can cause neurological symptoms, but usually accompanied by other signs like a rash or positive serology.\n\n7. **Thyroid Dysfunction** - Can cause neurological symptoms, but normal thyroid tests make this unlikely.\n\n8. **Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)** - Typically shows elevated protein in CSF, which is not present here.\n\n9. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - Conditions related to cancers that can cause neurological symptoms, but would likely have abnormal lab or imaging findings.\n\n10. **Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia** - A genetic condition causing progressive stiffness and weakness, but usually starts earlier in life and doesn't typically involve arm numbness.\n\nAfter considering all possibilities and the normal CSF findings, multiple sclerosis remains the most likely diagnosis, as it can present with minimal changes in the CSF.

She had no relevant medical, family, or ocular history. There was no history of trauma or ocular surgery. One month prior to presentation, she had developed fevers, chills, and coughing. After several days, she had developed redness, pain, photophobia, and blurry vision in her left eye, and she had subsequently developed similar symptoms in her right eye. On presentation, her visual acuity was counting fingers OU. Intraocular pressures were 14 mm Hg OU. A slitlamp examination revealed mild conjunctival redness, 2+ anterior chamber cell, and flare in both eyes, as well as mild posterior synechiae. The cornea was clear without keratic precipitates, and there were no iris nodules. Pigment was present on the anterior lens capsule. A fundus examination demonstrated a moderate amount of vitreous cell, hyperemia and edema of the optic disc, and retinal detachments in both eyes (Figure). The detachments were inferior and shifted with the patient’s head position, suggesting serous detachments. Findings were similar bilaterally. A B-scan ultrasonographic test demonstrated bullous retinal detachments and diffusely thickened choroid. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 33-year-old black woman who's come in with blurry vision in both eyes. That's pretty concerning, especially since she's otherwise healthy and doesn't have any big red flags in her medical or family history. No trauma or surgery either, so we can probably rule those out.\n\nShe mentioned having fevers, chills, and a cough about a month ago. That sounds like some kind of infection, maybe a virus or something similar. Then, a few days later, her eyes started getting red, painful, and sensitive to light. That's not good. And it started in one eye and then moved to the other. That's interesting.\n\nWhen we check her eyes, her vision is really poor, just counting fingers. That's quite severe. But her eye pressures are normal, so it's not glaucoma. The slit-lamp exam shows some inflammation in the front part of her eyes, with cells in the anterior chamber and some flare. There are also posterior synechiae, which means her iris is sticking to the lens. The corneas are clear, so no keratic precipitates, and there aren't any iris nodules. Hmm, that's something to note.\n\nThere's pigment on the lens capsule, which could mean some pigment dispersion. But the big thing is the fundus exam. There's a lot going on there: vitreous cells, optic disc swelling, and retinal detachments. Those detachments are serous and shift with head movement, so they're not the tractional kind. This is getting more interesting.\n\nThe B-scan ultrasound shows bullous retinal detachments and a thickened choroid. That's pointing towards some significant choroidal involvement. So, what could this be?\n\nLet's start with some possibilities. VKH disease comes to mind first. It's known for causing panuveitis and choroidal thickening, and it can definitely lead to serous retinal detachments. Plus, it's more common in certain populations, like Hispanics and Asians, but it can occur in anyone.\n\nNext, let's think about sympathetic ophthalmia. It's another granulomatous uveitis that can cause similar symptoms, but it usually follows eye trauma or surgery, which she doesn't have. Still, it's worth considering.\n\nWhat about sarcoidosis? It can cause panuveitis and retinal detachments, but we'd usually see more systemic symptoms or lung involvement. There's no mention of that here, so it's less likely.\n\nOh, and there's tuberculosis-associated uveitis. It can cause choroidal involvement and granulomatous inflammation, but we'd expect some systemic symptoms or a known history of TB. Again, not much to go on here.\n\nNow, let's not forget about syphilis. It can cause uveitis and retinal detachments, but it's usually more insidious and might have other systemic signs. We don't have any history of that either.\n\nCould it be lupus choroidopathy? That's another possibility, especially with the serous retinal detachments. But we'd expect more systemic lupus symptoms, which aren't mentioned.\n\nLet's also think about Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease again. It fits well with the panuveitis, choroidal thickening, and serous retinal detachments. Plus, it can occur in people of African descent, so that matches her profile.\n\nWhat about idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome? It's a bit of a wildcard, but it could cause some of these symptoms. However, it's usually more localized to the orbit rather than the whole eye.\n\nAnd finally, there's Behçet's disease. It can cause uveitis and retinal involvement, but we'd expect more systemic symptoms like oral or genital ulcers. There's no mention of those, so it's unlikely.\n\nSo, putting it all together, VKH disease seems like the strongest contender. It matches the symptoms, the patient's background, and the test results. Sympathetic ophthalmia and lupus choroidopathy are possibilities, but they don't fit as well. The others, like sarcoidosis and tuberculosis, just don't have enough supporting evidence. Yeah, I'm going with VKH disease as the most likely diagnosis.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease. This condition is characterized by panuveitis, choroidal thickening, and serous retinal detachments, which align well with the symptoms and test results described. VKH disease can occur in individuals of African descent, matching the patient's profile, and typically presents with the bilateral ocular involvement seen in this case. Other potential diagnoses, such as sympathetic ophthalmia and lupus choroidopathy, are considered but are less likely due to the absence of specific supporting factors. Therefore, VKH disease is the strongest contender for the diagnosis. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease**\n2. Sympathetic Ophthalmia\n3. Lupus Choroidopathy\n4. Sarcoidosis\n5. Tuberculosis-associated Uveitis\n6. Syphilis\n7. Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome\n8. Behçet's Disease\n9. Fuchs' Heterochromic Iridocyclitis\n10.

Examination of the jugular venous contour with the patient sitting upright at 90° is shown in Video 1. Auscultatory findings at the left lower sternal border showed normal S1 and S2 heart sounds with a diastolic sound and no murmurs (Figure 1; Video 2). Abdominal examination revealed an enlarged, pulsatile liver with smooth edges palpable 4 cm below the costal margin. Electrocardiography showed resting abnormalities (rightward axis and inferolateral T-wave inversions). Posteroanterior chest radiography showed normal heart size and clear lungs (Figure 1). Transthoracic echocardiography was performed, which showed normal left ventricular size and function without valvular abnormalities. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Constrictive pericarditis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a man in his mid-50s who's been dealing with exertional dyspnea and neck fullness for two years. That's quite a while to be experiencing these symptoms, so it's likely something chronic. Hmm, the neck fullness is interesting. It could be related to the jugular venous pressure. Let's keep that in mind.\n\nNow, when we listen to his heart, there's a diastolic sound. That's not something you hear every day. It's not a murmur, which is intriguing. Could it be a third heart sound or maybe an opening snap? That could give us some clues.\n\nThe liver is also enlarged and pulsatile. That's a big hint. An enlarged liver can be due to congestion, and if it's pulsatile, it might be related to the heart or blood flow issues. Let's think about conditions that cause both liver enlargement and jugular venous distension.\n\nOkay, let's consider constrictive pericarditis. It can cause those symptoms—neck fullness, a diastolic sound like a pericardial knock, and liver issues due to congestion. It fits pretty well so far.\n\nBut wait, the echocardiogram shows normal heart function and no valvular problems. That's a bit unexpected if we're thinking about constrictive pericarditis, which usually shows some restriction. Hmm, maybe we need to look at other possibilities.\n\nHow about tricuspid regurgitation? It can cause an enlarged, pulsatile liver and neck veins due to right-sided heart failure. But, there's no murmur, which is usually present in tricuspid regurgitation. That's a bit of a contradiction.\n\nLet's not forget about cardiac tamponade. It can cause similar symptoms, but usually, it's more acute, and we'd expect more dramatic echocardiogram findings. Still, it's worth considering.\n\nCor pulmonale could be another option. It involves right-sided heart strain, often due to lung issues, but the lungs are clear on the chest X-ray. That makes it less likely.\n\nWhat about chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension? It could explain the exertional dyspnea and jugular venous distension. The diastolic sound might be related to pulmonary hypertension. This is starting to make sense.\n\nOh, and let's not overlook the ECG. It shows a rightward axis and T-wave inversions. That could indicate right heart strain, which fits with pulmonary hypertension.\n\nSo, putting it all together, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension seems to be the most likely cause of his symptoms. It explains the dyspnea, neck fullness, diastolic sound, and liver findings. Yeah, that feels like the right direction.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's symptoms, with each step offering a distinct potential diagnosis:\n\n1. **Constrictive Pericarditis** - This condition can cause neck fullness, a diastolic sound (such as a pericardial knock), and liver enlargement due to congestion.\n\n2. **Tricuspid Regurgitation** - Although typically associated with a murmur, it can cause an enlarged, pulsatile liver and distended neck veins due to right-sided heart failure.\n\n3. **Cardiac Tamponade** - Presents with similar symptoms, but it's usually more acute and would show more dramatic findings on an echocardiogram.\n\n4. **Cor Pulmonale** - Involves right-sided heart strain, often due to lung issues, but clear lungs on the chest X-ray make this less likely.\n\n5. **Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension** - This could explain exertional dyspnea, jugular venous distension, and the diastolic sound, with ECG showing right heart strain.\n\n6. **Right Ventricular Infarction** - Could cause similar symptoms, including jugular venous distension and liver congestion, but usually presents acutely.\n\n7. **Restrictive Cardiomyopathy** - Might mimic constrictive pericarditis but would show restrictive filling on echocardiography.\n\n8. **Chronic Liver Disease** - Could cause an enlarged liver, but wouldn't explain the diastolic heart sound or neck fullness.\n\n9. **Superior Vena Cava Syndrome** - Involves obstruction of blood flow from the head, neck, and upper limbs, but doesn't typically cause a diastolic sound.\n\n10. **Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension** - Similar to chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension but without a history of thromboembolism.\n\nAfter considering all the patient's symptoms and test results, **Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension** emerges as the most likely diagnosis. It accounts for the exertional dyspnea, jugular venous distension, diastolic sound, and liver findings, along with the ECG indicating right heart strain.

In the weeks prior to onset, she traveled to Yosemite National Park but denied any particular infectious exposures or symptoms including rash. She reported no personal or family medical history. Although she did consume a variety of nutraceuticals, she denied medication and recreational drug use. On examination, mental status, cranial nerves, and upper extremities were normal. Lower extremities were significant for her right side having greater pyramidal weakness than the left, with brisk reflexes and right ankle clonus, as well as a sensory level to pinprick at T6. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the total spine with and without gadolinium is seen in Figure 1. Initial investigations were notable for normal complete blood cell count, electrolytes, kidney and liver function, B12, and thyrotropin as well as an unremarkable MRI of the brain. Three lumbar punctures were performed over the course of the patient’s hospitalization, each with a white blood cell count less than 5 /µL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001), normal IgG index, absent oligoclonal bands, normal protein and glucose levels, and benign cytology. A comprehensive infectious and inflammatory workup including HIV, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, Lyme disease, antinuclear antibodies, astrocyte aquaporin-4 autoantibody, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein autoantibody, and serum and cerebrospinal fluid autoimmune panels were negative. Whole-body positron emission tomography demonstrated hypermetabolism of the midthoracic cord. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Glioma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 48-year-old woman who's been dealing with some pretty concerning symptoms for the past two months. She's experiencing weakness in her lower legs, some sensory loss, and even issues with her sphincter control. That's definitely pointing towards something going on with her spinal cord.\n\nNow, she did travel to Yosemite before this all started, but she didn't mention any bugs, rashes, or other signs of infection. So, maybe it's not something she picked up on her trip. She's also not taking any medications or drugs, which rules out some potential causes.\n\nWhen we examine her, her upper body seems fine, but her lower body tells a different story. Her right leg is weaker than her left, and we've got those brisk reflexes and ankle clonus. Plus, she's got a sensory level at T6. That's a pretty clear sign of something happening in the thoracic spine.\n\nThe MRI of her spine shows something, but we don't have the details here. Let's assume it's significant because it's mentioned. Her blood work is all normal, which is good, but it also means we're not seeing any obvious infections or deficiencies.\n\nThe lumbar punctures are really interesting. They're all pretty much normal. No signs of infection or inflammation in the cerebrospinal fluid. That's making me think this might not be something like multiple sclerosis or an infection.\n\nThe infectious and inflammatory workups are all negative too. So, we can probably rule out things like HIV, Lyme disease, and those autoimmune conditions like NMOSD or MOG antibody disease.\n\nNow, the PET scan shows hypermetabolism in the midthoracic cord. That's a bit of a head-scratcher. It suggests some kind of activity or inflammation in the spinal cord itself.\n\nSo, what could this be? Let's start with some possibilities. Spinal cord tumors like ependymoma or astrocytoma could fit, especially with that hypermetabolism. They often show up as masses on MRI and can cause these kinds of symptoms.\n\nAnother thought is transverse myelitis, but the normal CSF findings are throwing me off a bit. Usually, you'd expect some inflammation in the CSF.\n\nSyringomyelia could be another option. It involves the formation of a fluid-filled cavity within the spinal cord, which could explain the sensory loss and weakness.\n\nLet's not forget about multiple sclerosis. It's a classic cause of spinal cord issues, but the normal MRI of the brain and lack of oligoclonal bands make it less likely.\n\nThere's also the possibility of a spinal arteriovenous malformation. These can cause progressive symptoms by altering blood flow in the spinal cord.\n\nHmm, what about something more systemic like sarcoidosis? It can affect the spinal cord and might show up on PET scans, but we'd usually see more systemic symptoms or abnormalities in the CSF.\n\nOkay, let's think about infections again. Even though the CSF is normal, could this be some kind of atypical infection like tuberculosis or syphilis? They can be sneaky and might not show up in standard tests.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about nutritional causes. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, but her B12 levels are normal.\n\nNow, what about a paraneoplastic syndrome? These can cause neurological symptoms and might show up on PET scans due to an underlying cancer.\n\nFinally, there's always the possibility of something rare like HTLV-1-associated myelopathy. It's not common, but it could fit the symptoms and the normal CSF.\n\nSo, after going through all of this, I think the top possibilities are a spinal cord tumor like ependymoma, syringomyelia, or maybe a spinal arteriovenous malformation. These seem to fit the symptoms, the imaging, and the normal CSF findings the best.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Spinal Cord Tumor (Ependymoma or Astrocytoma)**: The symptoms and the hypermetabolism seen on the PET scan could suggest a spinal cord tumor, which often presents as a mass on MRI and can cause progressive neurological deficits.\n\n2. **Syringomyelia**: This condition involves the formation of a fluid-filled cavity within the spinal cord, which could explain the sensory loss and weakness, particularly with a sensory level at T6.\n\n3. **Spinal Arteriovenous Malformation**: This vascular anomaly can cause progressive symptoms by altering blood flow in the spinal cord, which might align with the patient's presentation and imaging findings.\n\n4. **Transverse Myelitis**: Although the normal CSF findings are atypical, some forms of transverse myelitis could present with these symptoms, especially if the inflammation is localized within the spinal cord itself.\n\n5. **Multiple Sclerosis**: Despite the normal MRI of the brain and lack of oligoclonal bands, MS remains a consideration due to its potential to cause spinal cord symptoms, though it's less likely given the current findings.\n\n6. **Sarcoidosis**: This systemic condition can affect the spinal cord and may show increased activity on PET scans, but typically, one would expect more systemic symptoms or CSF abnormalities.\n\n7. **Atypical Infection (Tuberculosis or Syphilis)**: These infections can present with subtle or delayed diagnostic markers and might cause spinal cord involvement without obvious CSF changes.\n\n8. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**: This could cause neurological symptoms and show up on PET scans due to an underlying malignancy, which might not be immediately apparent.\n\n9. **HTLV-1-associated Myelopathy**: A less common condition that could fit the symptoms and normal CSF profile, though it's rare and would require specific testing for confirmation.\n\n10. **Nutritional or Metabolic Cause**: Although the patient's B12 levels are normal, other metabolic or nutritional factors could potentially contribute to spinal cord pathology, warranting further exploration.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are a spinal cord tumor (such as ependymoma or astrocytoma), syringomyelia, or a spinal arteriovenous malformation, as these options best align with the symptoms, imaging, and normal CSF findings.

He had hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and obesity and was a current smoker. His medications included carvedilol, furosemide, lisinopril, metformin, and aspirin but no testosterone or herbal supplements. Family history was significant for a sister with brain cancer, diagnosed in her 40s. On physical examination, his vital signs were within normal limits; his body mass index, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, was 53. His left nipple was retracted. At the 2-o’clock position of the left breast, 3 cm from the nipple, there was a 3.5 × 3.0–cm firm mass. The right breast was normal without masses, and there was no palpable axillary lymphadenopathy. He underwent a bilateral diagnostic mammogram, which showed a partially obscured mass in the left upper outer quadrant with linear extension to the nipple (Figure, left panel). Targeted ultrasound showed a 2.0 × 1.6 × 1.6–cm irregular hypoechoic mass (Figure, right panel). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Male breast cancer", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 43-year-old African American man with a lump in his left breast. That's not something you see every day, so it's definitely something to pay attention to. He's got a few health issues like hypertension and obesity, and he's a smoker. But he's not on testosterone, which can sometimes cause breast changes in men. So, what could this be?\n\nFirst off, gynecomastia is pretty common in men and can be caused by a bunch of things like medications or hormone imbalances. It's usually not cancer, so that's a relief. But let's not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nNow, male breast cancer is rare, but it's serious. The fact that his nipple is retracted and there's a firm mass is a bit worrying. These can be signs of breast cancer, so we can't ignore that.\n\nThere's also the possibility of lipoma, which is basically just a fat lump. They're usually soft and move around, but this mass is firm, so maybe not.\n\nWhat about epidermoid cysts? They can show up as lumps too, but they're usually more superficial and not as firm as what we're seeing here.\n\nPseudogynecomastia is another thought. It's when fat tissue gives the appearance of breast enlargement, but it's not really the same as true gynecomastia. Still, it's worth considering given his obesity.\n\nNow, let's think about the imaging. The mammogram and ultrasound show an irregular hypoechoic mass. That's not looking great, as it could suggest something more sinister like cancer.\n\nBut wait, what about fat necrosis? It can cause firm masses and changes in the skin, like retraction. It's not cancer, but it can mimic it on imaging.\n\nAnd then there's the family history. His sister had brain cancer, which isn't directly related, but it does make you think about hereditary cancer risks. Could there be a genetic link here?\n\nSo, where does that leave us? We've got a few possibilities. Gynecomastia is still on the table, but the imaging is pushing us to consider breast cancer more seriously. Lipoma and epidermoid cyst seem less likely given the firmness and imaging. Pseudogynecomastia is a maybe, but it doesn't quite fit the bill. Fat necrosis is interesting, but it's not as common in men. And then there's the family history, which adds a layer of complexity.\n\nIn the end, male breast cancer is the most concerning possibility given the evidence. But we can't completely rule out gynecomastia or fat necrosis without further tests. It's a tricky situation, and we'll need a biopsy to be sure.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the breast mass in this 43-year-old man, with a focus on one potential diagnosis per step, without repetition:\n\n1. **Gynecomastia** - This is a common benign condition in men characterized by breast tissue enlargement, often due to hormonal imbalances or certain medications.\n\n2. **Male Breast Cancer** - Although rare, breast cancer in men can present as a firm, painless mass, and the nipple retraction is concerning for this diagnosis.\n\n3. **Lipoma** - A benign tumor composed of fat tissue, usually soft and mobile, which doesn't quite match the firmness described.\n\n4. **Epidermoid Cyst** - These cysts can present as lumps but are typically more superficial and less firm than the mass described.\n\n5. **Pseudogynecomastia** - This occurs when fat tissue gives the appearance of breast enlargement, more common in obese individuals, but doesn't fit perfectly with the firm mass.\n\n6. **Fat Necrosis** - This can cause firm masses and skin changes, including nipple retraction, and can mimic cancer on imaging, though it's less common in men.\n\n7. **Hemangioma** - A benign vascular tumor that could present as a mass, though it's not typically firm.\n\n8. **Fibroadenoma** - A benign tumor of glandular and fibrous tissue, more common in women but can occur in men, often presenting as a well-defined mass.\n\n9. **Lymphoma** - Though rare in the breast, it can present as a firm mass, and the patient's family history of cancer raises the question of a potential genetic predisposition.\n\n10. **Sarcoma** - A malignant tumor of mesenchymal origin, which could present as a firm mass, though it's quite rare in the breast.\n\nAfter considering all the information, including the imaging findings and family history, **Male Breast Cancer** is the most concerning possibility and should be ruled out with a biopsy. **Gynecomastia** and **Fat Necrosis** remain as important differential diagnoses that should be considered, but the clinical and radiological features lean more towards a malignancy in this case.

The lesions did not respond to treatment with an unknown oral antibiotic. His medical history included hypertension treated with captopril and a remote history of psoriasis. Physical examination demonstrated several dry, crusted skin lesions with blistering and ulceration, and shallow erythematous ulcerations of his oral mucosa. Internal medicine, otolaryngology, and dermatology departments were consulted. Results of flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy demonstrated erythematous and ulcerative lesions with surrounding leukoplakia involving the base of tongue, glossoepiglottic fold, lingual and laryngeal surfaces of the epiglottis, and aryepiglottic folds (Figure, C and D).

He was living on a ranch in Mexico when this all began. Maybe something he picked up there? But the antibiotics he took didn't work, so it's probably not a simple bacterial infection.\n\nNow, let's see. He has a history of hypertension and psoriasis. Psoriasis can sometimes flare up in response to other issues, so that's something to keep in mind. The physical exam shows dry, crusted lesions that are blistering and ulcerating.

The biopsy from the skin showed something, but it's the blood tests that are really telling. Elevated levels of antidesmoglein 1 and 3 antibodies? That's a hallmark of pemphigus vulgaris. This is an autoimmune condition that causes blisters on the skin and mucous membranes. It fits the symptoms perfectly.\n\nSo, what about that positive TB test? It could be a red herring, or maybe he has a latent TB infection that's not causing symptoms right now. It's possible that the stress from the pemphigus vulgaris could have triggered the TB test to turn positive.\n\nIn the end, the evidence strongly points to pemphigus vulgaris. The antibody levels don't lie, and the symptoms match up well with this condition. The positive TB test is intriguing, but it doesn't change the fact that pemphigus vulgaris is the best fit for what's going on here.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnosis for the 66-year-old man with painful and pruritic ulcerative cutaneous and mucosal lesions is as follows:\n\n1. **Pemphigus Vulgaris** - This is the most likely diagnosis given the presence of painful, blistering lesions on the skin and mucous membranes, along with elevated levels of antidesmoglein 1 and 3 antibodies, which are characteristic of this autoimmune condition.\n\n2. **Tuberculosis** - The positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test suggests the possibility of tuberculosis. However, the presentation of skin and mucosal lesions without other typical symptoms of TB makes this less likely to be the primary issue.\n\n3. **Lupus Vulgaris** - This form of cutaneous tuberculosis can present with skin lesions, but it typically has a different appearance and is accompanied by other symptoms of tuberculosis.\n\n4. **Chronic Discoid Lupus Erythematosus** - This condition can cause skin lesions, but the mucosal involvement and antibody profile do not align well with this diagnosis.\n\n5. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - The lesions' appearance and the patient's age could raise suspicion for squamous cell carcinoma, but the widespread mucosal involvement and antibody findings make this less likely.\n\n6. **Herpes Simplex Virus Infection** - Although HSV can cause mucosal lesions, the lack of response to antibiotics and the specific antibody findings do not support this diagnosis.\n\n7. **Candidiasis** - This could cause oral lesions, but the skin involvement and negative tests for fungal infections make it unlikely.\n\n8. **Erythema Multiforme** - This condition can cause target-like lesions, but the presentation and chronic nature of the lesions do not fit well.\n\n9. **Mucous Membrane Pemphigoid** - This autoimmune condition involves mucosal lesions, but the antibody profile and skin involvement are more consistent with pemphigus vulgaris.\n\n10. **Paraneoplastic Pemphigus** - This is a consideration given the mucosal involvement and blistering, but there is no mention of an underlying neoplasm.\n\nAfter considering all the information, pemphigus vulgaris is the most likely diagnosis, with the positive TB test potentially indicating a latent infection.", "topic": "['Dermatology']"}

He did not have chest pain or any other symptoms. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained (Figure 1). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Atrial fibrillation", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 65-year-old man who's been dealing with hypertension for a decade. He's feeling more tired than usual, dizzy, and having heart palpitations. No chest pain, which is interesting. So, what could be going on here?\n\nFirst off, those palpitations and dizziness make me think of some kind of arrhythmia. Atrial fibrillation pops into my mind right away. It's pretty common, especially in someone his age with a history of high blood pressure.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. What if it's something else? His fatigue and dizziness could also point to a problem with his blood pressure meds. Maybe he's experiencing some side effects, like orthostatic hypotension. That's when your blood pressure drops too much when you stand up, making you feel dizzy.\n\nNow, considering his hypertension, I should think about heart-related issues too. Could it be something like aortic stenosis? That can cause dizziness and fatigue, especially in older adults. It's worth considering.\n\nOh, and what about his ECG? That could give us some clues. If there are any abnormalities, like arrhythmias or ischemic changes, that might point us in a different direction. Maybe it's ventricular tachycardia or something else that's causing these symptoms.\n\nHmm, let's not forget about other possibilities. Anemia could cause fatigue and dizziness too. It's not the first thing that comes to mind with palpitations, but it's still a possibility.\n\nAnd then there's the chance of some kind of neurological issue, like vertigo. That could explain the dizziness. But would it cause palpitations? Maybe not, but it's worth keeping in mind.\n\nOh, and hyperthyroidism could be a player here. It can cause palpitations and fatigue. It's not as common in older men, but it happens.\n\nNow, let's think about medications again. Could a medication interaction be causing these symptoms? Maybe his hypertension meds are clashing with something else he's taking.\n\nAlso, what about cardiac tamponade? That's when fluid builds up around the heart and can cause fatigue, dizziness, and palpitations. It's a bit of a long shot, but it fits some of the symptoms.\n\nFinally, let's consider myocardial infarction. Even without chest pain, it can still cause palpitations and fatigue. It's always a big concern in someone with his history.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I'd say atrial fibrillation is still a top contender. But I shouldn't ignore the possibility of medication side effects or something like aortic stenosis. Cardiac tamponade and myocardial infarction are less likely but still on the list. Anemia, vertigo, and hyperthyroidism round out the possibilities. That's my take.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 65-year-old man with hypertension, fatigue, dizziness, and palpitations:\n\n1. **Atrial Fibrillation**  \n2. **Medication Side Effects (Orthostatic Hypotension)**  \n3. **Aortic Stenosis**  \n4. **Ventricular Tachycardia**  \n5. **Anemia**  \n6. **Vertigo**  \n7. **Hyperthyroidism**  \n8. **Medication Interaction**  \n9. **Cardiac Tamponade**  \n10. **Myocardial Infarction**  \n\nThese diagnoses consider the patient's symptoms, age, and history of hypertension, as well as possible contributions from medications and other less common conditions. Atrial fibrillation and medication side effects are prominent considerations, while cardiac tamponade and myocardial infarction, though less likely, should not be overlooked. Anemia, vertigo, and hyperthyroidism provide alternative explanations for some of the symptoms.

He had no notable medical history except stable asthma. On physical examination, nasopharyngoscopy showed a pedunculated mass with a smooth mucosal surface arising from the roof of the nasopharynx. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging (Figure, A and B) revealed a midline, well-defined, pedunculated polypoid lesion with areas of calcifications in the nasopharynx, measuring approximately 1.2 × 1.5 × 2.0 cm. An endoscopic resection via retrovelar approach using a 70-degree endoscope combined with transnasal approach was performed under general anesthesia. The mass was completely resected with its stalk and with adequate surgical margin. Histopathological results (Figure, C and D) showed that the tumor cells were arranged in papillary structures with fibrovascular cores and these cells also had nuclear grooves. Results of other investigations after surgery were negative for cancer, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neck and thyroid ultrasonography. In addition, no residual tumor or systemic metastasis was observed on positron emission tomography (PET)-CT results. There was no evidence of recurrence at 12-month postoperative follow-up. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Papillary adenocarcinoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a young Asian guy in his 20s who's been dealing with this annoying nasal blockage for about five months. And it's not just that, he's also having these episodes of nosebleeds. That's gotta be frustrating. He's got asthma, but it's been stable, so maybe that's not directly related. \n\nNow, when they did the nasopharyngoscopy, they found this pedunculated mass with a smooth surface sitting in the nasopharynx. That's interesting. And the CT scan shows it's well-defined with some calcifications. It's sitting right in the middle, which makes me think it's not your run-of-the-mill infection or something. \n\nThe histopathology report comes in, and it's showing papillary structures with fibrovascular cores and nuclear grooves. Hmm, that sounds familiar. Could it be a papilloma? But wait, papillomas don't usually have nuclear grooves, do they? That's making me second guess. \n\nLet's think about other possibilities. Could it be a carcinoma? But then, wouldn't we see more aggressive features on the scans or during surgery? And the fact that there's no residual tumor or metastasis is a good sign. \n\nWhat about an inverted papilloma? They can occur in this age group and present with these symptoms. But those nuclear grooves are still bugging me. \n\nMaybe it's a juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. But that's more common in adolescent males, and this guy is in his 20s. Plus, the histology doesn't quite match. \n\nCould it be a craniopharyngioma? They can have calcifications and occur in the nasopharynx, but they're rare in adults. And the histology isn't quite right either. \n\nLet's not forget about schwannomas. They can appear in the nasopharynx, but they don't usually have those papillary structures. \n\nOh, and what about a solitary fibrous tumor? They can occur in the nasopharynx and have a variety of histological features. But again, those nuclear grooves... \n\nAlright, let's take a step back. Considering the age, symptoms, and histology, maybe it's a low-grade papillary carcinoma. They can have papillary structures and nuclear grooves. \n\nBut wait, the clinical behavior doesn't match. There's no invasion or metastasis. \n\nCould it be a branchial cleft cyst? They can present as a mass in the nasopharynx, but the histology doesn't fit. \n\nLet's think about oncocytic papillomas. They can occur in the nasopharynx and have papillary structures. But do they have nuclear grooves? \n\nAlright, let's settle on this. Given the patient's age, symptoms, and the histological findings, it's most likely a low-grade papillary carcinoma. It fits the bill, even if it's a bit unusual. \n\nBut wait, let's not forget about the possibility of a thyroglossal duct cyst. They can present as a midline nasopharyngeal mass and have papillary structures. And the nuclear grooves could be a weird anomaly. \n\nYeah, that makes sense. A thyroglossal duct cyst fits the clinical and histological picture better. Let's go with that.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the provided information, the differential diagnoses for the mass in the nasopharynx of this young Asian man in his 20s, considering the symptoms and histological findings, can be ranked as follows:\n\n1. **Inverted Papilloma** - This is a common benign tumor in the nasal cavity and sinuses that can present with nasal obstruction and epistaxis. The papillary structures with fibrovascular cores align with this diagnosis, although the presence of nuclear grooves is atypical.\n\n2. **Low-Grade Papillary Carcinoma** - This could explain the papillary structures and nuclear grooves, but the lack of aggressive features and metastasis makes it less likely.\n\n3. **Schwannoma** - While schwannomas can occur in the nasopharynx, they typically do not present with papillary structures, making this a less likely option.\n\n4. **Solitary Fibrous Tumor** - These tumors can occur in the nasopharynx and have varied histological features, but the specific findings here are not typical.\n\n5. **Craniopharyngioma** - Although they can have calcifications and occur in the nasopharynx, they are rare in adults and the histology doesn't perfectly match.\n\n6. **Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma** - More common in adolescent males, and the histology doesn't align well with this case.\n\n7. **Oncocytic Papilloma** - Could fit the papillary structures, but nuclear grooves are not typical.\n\n8. **Branchial Cleft Cyst** - Presents as a mass but the histology doesn't fit well.\n\n9. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst** - Can present as a midline nasopharyngeal mass, but the histological findings are not typical for this diagnosis.\n\n10. **Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma Metastasis** - Although the nuclear grooves could suggest this, there's no evidence of a primary thyroid tumor or metastasis.\n\nGiven the age, symptoms, and histological findings, an **Inverted Papilloma** seems the most likely diagnosis, despite the atypical presence of nuclear grooves.

He worked as a farmer and denied recent illnesses, contacts with illnesses, alcohol or tobacco use, and having pets. His visual acuity was 20/60 OD and 20/40 OS with normal intraocular pressures. His slitlamp examination results were notable for mild nuclear sclerosis in both eyes and were negative for conjunctival or corneal lesions. He had round, reactive pupils and no anterior chamber inflammation in either eye. Dilated fundus examination results revealed a few pigmented anterior vitreous cells, a normal optic disc, and flat and large yellowish chorioretinal lesions with overlying pigment scattered throughout the macula and periphery in the right eye (Figure). The left eye had several similar chorioretinal lesions in the superotemporal periphery. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Ocular tuberculosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an 81-year-old man from Mexico who's been dealing with a gradual decline in vision for a couple of years. He's got these subretinal lesions in his right eye, and they're yellowish with some pigment on top. That's interesting. He's also got a chronic cough, which might be important, or maybe it's just a red herring.\n\nFirst, let's consider some common causes of these kinds of lesions. Choroidal nevi come to mind. They're pretty common and can look like these pigmented lesions. But, they're usually stable over time, and this guy's vision is getting worse, so maybe not.\n\nNext, let's think about age-related macular degeneration. It's a big cause of vision loss in older adults, and it can cause those yellowish lesions, which could be drusen. But, AMD usually has more distinct features like larger, softer drusen, and sometimes fluid or bleeding, which I don't see here.\n\nWhat about central serous chorioretinopathy? It causes serous detachments, but those are usually more acute and not chronic like this. Plus, it's more common in younger, stressed-out guys, not someone in his 80s.\n\nHmm, the fact that he's from Mexico is a clue. Could this be related to something endemic to that area? Maybe ocular tuberculosis? That can cause choroidal granulomas, and he does have a chronic cough. That's a big hint towards TB.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. What about other infectious causes like toxoplasmosis or histoplasmosis? They can cause chorioretinal scars, but they usually have more distinct features, and there's no history of systemic illness.\n\nOh, and we can't forget about metastatic disease. Could these lesions be metastases from a primary cancer somewhere else? It's possible, but there's no other evidence of cancer here, and usually, there are more systemic signs.\n\nNow, let's think about the possibility of a fungal infection like cryptococcosis. It's rare, but it can cause these kinds of lesions, especially in older adults. But, there's no mention of immunocompromise or other systemic symptoms.\n\nWhat about sarcoidosis? It can cause all sorts of eye problems, including choroidal lesions. But, we'd usually see more systemic involvement or other eye findings like uveitis.\n\nOkay, let's go back to the idea of ocular tuberculosis. It fits with the chronic cough and the choroidal granulomas. It's a strong contender.\n\nBut, wait, let's not forget about another possibility like sympathetic ophthalmia. It's a rare, bilateral inflammation that can cause these kinds of lesions. It's associated with a history of trauma or surgery, but maybe there's something we're missing there.\n\nSo, after thinking it all through, I'm leaning towards ocular tuberculosis as the most likely diagnosis. It just fits too well with the cough and the eye findings. But, sympathetic ophthalmia is still in the back of my mind as a possibility.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Choroidal Nevi** - These are common, benign pigmented lesions that could resemble the described findings.\n   \n2. **Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)** - While AMD is a common cause of vision loss in older adults, the described lesions don't perfectly match the typical features of AMD.\n\n3. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy** - This condition causes serous detachments, but it's more common in younger individuals and presents more acutely.\n\n4. **Ocular Tuberculosis** - Given the patient's chronic cough and the appearance of the lesions, this is a strong contender.\n\n5. **Toxoplasmosis** - This can cause chorioretinal scars, but usually, there are more distinct clinical features and a relevant history.\n\n6. **Histoplasmosis** - Similar to toxoplasmosis, it can cause chorioretinal lesions, but there's no specific history or systemic symptoms suggesting this.\n\n7. **Metastatic Disease** - Choroidal metastases are possible, but there's no evidence of a primary cancer or systemic symptoms.\n\n8. **Cryptococcosis** - A rare fungal infection that can cause similar lesions, but typically in immunocompromised individuals.\n\n9. **Sarcoidosis** - This can cause various ocular manifestations, including choroidal lesions, but usually with more systemic involvement.\n\n10. **Sympathetic Ophthalmia** - A rare, bilateral granulomatous inflammation that could fit the presentation, especially if there's an unreported history of trauma or surgery.\n\nAfter considering all the possibilities and the patient's background, **Ocular Tuberculosis** emerges as the most likely diagnosis due to the combination of chronic cough and choroidal granulomas.

There was no dyspnea and the airway was clear. The patient revealed that he had a similar but less severe clinical event 5 years previously. At that time, no diagnosis was found and the lesions disappeared following treatment with corticosteroids. Dermatopathologic analysis, biology, serology, and biopsy were performed. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Multiforme erythema", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a man in his 30s who's having a really tough time swallowing and his voice is off. That's pretty concerning. He also had a fever and a runny nose just before things got worse. Hmm, that sounds like it could be some kind of infection or maybe an autoimmune thing. \n\nNow, he's got these spots and peeling skin, but not just anywhere, it's in his mouth, on his lips, and even his private parts. And his eyes, oh man, they're bleeding too. That's not something you see every day. But his skin is fine otherwise, which is kind of weird. \n\nThe doctor took a look inside his nose and throat, and it's all peeling in there too, even down to his vocal cords. That explains the voice issue. But he's not having trouble breathing, so that's a relief. \n\nHe mentioned this happened before, but not as bad, and it went away with some steroids. That makes me think it might be something that flares up and then calms down with treatment. \n\nSo, what could this be? Let's start with some possibilities. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome comes to mind because of the mucosal involvement, but usually, there's skin involvement too, and he didn't take any new meds. \n\nThen there's Erythema Multiforme. It's known for target lesions, but it can involve mucosa and often comes back. The lack of skin lesions is odd, though. \n\nAutoimmune disorders like Pemphigus Vulgaris or Mucous Membrane Pemphigoid could fit, but they usually have a more consistent pattern, and he doesn't seem to have the typical skin blisters. \n\nLupus could be a contender, but it usually has more systemic symptoms and skin rashes. \n\nInfectious causes like HSV could cause mucosal lesions, but they're usually more localized and not this widespread. \n\nEpidermolysis Bullosa Acquisita is another one, but it's rare and usually has skin involvement. \n\nMaybe it's a paraneoplastic syndrome? Those can be weird and involve mucosal lesions. \n\nOr could it be a drug reaction, even though he didn't take anything new? Some reactions don't need a new drug, just a predisposition. \n\nAnd then there's Graft-Versus-Host Disease, but he didn't have a transplant, so that's unlikely. \n\nOkay, let's put it all together. Given the recurring nature and the fact that steroids helped before, I'm leaning towards Erythema Multiforme. It's not perfect, but it fits the best with what we know. \n\nBut wait, let's not forget about autoimmune progesterone dermatitis. It's rare, but it could explain the recurring pattern and mucosal involvement. \n\nSo, after thinking it through, I'm going with Autoimmune Progesterone Dermatitis as the most likely cause. It's not common, but it ticks the most boxes here.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome** - This condition is known for severe mucosal involvement, but it typically includes skin involvement and is often linked to medication use.\n\n2. **Erythema Multiforme** - Characterized by target lesions and mucosal involvement, it often recurs and can be triggered by infections or other factors.\n\n3. **Pemphigus Vulgaris** - An autoimmune disorder that affects mucous membranes, but it usually presents with skin blisters, which are not mentioned here.\n\n4. **Mucous Membrane Pemphigoid** - Another autoimmune condition that affects mucosal surfaces, but it typically involves the eyes and skin more prominently.\n\n5. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** - Can present with mucosal lesions, but it usually includes a range of systemic symptoms and skin rashes.\n\n6. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection** - Can cause mucosal lesions, but these are usually more localized and not as widespread.\n\n7. **Epidermolysis Bullosa Acquisita** - A rare autoimmune condition that typically involves skin lesions, which are absent in this case.\n\n8. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - Could present with unusual mucosal lesions, but there's no mention of an underlying malignancy.\n\n9. **Drug Reaction** - Although the patient didn't take new medications, some drug reactions can occur without recent changes.\n\n10. **Autoimmune Progesterone Dermatitis** - A rare condition that could explain the recurring mucosal lesions, especially if there's a hormonal component involved.\n\nAfter considering all the possibilities and the patient's history of responding well to corticosteroids, **Erythema Multiforme** seems to be the most fitting diagnosis. It aligns with the recurring nature of the symptoms and the significant mucosal involvement without skin lesions. However, **Autoimmune Progesterone Dermatitis** is also a strong contender given the unique presentation and recurring pattern.

The patient first noticed a rapidly expanding, itchy, painful nodule, which measured 3 cm in diameter, 5 months prior to presentation (Figure, B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Merkel cell carcinoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an 81-year-old woman with a pretty concerning skin lesion. It's 30 cm wide, violaceous, and it's bleeding easily. That's definitely not normal. Plus, it's got this nasty necrotic center and some satellite lesions around it. That's a lot to take in.\n\nFirst off, the size and color of this thing are pretty alarming. A lesion that big and bleeding easily? That's a red flag for something serious. My first thought is angiosarcoma. It's a malignant tumor that can appear as a bruise-like lesion, and it's known to bleed. That seems to fit.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. The lesion has a necrotic center and those satellite telangiectatic papules. That's interesting. Necrosis often means something aggressive, maybe even an infection. Could it be something like a pyogenic granuloma? Those can be pretty vascular and bleed too.\n\nNow, thinking about the patient's age, she's 81. Older adults can get all sorts of skin issues. Maybe it's a basal cell carcinoma? They can have telangiectatic features and sometimes ulcerate. But, they're usually not this aggressive or bleeding so easily.\n\nHmm, what about melanoma? It can have a necrotic center and be quite serious. But, I'm not seeing any mention of pigmentation changes, which is a key feature of melanoma. So, maybe not.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about infections. An 81-year-old with a rapidly expanding lesion could have something like a malignant otitis externa, especially if there's any connection to the ear. But, that doesn't quite fit the description here.\n\nAlso, considering the violaceous color, could it be a lymphoma, like a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma? Those can have unusual presentations. But, they usually don't have this kind of rapid growth or necrosis.\n\nWait, what about a dermatofibroma protuberans? They can grow rapidly and have a violaceous hue. But, they're usually more nodular and less likely to have a necrotic center.\n\nLet's not forget about the possibility of a metastatic tumor. Older adults can have internal cancers that metastasize to the skin. But, we'd likely see more of a history or other symptoms pointing to that.\n\nNow, thinking about the rapid expansion and the necrotic center, could it be something like an atypical fibroxanthoma? Those can be aggressive and bleed, especially in older adults. That seems to fit pretty well.\n\nSo, after going through all of this, I think the top differential diagnosis is angiosarcoma. It matches the bleeding, size, and violaceous color. But, atypical fibroxanthoma is a close second. It's aggressive and fits the rapid growth and necrotic features. Let's keep both of those in mind as we move forward.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the skin lesion described, with a focus on one potential diagnosis per step, without repetition:\n\n1. **Angiosarcoma** - This is a malignant tumor known for its rapid growth, violaceous color, and tendency to bleed easily, which aligns well with the lesion's characteristics.\n\n2. **Pyogenic Granuloma** - These are vascular lesions that can appear rapidly and bleed easily, often with a necrotic center, similar to what's described.\n\n3. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** - While typically less aggressive, basal cell carcinomas can ulcerate and have telangiectatic features, making them a consideration in an elderly patient.\n\n4. **Melanoma** - Although melanomas can have a necrotic center, the absence of pigmentation changes makes this less likely.\n\n5. **Malignant Otitis Externa** - This is more related to ear infections, but could be considered if there's any ear involvement, though it doesn't fit the description well.\n\n6. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma** - This can present with unusual skin lesions, including violaceous ones, but typically lacks the rapid necrotic center.\n\n7. **Dermatofibroma Protuberans** - These can grow rapidly and have a violaceous hue, but are usually more nodular and less likely to have a necrotic center.\n\n8. **Metastatic Tumor** - Internal cancers can metastasize to the skin, but additional history or symptoms would typically accompany this.\n\n9. **Atypical Fibroxanthoma** - Known for aggressive behavior in older adults, with rapid growth and potential for bleeding, making it a strong contender.\n\n10. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - Can present with necrotic centers and rapid growth, especially in sun-exposed areas, but is less likely to be violaceous.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are **Angiosarcoma** and **Atypical Fibroxanthoma**, as they both align well with the lesion's aggressive nature, rapid growth, and bleeding characteristics. Angiosarcoma is prioritized due to the violaceous color and significant bleeding, while atypical fibroxanthoma is a close second given the rapid expansion and necrotic center.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Oncology', 'Geriatrics']"}

A polypoid lesion was identified at the left lateral nasal wall. Noncontrasted computed tomography showed a hyperdense mass involving the left medial canthus extending through the nasolacrimal duct into the left nasal cavity. The patient underwent endoscopic left maxillary antrostomy, ethmoidectomy, and biopsy of mass, with results of pathology analysis showing poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was positive for cytokeratin 5/6 and p63, and negative for Epstein-Barr virus, p16, CD45 (leukocyte common antigen), and synaptophysin. The patient was referred to a tertiary care facility for further treatment. On examination, there was a palpable subcutaneous nodule 1 cm inferior to the left medial canthus with normal overlying skin. On nasal endoscopy, residual tumor was visible at the anterior aspect of the lateral nasal wall. Computed tomography showed postoperative changes with enhancement of left medial canthus extending into nasolacrimal duct and along the lateral nasal sidewall (Figure, A). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "NUT carcinoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 29-year-old woman who's been dealing with some annoying symptoms like left-sided tearing, headaches, and facial pressure for a couple of months. That's quite a while to be dealing with that. And there's a polypoid lesion on the left side of her nasal wall. That's interesting.\n\nNow, the CT scan shows a hyperdense mass near her left medial canthus, and it's extending through the nasolacrimal duct into the nasal cavity. That's a pretty specific area. I wonder what that could mean.\n\nThe biopsy results are in, and it's poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. That's a type of skin cancer, but it's odd to find it here. Let's see what the immunohistochemical staining tells us. It's positive for cytokeratin 5/6 and p63, which are markers often seen in squamous cell carcinoma. But it's negative for Epstein-Barr virus, p16, CD45, and synaptophysin. Hmm, that helps narrow things down a bit.\n\nGiven the location and the fact that it's squamous cell carcinoma, I'm thinking it might be related to the nasolacrimal duct. That's a reasonable starting point. But wait, let's not jump to conclusions too quickly.\n\nCould it be something else? Nasopharyngeal carcinoma often shows up in similar areas, but it's usually associated with Epstein-Barr virus. Since that's negative here, it's probably not that.\n\nWhat about mucoepidermoid carcinoma? It's a type of salivary gland tumor, but the IHC markers don't really match up. So that's likely not it either.\n\nLet's consider other possibilities. Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma is an option, but it often has different IHC profiles. And mucosal melanoma? That's usually positive for other markers like S100 or HMB-45, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nAdenoid cystic carcinoma is another salivary gland tumor, but it typically has different IHC characteristics. So that's probably not a match.\n\nCould it be a metastatic tumor? The IHC profile doesn't really fit the typical metastatic patterns, so that's unlikely.\n\nLet's think about the possibility of a primary squamous cell carcinoma of the nasolacrimal duct. The location and IHC results seem to fit. But we should keep an open mind.\n\nWhat about inverted papilloma? It's a benign tumor, but it can be quite aggressive. The IHC markers could fit, but it's usually not malignant like this.\n\nNUT carcinoma is a rare option, but it often has specific translocations and IHC profiles that don't match here. So that's probably not it.\n\nAfter going through all this, I think the most likely diagnosis is indeed a primary squamous cell carcinoma of the nasolacrimal duct. It fits the location, the symptoms, and the IHC results. But it's always good to double-check and make sure we're not missing anything.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the 29-year-old woman is a primary squamous cell carcinoma of the nasolacrimal duct. This diagnosis aligns with the location of the mass, the symptoms she is experiencing, and the immunohistochemical staining results, which are positive for cytokeratin 5/6 and p63, typical markers for squamous cell carcinoma. The negative staining for Epstein-Barr virus, p16, CD45, and synaptophysin helps to rule out other potential differential diagnoses such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma and mucosal melanoma. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Primary Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Nasolacrimal Duct** - This is the most likely diagnosis given the location, symptoms, and IHC profile.\n2. **Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma** - Typically associated with Epstein-Barr virus positivity, which is negative in this case.\n3. **Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma** - The IHC markers do not align well with this diagnosis.\n4. **Sinonasal Undifferentiated Carcinoma** - Often has a different IHC profile.\n5. **Mucosal Melanoma** - Would typically be positive for S100 or HMB-45, which are not mentioned.\n6. **Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma** - Has different IHC characteristics than what is presented.\n7. **Metastatic Tumor** - The IHC profile does not fit typical metastatic patterns.\n8. **Inverted Papilloma** - Usually benign and not malignant like the presented case.\n9. **NUT Carcinoma** - Would likely have specific translocations and IHC profiles not seen here.\n10. **Salivary Gland Tumor (Other)** - The IHC results do not align with common salivary gland tumors.\n\nThis ranking takes into account the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and immunohistochemical results to provide a comprehensive differential diagnosis list.", "topic": "['Otolaryngology', 'Rhinology and Sinus Disease', 'Radiology', 'External Eye Disease', 'Ophthalmology']"}

Physical examination was notable for tenderness over the nasal bones. No neurologic deficits were noted. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head without contrast revealed nasal bone fractures and an incidental 7-mm tissue density within the posterior aspect of the left sphenoid sinus (Figure 1A) with an apparent dehiscence of the posterior wall and possible communication with the intracranial extra-axial spaces and brain parenchyma. A magnetic resonance imaging scan with contrast was recommended to further characterize the lesion which showed a transosseous T1 dark, T2 bright multilobulated mass measuring 2.1 × 1.4 × 1.3 cm with heterogeneous enhancement on postcontrast imaging extending into the sphenoid sinus. An endoscopic transnasal approach was used to obtain a tissue biopsy specimen. Pathological analysis revealed sheets of neoplastic, vacuolated, “soap bubble–like” cells with a myxoid background (Figure 1B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Chordoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 30-year-old guy who came in after getting into a fight. He's got some facial trauma, and his nose is tender. That's not too surprising given the assault. But then, they found something unexpected on his CT scan. There's a small 7-mm spot in his left sphenoid sinus. That's kind of an odd place for something to show up, isn't it?\n\nNow, what could this little spot be? Nasal polyps are pretty common, so that's a possibility. But wait, this is in the sphenoid sinus, which is a bit unusual for a polyp. Let's keep that in mind but also think of other things.\n\nThe CT scan suggests this spot might be communicating with the brain. That's a big deal. Could it be a meningioma? Those can extend from the brain into the sinuses. It's a thought, but let's not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nNext, they did an MRI, and this thing is T1 dark and T2 bright. That sounds like it might have some cystic components. And it's got a heterogeneous enhancement, which means it's not just a simple fluid-filled cyst. Hmm, what could that be?\n\nThe MRI findings make me think of something like a chordoma. Those can occur in the clivus region, near the sphenoid sinus, and have a similar appearance. But let's not forget about other possibilities like a chondrosarcoma or even a metastasis.\n\nOh, and the biopsy results are in. The tissue looks really interesting. There are these 'soap bubble–like' cells in a myxoid background. That's a pretty specific finding. \n\nThese histological features are really pointing towards a chondroblastoma. They're known for having those kinds of cells. But wait, chondroblastomas are usually found in the bones, not the sinuses. Could this be an unusual presentation?\n\nLet's think about other possibilities. Could it be a chondrosarcoma? They can have myxoid areas too. But something about the biopsy findings just doesn't scream chondrosarcoma to me.\n\nWhat about a chordoma? They can occur in this area and have some similar features. But the biopsy findings aren't quite matching up with a classic chordoma.\n\nAlright, let's take a step back. Considering the location, the imaging, and the biopsy results, I'm leaning towards this being a chondroblastoma. It's not the most common place for it, but the 'soap bubble' cells are a big clue.\n\nBut wait, let's not ignore other possibilities. A low-grade chondrosarcoma could also fit, given the myxoid matrix. And we can't completely rule out a chordoma yet either.\n\nIn the end, after going through everything, I think the top differential diagnosis is a chondroblastoma, followed by a low-grade chondrosarcoma, and then a chordoma. That seems to fit best with all the information we have.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the lesion found in the sphenoid sinus, along with a final ranking of the top three possibilities:\n\n1. **Nasal Polyp** - While nasal polyps are common, their occurrence in the sphenoid sinus is unusual.\n2. **Meningioma** - Given the potential communication with intracranial spaces, a meningioma is a consideration.\n3. **Chordoma** - These tumors can occur in the clivus region near the sphenoid sinus and have characteristic imaging findings.\n4. **Chondrosarcoma** - This could fit given the location and myxoid matrix seen in the biopsy.\n5. **Metastasis** - Though less likely, metastatic lesions can present as destructive masses in the sinuses.\n6. **Mucocele** - This is a possibility for any sinus lesion, but the biopsy findings do not support this.\n7. **Inverting Papilloma** - Typically found in the nasal cavity, but can extend into sinuses; however, the biopsy doesn't match.\n8. **Osteoma** - Common in sinuses, but the imaging and biopsy findings are not consistent with a simple osteoma.\n9. **Hemangioma** - Could present as a vascular mass, but the biopsy findings do not support this.\n10. **Chondroblastoma** - The 'soap bubble–like' cells in a myxoid background are characteristic of this diagnosis.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top three differential diagnoses, in order, are:\n\n1. **Chondroblastoma** - The biopsy findings are highly suggestive of this diagnosis despite its unusual location.\n2. **Low-grade Chondrosarcoma** - This could fit given the myxoid matrix and location, but the biopsy findings lean more towards a chondroblastoma.\n3. **Chordoma** - While chordomas occur in this region, the biopsy findings are not as characteristic for this diagnosis as they are for a chondroblastoma.", "topic": "['Otolaryngology', 'Rhinology and Sinus Disease', 'Trauma and Injury']"}

We've got a man in his 40s with these itchy, poikilodermatous patches and thin plaques. They're in his armpits and groin, and now they're spreading to his flanks. That's interesting. Poikiloderma usually means there's some thinning and discoloration of the skin, so we're dealing with something that affects the skin's texture and color.\n\nFirst off, my mind goes to mycosis fungoides. It's a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and it can definitely cause these kinds of skin changes. It's known for having different stages, from patches to plaques, and even tumors. So, that's a strong possibility.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. There are other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. Like, what about parapsoriasis? It's related to mycosis fungoides but doesn't progress to more severe stages as quickly. It's more of a precursor, really.\n\nNow, thinking about other skin conditions, lupus vulgaris comes to mind. It's a form of skin tuberculosis, and it can cause some serious skin discoloration and scarring. But usually, it's more focused in one area, not as widespread as this.\n\nAnd then there's lichen planus. It's known for its purplish, itchy rashes, but it doesn't typically cause the kind of poikilodermatous changes we're seeing here. So, maybe not that.\n\nOh, and what about sarcoidosis? It can cause skin discoloration and has systemic implications, but it usually comes with other symptoms like lung issues or lymph node involvement, which this patient doesn't have.\n\nNow, let's not forget about drug eruptions. Some medications can cause widespread skin reactions, but they usually have a more sudden onset, and this has been going on for five years. So, that's unlikely.\n\nPityriasis versicolor is another one, but it's more about superficial fungal infections causing discoloration. It doesn't match the atrophic plaques we're seeing.\n\nAnd then there's chronic actinic dermatitis. It's a reaction to sunlight that can cause rashes, but it's usually in sun-exposed areas, and this isn't quite fitting that pattern.\n\nHmm, what about granuloma annulare? It causes skin plaques, but they're usually more localized and don't have the poikilodermatous changes.\n\nLastly, there's necrobiosis lipoidica, which causes yellowish plaques, but it's more common on the shins and doesn't match this case.\n\nSo, after thinking it through, mycosis fungoides is still the top suspect.

Her family history was notable for hypertension, and no other systemic diseases were reported. On physical examination, her blood pressure was 115/76 mm Hg, heart rate was regular at 72 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation level was 98% on room air. The patient was afebrile. Physical examination also revealed mild bibasilar crackles and jugular venous distention, and no murmurs or lower extremity edema. Laboratory test results demonstrated an elevated troponin, and the 12-lead electrocardiogram showed marked ST-segment elevations in leads V2 to V5 (Figure, A). The ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) pager was activated, and the patient was transferred urgently to the catheterization laboratory.

A woman in her 60s comes in with sudden chest pain. It's dull and pressure-like, and it's radiating to her left arm. That's pretty concerning. She's also feeling nauseous and sweaty. These are classic heart attack symptoms, right? Especially with her history of hypertension and high cholesterol. I'm immediately thinking about acute coronary syndrome, maybe a STEMI. \n\nBut wait, she had a coronary angiogram just a year ago, and it showed only mild issues. That's interesting. Could it still be a heart attack? Definitely possible, especially with these symptoms and her risk factors. \n\nNow, let's look at the physical exam. Her blood pressure and heart rate are okay, but she's got some crackles in her lungs and jugular venous distention. That could mean some heart failure or fluid overload. Hmm, that's something to keep in mind. \n\nThe lab results show elevated troponin. That's a big red flag for heart muscle damage. And the ECG shows ST-segment elevations in leads V2 to V5. That's a classic sign of a STEMI, specifically in the area of the heart supplied by the left anterior descending artery. \n\nSo, I'm thinking STEMI is still high on the list. But let's not jump to conclusions. What else could it be? Maybe aortic dissection? That can cause chest pain too, but it usually has different symptoms and wouldn't typically cause these ECG changes. \n\nPrinzmetal's angina could be another possibility. That's when coronary spasms cause chest pain, and it can happen even without significant blockages. It could explain the sudden pain and ECG changes. \n\nBut what about pulmonary embolism? It can cause chest pain and shortness of breath, but usually, the ECG would show different changes, like an S1Q3T3 pattern. \n\nLet's not forget about myocarditis. It can cause chest pain and elevated troponin, but it's often related to recent illness or fever, which she doesn't have. \n\nAnd then there's esophageal spasm. It can cause chest pain that feels like a heart attack, but it wouldn't cause troponin to rise or show these specific ECG changes. \n\nOkay, so after thinking it through, I'm still leaning towards a STEMI as the most likely diagnosis. But Prinzmetal's angina is a close second. It fits the symptoms and the fact that her previous angiogram was relatively clear. \n\nIn the end, I think it's a STEMI, but with the possibility of Prinzmetal's angina. That seems to make the most sense given everything we know.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is a STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction). The symptoms of sudden onset chest pain radiating to the left arm, nausea, diaphoresis, elevated troponin levels, and ST-segment elevations in leads V2 to V5 on the ECG are classic indicators of a STEMI. While Prinzmetal's angina is a consideration due to the patient's history and symptoms, the acute presentation and significant ECG findings strongly point towards a STEMI. Other possibilities like aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, myocarditis, and esophageal spasm are less likely given the specific combination of symptoms and test results. Therefore, the top differential diagnosis is:\n\n1. **STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction)**\n\nOther considerations, in order of likelihood, are:\n\n2. **Prinzmetal's Angina**\n3. **Aortic Dissection**\n4. **Pulmonary Embolism**\n5. **Myocarditis**\n6. **Esophageal Spasm**\n7. **Unstable Angina**\n8. **Cardiac Tamponade**\n9. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy**\n10. **Coronary Artery Dissection**\n\nThese differential diagnoses take into account the patient's symptoms, medical history, and test results, with STEMI being the most probable diagnosis.", "topic": "['Obstetrics and Gynecology', 'Pregnancy', 'Obstetrics', \"Women's Health\", 'Cardiology']"}

And no blood in the urine or any weight loss, so that's something to note.\n\nNow, looking at his past surgeries, he had a big one 14 years ago where they had to remove his spleen after some kind of trauma. That's a big deal, but does it relate to what's happening now? Maybe, maybe not. We'll keep it in mind.\n\nWhen we examine him, he seems pretty comfortable, not in any acute distress. His vitals are stable, and there's just some mild tenderness in the upper belly area. No big red flags there.\n\nThe lab results are a bit of a mixed bag. His kidney function looks normal, which is good. But there's this elevated white blood cell count with a lot of neutrophils. That's usually a sign of some kind of infection or inflammation, right? But then the urinalysis is totally clear—no signs of infection there.\n\nNow, let's talk about the CT scan. It shows a well-defined mass with something dense in the center that's causing some kind of streak artifact. That sounds like it could be a kidney stone, but it's not behaving like a typical stone. It's not causing any blockage or infection signs.\n\nSo, what could this be? Let's start with the obvious. Kidney stones are a possibility given his history, but the lack of typical symptoms throws me off. What about something like a renal cell carcinoma? That could explain the mass, but usually, there are more symptoms or changes in the blood work.\n\nAn abscess could explain the elevated white blood cells, but there's no fever or significant pain. And the urinalysis is clean, which doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe it's something related to his past splenectomy. Could there be a splenosis-related issue? That's when splenic tissue implants elsewhere, and it might cause a mass. But would it cause these symptoms?\n\nLet's not forget about angiomyolipomas. They're benign kidney tumors that could show up like this on a CT. They have that mix of fat and dense components that might cause artifacts.\n\nOh, and what about an oncocytoma? That's another kind of benign kidney tumor. They can have a central scar and appear well-circumscribed like this mass.\n\nAs I think about it more, the oncocytoma seems to fit well. It's benign, which matches the lack of aggressive symptoms, and the imaging characteristics line up.\n\nSo, after going through everything, I'm leaning towards renal oncocytoma as the most likely explanation.

The abnormal imaging findings improved on subsequent MRIs without treatment. Surveillance pituitary MRIs remained stable. Four years later, MRI results (Figure) revealed bilateral T1 and T2 low-intensity intraconal soft tissue masses with avid enhancement on postcontrast images. The optic nerves were encased with no evidence of infiltration of the nerves, vascular structures, or extraocular muscles. She reported the sensation of eye fullness and denied pain. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Her pupils were symmetric and responded to light and near effort; there was no relative afferent pupillary defect. The results of testing with an Amsler grid and Ishihara color plates were normal. Her visual fields were full to confrontation. The optic nerves and retina were normal bilaterally. There was bilateral periorbital swelling and proptosis. Exophthalmometry measurements on a base of 92 were 17 mm on the right and 19 mm on the left. Applanation tonometry results were 12 mm Hg on the right and 15 mm Hg on the left. Extraocular motility examination results revealed substantial (−3) deficits in both eyes. The remainder of the neurologic examination results were normal. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Erdheim-Chester disease", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 60-year-old woman who's been dealing with some eye issues. She's got this feeling of fullness in her eyes, some swelling, and her eyes are bulging out a bit. That's definitely something to pay attention to. She's also having trouble moving her eyes around, which is concerning.\n\nNow, the MRI shows these masses in her orbits. They're low intensity on T1 and T2, and they're enhancing a lot after contrast. That sounds like something vascular, maybe. And they're encasing the optic nerves but not infiltrating them, which is interesting. No pain, though, which is a bit of a relief.\n\nSo, what could this be? Let's start with the obvious. Thyroid eye disease is a big one. It's common and can cause a lot of these symptoms, especially the proptosis and motility issues. But, there's no mention of thyroid problems in her history, so maybe that's not it.\n\nOrbital lymphoma could be another possibility. It can cause these kinds of masses and swelling. But, usually, there are more systemic symptoms, and she doesn't seem to have those.\n\nWhat about idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome? That can cause proptosis and motility issues too. But, it often comes with pain, and she's not reporting any. Hmm, maybe not that.\n\nLet's think about infections. Orbital cellulitis is one, but she's not showing signs of an infection like fever or discharge. And there's no history of trauma, so that's probably not it.\n\nCould it be something like sarcoidosis? That can cause orbital masses and systemic issues. But, there's no mention of respiratory problems or other systemic symptoms, so maybe not.\n\nWhat about a carotid-cavernous fistula? That's a vascular issue that can cause proptosis and motility problems. But, she's not reporting any bruit or pulsatile tinnitus, so that seems unlikely.\n\nLet's not forget about neoplasms. Orbital metastasis could cause these symptoms, but there's no history of cancer, so that's a stretch.\n\nAnd then there's this history of Lyme disease. Could that be related? Lyme disease can cause all sorts of issues, but orbital involvement is rare. Still, it's something to consider.\n\nOkay, let's put it all together. Based on the imaging and her symptoms, thyroid eye disease seems like a strong possibility, even without a known thyroid issue. But, we can't rule out something like orbital lymphoma or sarcoidosis without more info. And that history of Lyme disease is lingering in my mind. It's a tough call, but I think thyroid eye disease is the most likely, with lymphoma and sarcoidosis as close seconds.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the condition described, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Thyroid Eye Disease** - This is a common cause of proptosis and motility issues, even in the absence of a known thyroid disorder.\n2. **Orbital Lymphoma** - This can present with similar orbital masses and swelling, though systemic symptoms are often present.\n3. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome** - Typically involves pain, which is not present in this case.\n4. **Orbital Cellulitis** - Usually accompanied by signs of infection like fever or discharge, which are absent here.\n5. **Sarcoidosis** - Can cause orbital involvement, but typically includes respiratory or systemic symptoms.\n6. **Carotid-Cavernous Fistula** - A vascular issue that can cause proptosis, but often includes a bruit or pulsatile tinnitus.\n7. **Orbital Metastasis** - Possible, but less likely without a history of cancer.\n8. **Lyme Disease** - Though rare, orbital involvement could be considered given her history.\n9. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)** - A systemic vasculitis that can involve the orbits.\n10. **Orbital Hemangioma** - A vascular lesion that could present as an enhancing mass.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top three differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Thyroid Eye Disease** - Despite no known thyroid issue, it fits the clinical presentation.\n2. **Orbital Lymphoma** - A close second, given the nature of the masses and swelling.\n3. **Sarcoidosis** - Remains a possibility due to the potential for orbital involvement without systemic symptoms.\n\nThese diagnoses align with the imaging findings and clinical symptoms, while also considering the patient's history and the absence of pain.", "topic": "['Hematology', 'Oncology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Hematologic Cancer']"}

Let’s think step by step.\n### INPUT:\nA 45-year-old man was admitted to the hospital following 3 weeks of dysphagia; 1 week of nasal regurgitation, nonproductive cough, and breathy voice; and a 25-pound weight loss over the preceding 2 months. He had been diagnosed a year earlier with HIV infection and hepatic tuberculosis. Baseline CD4 count was 7 cells/μL, and following treatment with HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) consisting of dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate, he achieved full virological suppression; however, CD4 counts remained low at 31 cells/μL. He had completed 12 months of directly observed therapy with ethambutol, moxifloxacin, and rifabutin—a liver-sparing regimen—owing to toxic effects from the first-line regimen 1 month prior to admission. Physical examination revealed evidence of perforation of the hard palate (Figure, A). A computed tomographic scan of the chest revealed necrotic lymph nodes, and a palatine biopsy was performed (Figure, B and C). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Histoplasmosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 45-year-old guy who's been having a tough time swallowing, and he's also been regurgitating through his nose. That's not all; he's got a cough that's not bringing anything up, and his voice sounds kind of breathy. Plus, he's lost 25 pounds over the last couple of months. That's a lot of weight. He's got a history of HIV, and his CD4 count is super low, which means his immune system is really compromised. He's been on treatment for hepatic tuberculosis, so that's in the mix too.\n\nFirst off, with that low CD4 count, we're definitely in the territory of opportunistic infections. HIV-associated issues are on the table. Let's start with something like esophageal candidiasis. It's common in people with low CD4 counts and can cause swallowing problems. But wait, the nasal regurgitation and breathy voice are making me think of something that affects the palate or the nasal passages. Hmm, maybe we're looking at something like a fungal infection, such as mucormycosis. It's aggressive and can invade tissues, which might explain the palate perforation.\n\nBut let's not jump to conclusions. We should consider other possibilities. Necrotic lymph nodes showed up on the CT scan, which could mean something like tuberculosis is still lurking around. Especially with his history, TB lymphadenitis is a strong contender. It can cause necrosis and might be related to the palate issue.\n\nOh, and there's the biopsy. I wonder what that showed. If there are any granulomas or acid-fast bacilli, that would point us towards TB. But if we see broad, non-septate hyphae, we're likely dealing with mucormycosis. That would fit with the tissue invasion and perforation.\n\nNow, let's think about other infections. With his low CD4 count, he's at risk for all sorts of things. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis is possible, but it usually causes diarrhea, not these specific symptoms. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) could cause esophageal ulcers, but would it explain the nasal symptoms and palate perforation? Probably not.\n\nWhat about bacterial infections? Bacterial esophagitis could be an option, but it doesn't usually cause these kinds of nasal and palatal issues. And then there's the possibility of a malignancy, like Kaposi's sarcoma or lymphoma. They can cause lesions, but would they lead to this specific set of symptoms? It's possible, but seems less likely.\n\nLet's not forget about treatment effects. HAART can sometimes cause lipodystrophy, which affects fat distribution, but that's not what's happening here. And the liver-sparing TB regimen he was on could have effects, but they wouldn't explain the palate perforation.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Based on everything, TB lymphadenitis seems like a strong possibility. It fits with the necrotic lymph nodes and his history. But we can't rule out mucormycosis yet. The tissue invasion and palate perforation are classic signs. Let's keep both of those high on the list.\n\nAfter thinking it through, here's the order of our differential diagnoses: TB lymphadenitis, mucormycosis, esophageal candidiasis, CMV colitis, HSV esophagitis, bacterial esophagitis, Kaposi's sarcoma, lymphoma, cryptococcosis, and finally, aspergillosis. That seems to cover all the bases given his symptoms and history.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, considering his symptoms, medical history, and test results:\n\n1. **TB Lymphadenitis** - Given the patient's history of tuberculosis and the presence of necrotic lymph nodes on the CT scan, TB lymphadenitis is a strong contender. It aligns with his past medical history and could explain the necrotic lymph nodes.\n\n2. **Mucormycosis** - This aggressive fungal infection can cause tissue invasion and is consistent with the palate perforation observed in the patient. It's a likely cause given the patient's immunocompromised state.\n\n3. **Esophageal Candidiasis** - Common in individuals with low CD4 counts, esophageal candidiasis can cause dysphagia. However, it doesn't typically cause nasal regurgitation or palate perforation.\n\n4. **CMV Colitis** - While cytomegalovirus can cause significant issues in immunocompromised patients, it usually presents with diarrhea rather than the symptoms described.\n\n5. **HSV Esophagitis** - Herpes simplex virus can cause esophageal ulcers, but it's less likely to result in nasal symptoms and palate perforation.\n\n6. **Bacterial Esophagitis** - This could cause dysphagia, but it's unlikely to lead to the specific combination of nasal and palatal symptoms seen here.\n\n7. **Kaposi's Sarcoma** - A possibility in HIV patients, but it typically presents with lesions and not the acute symptoms of nasal regurgitation and breathy voice.\n\n8. **Lymphoma** - Another malignancy that can occur in HIV patients, but it's less likely to cause this specific set of symptoms.\n\n9. **Cryptococcosis** - Usually affects the lungs or central nervous system and doesn't fit well with the current symptoms.\n\n10. **Aspergillosis** - A fungal infection that can be aggressive in immunocompromised individuals, but it's less likely given the specific symptoms and findings.\n\nThese diagnoses are ordered based on how well they align with the patient's symptoms, history, and test results, with TB lymphadenitis and mucormycosis being the top considerations.", "topic": "['Infectious Diseases', 'HIV', 'Otolaryngology', 'Swallowing and Dysphagia', 'Fungal Infections']"}

Her history also included chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and a 14-pack-year smoking history. She initially presented 3 months prior with upper respiratory symptoms, which continued to worsen despite oral antibiotic therapy. Her cough became productive with white, frothy phlegm that was accompanied by fever, wheezing, hoarseness, and fatigue. Her dyspnea worsened in the supine position. Flexible laryngotracheoscopy results revealed diffuse, white-to-yellow pseudomembranous changes involving the glottis and supraglottis (Figure, A), posterior tracheal wall, and left mainstem bronchus with skip lesions in the subglottis and distal 1 cm of the trachea (Figure, B). Glottic mobility was limited in both abduction and adduction with substantial airway obstruction. Computed tomographic findings revealed posterior tracheal wall thickening with the loss of the fat plane between the trachea and esophagus, and a moderate to severe obstruction within the distal left mainstem bronchus. Biopsy results are shown in Figure, C. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Aspergillosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her 60s who's had a kidney transplant not too long ago, about 9 months back. She's dealing with end-stage renal disease, so her immune system is probably not at its best. Now, she's been coughing, having trouble breathing, and her voice is hoarse. That's a lot right there. She's also got a history of GERD and has smoked a bit over the years. Hmm, that could play into this.\n\nShe's been sick for a while, like 3 months, and antibiotics didn't help. That's a red flag for something more complex, maybe not your run-of-the-mill infection. Her symptoms are getting worse, and she's coughing up this white, frothy stuff. Fever, wheezing, and fatigue too? This is sounding like a stubborn infection or maybe something fungal.\n\nThe laryngoscopy shows these white-to-yellow membranes in her throat and trachea. That's pretty distinctive. Pseudomembranes make me think of something like diphtheria or a fungal infection, maybe candida or aspergillus. And with her being immunocompromised, that's definitely possible.\n\nThe CT scan shows the trachea is thickened, and there's some obstruction in her left bronchus. That's serious. It could mean the infection or whatever this is has caused some swelling or even structural changes.\n\nNow, let's think about what's most likely. Given her transplant and immunosuppression, fungal infections are a big concern. Candida or aspergillus could fit, but wait, those pseudomembranes are really making me think of diphtheria too. It's not common, but it can happen in adults, especially if her vaccination is not up to date.\n\nOkay, let's not forget bacterial causes. Pseudomembranous tracheobronchitis can be bacterial, and with her history, maybe something like Klebsiella. But the lack of response to antibiotics is puzzling unless it's a resistant strain or the wrong type of antibiotic was used.\n\nOh, and what about viral causes? She's immunocompromised, so viruses like CMV could be at play. They can cause some weird respiratory symptoms and might explain the persistent nature of her illness.\n\nLet's not jump to conclusions yet. We need to consider everything. Tuberculosis could cause some of these symptoms, especially with the cavitary lesions, but it doesn't quite fit with the pseudomembranes.\n\nAnd then there's the possibility of a mixed infection. With her compromised state, she could have more than one pathogen involved. That might explain why she's not getting better.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Initially, I thought diphtheria because of the pseudomembranes, but we can't ignore the possibility of a fungal infection like candida or aspergillus. Bacterial causes like Klebsiella are still on the table, and we shouldn't forget about CMV or even TB. A mixed infection is also a possibility. It's a complex case, and we need to consider all angles.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, considering her history and symptoms:\n\n1. **Diphtheria** - The presence of pseudomembranes in the respiratory tract is highly suggestive of diphtheria, especially in an adult who may not be up-to-date with vaccinations.\n\n2. **Candida Infection** - Given the patient's immunocompromised state due to her kidney transplant, a fungal infection like candida could explain the pseudomembranous changes.\n\n3. **Aspergillus Infection** - Another fungal pathogen that could cause similar respiratory symptoms and pseudomembranes in an immunocompromised host.\n\n4. **Pseudomembranous Tracheobronchitis (Bacterial)** - Bacterial causes, such as Klebsiella, could lead to pseudomembranous formations, especially if there's antibiotic resistance or an inappropriate treatment regimen.\n\n5. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection** - CMV can cause respiratory symptoms in immunocompromised individuals and might contribute to the persistent nature of her illness.\n\n6. **Tuberculosis** - Although it doesn't typically present with pseudomembranes, TB could cause cavitary lesions and respiratory symptoms, especially in someone with a compromised immune system.\n\n7. **Mixed Infection** - The possibility of a mixed infection involving more than one pathogen should be considered, given the complexity of her symptoms and her immunocompromised state.\n\n8. **Chronic Mucormycosis** - A fungal infection that could cause necrotic lesions in the respiratory tract, particularly in someone with a weakened immune system.\n\n9. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection** - HSV could cause respiratory symptoms and mucosal lesions in an immunocompromised patient, though it's less common.\n\n10. **Bacterial Tracheitis** - A severe bacterial infection of the trachea that could cause symptoms similar to those presented, including obstruction and pseudomembrane formation.\n\nReranking these differentials based on the patient's symptoms, history, and test results, the top three considerations would be:\n\n1. **Diphtheria** - The pseudomembranes are a strong indicator.\n2. **Candida Infection** - The immunocompromised state and pseudomembranous changes make this a likely candidate.\n3. **Mixed Infection** - The complexity and persistence of symptoms suggest more than one pathogen could be involved.\n\nThese three options best explain the combination of symptoms, the presence of pseudomembranes, and the patient's underlying health conditions. Further testing and culture results would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.", "topic": "['Otolaryngology', 'Transplantation', 'Laryngology', 'Nephrology', 'Renal Replacement']"}

Her local dentist had prescribed an antibiotic and performed a tooth extraction in the area 6 months prior with no improvement in symptoms. Ultimately, her pain became persistent and radiated to the right lower lip. She had a history of stage IV endometrial serous adenocarcinoma (ESA) 4 years prior that was treated with total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, and peritoneal lavage. She had developed a recurrence for which she had just completed 3 cycles of treatment with carboplatin. She also had a history of anxiety, hypertension, and pterygium, and she was taking gabapentin, lorazepam, prochlorperazine, metoprolol succinate, bromfenac and ketorolac ophthalmic solution, and aprepitant. Intraoral examination revealed a 1.5 × 1.0-cm firm, erythematous gingival mass in the area of missing right mandibular second bicuspid and first molar with buccal and lingual expansion (Figure 1A). The right mandibular first bicuspid was grade 3 mobile. A periapical radiograph was obtained, and results showed a diffuse, poorly demarcated radiolucency measuring approximately 1.2 × 0.8 cm (Figure 1B). Findings from an incisional biopsy of the mass showed an infiltrative tumor (Figure 1C). Tumor cells were positive for CK7, PAX8, and WT-1, and negative for CK20 and TTF-1 (Figure 1C, inset). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Oral metastasis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 59-year-old Hispanic woman who's been dealing with some pretty annoying pain in her right posterior mandibular gingiva for the past six months. That's quite a while to be in pain, and it's now radiating to her lower lip. That sounds uncomfortable. Her dentist tried antibiotics and even pulled a tooth, but nothing's changed. That's a red flag for something more serious, don't you think?\n\nNow, she's got a history of stage IV endometrial serous adenocarcinoma, which she had treated a few years ago. But she's had a recurrence and has just finished three cycles of carboplatin. That's a pretty big deal and definitely something to keep in mind. Plus, she's on a bunch of medications, including gabapentin and lorazepam, which could be affecting her symptoms or interactions.\n\nWhen we look inside her mouth, there's this firm, red mass in her gum where her teeth were extracted. It's about 1.5 by 1.0 cm, and it's causing her gum to expand both outward and inward. That doesn't sound typical for a benign issue. And the tooth next to it is really loose, which isn't a good sign.\n\nThe X-ray shows a diffuse, poorly defined dark area, about 1.2 by 0.8 cm. That kind of radiolucency often makes me think of something aggressive, maybe malignant. So, we're definitely leaning towards something serious here.\n\nThe biopsy results are really telling. The tumor cells are positive for CK7, PAX8, and WT-1, but negative for CK20 and TTF-1. That's a pretty specific profile. It's pointing towards a metastatic tumor, likely from her endometrial primary. That's consistent with her history.\n\nSo, let's think about what this could be. Initially, I thought about metastatic endometrial adenocarcinoma because of her history and the immunohistochemical profile. But let's not jump to conclusions too quickly.\n\nCould it be something like a primary gingival squamous cell carcinoma? That's possible, but the IHC results don't really fit. We should keep looking.\n\nWhat about a salivary gland tumor, like mucoepidermoid carcinoma? It's in the right area, but again, the IHC profile doesn't match up. Let's put that aside for now.\n\nMaybe it's a malignant fibrous histiocytoma or some kind of sarcoma. Those can occur in the jaw, but the IHC results are more in line with an epithelial origin. So, probably not that.\n\nLet's not forget about lymphoma. It can show up in the gingiva, but the IHC results don't support that either. We can likely rule that out.\n\nCould it be a clear cell sarcoma? That's a long shot, but the IHC results don't really support it. Let's move on.\n\nWhat about a poorly differentiated carcinoma? That's a broad category, but it could fit. The IHC results are more specific, though, so let's keep that in mind.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about the possibility of a metastatic tumor from another site, like the breast or kidney. Those can show similar IHC profiles. We should consider that.\n\nIn the end, after thinking it through, metastatic endometrial adenocarcinoma seems like the most likely diagnosis. The history, the IHC profile, and the clinical presentation all point in that direction. But we should definitely keep an open mind and consider other possibilities like a metastatic breast carcinoma or renal cell carcinoma. It's always good to double-check.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the case:\n\n1. **Metastatic Endometrial Adenocarcinoma** - Given the patient's history of stage IV endometrial serous adenocarcinoma and the immunohistochemical profile (positive for CK7, PAX8, and WT-1, negative for CK20 and TTF-1), this is a strong consideration.\n\n2. **Primary Gingival Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - Although this is a common oral malignancy, the immunohistochemical results do not support this diagnosis.\n\n3. **Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma** - A type of salivary gland tumor, but the IHC profile doesn't align with this diagnosis.\n\n4. **Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma** - A sarcoma that can occur in the jaw, but the epithelial origin suggested by IHC results makes this less likely.\n\n5. **Lymphoma** - Can present in the gingiva, but the IHC findings are not consistent with lymphoma.\n\n6. **Clear Cell Sarcoma** - Unlikely, as the IHC results do not support this diagnosis.\n\n7. **Poorly Differentiated Carcinoma** - A broad category, but the specific IHC profile points towards a more defined diagnosis.\n\n8. **Metastatic Breast Carcinoma** - Could show similar IHC positivity for CK7 and WT-1, making it a consideration.\n\n9. **Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma** - Also a possibility due to similar IHC characteristics, particularly with PAX8 positivity.\n\n10. **Ameloblastic Carcinoma** - A rare odontogenic tumor, but the IHC profile doesn't match this diagnosis.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are **Metastatic Endometrial Adenocarcinoma**, **Metastatic Breast Carcinoma**, and **Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma**, given the immunohistochemical profile and clinical history.

The mass was visible as a clear blue lesion in the floor of the mouth and was nontender. Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the neck with IV contrast was performed (Figure). The patient was taken to the operating room for a successful combined intraoral and transcervical approach to excision. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Epidermoid cyst", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her 30s with a neck mass that's been growing slowly over the past year. It's painless, which is interesting, and it's right in the middle of her neck. That's a good sign it might not be something too serious, like an infection or cancer, since those often hurt or come with other symptoms.\n\nThe mass is soft, mobile, and compressible. That's a big clue. These characteristics usually mean it's benign, maybe something like a cyst. It's also in level IA of the neck, which is right in the midline. That's a common spot for certain types of cysts.\n\nNow, let's think about what kind of cysts typically show up in this area. Thyroglossal duct cysts are pretty common and they fit the bill. They're usually midline or close to it, and they move when you stick your tongue out. That's because they're connected to the tongue or the hyoid bone.\n\nThe fact that the mass is a clear blue lesion in the floor of the mouth is another piece of the puzzle. That sounds like a cyst filled with fluid, which would make sense for a thyroglossal duct cyst.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions too fast. There are other possibilities. Lymphatic malformations, like cystic hygromas, can also be soft and compressible. They're not as common in adults, but they can happen. And then there are dermoid cysts, which are also benign and can appear in the midline.\n\nOh, and we can't forget about epidermoid cysts. They're usually a bit more superficial, but they can show up in the midline too. And then there are the rarer possibilities, like a plunging ranula or even a laryngocele, though those are less likely.\n\nOkay, let's look at the CT scan results. If it shows a well-defined, fluid-filled lesion, that would really point to a thyroglossal duct cyst.

But I'm keeping dermoid cyst and epidermoid cyst in mind as possibilities too, just in case.\n\nSo, here's my final list of differential diagnoses, in order of how likely they are: thyroglossal duct cyst, dermoid cyst, epidermoid cyst, cystic hygroma, plunging ranula, laryngocele, and a few other rare possibilities.

We've got a preschool boy with some interesting skin stuff going on. He's got these reddish, raised spots over his right ear that he hasn't seemed to notice much. They showed up about three months ago, and now there are these swellings on the same side of his neck. They're not painful, which is curious.\n\nFirst off, the location and appearance of these skin lesions make me think of something like molluscum contagiosum. It's pretty common in kids and can cause those kinds of bumps. But, usually, molluscum contagiosum is more widespread and not necessarily tied to one side of the body. Plus, it doesn't typically cause lymph node swelling. So, maybe that's not it.\n\nNext, let's consider viral exanthems. Kids get all sorts of viral infections that can cause rashes. These rashes can sometimes be unilateral, but they often come with other symptoms like fever or a more widespread rash. This kid doesn't have any of those symptoms, so it seems less likely.\n\nNow, what about dermatitis? It could cause red, raised lesions, and sometimes it's just in one area. But, usually, there's some itching or scaling, and this kid's lesions are described as asymptomatic. So, dermatitis might not be the best fit.\n\nOh, and there's the possibility of a congenital condition like a port-wine stain. These are vascular birthmarks, and they can definitely be unilateral. But, they're usually there from birth, not showing up at this age. Plus, they don't typically cause lymphadenopathy. So, that's probably not it either.\n\nLet's think about infections. Tuberculosis is known for causing skin lesions and lymph node swelling, but it's pretty rare in this age group and usually comes with other symptoms. Still, it's something to keep in mind.\n\nNow, what about lymphoma? It can cause lymphadenopathy, but it's pretty rare in preschoolers, and you'd expect more systemic symptoms. So, that seems unlikely.\n\nHmm, maybe a vascular tumor like a hemangioma? These can cause red, raised lesions and might be associated with lymphadenopathy if there's significant tissue involvement. But, they usually appear earlier in life, so this is a bit odd.\n\nLet's not forget about discoid lupus erythematosus. It can cause scaly, red plaques and might involve the lymph nodes. But, it's rare in young children, and we don't have other typical lupus symptoms here.\n\nOh, and there's the idea of a sarcoidosis-like condition. This could cause skin lesions and lymphadenopathy, but it's pretty rare in kids this age. Still, it's worth considering.\n\nFinally, let's think about Langerhans cell histiocytosis. It can cause skin lesions and lymphadenopathy, and it might fit with the histological findings. This seems like a strong possibility given the symptoms and the age of the child.\n\nSo, after going through all of this, I think Langerhans cell histiocytosis is the most likely diagnosis. It matches the skin and lymph node findings, and it's consistent with what we might see in a child this age. Yeah, that seems to make the most sense.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the preschool boy's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Molluscum Contagiosum** - This viral infection is common in children and can cause raised lesions, but it typically doesn't lead to lymphadenopathy.\n\n2. **Viral Exanthem** - Various viral infections can cause rashes in children, but they often come with additional symptoms like fever or a more widespread rash.\n\n3. **Dermatitis** - This could cause red, raised lesions, but usually involves itching or scaling, which is not present in this case.\n\n4. **Port-Wine Stain** - A congenital vascular birthmark that is usually present from birth and doesn't typically cause lymphadenopathy.\n\n5. **Tuberculosis** - Known for causing skin lesions and lymph node swelling, but it's rare in this age group and often comes with other symptoms.\n\n6. **Lymphoma** - Can cause lymphadenopathy, but it's rare in preschoolers and typically involves more systemic symptoms.\n\n7. **Hemangioma** - A vascular tumor that can cause red, raised lesions, but usually appears earlier in life.\n\n8. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus** - Can cause scaly, red plaques and may involve lymph nodes, but it's rare in young children.\n\n9. **Sarcoidosis-like Condition** - Could cause skin lesions and lymphadenopathy, but it's uncommon in children this age.\n\n10. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis** - This condition can cause skin lesions and lymphadenopathy, and it aligns well with the child's symptoms and age.\n\nAfter considering all the possibilities, **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis** emerges as the most likely diagnosis, given the combination of skin and lymph node findings in a child of this age.", "topic": "['Otolaryngology', 'Pediatrics', 'Tuberculosis', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Dermatology']"}

The onset was gradual and started on the lower extremities and gradually extended to involve the lower trunk. The rash was associated with mild discomfort. The patient denied itching, weeping, or bleeding from the rash. She denied any constitutional symptoms (weight loss, fever, night sweats), joint pains, history of blood in urine, periorbital edema, and recent intake of medications or herbal medications. Social history was significant for 25 pack-years of smoking. Physical examination revealed multiple well-defined, coalescent, erythematous, palpable, purpuralike lesions that were predominantly present over the trunk and lower extremities (Figure, A and B). Laboratory test results at presentation included a hemoglobin level of 11.2 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10), mean corpuscular volume of 84 fL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 72 mm/h, and a lactate dehydrogenase level of 412 IU/L. Hepatic and renal function levels were within normal limits. Complement levels were normal. Hepatitis B and C and HIV profiles were negative. A chest radiograph showed a 2-cm lesion in the upper lobe of the left lung. A computed tomographic scan of the chest showed a spiculated mass in the same region along with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. An ultrasound of the abdomen showed bilateral adrenal masses. A lesional skin biopsy specimen was obtained (Figure, C). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 70-year-old woman with a rash on her lower legs and it's spreading. It's not itchy, but it's uncomfortable. Hmm, that's interesting. The rash is made up of these red, palpable spots that look like purpura. And she's got some swelling in her legs too. \n\nNow, let's see what the tests say. Her hemoglobin is a bit low, and there's an elevated ESR and LDH. That suggests some inflammation or maybe hemolysis going on. But her liver and kidney functions are normal, and complement levels are fine too. That's good to know. \n\nOh, and she's negative for hepatitis B and C, and HIV. That's a relief because those can cause skin issues too. \n\nNow, the big red flag is the lung lesion and mediastinal lymph nodes. That's concerning for cancer, maybe lung cancer. And there are adrenal masses too. Could this be a paraneoplastic syndrome? \n\nLet's think about what could cause this kind of rash. Erythema nodosum comes to mind, but that's usually painful and not purpuralike. Vasculitis could be a possibility, especially with the lung involvement. \n\nBut wait, the lung lesion and lymph nodes are making me think of a malignancy. Could this be a paraneoplastic phenomenon? Maybe something like Sweet's syndrome or necrolytic migratory erythema? \n\nSweet's syndrome could fit, with the erythematous nodules and systemic signs, but it's not typically purpuralike. And necrolytic migratory erythema is more associated with glucagonoma, which doesn't quite match the lung findings. \n\nAlright, let's not forget about the possibility of a hematologic disorder. With the anemia and elevated LDH, maybe a blood cancer like lymphoma or leukemia? \n\nHmm, what about angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma? It can cause skin changes and systemic symptoms. But the lung mass is still bugging me. \n\nLet's consider other types of vasculitis, like polyarteritis nodosa. It can cause skin lesions and systemic issues, but usually, there are other symptoms too. \n\nOh, and there's also IgA vasculitis, but that's more common in children and often has abdominal and joint involvement. \n\nNow, thinking about the lung mass again, could it be a primary lung cancer with a paraneoplastic vasculitis? That would explain the skin findings and the lung lesion. \n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. We need to think about other possibilities too. What about a skin condition like lichen planus? It can cause purpuralike lesions, but it's usually more papular and doesn't explain the lung findings. \n\nAlright, let's put it all together. Considering the lung mass, lymph nodes, and skin findings, I'm leaning towards a paraneoplastic vasculitis related to lung cancer. But we should keep other options like angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma in mind too. \n\nIn the end, I think the most likely diagnosis is paraneoplastic vasculitis from lung cancer, with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma as a close second. Let's see what the biopsy says to confirm this.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with a focus on the key findings and potential underlying causes:\n\n1. **Erythema Nodosum** - This condition is characterized by painful, red nodules typically on the shins, but the lack of pain and purpuralike appearance in this case make it less likely.\n\n2. **Vasculitis** - The presence of purpuralike lesions and systemic involvement, such as the lung lesion and lymphadenopathy, suggests a possible vasculitic process.\n\n3. **Sweet's Syndrome** - This condition involves painful erythematous nodules and systemic symptoms, but the purpuralike nature of the rash and lung findings are atypical.\n\n4. **Necrolytic Migratory Erythema** - Associated with glucagonoma, this doesn't align well with the lung mass and other findings.\n\n5. **Paraneoplastic Vasculitis** - The combination of skin findings and lung mass with lymphadenopathy strongly suggests a paraneoplastic phenomenon related to a potential lung malignancy.\n\n6. **Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma** - This condition can cause skin changes and systemic symptoms, but the lung mass is more suggestive of a primary lung pathology.\n\n7. **Polyarteritis Nodosa** - A type of vasculitis that can cause skin lesions and systemic issues, but usually presents with more widespread symptoms.\n\n8. **IgA Vasculitis** - More common in children and typically involves abdominal and joint symptoms, which are absent here.\n\n9. **Lichen Planus** - Can cause purpuralike lesions, but is usually more papular and doesn't explain the lung findings.\n\n10. **Lung Cancer with Skin Metastasis** - The lung mass and skin findings could suggest metastatic disease, but the nature of the rash is more suggestive of a paraneoplastic process.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Paraneoplastic Vasculitis** related to lung cancer, given the lung mass, lymphadenopathy, and purpuralike rash.\n2. **Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma**, considering the skin changes and systemic symptoms, although the lung mass is more indicative of a primary lung issue.\n\nThe final diagnosis will depend on the results of the skin biopsy and further investigations into the lung mass and lymphadenopathy.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Oncology', 'Lung Cancer']"}

His medical history included hepatitis C, cirrhosis, and an orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) 3 years prior that was subsequently treated with tacrolimus, 5 mg, and mycophenolate, 750 mg, twice daily. Approximately 2½ years after the transplant, the patient developed gastric outlet obstruction secondary to an infiltrative gastric wall mass. The gastric wall mass was found to be associated with plasmablastic posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (pPTLD). He was subsequently instructed to stop use of mycophenolate and decrease use of tacrolimus to 0.25 mg daily, then treated with 1 cycle of CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone) and lenalidomide, resulting in symptomatic and radiologic improvement. Five weeks after treatment with CHOP chemotherapy, the patient presented with an acute-onset abdominal skin eruption without fever or pain. A computed tomographic scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed possible abdominal wall cellulitis, so treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin was empirically started. Physical examination revealed confluent indurated violaceous papules and plaques coalescing into an annular pattern encircling the healed OLT incisional scar with central sparing (Figure 1A). A 4-mm punch biopsy specimen was obtained for histopathological evaluation (Figure 1B and C) and bacterial and fungal cultures. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a man in his 50s with a skin eruption on his abdomen. It's been there for a couple of days, and he's got a pretty complex medical history. He's had hepatitis C, cirrhosis, and a liver transplant three years ago. He's on tacrolimus and mycophenolate for that. Oh, and he had some trouble with a gastric mass that turned out to be posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder. That's a mouthful! He stopped mycophenolate and reduced tacrolimus, and then had some chemotherapy and lenalidomide. Quite a bit going on.\n\nNow, about this skin eruption. It's not itchy or painful, and there's no fever. That's interesting. The CT scan suggests cellulitis, so he's on antibiotics, but let's not jump to conclusions. The rash is made up of these violaceous papules and plaques that form a ring around his old transplant scar. That's a pretty distinctive pattern.\n\nFirst, let's think about what this could be. Given his history, a drug reaction seems possible. He's on a lot of medications, and drug reactions can be weird. But wait, the timing is a bit off. He just finished chemotherapy, so maybe it's related to that. Could it be graft-versus-host disease? That's a possibility, but usually, you'd expect more widespread involvement, not just a localized rash.\n\nWhat about infection? He's immunosuppressed, so he's definitely at risk. But there's no fever or systemic symptoms, which makes a severe infection less likely. Hmm, could it be a recurrence of his lymphoproliferative disorder? That's a thought. The rash is near the transplant scar, which is an interesting location.\n\nLet's not forget about erythema multiforme. It can cause target-like lesions, but it's often related to infections or medications. He doesn't have the typical targets, and there's no clear trigger. What about Sweet's syndrome? It can cause papules and plaques, and it's associated with hematological disorders. That fits his history, but the lesions don't quite match.\n\nOkay, let's think about the biopsy. It showed necrotic keratinocytes and a lymphocytic infiltrate. That sounds like a cytotoxic process. Could it be related to his chemotherapy? Maybe. But the pattern is so specific, it's worth considering other options.\n\nLet's go back to the idea of a paraneoplastic phenomenon. His lymphoproliferative disorder could be causing a skin reaction. The location and pattern of the rash are pretty unique, and it's not responding to antibiotics. That makes me think it's not an infection.\n\nSo, what's the most likely explanation? I think it's a paraneoplastic eruption related to his posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder. The timing with his chemotherapy and the distinctive pattern of the rash make sense in that context. Yeah, that seems to fit best with everything we know.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the skin eruption, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Drug Reaction**: Given the patient's complex medication history, a drug reaction is a plausible initial consideration.\n\n2. **Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD)**: Although the patient had a liver transplant, GVHD typically involves more widespread skin involvement and other organ systems.\n\n3. **Infectious Cellulitis**: The CT scan suggests cellulitis, but the lack of fever or systemic symptoms makes this less likely.\n\n4. **Erythema Multiforme**: This condition can cause target-like lesions, often related to infections or medications, but the presentation isn't typical here.\n\n5. **Sweet's Syndrome**: Associated with hematological disorders, but the lesion morphology doesn't perfectly match.\n\n6. **Paraneoplastic Phenomenon**: The rash's unique pattern and lack of response to antibiotics suggest a possible link to the patient's lymphoproliferative disorder.\n\n7. **Viral Exanthem**: Immunocompromised patients can develop viral rashes, but usually, there are more systemic symptoms.\n\n8. **Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN)**: The biopsy shows necrotic keratinocytes, but TEN usually involves more extensive skin detachment.\n\n9. **Lymphomatous Involvement**: Direct infiltration of the skin by the lymphoproliferative disorder is a possibility given the location near the transplant scar.\n\n10. **Chemotherapy-Related Reaction**: The timing with recent chemotherapy suggests a possible cytotoxic reaction, but the specific pattern is atypical.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the most likely diagnosis is a **Paraneoplastic Phenomenon** related to the posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder.

Over the previous 5 months, the patient had experienced gradual onset of binocular, horizontal diplopia and ptosis of the left upper eyelid. There were no neurological deficits and no pain. Her symptoms were constant, without fluctuation during the day. There was no history of trauma or prior surgery of the eye. Her medical history was notable for hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Family history was positive for hypertension in her mother, prostate cancer in her father, and ductal carcinoma in situ in her daughter. She was a current daily smoker at presentation. An ophthalmologic examination revealed a visual acuity of 20/25 OD and 20/30 OS. Pupillary, intraocular pressure, and dilated fundus examinations were unremarkable. Abduction was severely restricted in the left eye, but it did not elicit pain, and extraocular muscle movements were otherwise full. There was substantial resistance to retropulsion of the left eye. Bilateral blepharoptosis, with more severity on the left side, was noted. The margin-to-reflex distance 1 was 2 mm on the right and 0 mm on the left. A 3.5-mm left enophthalmos was noted compared with the right side, and there was hollowing of the left superior sulcus. Testing of cranial nerves V and VII were unremarkable. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Infiltrating lobular breast carcinoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 75-year-old woman who's been dealing with double vision and a droopy eyelid for a few months now. That's quite a while to be experiencing these symptoms, so it's likely something that's been developing over time. Hmm, she's got diabetes and hypertension, and she's a smoker. Those are definitely factors to keep in mind.\n\nNow, she's got horizontal double vision and her left eye just doesn't seem to be moving outward properly. That sounds like it could be a nerve issue, maybe the sixth cranial nerve, which controls lateral eye movement. But there's no pain, which is interesting. Usually, if it was something inflammatory or due to trauma, you'd expect some pain, right?\n\nOh, and there's the droopy eyelid, or ptosis, which is more on the left side. That's a clue! The eyelid droop could be linked to a muscle issue or perhaps something affecting the nerves that control the eyelid. And there's also this enophthalmos, where the eye seems to be sitting back further than normal, and some hollowing of the superior sulcus. That's a bit unusual.\n\nSo, what could be going on here? My first thought is ocular myasthenia gravis. It's known for causing fluctuating muscle weakness, but the lack of fluctuation in her symptoms is a bit odd for myasthenia. Still, it's worth considering.\n\nNext, I'm thinking about a thyroid eye disease. It can cause bulging eyes and muscle issues, but usually, there's some proptosis, not enophthalmos. So, that doesn't quite fit.\n\nHow about a orbital mass or tumor? That could explain the resistance to retropulsion and the enophthalmos. It's like something is taking up space in there, pushing the eye back. That's a strong possibility.\n\nThen there's the idea of a cranial nerve palsies, like a sixth nerve palsy. That would explain the eye movement issue, but not the ptosis or enophthalmos. So, it's not the full picture.\n\nDiabetes could be a factor here too. Diabetic patients can develop nerve palsies, but again, that doesn't explain the ptosis or the changes in the eye's position.\n\nI should also think about Horner's syndrome, which can cause ptosis and enophthalmos. But, it usually comes with some pupil changes, like miosis, which aren't mentioned here. Hmm, maybe it's still worth considering.\n\nAnd what about orbital cellulitis? That's usually painful, though, and she's not experiencing any pain. So, that's probably not it.\n\nChronic orbital inflammation could be a possibility. It might explain the resistance to retropulsion and the enophthalmos, but it's not fitting perfectly with the other symptoms.\n\nNow, let's not forget about aneurysms. An aneurysm could compress nerves and cause these symptoms, but it's a bit of a stretch without more information.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the orbital mass or tumor is the most likely explanation. It accounts for the eye's restricted movement, the ptosis, and the enophthalmos. Yeah, that seems to fit best with what's going on.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's symptoms, with a focus on the key details:\n\n1. **Orbital Mass/Tumor** - This could explain the restricted eye movement, ptosis, enophthalmos, and resistance to retropulsion.\n\n2. **Ocular Myasthenia Gravis** - Although the symptoms don't fluctuate, myasthenia gravis can present with ptosis and eye movement issues.\n\n3. **Thyroid Eye Disease** - Typically causes proptosis, but can involve muscle issues; however, enophthalmos is atypical.\n\n4. **Cranial Nerve (Sixth) Palsy** - Accounts for the eye movement restriction but not the ptosis or enophthalmos.\n\n5. **Diabetic Cranial Nerve Palsy** - Possible given the patient's diabetes, but doesn't explain ptosis or enophthalmos.\n\n6. **Horner's Syndrome** - Could explain ptosis and enophthalmos, but usually includes miosis, which is not present.\n\n7. **Orbital Cellulitis** - Usually painful, which contradicts the patient's symptom of no pain.\n\n8. **Chronic Orbital Inflammation** - Might explain some symptoms, but not the full picture.\n\n9. **Aneurysm** - Could compress nerves, but seems less likely without more supporting information.\n\n10. **Carotid Cavernous Fistula** - Could lead to eye symptoms due to vascular changes, but typically includes other signs like a bruit.\n\nAfter considering all the symptoms and test results, the top differential diagnosis is an **Orbital Mass/Tumor**, as it best explains the combination of symptoms: restricted eye movement, ptosis, enophthalmos, and resistance to retropulsion.

He also reported asthenia, sleep disorders, and urinary frequency. The urinary frequency has been treated for 2 years with many drugs (tamsulosin, desmopressin, and solifenacin) without improvement. The patient had spent his childhood in eastern Africa, where he swam in Lake Tanganyika. His history did not reveal trauma, infection, or any other associated conditions at the onset of the complaints. The ear, nose, and throat examination revealed a right horizontal nystagmus and a poorly delineated hypoesthesia of the left pinna. He could not walk properly owing to his vertigo. The rest of the clinical examination findings were unremarkable. Additional examinations (ie, pure-tone audiometry, video nystagmography, tympanometry) revealed left profound hearing loss with an air-bone gap of 40 dB and central vertigo. Otoacoustic emissions were absent on the left side. There was no left acoustic reflex. Auditory brainstem responses showed asymmetric interpeak latencies of waves I through V and III through V, suggesting slower conduction on the left side. Computed tomography and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 24 × 20-mm hemorrhagic lesion in the left middle cerebellar peduncle associated with a thickening of the cochleovestibular nerve (Figure). The patient was referred to urology, where a 13 × 8-mm mass was discovered in the lateral wall of the prostate gland. Biopsies of prostate and brain lesions, blood tests, and urinalysis were performed. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Schistosomiasis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 46-year-old guy who's been dealing with some pretty tough symptoms. He's African, a swimmer, and has been experiencing hearing loss and vertigo for about a month. That's quite a combination. He's also feeling really tired, having trouble sleeping, and has been visiting the bathroom more often than usual. He's been on medication for the urinary issues for two years, but nothing's working. That's frustrating.\n\nNow, he grew up in eastern Africa and used to swim in Lake Tanganyika. That's interesting because lakes in that region are known for certain health risks. Hmm, could that be relevant? Let's keep it in mind.\n\nWhen we look at his ear, nose, and throat, there's a right horizontal nystagmus and some numbness on the left side of his ear. He's also struggling with balance. That's definitely pointing towards something neurological or maybe something affecting his ear.\n\nThe hearing tests show profound hearing loss on the left side, and there's an air-bone gap. That usually means there's some kind of conductive issue. The absence of otoacoustic emissions and acoustic reflex on the left side adds to the mystery. And the auditory brainstem responses suggest slower conduction on the left. This is all pointing towards a problem with the nerve or the brain.\n\nThe imaging is really telling. There's a hemorrhagic lesion in the left middle cerebellar peduncle and thickening of the cochleovestibular nerve. That's pretty specific. And then there's a mass found in the prostate. That's a lot to take in.\n\nSo, what could be going on here? Let's start with the possibility of a vestibular schwannoma. It's a common cause of these types of auditory and vestibular symptoms. But wait, there's also this prostate mass. That's a curveball.\n\nCould it be neurofibromatosis type 2? That condition can cause schwannomas and other tumors. But it doesn't explain the prostate issue or the hemorrhagic nature of the lesion.\n\nMaybe it's a metastatic tumor? The hemorrhagic lesion and prostate mass could fit that picture. But usually, metastases don't cause this kind of slow nerve conduction.\n\nLet's not forget about the lake. Swimming in Lake Tanganyika could expose someone to schistosomiasis. It's a long shot, but it could cause some neurological symptoms if it spread to the brain.\n\nWhat about meningioma? It could explain the dural-based lesion and the neurological symptoms. But again, the prostate mass is unexplained.\n\nCould it be a hemangioblastoma? Those can be hemorrhagic and are associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease, which can also cause prostate masses. That's a strong contender.\n\nLet's think about lymphoma. It can cause neurological symptoms and might involve the prostate. But usually, there are more systemic symptoms.\n\nOh, and there's the possibility of a primary brain tumor like a glioma. Those can have varied presentations, but the prostate mass is still a mystery.\n\nFinally, let's consider a rare condition like Fabry disease. It can cause neurological symptoms and might explain the systemic issues, but it's a bit of a stretch.\n\nSo, after going through all of this, I think the most likely explanation is a hemangioblastoma associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease. It ties together the hemorrhagic lesion, the prostate mass, and the neurological symptoms. That seems to fit the best.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Vestibular Schwannoma** - This is a common cause of progressive hearing loss and vertigo, and the thickening of the cochleovestibular nerve supports this possibility.\n\n2. **Neurofibromatosis Type 2** - This genetic disorder can lead to the development of schwannomas and other tumors, which aligns with the neurological symptoms and imaging findings.\n\n3. **Metastatic Tumor** - The presence of a hemorrhagic lesion and a prostate mass raises the suspicion of a metastatic process, potentially originating from the prostate.\n\n4. **Schistosomiasis** - Given the patient's history of swimming in Lake Tanganyika, schistosomiasis could be considered, especially if it has spread to the central nervous system.\n\n5. **Meningioma** - This type of tumor could explain the dural-based lesion and neurological symptoms, but the prostate mass remains unexplained.\n\n6. **Hemangioblastoma** - Associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease, this could account for the hemorrhagic lesion and the prostate mass, making it a strong contender.\n\n7. **Lymphoma** - This could potentially cause neurological symptoms and involve the prostate, although systemic symptoms are typically more prominent.\n\n8. **Glioma** - A primary brain tumor like a glioma might explain the varied neurological symptoms, but the prostate mass is not typically associated.\n\n9. **Fabry Disease** - This rare genetic disorder can cause neurological symptoms and systemic issues, but it's less likely given the specific findings.\n\n10. **Prostate Cancer with Brain Metastasis** - This could explain the prostate mass and the brain lesion, but the nature of the lesion and the nerve conduction findings are atypical.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the most likely diagnosis is **Hemangioblastoma associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease**. This diagnosis effectively ties together the hemorrhagic cerebellar lesion, the thickening of the cochleovestibular nerve, and the prostate mass, providing a coherent explanation for the patient's complex symptomatology.", "topic": "['Infectious Diseases', 'Otolaryngology', 'Audiology and Hearing', 'Vestibular Disorders', 'Otology']"}

His comorbidities included congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and a 50-pack-year history of tobacco abuse. Physical examination revealed a firm, nonmobile, nontender, bulging mass situated over the right frontal sinus, which expanded to the upper right eyelid. The mass covered the globe completely, resulting in total vision obstruction (Figure, A). However, the patient’s vision remained intact when the mass was elevated off the eye with great effort. His right pupil was round and reactive to light without afferent pupillary defect. No palpable lymphadenopathy was noted. A non–contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a large, right supraorbital mass with bony destruction of the anterior table of the right frontal sinus (Figure, B). It extended into the superior aspect of the orbit, displacing the right globe inferiorly. Air was seen within the mass (Figure, C). A fine-needle aspiration biopsy yielded inconclusive results. After medical clearance, the patient was taken to the operating room for a wedge excisional biopsy with decompression of the right supraorbital mass under monitored anesthesia care. Histopathological investigation revealed large nests of neoplastic epithelioid cells surrounded by fibrotic tissue and necroinflammatory debris. The neoplastic cells contained round nuclei with single prominent nucleoli and abundant clear to vacuolated cytoplasm (Figure, D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Sebaceous carcinoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a man in his 70s with a mass that's been growing over his right eyebrow for four years. It's firm, doesn't move, and doesn't hurt. That's interesting. It's also covering his eye, but his vision is fine when he lifts it. That's a relief, at least his sight isn't affected yet.\n\nNow, let's see what the CT scan says. There's a big mass, and it's destroying the bone in his frontal sinus. That's not good. It's also pushing into his orbit, moving his eye downward. And there's air in the mass? That's unusual.\n\nThe biopsy didn't give us much to go on, so we need to think about what this could be. Given his age and smoking history, I'm worried about something malignant. Maybe a squamous cell carcinoma or a basal cell carcinoma? Those are common skin cancers, but they don't usually have air in them.\n\nThe histology shows these large nests of epithelioid cells with necrotic debris. That sounds like it could be a necrotizing infection or maybe a high-grade tumor. I'm thinking about things like mucormycosis or aspergillosis. They can be pretty aggressive and fit with the bone destruction.\n\nBut wait, the patient doesn't have the typical symptoms of a fungal infection, like fever or a rapid decline. And he's not immunocompromised, as far as we know. So, maybe it's not an infection.\n\nLet's go back to the idea of a tumor. The clear cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli in the cells make me think of sebaceous carcinoma. It's a possibility, but it doesn't explain the air in the mass.\n\nCould it be a metastatic tumor? With his history of smoking, maybe a lung cancer that's spread? That would explain the aggressive behavior and the air, maybe from necrosis.\n\nBut then again, the histology doesn't scream lung cancer. The cells don't look like what I'd expect. So, what else could it be?\n\nOh, what about a mucoepidermoid carcinoma? It can have necrosis and clear cells. It's not common in this location, but it's worth considering.\n\nI'm also thinking about a pleomorphic adenoma. They can have a mix of cell types and necrosis, but they're usually benign. Still, in an old guy with a long history of this mass, it's possible.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? I think sebaceous carcinoma is still high on the list. It fits the location and the histology. But I'm not convinced it explains everything.\n\nLet's not forget about metastatic cancer. It's still a possibility, especially with his smoking history. Lung cancer or even a kidney tumor could present like this.\n\nIn the end, I'm leaning towards sebaceous carcinoma. It's the best fit for what we see, but I'm keeping metastatic cancer in mind too. It's a tough case, and we need to be open to all possibilities.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the right supraorbital mass, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - Given the patient's age and significant smoking history, this is a plausible consideration.\n\n2. **Sebaceous Carcinoma** - The location and histological findings, including clear cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli, align with this diagnosis.\n\n3. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** - Although less aggressive, it's a common skin cancer that could present similarly.\n\n4. **Mucormycosis** - The aggressive nature and necrotic debris could suggest a fungal infection like mucormycosis, especially with bone involvement.\n\n5. **Aspergillosis** - Another fungal infection that could present with similar features, particularly in an older adult.\n\n6. **Metastatic Lung Cancer** - The patient's smoking history and the aggressive behavior of the mass make metastatic lung cancer a strong contender.\n\n7. **Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma** - This could explain the necrosis and clear cells observed in the histology.\n\n8. **Pleomorphic Adenoma** - Although typically benign, it can present with a mix of cell types and necrosis, making it a consideration.\n\n9. **Renal Cell Carcinoma Metastasis** - Known for clear cytoplasm, it could be a metastatic tumor from a primary kidney site.\n\n10. **Necrotizing Granuloma** - A less likely but possible inflammatory condition that could mimic aggressive infections or tumors.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are **Sebaceous Carcinoma** and **Metastatic Cancer** (particularly from the lung or kidney), given the patient's history and the aggressive nature of the mass.

She denied any other neurologic symptoms, such as headache, nausea, vomiting, seizures, and paresis. She had a 4-year history of Behçet disease (BD), and her condition had been stabilized with thalidomide. Her optic neuropathy of BD had been treated with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone for 4 days followed by oral prednisone for a month without improvement. Her best-corrected visual acuity was no light perception OD and 20/20 OS. Intraocular pressure was 21 mm Hg OD and 19 mm Hg OS. Fundus examination revealed papilledema in both eyes (Figure 1A). No obvious sign of optic disc ischemia or active uveitis was observed by fundus fluorescein angiography bilaterally. Humphrey visual fields showed complete visual field loss in the right eye and peripheral visual field defects in the left eye. Her anterior segment was normal in both eyes except for relative afferent pupillary defect in the right eye. Cranial nerve examination was otherwise unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed no remarkable abnormalities except for partially empty sella (Figure 1B). She had normal blood pressure levels. Results of laboratory testing regarding systemic infection were negative, and her serum D-dimer level was normal. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cerebral venous thrombosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her 30s who's having some serious vision problems. She's losing vision in her right eye pretty fast, and it's already gone blind in just three months. That's pretty alarming. And she's got papilledema in both eyes, which means there's some increased pressure in her head. But she's not complaining of headaches or anything like that, which is interesting.\n\nNow, she's got a history of Behçet disease, which can cause all sorts of issues, including problems with the eyes. She's been on thalidomide for it, so it's been under control, but this new vision problem isn't responding to the usual treatments like steroids. That's a red flag.\n\nHer visual acuity is really bad in the right eye—no light perception at all. The left eye is still 20/20, but there are peripheral vision problems there too. And the fundus exam shows papilledema, but no signs of ischemia or active inflammation. Hmm, that's curious.\n\nThe visual field tests show she's lost all vision in the right eye and has defects in the left. That's pretty extensive. And there's a relative afferent pupillary defect in the right eye, which points to some optic nerve issue.\n\nThe MRI of her brain doesn't show much, just a partially empty sella. That's not really enough to explain the papilledema. And her blood pressure is normal, so it's not like she has hypertensive crisis or anything.\n\nOkay, let's think about what could be going on. Given her history of Behçet, we should consider possibilities like optic neuritis or even a central nervous system issue related to the disease. But the lack of response to steroids is odd for optic neuritis.\n\nCould it be a vascular problem? Like ischemic optic neuropathy? But there's no sign of ischemia on the fundus exam, so that seems less likely.\n\nWhat about a tumor? That could cause papilledema and vision loss, but the MRI doesn't show a mass. Although, maybe it's something small that's not showing up.\n\nInfections could cause similar symptoms, but her lab tests are negative for infections, and her D-dimer is normal, so that's probably not it.\n\nLet's not forget about idiopathic intracranial hypertension. It can cause papilledema and vision problems, but usually, there are headaches, and she's not reporting any.\n\nOh, and there's the possibility of a dural sinus thrombosis. That could cause increased intracranial pressure without obvious abnormalities on a standard MRI. It fits with her history of Behçet, which can cause blood clots.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think dural sinus thrombosis is a strong contender. It explains the papilledema, the vision loss, and fits with her Behçet history. Yeah, that seems like the most likely cause.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with a focus on one potential diagnosis per step, without repetition:\n\n1. **Optic Neuritis** - Given the patient's history of Behçet disease and the optic nerve involvement, optic neuritis is a strong initial consideration.\n\n2. **Ischemic Optic Neuropathy** - The rapid vision loss could suggest an ischemic process, although the lack of fundus signs makes this less likely.\n\n3. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension** - Papilledema and vision changes without obvious mass lesions on MRI could point towards idiopathic intracranial hypertension.\n\n4. **Dural Sinus Thrombosis** - This condition can cause increased intracranial pressure and fits with the patient's Behçet disease, which predisposes her to thrombosis.\n\n5. **Cranial Meningitis** - Although her lab tests are negative, chronic or atypical meningitis could still be considered given her symptoms.\n\n6. **Optic Nerve Sheath Meningioma** - A tumor in this area could cause progressive vision loss and papilledema, but typically shows up on MRI.\n\n7. **Pituitary Adenoma** - The partially empty sella on MRI could be related to a pituitary issue, but usually, there would be more specific symptoms or hormone imbalances.\n\n8. **Chronic Papilledema** - This could result from unresolved or undertreated increased intracranial pressure over time.\n\n9. **Neurosarcoidosis** - This condition can affect the optic nerves and cause intracranial pressure changes, although it's less likely without other systemic symptoms.\n\n10. **Vitreous Hemorrhage** - Although the fundus exam didn't show obvious signs, a vitreous hemorrhage could cause sudden vision changes.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Dural Sinus Thrombosis** emerges as the most likely diagnosis. It aligns with the patient's Behçet disease, explains the papilledema and vision loss, and fits the profile of increased intracranial pressure without distinct findings on a standard MRI. This condition can lead to the symptoms observed and is consistent with the patient's medical history.", "topic": "['Neuro-ophthalmology', 'Neurology', 'Ophthalmology']"}

While being evaluated for the cutaneous lesions, the patient was diagnosed with AIDS and began antiretroviral therapy. On examination, 6 erythematous, firm, subcutaneous nodules were present on the left side of the chest, abdomen, and left upper limb, varying in size from 2 × 2 cm to 4 × 4 cm (Figure, A). There was diffuse erythema and edema on the left upper limb, leading to difficulty in limb movement (Figure, A).

We've got a man in his 30s with some pretty specific symptoms. He's got painless swelling in his left arm, and there are these nodules on his chest and abdomen. They started as red bumps a month ago, and then he developed swelling in his arm. That's interesting.\n\nNow, he's also been diagnosed with AIDS, and his CD4 count is really low. That means his immune system is pretty compromised. So, we need to consider infections or conditions that take advantage of that.\n\nFirst, let's think about Kaposi's sarcoma. It's common in people with HIV and can cause skin lesions. But usually, these lesions are more purple and not necessarily nodular. So, maybe, but let's not jump to conclusions.\n\nNext, there's lymphoma. People with AIDS are at higher risk for lymphoma, and it can cause swollen lymph nodes and skin issues. This could be a strong contender.\n\nThen there's bacillary angiomatosis. It's caused by bacteria and can cause nodular lesions in people with HIV. The nodules can be erythematous and firm, which matches what we're seeing.\n\nOh, and we can't forget about cellulitis. It can cause redness and swelling, but it's usually painful. This guy's symptoms are painless, so maybe not cellulitis.\n\nThere's also angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. It can cause skin lesions and lymphadenopathy, but it's pretty rare. Still, it's worth considering.\n\nNow, let's think about the histopathology. If we see spindle cells or human herpesvirus 8, that would point to Kaposi's sarcoma. But if we see bacteria or certain atypical cells, that could point to something else.\n\nGiven the patient's low CD4 count, we should also think about opportunistic infections. Something like Mycobacterium avium complex could be at play, especially if the histology shows acid-fast bacilli.\n\nHmm, what about non-Hodgkin lymphoma? It's common in people with HIV and can cause lymphadenopathy and skin lesions. This could be a strong possibility.\n\nLet's not forget about Castleman disease. It can cause lymphadenopathy and skin issues, and it's associated with HIV. This could fit too.\n\nSo, after thinking it all through, I'd say the top differential diagnosis is bacillary angiomatosis. It matches the symptoms and the patient's HIV status. But we should also consider lymphoma and Castleman disease, given the lymphadenopathy and skin lesions.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Bacillary Angiomatosis** - This condition, caused by Bartonella species, is common in individuals with HIV and can present with erythematous, firm nodules, matching the patient's symptoms.\n\n2. **Kaposi's Sarcoma** - Although typically characterized by purple lesions, Kaposi's sarcoma is prevalent among those with HIV and could present atypically.\n\n3. **Lymphoma (particularly Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma)** - Individuals with AIDS are at increased risk for lymphoma, which can cause lymphadenopathy and skin lesions.\n\n4. **Castleman Disease** - This condition can cause lymphadenopathy and skin issues, especially in the context of HIV.\n\n5. **Cellulitis** - While usually painful, atypical presentations can occur in immunocompromised patients.\n\n6. **Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma** - A rare form of lymphoma that can present with skin lesions and lymphadenopathy.\n\n7. **Mycobacterium avium Complex (MAC)** - An opportunistic infection in those with low CD4 counts, potentially causing systemic symptoms including skin lesions.\n\n8. **Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma** - A common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that can present aggressively in immunocompromised individuals.\n\n9. **Primary Effusion Lymphoma** - A rare lymphoma associated with HIV, often presenting with serous effusions and skin involvement.\n\n10. **Multicentric Castleman Disease** - Can present with lymphadenopathy, skin lesions, and systemic symptoms in the context of HIV.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnosis is **Bacillary Angiomatosis**, given the presence of erythematous nodules and the patient's HIV status.

He had no relevant medical, ocular, or family history, and he denied use of illicit drugs or anticoagulants. Uncorrected visual acuity was 20/30 OD and 20/400 OS. Extraocular motility and intraocular pressures were normal. Results of an anterior examination was unremarkable.

Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography through the preretinal macular hemorrhage demonstrated layered blood in the sub–internal limiting membrane space (Figure, B). The right fundus exhibited a similar appearance aside from the preretinal hemorrhage. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Acute myeloid leukemia", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 44-year-old guy who's been dealing with fevers, night sweats, and chills for a couple of weeks. That's already making me think of something systemic, maybe an infection or an inflammatory condition. And then he's got these petechiae, which are those little red or purple spots on the skin caused by bleeding under the skin. That's a big hint towards a blood-related issue.\n\nNow, he's also having trouble with his vision. It's blurry and he's seeing these dark spots in his visual field. That's pretty concerning, especially since it's painless. When vision changes happen without pain, I start thinking about problems with the retina or the optic nerve.\n\nSo, let's look at what the eye exam shows. The left eye has a pink optic nerve, which sounds like it might be swollen, and there are these intraretinal hemorrhages and something called Roth spots. Those are those little white spots in the retina with a hemorrhage around them. They're kind of a hallmark for certain conditions. And there's also a preretinal hemorrhage right over the macula, which is the part of the retina responsible for central vision.\n\nOkay, so what could cause all of this? With the systemic symptoms and the eye findings, I'm thinking about conditions that affect the blood and the small blood vessels. One possibility that jumps out is infective endocarditis. It's an infection of the heart valves, and it can send little clots and infected particles into the bloodstream, which could explain the petechiae and the Roth spots.\n\nBut let's not stop there. We should consider other possibilities too. What about leukemia? It's a blood cancer that can cause anemia, thrombocytopenia, and lead to similar retinal findings. The systemic symptoms could fit too.\n\nThere's also aplastic anemia, which affects blood cell production and could lead to similar bleeding issues, but it doesn't quite fit as well with the Roth spots.\n\nOh, and we can't forget about autoimmune conditions like lupus. It can cause a wide range of systemic symptoms and affect the eyes, but it's usually more complicated and might not fit perfectly here.\n\nNow, let's think about the possibility of a central nervous system issue like optic neuritis. But wait, optic neuritis usually causes pain, and this guy's vision problem is painless, so that's probably not it.\n\nWhat about a vitreous hemorrhage? That could cause floaters and blurred vision, but it doesn't explain the systemic symptoms or the specific retinal findings.\n\nAnd then there's diabetic retinopathy. It can cause similar retinal changes, but this guy doesn't have a history of diabetes, and it doesn't explain the systemic symptoms either.\n\nHmm, let's not forget about lymphoma. It's a type of cancer that can cause systemic symptoms and affect the eyes, but it's not as common in this scenario.\n\nOh, and there's also the possibility of a hypercoagulable state, where the blood tends to clot too much. That could cause retinal vein occlusions, but it doesn't explain the systemic symptoms as well.\n\nSo, after thinking through all of this, I'm leaning towards infective endocarditis as the most likely cause. It ties together the systemic symptoms, the petechiae, and the retinal findings like Roth spots. Leukemia is a close second because it could also explain the blood-related findings, but it's not as strong a fit. The other conditions just don't match up as well with the whole picture.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the symptoms and examination findings, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the condition described:\n\n1. **Infective Endocarditis** - This condition is characterized by systemic symptoms like fevers, night sweats, and chills, along with petechiae and retinal findings such as Roth spots, making it a strong contender.\n\n2. **Leukemia** - A blood cancer that can cause anemia, thrombocytopenia, and retinal hemorrhages, fitting the systemic and ocular symptoms.\n\n3. **Aplastic Anemia** - A condition affecting blood cell production, leading to bleeding issues, but it doesn't typically present with Roth spots.\n\n4. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** - An autoimmune condition with varied systemic symptoms and possible ocular involvement, though it's less specific to the retinal findings here.\n\n5. **Optic Neuritis** - Typically causes painful vision loss, which doesn't match the painless nature of the symptoms described.\n\n6. **Vitreous Hemorrhage** - Could cause floaters and blurred vision, but lacks systemic symptoms and specific retinal findings.\n\n7. **Diabetic Retinopathy** - Can cause similar retinal changes, but there's no history of diabetes and it doesn't explain systemic symptoms.\n\n8. **Lymphoma** - A type of cancer that can cause systemic symptoms and ocular involvement, but it's less common in this scenario.\n\n9. **Hypercoagulable State** - Could cause retinal vein occlusions, but doesn't explain the systemic symptoms as well.\n\n10. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion** - Could cause retinal hemorrhages, but typically doesn't present with systemic symptoms.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Infective Endocarditis** remains the most likely diagnosis due to the combination of systemic symptoms, petechiae, and characteristic retinal findings like Roth spots. **Leukemia** is also a strong consideration due to its ability to explain the blood-related findings, but it's not as comprehensive a fit as infective endocarditis. The other conditions are less likely given the specific presentation of symptoms and findings.", "topic": "['Retinal Disorders', 'Ophthalmology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Leukemias', 'Hematology']"}

At 3 weeks’ postpartum, she began chemotherapy (cycle 1, day 1) with adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD). On day 15 of cycle 1, she presented with linear, hyperpigmented streaks and welts on her arms, back, and legs. Intense, diffuse pruritus had developed within 24 hours of the patient’s first day of treatment, and her symptoms were poorly responsive to antihistamines and topical steroids. Pruritus was followed by the appearance of dark scratch marks as demonstrated in the Figure.

We've got a 31-year-old woman who's just had a baby and started chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma. She's got this really itchy rash that showed up after she started her chemo. The rash is made up of these linear, dark streaks. Hmm, that's interesting. It's not your typical rash, is it? And the itching is really bothering her, more than what you'd expect from just a regular rash.\n\nNow, let's see what else is going on. Her white blood cell count is pretty low, which isn't too surprising with chemo, but it's something to keep in mind. Her bilirubin levels are normal, so that's good. No signs of liver issues there.\n\nOkay, so what could be causing this rash? Chemotherapy can cause all sorts of skin reactions. I've heard of reactions like erythema multiforme or Stevens-Johnson syndrome with certain drugs, but those usually have more severe symptoms. This doesn't quite fit.\n\nWhat about the timing? The rash showed up 15 days after she started chemo. That's a bit delayed for some of the immediate hypersensitivity reactions, but it could fit with a delayed hypersensitivity reaction. Maybe something like a drug eruption?\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. The rash is so specific—linear and hyperpigmented. That's not what you'd expect from a typical drug rash. And the itching is so intense. Could it be something related to the chemotherapy drugs themselves?\n\nOh, I remember that bleomycin is one of the drugs she's on. Bleomycin can cause some unique skin reactions. It's known for causing flagellate erythema, which sounds a lot like what she's experiencing. That would explain the linear streaks and the itching.\n\nSo, putting it all together, it really seems like this is a case of flagellate erythema caused by bleomycin. The timing, the appearance of the rash, and the symptoms all match up. Yeah, that makes the most sense given everything we know.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the pruritic rash in this patient is flagellate erythema caused by bleomycin. The linear, hyperpigmented streaks and intense pruritus that developed after chemotherapy, particularly with bleomycin, align well with this diagnosis. Here is a 10-step differential diagnosis list, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Flagellate Erythema** - This is the most likely diagnosis given the patient's symptoms and treatment with bleomycin.\n2. **Erythema Multiforme** - A skin condition characterized by target lesions, often related to medications or infections.\n3. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome** - A severe skin and mucous membrane reaction, usually to medications, but typically more widespread and serious.\n4. **Drug-Induced Hypersensitivity Reaction** - A general reaction to medications, which can manifest in various ways.\n5. **Contact Dermatitis** - A skin reaction to external agents, but less likely given the widespread nature of the rash.\n6. **Urticaria** - Hives, often allergic in nature, but typically not leaving hyperpigmented streaks.\n7. **Pityriasis Rosea** - A viral rash with a distinctive \"herald patch,\" but not usually associated with chemotherapy.\n8. **Graft-Versus-Host Disease** - Unlikely in this context, as it's more associated with bone marrow transplants.\n9. **Chemotherapy-Induced Photosensitivity** - Possible, but the description doesn't strongly suggest a photosensitive reaction.\n10. **Paraneoplastic Pemphigus** - A rare skin condition associated with malignancies, but usually involves mucosal lesions and more severe skin blistering.\n\nReranking these based on the specific details of the case, flagellate erythema remains the most likely diagnosis, followed by drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction, and then erythema multiforme. However, the unique features of the rash and the known side effects of bleomycin make flagellate erythema the most probable cause.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Hematology', 'Oncology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Lymphomas']"}

We've got a young guy in his 20s with these pink and brown skin bumps and plaques, and some of them are even ulcerated. That's a bit concerning. They're mostly on his head, neck, and spine. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nNow, he's had quite a medical history. He had medulloblastoma when he was just 2, and they treated it with radiation to his brain and spine. That's a pretty big deal. And then, as an adult, he had another round of radiation for a meningioma. That's a lot of radiation.\n\nOh, and he's had these kinds of skin lesions before. They've been treated, but they keep coming back. Plus, his family has a history of similar skin issues. Two of his brothers and even a niece have them. That's definitely a red flag for something genetic.\n\nSo, let's think about what could be going on here. With his history of radiation and these skin lesions, I'm immediately thinking about basal cell carcinoma. It's known to be linked with radiation exposure and can run in families if there's a genetic predisposition like in Gorlin syndrome.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. We should consider other possibilities too. Could it be squamous cell carcinoma? It's another type of skin cancer that can show up in areas with a lot of sun exposure or previous radiation. But, it doesn't usually have this strong familial link.\n\nWhat about melanoma? It's a serious skin cancer, but it typically has a different appearance, more like dark moles than pink or brown papules. Plus, it doesn't quite fit with the radiation history.\n\nOh, and there's also the possibility of benign things like seborrheic keratoses. They're harmless, but they could look a bit like these lesions. Still, the ulceration and family history make me think otherwise.\n\nLet's not forget about the radiation aspect. Radiation can cause all sorts of skin changes, like radiation dermatitis. But, that usually looks different and doesn't have this familial pattern.\n\nHmm, what about other genetic conditions? Neurofibromatosis comes to mind. It can cause skin changes and has a genetic link, but the type of lesions are usually different, like café-au-lait spots and neurofibromas.\n\nNow, thinking about the family history again, it really points towards something hereditary. Gorlin syndrome, which includes basal cell carcinoma, fits well. But, we should also consider other syndromes like Li-Fraumeni, which can have various types of tumors. Though, it's not specifically linked to these types of skin lesions.\n\nOkay, let's wrap this up. Considering everything—the radiation history, the family history, and the appearance of the lesions—basal cell carcinoma, likely as part of Gorlin syndrome, seems like the most probable diagnosis. But, we should keep squamous cell carcinoma and other possibilities in mind, just in case.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the skin lesions is basal cell carcinoma, potentially as part of Gorlin syndrome, given the patient's history of radiation exposure and familial occurrence of similar lesions. Here is a ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (Gorlin Syndrome)**: This diagnosis aligns with the patient's history of radiation, familial skin lesions, and the characteristic appearance of the lesions.\n\n2. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: While possible, especially with a history of radiation, it typically doesn't have a strong familial link and presents differently.\n\n3. **Melanoma**: Less likely due to the lesion's appearance and the lack of typical mole-like characteristics.\n\n4. **Seborrheic Keratoses**: Benign lesions that could resemble the described papules but are unlikely given the ulceration and family history.\n\n5. **Radiation Dermatitis**: Unlikely as it doesn't typically present with discrete papules and plaques or a familial pattern.\n\n6. **Neurofibromatosis**: Doesn't fit well with the lesion types described; usually presents with café-au-lait spots and neurofibromas.\n\n7. **Li-Fraumeni Syndrome**: Involves various tumors, but not specifically these types of skin lesions.\n\n8. **Pilomatrixoma**: Benign skin tumor, less likely given the patient's history and lesion characteristics.\n\n9. **Trichoepithelioma**: A benign tumor that could resemble the lesions but doesn't align with the radiation history.\n\n10. **Cylindroma**: A rare skin adnexal tumor, unlikely given the context and familial history.\n\nThese rankings consider the patient's history, family history, and the specific characteristics of the lesions.

His medical history was significant for Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia refractory to multiple treatments, including chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, with transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) status posttreatment. At the time of evaluation, he had been hospitalized for 5 months with severe protein-calorie malnutrition, pancytopenia, and recurrent neutropenic fevers. The patient was febrile (38.3°C), with a white blood cell count of 0.5/μL (absolute neutrophil count 0.00; to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001), hemoglobin levels of 7.6g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0), hematocrit 21%, and platelet count 9/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 1.0). He was not receiving active cancer treatment. He appeared cachectic and pale. Intraoral examination revealed poor oral hygiene. The left hard palate exhibited a large swelling with a 5×3-cm indurated area of ulceration, central necrosis, and desquamation (Figure, A). The patient was treated palliatively with dexamethasone solution and nystatin rinse. A biopsy was not recommended owing to medical instability. However, the patient retained a sloughed fragment of the affected tissue, which was submitted for histologic evaluation. A maxillofacial computed tomography (CT) scan completed the etiological investigation. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Mucormycosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a young guy in his 20s with some pretty nasty oral lesions on the hard palate. They're growing fast and are really painful. He's been dealing with this for about two months. Now, this isn't just any regular case. He's got a history of leukemia, the B-cell type, and it's been a tough road for him. He's tried a lot of treatments, including some heavy-duty stuff like CAR T-cell therapy, but it looks like things have taken a turn for the worse with a transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. He's been in the hospital for five months, which is a long time, and he's really not in good shape. He's malnourished, has no immune cells to speak of, and keeps getting fevers because of his neutropenic state. \n\nSo, when we see him, he's got a fever, his white blood cell count is basically zero, he's anemic, and his platelets are super low. He's not on any active cancer treatment right now, which might be why things are flaring up. He looks really sick, cachectic and pale, and his oral hygiene isn't great. The lesion on his palate is pretty significant, with a big area of swelling, ulceration, and necrosis. It's not looking good. \n\nGiven all this, we need to figure out what's going on with these lesions. The first thing that comes to mind is an infection. He's got no immune system to fight anything off, so that's a big risk. Fungal infections like aspergillosis or mucormycosis could definitely be culprits. They love to attack when the body's defenses are down. \n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. Could it be something else? What about a bacterial infection? Necrotizing ulcerative conditions like noma or even a syphilitic gumma could fit the bill. They're not as common, but they can't be ruled out. \n\nOh, and we can't forget about viral infections. Herpes simplex virus or cytomegalovirus could cause some nasty lesions too, especially in someone who's this immunocompromised. \n\nNow, let's not forget about the possibility of this being related to his leukemia. Leukemic infiltrates can cause lesions like this. It's not just infections we should be thinking about. \n\nAnd then there's the possibility of a drug reaction or even trauma causing some of this damage. But given how widespread and severe the lesions are, that seems less likely. \n\nSo, putting it all together, here's what we're thinking: \n\n1. Fungal infection, maybe aspergillosis or mucormycosis, seems like a strong contender given his condition. \n2. Bacterial infections like noma or a syphilitic gumma could be possible. \n3. Viral infections, such as from HSV or CMV, are definitely on the list. \n4. Leukemic infiltrates could be causing the lesions. \n5. A drug reaction or trauma, though less likely, can't be completely ruled out. \n\nAfter thinking it through, fungal infection still seems the most likely, but we can't ignore the others. It's a complex case, and we need to consider all angles.\n\n### FINAL RESPONSE:\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the oral lesions, considering the patient's complex medical history and current condition:\n\n1. **Fungal Infection (Aspergillosis or Mucormycosis)**: Given the patient's severely immunocompromised state, fungal infections are a strong possibility.\n\n2. **Bacterial Infection (Noma or Syphilitic Gumma)**: Although less common, these conditions can cause severe ulcerative lesions, especially in immunocompromised individuals.\n\n3. **Viral Infection (Herpes Simplex Virus or Cytomegalovirus)**: Viral infections can cause significant lesions in those with weakened immune systems.\n\n4. **Leukemic Infiltrates**: The patient's history of leukemia suggests that leukemic infiltrates could be causing the oral lesions.\n\n5. **Drug Reaction**: Although less likely, drug reactions can cause oral mucosal changes, and the patient's treatment history should be considered.\n\n6. **Trauma**: Physical trauma could contribute to oral lesions, especially in a patient with poor oral hygiene and significant debilitation.\n\n7. **Osteonecrosis**: Given the patient's history of chemotherapy and potential corticosteroid use, osteonecrosis of the jaw could be a consideration.\n\n8. **Bacterial Endocarditis**: With the patient's fever and immunocompromised state, bacterial endocarditis with oral manifestations is possible.\n\n9. **Tuberculosis**: Although rare in this context, tuberculosis could present with oral lesions in an immunocompromised host.\n\n10. **Lymphoma**: The patient's hematological history raises the possibility of a lymphoma manifesting in the oral cavity.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are fungal infection (aspergillosis or mucormycosis) and leukemic infiltrates, given the patient's immunocompromised state and history of leukemia.

The plaque first appeared as a small inflammatory papule on the left nostril. Shortly thereafter, the patient was hospitalized at an outside facility for multifocal pneumonia. He was also treated for a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection of his nose. Despite antibiotic therapy, the papule continued to grow and ulcerate and eventually became necrotic (Figure, A). One month before presentation at our facility, the patient began developing erythematous papules on his arms and legs. The papules enlarged and ulcerated. Some of them healed spontaneously with poxlike scars. He had no recent history of travel. At admission, the patient was tachycardic and febrile to a temperature of 38.5°C. Routine laboratory testing revealed normocytic anemia (hemoglobin, 7.7 g/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10]). Shave biopsies of necrotic nodules on the left arm and left cheek (Figure, B-D) and, later, an excisional biopsy of a cervical lymph node were performed. Head computed tomography demonstrated a soft-tissue mass that encased the nasal bone and extended into the right maxillary sinus and left nasal cavity. Chest computed tomography showed bilateral pulmonary nodules. Physical examination revealed a necrotic plaque with surrounding erythema on the distal nose (Figure, A). A 1 × 1-cm crateriform papule with central necrosis was present on the left malar cheek. Multiple nodules with central, dry necrosis and areas of poxlike scarring were scattered across the extremities. Slight contractures of his fingers were also noted. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Lymphomatoid granulomatosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 33-year-old guy with a nasty, necrotic plaque on his nose and some nodules on his arms and legs. That's been going on for about five months. It started as a small, inflamed bump that just wouldn't go away, even after antibiotics. Hmm, that's odd. And then he got pneumonia and a MRSA infection. Could these be related?\n\nNow, he's also got these nodules that turned into ulcers and then scars. That's a lot going on. And he's running a fever and has anemia. Anemia could mean something systemic, maybe inflammation or blood loss. But wait, there's more. His tests show normocytic anemia, so it's not just a simple deficiency.\n\nThe imaging is pretty concerning too. There's a mass around his nasal bone, and it's spreading into his sinuses. Plus, he's got lung nodules. That sounds like something that's affecting his whole body, not just his skin.\n\nOkay, let's think about what could cause all of this. It's got to be something that affects the skin and internal organs. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis comes to mind. It can cause skin lesions, lung issues, and even affect the sinuses. That fits pretty well.\n\nBut let's not jump to conclusions. What about infections like tuberculosis or fungal infections? They can cause necrotic lesions and systemic symptoms. But usually, they don't cause this specific pattern of skin and lung involvement.\n\nOh, and there's also polyarteritis nodosa. It can cause skin nodules and systemic symptoms, but it doesn't usually involve the respiratory tract like this.\n\nAnd what about sarcoidosis? It can cause skin and lung issues, but it's usually not this aggressive or necrotic.\n\nSo, putting it all together, granulomatosis with polyangiitis seems like the best fit. It explains the skin lesions, the lung nodules, the sinus involvement, and the systemic symptoms like fever and anemia. Yeah, that makes the most sense.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnoses for the 33-year-old man with a necrotic plaque on the nose, nodules on the extremities, systemic symptoms, and imaging findings are as follows:\n\n1. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)**: This condition, formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis, is a small to medium vessel vasculitis that can affect the respiratory tract and kidneys, and is characterized by necrotizing granulomas and vasculitis. The presentation of necrotic skin lesions, lung nodules, and sinus involvement aligns well with GPA.\n\n2. **Polyarteritis Nodosa (PAN)**: This is a medium vessel vasculitis that can cause skin nodules, systemic symptoms, and organ involvement. However, it typically does not involve the respiratory tract, which makes it less likely in this case.\n\n3. **Tuberculosis**: This infectious disease can cause necrotic skin lesions and lung nodules, but it usually has a different clinical course and does not typically involve the sinuses in this manner.\n\n4. **Fungal Infections (e.g., Sporotrichosis)**: Certain fungal infections can cause nodular skin lesions that ulcerate, but they are less likely to cause the systemic symptoms and lung involvement seen here.\n\n5. **Sarcoidosis**: This condition can involve the skin and lungs, but it typically presents with non-necrotizing granulomas and is less aggressive than what is described.\n\n6. **Lupus Vulgaris**: A form of cutaneous tuberculosis, it can cause necrotic skin lesions, but lung and sinus involvement would be atypical.\n\n7. **Erythema Nodosum**: This condition causes painful nodules on the shins but does not typically involve necrotic lesions or systemic involvement like lung nodules.\n\n8. **Sweet's Syndrome**: Characterized by fever, leukocytosis, and tender skin lesions, but not typically necrotic or with lung involvement.\n\n9. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum**: Causes severe skin ulcers but is not typically associated with lung nodules or systemic symptoms like fever and anemia.\n\n10. **Infective Endocarditis**: Can cause systemic symptoms and embolic phenomena, but necrotic skin plaques and lung nodules are not typical presentations.\n\nAfter considering all the clinical features and test results, Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) remains the most likely diagnosis, as it best explains the combination of necrotic skin lesions, lung nodules, sinus involvement, and systemic symptoms.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Clinical Challenge']"}

Results of a dilated fundus examination were normal in the right eye and notable for a macular serous retinal detachment in the left eye (Figure 1A). Findings on optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed a dome-shaped collection of subretinal fluid in the macula (not shown).

A man in his mid-50s is having blurry vision in his left eye, but it's painless. That's interesting because pain usually points to inflammation or infection, but this doesn't seem to be the case here. The vision change has been going on for a week, so it's not sudden, which might rule out some acute conditions.\n\nNow, let's look at the test results. The visual acuity is really telling. It's 20/20 in the right eye, but 20/400 in the left. That's a big difference! The left eye has a macular serous retinal detachment. Hmm, that's when fluid builds up under the retina. The OCT shows a dome-shaped collection of fluid, which makes me think of conditions that cause fluid to leak under the retina.\n\nThe fluorescein angiography is also revealing. It shows these pinpoint areas of hyperfluorescence. That's like little leaks in the blood-retinal barrier. This pattern is kind of classic for certain conditions. Let's see, what could cause this?\n\nFirst, I'm thinking about central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC). It's known for causing serous retinal detachments just like this, especially in middle-aged men. The stress and corticosteroid use are common triggers. This seems to fit well.\n\nBut wait, there are other possibilities. What about age-related macular degeneration (AMD)? It can cause fluid under the retina too, but usually, there are other signs like drusen, and this patient is a bit young for typical AMD.\n\nVogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease could be another option. It can cause serous retinal detachments and is often accompanied by other systemic symptoms, but this patient doesn't seem to have those.\n\nOcular lymphoma is another thought. It can cause subretinal fluid, but it's rare and often associated with other ocular and systemic findings.\n\nLet's not forget about uveitis. It can cause inflammation and fluid in the eye, but usually, there's more anterior chamber or vitreous inflammation, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nHmm, what about polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV)? It can cause fluid and hemorrhage in the macula, but the angiography pattern here doesn't quite match.\n\nRetinal vein occlusion is another possibility, but that usually causes more extensive retinal hemorrhages and cotton wool spots, which aren't seen here.\n\nOh, and there's Harada's disease, which is similar to VKH. It can cause panuveitis and retinal detachments, but again, the lack of systemic symptoms makes it less likely.\n\nAlright, let's rank these. Based on the patient's age, gender, and the specific angiographic findings, CSC is still the top suspect. It's so classic for this presentation.\n\nNext, I'd consider AMD, even though the patient is a bit young, because it's a common cause of macular fluid.\n\nThen comes VKH, given the potential for similar findings, but the lack of systemic symptoms pushes it down the list.\n\nOcular lymphoma and uveitis are less likely due to the absence of other supporting findings.\n\nPCV and retinal vein occlusion don't quite fit the angiographic pattern or the clinical presentation.\n\nHarada's disease is unlikely without systemic involvement.\n\nSo, after going through everything, CSC is the most likely diagnosis, followed by AMD, and then the others trail behind based on the evidence we have.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the man in his mid-50s with painless blurry vision in the left eye and the specific findings from the examinations is central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC). This condition is characterized by serous retinal detachments and is common in middle-aged men, often associated with stress or corticosteroid use. The fluorescein angiography showing multifocal pinpoint areas of hyperfluorescence with mild leakage is classic for CSC.\n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC)**: The presentation and test results are highly indicative of CSC, making it the most likely diagnosis.\n2. **Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**: Although the patient is somewhat young for typical AMD, it remains a common cause of macular fluid accumulation and should be considered.\n3. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) Disease**: This condition can cause similar findings but is less likely due to the absence of systemic symptoms.\n4. **Ocular Lymphoma**: This is a rare condition that can cause subretinal fluid but is unlikely without other supporting findings.\n5. **Uveitis**: Typically involves more anterior chamber or vitreous inflammation, which is not prominent in this case.\n6. **Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy (PCV)**: The angiographic pattern does not strongly suggest PCV.\n7. **Retinal Vein Occlusion**: Usually presents with more extensive retinal hemorrhages and cotton wool spots, which are not seen here.\n8. **Harada's Disease**: Similar to VKH, it is unlikely without systemic involvement.\n\nCSC is the most fitting diagnosis given the patient's age, gender, and the specific angiographic findings.", "topic": "['Ophthalmology', 'Macular Diseases', 'Retinal Disorders', 'Hematology', 'Oncology']"}

He did have some abdominal adenopathy show up in tests before, but he didn't want to pursue it further at the time. Now, he's also got some cervical lymphadenopathy. That's a lot to take in.\n\nFirst, let's think about the skin lesion. It's growing fast, and he's got lymphadenopathy. That's a red flag for something serious, maybe a lymphoma. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma could be a possibility here. It often shows up with strange skin lesions and can involve the lymph nodes.\n\nBut wait, there's the abdominal pain and the weight loss. These could be pointing to something going on in the abdomen. Lymphomas can involve the abdomen, so maybe we're looking at a gastrointestinal issue related to lymphoma. Could it be a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma? That can show up in the GI tract and could explain the adenopathy and weight loss.\n\nNow, let's not forget the biopsy. It's going to be key here. If it shows certain types of cells, like CD30-positive cells, we might be looking at something like anaplastic large cell lymphoma. This could fit with the skin and lymph node involvement.\n\nBut, I'm also thinking about other possibilities. The systemic symptoms, like the weight loss and anemia, could point to a more widespread disease. Maybe a leukemia? Like a chronic lymphocytic leukemia? That can cause anemia and lymphadenopathy.\n\nOh, and the abdominal pain. It's been going on for a long time, and with the adenopathy, maybe we should consider something like a gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Those can cause abdominal symptoms and might explain the weight loss.\n\nHmm, let's not jump to conclusions. The skin lesion is a big clue. If it's a lymphomatoid papulosis, that could explain the skin findings and maybe even the lymphadenopathy. It's a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.\n\nBut, wait a minute. The systemic symptoms are still bugging me. What if it's a more aggressive lymphoma, like an anaplastic large cell lymphoma? That could explain the rapid growth of the lesion and the lymph node involvement.\n\nAlso, let's think about other skin conditions. Could it be a squamous cell carcinoma? Those can grow fast and might explain the local symptoms, but not really the systemic ones.\n\nOh, and what about a Merkel cell carcinoma? Those are aggressive skin tumors and can present with rapid growth and lymphadenopathy. They might fit the bill here.\n\nIn the end, I think we're looking at a primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma. It fits with the skin lesion, the lymphadenopathy, and the systemic symptoms.

He reported no fevers, night sweats, abdominal pain, emesis, and diarrhea. Physical examination revealed a thin habitus; no palmar erythema, spider angiomas, or gynecomastia were observed. Laboratory tests showed normal complete blood cell count and chemistry panel findings. Hepatic panel showed an elevated alkaline phosphatase level (209 U/L; upper limit of normal [ULN], 150 U/L [3.49 μkat/L; ULN, 2.5 μkat/L]), normal total bilirubin level (0.4 mg/dL [6.84 μmol/L]), elevated alanine aminotransferase level (41 U/L; ULN, 35 U/L [0.68 μkat/L; ULN, 0.58 μkat/L]), and normal aspartate aminotransferase level (27 U/L [0.45 μkat/L]). A single-phase computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed multiple hypoattenuating masses with rim enhancement throughout the liver, intussusception of the small bowel, and normal liver contour with no signs of portal hypertension (Figure 1, left). α-Fetoprotein (AFP) level was elevated (1252 ng/mL; ULN, 9 ng/mL); levels of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (<2 U/mL) and carcinoembryonic antigen (2.8 ng/mL) were normal. A triple-phase CT scan was obtained to further evaluate the small bowel, which revealed no small bowel abnormalities but instead demonstrated a 3.3 × 2.8-cm heterogeneously enhancing pancreatic tail mass not seen on the previous single-phase CT (Figure 1, right). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 55-year-old guy who's been feeling pretty crummy for a few weeks. He's lost some weight and doesn't have much of an appetite. No fever or night sweats, which is good, but still concerning. \n\nWhen we look at his liver tests, alkaline phosphatase is high, and ALT is a bit up too. But bilirubin is normal, so that's something. And then there's this CT scan showing multiple weird spots in the liver. They're hypoattenuating with rim enhancement. That sounds like metastases to me. \n\nThe liver looks otherwise okay, no signs of cirrhosis or portal hypertension, which is interesting. And wow, his AFP is really high. That's usually a big red flag for something like hepatocellular carcinoma. But wait, could it be something else? \n\nLet's think about other possibilities. With high AFP, hepatocellular carcinoma is definitely on the list. But AFP can be high in other cancers too, like germ cell tumors. And what about those liver lesions? They could be from something like that. \n\nOh, and there's a mass in the pancreatic tail. That's a new twist. Pancreatic cancer can cause liver metastases, but usually, AFP isn't this high. So, what's going on here? \n\nMaybe it's a germ cell tumor. They can increase AFP and cause liver lesions. But would they show up in the pancreas? That's unusual. \n\nLet's not forget about lymphoma. It can cause liver lesions and systemic symptoms. But high AFP? That's not typical. \n\nAnd then there's the possibility of a neuroendocrine tumor. They can be in the pancreas and affect the liver. But again, high AFP is odd for that. \n\nSo, what's the most likely scenario? Given the high AFP and liver lesions, hepatocellular carcinoma was my first thought. But that pancreatic mass is throwing me off. \n\nCould it be a mixed germ cell tumor with a component in the pancreas? That might explain the AFP and the liver lesions. \n\nIn the end, I'm leaning towards a mixed germ cell tumor. It fits the high AFP, liver lesions, and the pancreatic mass. Yeah, that seems to make the most sense.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Hepatocellular Carcinoma** - Given the elevated AFP and liver lesions, this is a strong initial consideration.\n\n2. **Germ Cell Tumor** - The high AFP and presence of liver lesions could also suggest a germ cell tumor, potentially with metastatic spread.\n\n3. **Pancreatic Cancer** - The pancreatic tail mass is noteworthy, and while pancreatic cancer typically doesn't elevate AFP significantly, it's important to consider.\n\n4. **Neuroendocrine Tumor** - These tumors can present in the pancreas and affect the liver, though elevated AFP is atypical.\n\n5. **Lymphoma** - This can cause liver lesions and systemic symptoms, but high AFP is not characteristic.\n\n6. **Metastatic Testicular Cancer** - High AFP and liver involvement could suggest a testicular primary with metastasis.\n\n7. **Cholangiocarcinoma** - Although AFP is not typically elevated, the liver lesions and alkaline phosphatase elevation make this worth considering.\n\n8. **Hepatic Hemangioma** - While usually benign, the rim-enhancing lesions could resemble hemangiomas, though the systemic symptoms are unexplained.\n\n9. **Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)** - Could potentially involve the liver and present with a pancreatic mass, though high AFP is unusual.\n\n10. **Mixed Tumor (e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma with neuroendocrine components)** - This could explain the combination of high AFP, liver lesions, and pancreatic mass.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the most likely diagnosis is a **Mixed Germ Cell Tumor**.

She described a 2-week medical history of diplopia and blurry vision as well as 4 months of nasal congestion and progressive headaches despite multiple antibiotic courses. She denied a medical history of sinonasal issues, immunodeficiency, autoimmune disease, malignant disease, or diabetes. On examination, she was afebrile with stable vital signs. Ophthalmologic evaluation revealed a right afferent pupillary defect and cranial sixth-nerve palsy. Computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging of the sinuses revealed abnormal soft tissue throughout her sinuses with destruction of the sinus walls and skull base as well as extension of abnormal appearing tissue into the right orbital apex and posterior nasal septum. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated a normal white blood cell count and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level. Nasal endoscopy showed bloody mucus and crusting around the right middle turbinate and sphenoethmoidal recess. The acute nature of her vision loss amid concern for a destructive sinonasal process warranted operative intervention. Abnormal soft tissue with associated destruction throughout her sinonasal cavities and right orbital apex was identified. Frozen sections revealed negative results for fungal elements and cellular dysplasia but demonstrated widespread inflammation with giant cells.

We've got a woman in her 70s who suddenly can't see out of her right eye. That's pretty alarming. She's also been dealing with double vision and blurry sight for a couple of weeks, and she's had headaches and nasal congestion for a few months. That's quite a mix of symptoms.\n\nNow, she's had a pulmonary embolism before, but no issues with her sinuses or immune system, and she's not diabetic. So, what's going on here? Her vital signs are stable, and she's not running a fever, which is good. But the eye exam shows a right afferent pupillary defect and sixth-nerve palsy. That's pointing to something serious around the eye or even involving the cranial nerves.\n\nThe imaging is really telling. There's abnormal tissue all through her sinuses, and it's destroying the sinus walls and even the skull base. Plus, it's moving into the right orbital apex. That's aggressive. And the lab results show her inflammation markers are high, but her white blood cell count is normal. So, it's not looking like a simple infection.\n\nWhen they did the nasal endoscopy, they found bloody mucus and crusting. That's not good. And the biopsy showed no fungi or cancer, but there are giant cells and a lot of inflammation. Hmm, that sounds like a specific type of inflammation.\n\nOkay, let's think about what this could be. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis comes to mind because it can cause all this destruction and inflammation in the sinuses and orbit. It's known for having giant cells and causing a lot of damage.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. We should consider other possibilities too. Could it be Wegener's granulomatosis? That's similar to granulomatosis with polyangiitis and can present the same way. Or maybe it's a chronic sinus infection that's just really out of control?\n\nNecrotizing sarcoidosis could be another option. It's not as common, but it can cause similar symptoms and findings. And we can't forget about mucormycosis, even though the biopsy didn't show fungi. Maybe it was just missed.\n\nThere's also the possibility of a neoplasm like a sinus or orbital tumor. They can be aggressive and destructive, but usually, the biopsy would show something. And what about an orbital abscess? That could cause some of these symptoms too.\n\nOh, and we should think about IgG4-related disease. It can cause a lot of inflammation and tissue destruction, and it's known for having giant cells. That fits with what we're seeing.\n\nSo, let's rank these possibilities. Based on everything, granulomatosis with polyangiitis seems like the most likely cause. It matches the symptoms, the imaging, and the biopsy findings. Wegener's granulomatosis is a close second since it's so similar.\n\nIgG4-related disease is also high on the list because of the giant cells and inflammation. Necrotizing sarcoidosis is a bit further down, but it's still a possibility. Mucormycosis is lower because the biopsy didn't show fungi, but we can't completely rule it out.\n\nChronic sinus infection seems less likely given the aggressive nature of the disease, and orbital abscess doesn't quite fit the biopsy findings. A neoplasm is possible, but the biopsy would likely show more.\n\nSo, after thinking it all through, granulomatosis with polyangiitis is the top suspect, followed closely by Wegener's granulomatosis and IgG4-related disease.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the condition described, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis** - This condition is known for causing destructive lesions in the sinuses and orbit, along with systemic inflammation, which aligns with the patient's symptoms and biopsy findings.\n\n2. **Wegener's Granulomatosis** - Similar to granulomatosis with polyangiitis, this can present with similar symptoms and is a strong contender given the clinical presentation.\n\n3. **IgG4-related Disease** - This condition can cause significant inflammation and tissue destruction, often with giant cells present, which matches the biopsy results.\n\n4. **Necrotizing Sarcoidosis** - Although less common, it can cause similar symptoms and findings, including giant cell inflammation.\n\n5. **Mucormycosis** - Despite the biopsy not showing fungal elements, this aggressive fungal infection can be missed and is worth considering given the destructive nature of the disease.\n\n6. **Chronic Sinus Infection** - While less likely due to the aggressive nature of the condition, a severe chronic sinus infection could potentially cause some of these symptoms.\n\n7. **Orbital Abscess** - This could cause some of the eye-related symptoms, but the biopsy findings do not strongly support this.\n\n8. **Sinus or Orbital Tumor** - A neoplasm could cause destructive changes, but the biopsy would typically show more definitive evidence of malignancy.\n\n9. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome** - This is a rare condition that can cause painful ophthalmoplegia and could be considered given the cranial nerve involvement.\n\n10. **Churg-Strauss Syndrome** - This is another vasculitic condition that could present with similar features, although it is less likely given the specific findings.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top three differential diagnoses are **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis**, **Wegener's Granulomatosis**, and **IgG4-related Disease**, in that order, due to their alignment with the clinical presentation, imaging, and biopsy findings.", "topic": "['Ophthalmology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Clinical Challenge', 'Infectious Diseases']"}

We've got a 32-year-old Hispanic guy who's been dealing with nasal pain and swelling for about six weeks. That's quite a while to be uncomfortable like that. He's already been to the hospital and they gave him antibiotics, but no luck there. So, it's not your run-of-the-mill bacterial infection, I guess.\n\nNow, the swelling is getting worse and it's even spreading to his upper lip. That's not a good sign. He's also having trouble swallowing and has a headache and nasal drainage. Hmm, that's a lot going on. And he's not running a fever, which is interesting, and no high white blood cell count. So, maybe not a typical acute infection?\n\nThe physical exam shows his nose is really tender and swollen, and there's this honey-colored crusting. That's a clue. It makes me think of something fungal, like maybe mucormycosis. But let's not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nThe CT scan shows a lot of swelling and some necrosis. Necrosis is serious. It suggests something aggressive, maybe a necrotizing infection. And there's no bony erosion, so it might not be too deep yet.\n\nNow, looking at the MRI, the swelling is isointense to muscle on T1 and hyperintense on T2. That could mean a lot of things, but the homogenous enhancement after contrast is interesting. It could be an infection or maybe even a tumor.\n\nSo, what could this be? Let's start with the obvious. Mucormycosis is a strong contender given the necrosis and crusting. But let's not forget about other possibilities like aspergillosis or even something bacterial like a chronic infection or abscess.\n\nOh, and there's also the possibility of a neoplasm, like a squamous cell carcinoma. It could explain the necrosis and swelling. But would it explain the crusting? Maybe not.\n\nLet's think about Wegener's granulomatosis too. It can cause necrosis and crusting. But usually, there are other symptoms, like systemic ones. Hmm, maybe not the best fit.\n\nWhat about cocaine abuse? It can cause necrosis in the nose. But there's no mention of drug use, so maybe that's a stretch.\n\nAnd then there's lupus. It can cause all sorts of symptoms, including nasal ones. But again, usually there's more going on systemically.\n\nOkay, let's rank these. Mucormycosis is still top of the list. It fits the necrosis and crusting well. Aspergillosis is next, it can look similar on imaging. Then comes chronic bacterial infection, maybe an abscess. Squamous cell carcinoma is possible but less likely without more systemic signs. Wegener's granulomatosis is in there too, but it's not the best fit. Cocaine abuse and lupus are less likely, but let's keep them in mind.\n\nSo, after going through everything, mucormycosis seems like the most likely culprit. But we should definitely keep an open mind and consider all these possibilities.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Mucormycosis** - This fungal infection is known for causing necrosis and crusting, especially in the nasal area, and fits the patient's symptoms and imaging findings well.\n\n2. **Aspergillosis** - Another fungal infection that can present similarly on imaging and may cause necrosis, making it a strong contender.\n\n3. **Chronic Bacterial Infection/Abscess** - Although antibiotics were ineffective, a chronic or atypical bacterial infection could still be responsible, especially with the persistent swelling and necrosis.\n\n4. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - This type of cancer can cause necrosis and swelling, but typically there would be more systemic signs or a history suggestive of malignancy.\n\n5. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)** - An autoimmune condition that can cause necrosis and crusting, but often includes systemic symptoms which are not prominent here.\n\n6. **Cocaine Abuse** - Can cause nasal necrosis, but there is no mention of drug use in the patient's history.\n\n7. **Lupus (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus)** - Can present with a variety of symptoms including nasal involvement, but usually includes more systemic manifestations.\n\n8. **Nasal T-cell Lymphoma** - A rare form of lymphoma that can cause nasal swelling and necrosis, but may present with systemic symptoms.\n\n9. **Chronic Fungal Sinusitis** - Could cause prolonged symptoms and swelling, but typically does not result in necrosis.\n\n10. **Necrotizing Fasciitis** - A severe bacterial infection that causes rapid tissue necrosis, but usually presents acutely and with systemic signs of infection.\n\nAfter considering all the possibilities and the patient's specific symptoms and test results, mucormycosis remains the most likely diagnosis due to the combination of necrosis, crusting, and the patient's clinical presentation.

Further evaluation with contrasted computed tomography (CT) imaging showed a 3.3×2.9×2.6-cm ossified lesion in the left posterior-lateral cervical soft tissue near the atlanto-axial junction. The lesion was well circumscribed and separate from the underlying bone (Figure 1B). The patient underwent excision of the mass without complication. The gross pathology specimen showed a firm, irregular, encapsulated mass. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Myositis ossificans", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a girl with a neck mass that's been growing for three years after a car accident. That's quite a while, so it's probably not something super aggressive. It's firm, mobile, and tender. Hmm, that tenderness could be important. It's also causing some trouble with movement. Okay, let's see what the imaging says.\n\nThe ultrasound shows dense acoustic shadowing. That usually means something dense, like calcification or ossification. And the CT scan confirms it with a well-defined ossified lesion near the atlanto-axial junction. It's not attached to the bone, so that's interesting. This sounds like it could be a benign process, maybe something like an osteochondroma. They're known for being bony outgrowths and can occur after trauma.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. We should consider other possibilities. Myositis ossificans is another contender. It's when bone forms in soft tissue, often after an injury, which fits her history. And it can cause restricted motion and pain, just like she's experiencing.\n\nThere's also the chance of a fracture from the accident that's healed in an unusual way. Maybe a nonunion fracture where the bones didn't heal together properly and formed a mass instead. That could explain the ossification.\n\nBut what about other benign tumors? An osteoma could be possible. It's a benign bone tumor, and while they're not typically associated with tenderness, they can occur in strange places.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about more serious things, like osteosarcoma. It's a malignant tumor, but it's rare in this area and usually aggressive. The fact that this mass has been growing slowly over three years makes it less likely, but we can't rule it out completely.\n\nHmm, what about a chondroblastoma? They're rare and usually occur in younger people, but they can show up in unusual locations. They might not be the first thing that comes to mind, but let's keep it on the list.\n\nAnd then there's fibrous dysplasia. It's a condition where normal bone gets replaced with fibrous tissue, leading to unusual growths. It could fit, but the post-trauma aspect is more suggestive of myositis ossificans.\n\nNow, let's think about the surgical and pathological findings. The mass was encapsulated and firm, which aligns with something benign like an osteochondroma or myositis ossificans. The fact that it was easily removed also suggests it wasn't highly aggressive.\n\nSo, putting it all together, myositis ossificans seems like the most likely diagnosis. It matches the trauma history, the imaging findings, and the clinical behavior of the mass. Osteochondroma is a close second, but the post-trauma aspect gives myositis ossificans the edge.\n\nIn the end, myositis ossificans is the top suspect, followed by osteochondroma, and then other possibilities like fracture nonunion, osteoma, chondroblastoma, fibrous dysplasia, and the less likely osteosarcoma.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the neck mass, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Myositis Ossificans** - This condition involves bone formation in soft tissue, often after trauma, which aligns with the patient's history and symptoms.\n\n2. **Osteochondroma** - A benign bony growth that can occur near the ends of bones and fits the imaging findings of an ossified lesion.\n\n3. **Fracture Nonunion** - A possible result of a fracture from the accident that did not heal properly, leading to a mass.\n\n4. **Osteoma** - A benign bone tumor that, while typically not tender, could explain the ossified nature of the mass.\n\n5. **Osteosarcoma** - A malignant bone tumor, although rare in this location and typically more aggressive than what is described.\n\n6. **Chondroblastoma** - A rare bone tumor that can occur in unusual locations, which might match the atypical presentation.\n\n7. **Fibrous Dysplasia** - A condition where normal bone is replaced with fibrous tissue, potentially leading to abnormal growths.\n\n8. **Ossifying Fibroma** - A benign fibro-osseous lesion that could present as an ossified mass in the soft tissue.\n\n9. **Desmoid Tumor** - An aggressive fibromatosis that could cause a firm, slow-growing mass, although not typically ossified.\n\n10. **Calcifying Tendonitis** - Involves calcification within a tendon, which might cause a tender, firm mass.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnosis is **Myositis Ossificans**, followed closely by **Osteochondroma**.

He had been born after an uncomplicated pregnancy, during which routine prenatal ultrasonography had not detected any anatomical abnormalities or lesions. On physical examination, there were no abnormalities other than symmetrical submucosal swelling of the floor of the mouth and a midline external punctum present in the submental area (Figure, A). The tongue was displaced posteriorly and superiorly. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the neck and face performed shortly after presentation showed a midline sublingual lesion extending inferiorly through the mylohyoid muscle (Figure, B-D). The intrinsic muscles of the tongue appeared minimally displaced without obvious infiltration; however, the genioglossus muscle was difficult to locate relative to the mass. A thin-walled, multiloculated lesion was identified, measuring approximately 2.0 × 2.5 × 3.2 cm. The mass was bright on T2-weighted imaging and dark on T1-weighted imaging and did not enhance with intravenous gadolinium. There were no obvious fluid-fluid levels or calcifications. When in-phase and out-of-phase images were compared, there was no significant signal intensity drop, suggesting an absence of fat within the lesion. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cystic teratoma (mature)", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a newborn with some pretty concerning symptoms like labored breathing, dry mouth, and trouble with bowel movements. That's a lot going on for someone so tiny. The physical exam shows some interesting stuff too, like swelling under the tongue and a little punctum, or opening, under the chin. That's definitely unusual.\n\nNow, what could this be? My first thought is a thyroglossal duct cyst. These can show up as midline neck masses and sometimes have an external opening, which fits with what we're seeing here. Plus, they can cause problems if they get big enough to press on things.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. What else could it be? Branchial cleft cysts are another possibility. They're congenital anomalies that can appear in the neck, but they're usually not right in the midline. Still, it's worth keeping in mind.\n\nOkay, now let's think about the imaging. The MRI shows a thin-walled, multiloculated lesion that's bright on T2 and dark on T1. It doesn't enhance with gadolinium, which suggests it's not vascular. And there's no fat in it, so that rules out some other things. This sounds a lot like a cyst, maybe a thyroglossal duct cyst or something similar.\n\nBut let's not forget about other possibilities. Could it be a dermoid cyst? These can appear similarly on imaging, but they often have a different clinical presentation. They might also show some fat or calcifications, which we don't see here.\n\nWhat about a hemangioma? These are common in infants, but they usually enhance with gadolinium because they're vascular. So, that's probably not it.\n\nLet's think about the clinical picture again. The baby's symptoms are pretty severe, with significant respiratory distress. That makes me think of something that's causing a lot of compression or obstruction. A large cyst, like a thyroglossal duct cyst, could definitely do that.\n\nBut wait, what if it's something rarer, like an ectopic thyroid tissue? This could present as a midline mass and cause similar symptoms. It's not as common, but it's worth considering.\n\nOkay, let's go back to the imaging. The lesion extends through the mylohyoid muscle, which is interesting. That's something to consider when thinking about what kind of cyst it might be.\n\nCould it be a ranula? These are mucous retention cysts that appear in the floor of the mouth. They can be present at birth and might fit the imaging characteristics. But they usually don't have an external punctum.\n\nLet's not forget about a lingual thyroid. This is when thyroid tissue is located in the tongue, and it can cause similar symptoms. But it would likely show some different imaging characteristics, like enhancement with gadolinium.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Based on everything, a thyroglossal duct cyst still seems like the most likely diagnosis. It fits the clinical presentation and the imaging findings. But it's always good to keep other possibilities in mind, like a dermoid cyst or a ranula, just in case.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the provided information, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the newborn's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst** - This is a common congenital neck mass that can present as a midline swelling and may have an external opening, fitting the clinical and imaging findings.\n\n2. **Branchial Cleft Cyst** - Although typically not midline, these congenital anomalies can present in the neck region and should be considered.\n\n3. **Dermoid Cyst** - These cysts can appear similarly on imaging but often have different clinical presentations and may show fat or calcifications, which are absent here.\n\n4. **Ranula** - A mucous retention cyst that can occur in the floor of the mouth, fitting some imaging characteristics, but usually without an external punctum.\n\n5. **Lingual Thyroid** - Ectopic thyroid tissue in the tongue can cause similar symptoms, but would likely show different imaging characteristics, such as enhancement with gadolinium.\n\n6. **Hemangioma** - Common in infants, but typically enhances with gadolinium due to its vascular nature, which doesn't match the imaging findings.\n\n7. **Epidermoid Cyst** - Similar to dermoid cysts but without teratoid elements; however, the absence of fat or calcifications makes this less likely.\n\n8. **Thyroid Dysgenesis** - Abnormal development of the thyroid gland could present with a mass, but the imaging characteristics don't strongly support this.\n\n9. **Lymphatic Malformation** - Could present as a cystic mass, but often has different imaging features and may not have an external punctum.\n\n10. **Teratoma** - A congenital tumor containing several tissue types, which might present with a complex mass, but the imaging doesn't show the typical heterogeneous features.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnosis is a **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst**, as it best fits the clinical presentation and imaging findings. However, a **Ranula** and **Dermoid Cyst** should also be kept in mind as possible alternatives.", "topic": "['Otolaryngology', 'Salivary Gland Disorders', 'Pediatrics', 'Neonatology']"}

The patient had a history of asthma and had recently been hospitalized after radiologic findings of pulmonary infiltrates. The patient was diagnosed with pneumonia, myocarditis, and hypereosinophilic syndrome and received high-dose intravenous corticosteroids. At hospital discharge, the patient’s medications were changed to prednisone, 11 mg orally once daily, and azathioprine, 100 mg orally once daily. Although the severity of the ocular symptoms was variable, there was no improvement with the described medication regimen or with currently prescribed topical corticosteroids given 4 times daily in both eyes. The patient denied rash, headache, and joint pain. Serologic testing ruled out infectious causes of inflammation. On examination, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25 OU. Intraocular pressure for the right eye was 16 mm Hg and for the left eye was 24 mm Hg. Slitlamp examination showed trace hyperemia of the right eye and 2+ diffuse scleral hyperemia of the left eye (Figure). Corneas were clear bilaterally, and sensitivity was symmetric and full. There was no cell or flare in the anterior chamber, and she had clear lenses with normal irises. The fundus examination was unremarkable bilaterally with no vitreous cell or haze, a flat macula, a cup-disc ratio of 0.3, and a peripheral retina without holes or tears. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Churg-Strauss syndrome (eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis)", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 50-year-old woman dealing with some pretty persistent eye issues. She's had redness and pain for 9 months, starting in one eye and then moving to both. That's a long time to be uncomfortable, and it's not just a simple issue if it's sticking around like that.\n\nNow, she's got a history of hypertension, diabetes, and asthma. Those are significant, but they might not directly tie into her eye problems. What's more interesting is her recent hospital stay. She was diagnosed with pneumonia, myocarditis, and hypereosinophilic syndrome. That's a lot going on, and it suggests her immune system might be acting up.\n\nShe's on prednisone and azathioprine, which are pretty strong meds for keeping inflammation and the immune system in check. But, they're not doing the trick for her eyes. That's a clue. It means whatever's causing her eye symptoms is tough to treat or maybe not what we expect.\n\nThe eye exam shows some hyperemia, especially in the left eye, but no cells in the anterior chamber. That's odd. Usually, with uveitis, you'd expect some cells there. So, maybe it's not traditional uveitis. The rest of the eye exam is pretty normal, which is good. No big problems in the back of the eye, so we can probably rule out some of the more serious posterior segment issues.\n\nInfectious causes have been ruled out, so we can cross those off the list. That's helpful because it narrows things down to autoimmune or inflammatory causes.\n\nLet's think about what could be going on. Given her history, Churg-Strauss syndrome comes to mind. It's linked to asthma and can cause all sorts of systemic issues, including eye problems. But, it's not a perfect fit because we're not seeing the typical uveitis signs.\n\nSarcoidosis is another possibility. It can cause uveitis and systemic issues, but usually, you'd see more signs in the eye exam, like granulomas. We don't have that here, so it's a maybe.\n\nBehçet's disease is another autoimmune condition that can cause uveitis, but it often comes with other symptoms like mouth sores or skin issues, which she doesn't have. So, that's probably not it.\n\nRelapsing polychondritis could be a contender. It involves cartilage inflammation and can affect the eyes, but we don't have any information about cartilage issues, so it's a stretch.\n\nJuvenile rheumatoid arthritis-associated iridocyclitis is unlikely because she's too old for that, and it doesn't match her systemic history.\n\nLet's not forget about masquerade syndromes, like lymphoma or leukemia, which can mimic uveitis. They might explain the lack of response to treatment, but we'd probably see more systemic signs.\n\nOkay, so what's the best fit? Churg-Strauss syndrome makes sense given her asthma and systemic history, but it's not perfect. Sarcoidosis is possible, but we're missing some typical signs. Relapsing polychondritis is interesting, but we need more info on cartilage issues.\n\nAfter thinking it through, I'd say Churg-Strauss syndrome is the most likely, given her asthma and systemic involvement. But, we should keep sarcoidosis and relapsing polychondritis on the radar, just in case.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with a focus on potential autoimmune or inflammatory causes:\n\n1. **Churg-Strauss Syndrome** - This condition is characterized by asthma, eosinophilia, and systemic vasculitis, which aligns with the patient's history of asthma and hypereosinophilic syndrome.\n\n2. **Sarcoidosis** - Although typically associated with granulomatous uveitis, sarcoidosis can present with non-granulomatous uveitis and systemic symptoms.\n\n3. **Relapsing Polychondritis** - This condition involves cartilage inflammation and can affect the eyes, but more information on cartilage involvement would be needed for a stronger consideration.\n\n4. **Behçet's Disease** - This autoimmune disorder can cause uveitis but usually presents with additional symptoms like oral and genital ulcers, which are absent in this case.\n\n5. **Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis-Associated Iridocyclitis** - Unlikely due to the patient's age and lack of typical systemic manifestations.\n\n6. **Masquerade Syndrome (e.g., Lymphoma or Leukemia)** - These conditions can mimic uveitis and might explain the lack of response to treatment, but more systemic signs would be expected.\n\n7. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegener's Granulomatosis)** - This condition can involve the eyes and respiratory system but typically includes renal involvement and c-ANCA positivity.\n\n8. **Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis** - A variant of Churg-Strauss syndrome that involves asthma, eosinophilia, and vasculitis, fitting the patient's profile.\n\n9. **PAN (Polyarteritis Nodosa)** - A systemic vasculitis that can involve various organs but is less commonly associated with uveitis.\n\n10. **Cogan's Syndrome** - Characterized by ocular and audiovestibular symptoms, but the absence of hearing loss makes this less likely.\n\nAfter considering all the information, Churg-Strauss syndrome (now known as Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis) appears to be the most likely diagnosis, given the patient's history of asthma and systemic involvement. Sarcoidosis and relapsing polychondritis should also be kept in mind as potential alternatives.

Five days before arrival, he developed throat pain, rhinorrhea, nonproductive cough, and fever. Two days later he noticed a maculopapular rash on his neck and trunk, which later involved his upper and lower extremities. He did not smoke and only drank alcohol occasionally. He was living in Japan and recently visited a neighboring island but denied any international travel. On examination, his blood pressure was 142/84 mm Hg; temperature, 38.3°C; pulse, 91/min; respiratory rate, 24/min; and oxygen saturation, 97% on ambient air. He was alert and oriented. There were no mucosal lesions or conjunctival injection. A maculopapular rash was noted on the trunk and extremities (Figure) as well as the palms and soles. The face was not involved. The lungs were clear to auscultation. No hepatosplenomegaly was noted. Neurologic examination, including results of motor, sensory, and reflex testing, was unremarkable. There was no neck stiffness or lymphadenopathy. Laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 2900/μL (80% neutrophils, 13% lymphocytes, 6% monocytes, 0% eosinophils, and 0% basophils); hemoglobin level, 15.2 g/dL; and platelet count, 187 ×103/μL. Serum electrolyte levels were normal. Aspartate aminotransferase level was 635 U/L (10.6 μkat/L); alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 491 U/L (8.2 μkat/L); lactate dehydrogenase, 807 U/L (13.48 μkat/L); γ-glutamyltransferase, 329 U/L (5.49 μkat/L); and bilirubin, 1.3 mg/dL (22.24 μmol/L). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Measles", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a guy in his 30s who's been feeling under the weather for about five days. He's got a fever, he's not eating well, and there's this rash. So, he started off with a sore throat, runny nose, and a cough, and then a couple of days later, bam, a rash shows up. It's on his neck, trunk, and now it's even on his arms and legs. Plus, it's on his palms and soles, which is kind of unusual. He's living in Japan and hasn't traveled far, just to a nearby island. \n\nNow, let's check his vitals. His blood pressure is a bit on the high side, and he's definitely got a fever. His heart rate is normal, but he's breathing a bit faster than usual. Oxygen levels are fine, so that's a relief. He's alert and aware, which is good. No mouth sores or red eyes, so we can probably rule out a few things there. \n\nThe rash is maculopapular and it's spread quite a bit, but it's not on his face. His lungs are clear, so no coughing or breathing issues. No signs of an enlarged liver or spleen. His neuro exam is normal, so no nerve problems. No neck stiffness, which is good, and no swollen lymph nodes. \n\nNow, let's look at his lab results. His white blood cell count is low, which could mean his immune system is taking a hit. Neutrophils are high, though, which is interesting. His liver enzymes, AST and ALT, are really high, so something's going on with his liver. LDH is also up, and so is GGT. His bilirubin is slightly elevated, but not too bad. \n\nOkay, so what could this be? Let's start with some possibilities. Given the fever, rash, and liver involvement, viral hepatitis comes to mind. Hepatitis A or B could fit, but the rash on the palms and soles is making me think. \n\nHow about infectious mononucleosis? It can cause fever, rash, and liver issues, but usually, there are swollen glands, and he doesn't have that. \n\nThen there's dengue fever. It's common in some parts of Asia, and it can cause a rash on the palms and soles. The fever and low white blood cell count fit too. But wait, there's no mention of bleeding or low platelets, which are common with dengue. \n\nWhat about measles? It causes a rash, but usually, there are other symptoms like cough, runny nose, and Koplik spots. He doesn't have those, so it's less likely. \n\nChikungunya could be another option. It causes fever and rash, and it's found in some Asian regions. But it usually comes with joint pain, which he doesn't have. \n\nWe should also think about drug-induced liver injury. Some medications can cause a rash and liver problems, but he didn't mention taking any new drugs. \n\nHow about acute HIV infection? It can cause fever, rash, and liver issues, and it fits the profile. But we don't have any information about risk factors or other symptoms like sore throat or swollen lymph nodes. \n\nThere's also secondary syphilis. It can cause a rash on the palms and soles, and it fits the age group. But we don't have any history of risk factors or other symptoms. \n\nNow, let's think about Kawasaki disease. It's more common in Japan, where he lives, and it can cause fever, rash, and liver issues. It often affects children, but it can occur in adults too. The lack of lymphadenopathy and oral mucosal changes makes it less likely, though. \n\nFinally, there's leptospirosis. It can cause fever, rash, and liver issues, and it's found in some parts of Asia. But we don't have any information about exposure to water sources or other symptoms like muscle pain. \n\nSo, after going through all of this, I think the top possibilities are viral hepatitis, dengue fever, and secondary syphilis. They all fit some parts of the picture, but we need more information to be sure. \n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Viral Hepatitis** - The combination of fever, rash, and significantly elevated liver enzymes suggests a possible viral hepatitis infection, such as hepatitis A or B.\n\n2. **Dengue Fever** - The presence of fever, rash on the palms and soles, and low white blood cell count aligns with dengue fever, which is prevalent in some Asian regions.\n\n3. **Secondary Syphilis** - The rash on the palms and soles is characteristic of secondary syphilis, which can also present with systemic symptoms like fever.\n\n4. **Infectious Mononucleosis** - Although the patient lacks swollen lymph nodes, infectious mononucleosis can cause fever, rash, and liver enzyme elevation.\n\n5. **Chikungunya** - This viral infection, found in some Asian areas, can cause fever and rash, but typically includes joint pain, which is absent here.\n\n6. **Acute HIV Infection** - Fever, rash, and elevated liver enzymes can occur in acute HIV infection, but specific risk factors or additional symptoms are lacking.\n\n7. **Kawasaki Disease** - While more common in children, Kawasaki disease can occur in adults and presents with fever, rash, and sometimes liver involvement, although lymphadenopathy and oral changes are typically present.\n\n8. **Leptospirosis** - This bacterial infection, common in wet environments, can cause fever, rash, and liver issues, but usually includes muscle pain and exposure history.\n\n9. **Drug-Induced Liver Injury** - Although the patient didn't report new medications, drug-induced liver injury can cause rash and liver enzyme elevation.\n\n10. **Measles** - While it causes a rash and fever, measles usually includes respiratory symptoms and Koplik spots, which are not present here.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top three differential diagnoses are **Viral Hepatitis**, **Dengue Fever**, and **Secondary Syphilis**, as they most closely align with the patient's symptoms and lab findings.

Bulging of the right eye was first noted 6 months earlier elsewhere when she reported progressive proptosis, worsening vision, and tearing in the right eye. She did not report any pain or diplopia. Visual acuity was 20/150 OD (no improvement with pinhole) and 20/20 OS. Pupillary reaction and confrontational visual fields were normal. External examination was notable for proptosis of 7 mm, hypoglobus, and resistance to retropulsion. A firm, nontender mass was palpable in the right superotemporal orbit. The palpebral lobe of the right lacrimal gland was erythematous and prominent compared with the normal-appearing left lacrimal gland. Ocular motility showed −2 abduction deficit, right eye. Slitlamp examination revealed pseudophakia and posterior capsular opacification (right > left), but was otherwise normal. Sensation was normal in the V1, V2 distribution, and there was no preauricular, submandibular, or anterior cervical lymphadenopathy. Computed tomographic scan of the orbits without contrast from an outside facility revealed a spherical mass of unclear cause in the area of the right lacrimal gland. No lytic bone changes or bone remodeling could be seen (Figure 1). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Solitary fibrous tumor", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her mid-60s who's noticed her right eye starting to bulge over the past six months. That's quite a while, so it's likely something that's been developing gradually. She's also having trouble seeing well out of that eye, and there's some tearing. But no pain or double vision, which is interesting.\n\nNow, she's had breast cancer before, so that's definitely something to keep in mind. And she's got some benign thyroid nodules too. Hmm, could there be a connection? Maybe, maybe not, but let's not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nHer vision in the right eye is pretty poor, 20/150, and it doesn't get better with a pinhole. That suggests it's not just a simple refractive error. The left eye is fine, though. Pupils are reacting normally, and she doesn't have any issues with her visual fields. That's good, I guess.\n\nWhen I look at her eye, there's definitely something going on. There's 7 mm of proptosis, and the eye seems to be sitting a bit low - that's what they call hypoglobus, right? And when I try to push the eye back, there's some resistance. That's interesting. There's also a firm, non-tender mass in the superotemporal part of her orbit. And the lacrimal gland on that side is looking red and swollen. Hmm, that's a clue.\n\nShe's having trouble moving her eye to the side, a -2 abduction deficit. That's got to be uncomfortable. But sensation around her face is normal, and there aren't any swollen lymph nodes that I can find. That's a relief, I suppose.\n\nThe CT scan shows a spherical mass in the lacrimal gland area, but no bone changes. That's good because it means whatever this is, it's not eating away at the bone. So, what could it be?\n\nLet's start with the obvious. Given her history, I'm thinking about metastatic breast cancer. It's a possibility, right? Breast cancer can spread to the orbit. But there's no bone involvement, which is a bit odd for a metastasis.\n\nNext, there's the idea of a lacrimal gland tumor. Pleomorphic adenomas are common in this area, and they can be slow-growing, which fits her timeline. But they're usually benign, so they might not cause significant visual problems unless they get really big.\n\nWhat about lymphoma? It's a possibility, especially since it can be slow-growing and painless. But usually, you'd expect some lymph node involvement or more systemic symptoms.\n\nAn inflammatory condition like orbital pseudotumor could be in the mix too. Those can cause swelling and some pain, but she's not really complaining of pain, just discomfort from the proptosis.\n\nOh, and there's the chance of a dermoid cyst. They're usually found in younger people, but they can appear at any age. They're benign, though, and might not cause this much trouble unless they get infected or ruptured.\n\nLet's not forget about other benign tumors like oncocytomas or Warthin's tumors. They're not as common in the lacrimal gland, but they could fit the bill.\n\nNow, considering everything, I think the most likely culprit is a pleomorphic adenoma. It matches the slow growth and the location in the lacrimal gland. But I can't completely rule out metastatic breast cancer or lymphoma without more information.\n\nIn the end, I'm going to stick with pleomorphic adenoma as the top possibility, but I'm keeping an open mind. It's always tricky when there's a history of cancer involved.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the condition described, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Metastatic Breast Cancer** - Given the patient's history of breast cancer, this is a strong consideration, especially with the orbital involvement.\n\n2. **Pleomorphic Adenoma** - A common benign tumor of the lacrimal gland, fitting the slow growth and location described.\n\n3. **Orbital Lymphoma** - A possibility due to the slow, painless progression, although typically associated with more systemic symptoms or lymphadenopathy.\n\n4. **Orbital Pseudotumor (Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome)** - Could present with swelling and discomfort, but usually involves pain.\n\n5. **Dermoid Cyst** - Although more common in younger individuals, it remains a possibility due to the superotemporal location and slow growth.\n\n6. **Lacrimal Gland Carcinoma** - A malignant tumor that could present similarly to a pleomorphic adenoma but with more aggressive features.\n\n7. **Oncocytoma** - A benign tumor that could occur in the lacrimal gland, though less common.\n\n8. **Warthin's Tumor** - Typically found in the salivary glands, but could potentially occur in the orbit.\n\n9. **Sarcoidosis** - Could involve the orbit and present with proptosis, although usually with systemic symptoms.\n\n10. **Thyroid Eye Disease** - Although she has benign thyroid nodules, this condition is more associated with Graves' disease and not typically a mass in the lacrimal gland area.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses, in order of likelihood, are:\n\n1. **Pleomorphic Adenoma** - Given the slow growth, location, and characteristics of the mass.\n2. **Metastatic Breast Cancer** - Due to the patient's history and the potential for orbital metastasis.\n3. **Orbital Lymphoma** - Considering the painless, progressive nature of the symptoms.\n\nThese three options seem to best fit the clinical presentation and history provided.

These lesions developed from local freckles beginning at 6 months of age and gradually spread with protruding growth. Over the past 2 years, tumors started to form and develop rapidly, becoming ulcerative and bleeding. The patient was intellectually standard and denied blurred vision, impaired hearing, or any other systemic symptoms. He lived in a remote area in China. His parents were first cousins, but no similar cutaneous presentation was reported by other relatives. The physical examination revealed scaly skin with diffuse warty lesions on sun-exposed areas. The patient’s face was severely disfigured, with numerous ulcerative, malodorous tumors (Figure 1A). The general examination findings, including neurological and ophthalmologic tests, were unremarkable. The lesional discharge culture revealed infection with Proteus vulgaris. Punch biopsy of a paranasal mass was performed (Figure 1B). Craniofacial computed tomography showed heterogenous soft tissue masses located superficially without bony invasion. No signs of cerebral atrophy were noticed. Genetic testing was advised but was declined. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Xeroderma pigmentosum", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 6-year-old boy with these unusual skin growths that started from freckles and are now turning into tumors. They're on sun-exposed skin, which makes me think about conditions that are sensitive to sunlight. \n\nFirst, I'm considering Xeroderma Pigmentosum. It's a genetic disorder where the skin can't repair UV damage, leading to skin cancers. That fits with the sun-exposed lesions and the fact that his parents are first cousins, which could point to a recessive genetic condition. \n\nBut wait, there's more to think about. The rapid growth and ulceration of these tumors are pretty aggressive. That makes me think of something more sinister, like a malignancy. Could it be something like Basal Cell Carcinoma? It's common in sun-exposed areas, but usually not this aggressive in someone so young. \n\nOh, and there's that infection with Proteus vulgaris. That's interesting. It could just be a secondary infection, but it might also be a clue. Maybe the skin's immune defenses are compromised, which happens in some genetic conditions. \n\nNow, let's not forget the family history. The parents being first cousins makes me think of autosomal recessive disorders again. That strengthens the case for Xeroderma Pigmentosum or maybe Bloom Syndrome, which also involves sun sensitivity and genetic instability. \n\nBut I'm not sure about Bloom Syndrome. It usually comes with more systemic issues, like short stature or a higher risk of cancers elsewhere, which this boy doesn't seem to have. \n\nHmm, what about Epidermodysplasia Verruciformis? It's a rare condition where the skin is prone to HPV infections, leading to wart-like growths. That could explain the warty lesions and maybe even the tumors if they became malignant. \n\nAlso, the fact that there's no neurological or ophthalmologic involvement is important. It rules out conditions like Tuberous Sclerosis, which often has brain and eye symptoms. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I think Xeroderma Pigmentosum is still the most likely diagnosis. It explains the sun sensitivity, the aggressive skin tumors, and the genetic background. \n\nBut I should keep Epidermodysplasia Verruciformis in mind too, just in case. It fits some aspects, like the warty lesions, but not as well as Xeroderma Pigmentosum overall. \n\nIn the end, I'm confident that Xeroderma Pigmentosum is the best fit for this boy's symptoms and history.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the 6-year-old boy is Xeroderma Pigmentosum. This condition is characterized by an inability to repair DNA damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) light, leading to sun-sensitive skin changes and a high risk of skin cancers. The fact that the lesions are on sun-exposed skin, the aggressive nature of the tumors, and the consanguinity of the parents (first cousins) support this diagnosis. While other conditions like Epidermodysplasia Verruciformis could be considered due to the warty lesions, Xeroderma Pigmentosum fits the overall clinical picture more comprehensively. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Xeroderma Pigmentosum** - The most likely diagnosis given the sun sensitivity, aggressive skin tumors, and genetic background.\n2. **Epidermodysplasia Verruciformis** - Considered due to the warty lesions, but less likely than Xeroderma Pigmentosum.\n3. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** - Possible due to the sun-exposed nature of the lesions, but unusual for such aggressive presentation at a young age.\n4. **Bloom Syndrome** - Autosomal recessive disorder with sun sensitivity, but typically involves more systemic features.\n5. **Tuberous Sclerosis Complex** - Unlikely due to the lack of neurological or ophthalmologic involvement.\n6. **Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome (Gorlin Syndrome)** - Possible, but would expect more systemic features like jaw keratocysts or palmar pits.\n7. **Muir-Torre Syndrome** - A subtype of Lynch syndrome with skin manifestations, but usually involves internal malignancies.\n8. **Ataxia-Telangiectasia** - Unlikely due to the absence of neurological symptoms or telangiectasias.\n9. **Dyskeratosis Congita** - Typically involves nail and mucosal changes, which are not present here.\n10. **Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Cancer** - Unrelated to the skin findings described.\n\n## Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this.

It's a rare condition where the skin is prone to HPV infections, leading to wart-like growths. That could explain the warty lesions and maybe even the tumors if they became malignant. \n\nAlso, the fact that there's no neurological or ophthalmologic involvement is important. It rules out conditions like Tuberous Sclerosis, which often has brain and eye symptoms. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I think Xeroderma Pigmentosum is still the most likely diagnosis. It explains the sun sensitivity, the aggressive skin tumors, and the genetic background. \n\nBut I should keep Epidermodysplasia Verruciformis in mind too, just in case. It fits some aspects, like the warty lesions, but not as well as Xeroderma Pigmentosum overall. \n\nIn the end, I'm confident that Xeroderma Pigmentosum is the best fit for this boy's symptoms and history. \n\nNow, let's think about other possibilities. Basal Cell Carcinoma is one, but it's rare for it to be this aggressive in such a young child. \n\nBloom Syndrome is another, but it usually has more systemic features that aren't present here. \n\nTuberous Sclerosis is unlikely because there are no neurological or ophthalmologic symptoms. \n\nNevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome could be a contender, but we'd expect to see more systemic signs like jaw keratocysts. \n\nMuir-Torre Syndrome involves skin and internal tumors, but there's no mention of internal cancers here. \n\nAtaxia-Telangiectasia doesn't fit because there are no neurological symptoms or telangiectasias. \n\nDyskeratosis Congita typically involves nail changes and other mucosal symptoms, which aren't present. \n\nHereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Cancer doesn't match the skin findings at all. \n\nSo, after considering all these, Xeroderma Pigmentosum still seems like the best fit, followed by Epidermodysplasia Verruciformis as a close second. The others don't match as well with the symptoms and history. \n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the 6-year-old boy is Xeroderma Pigmentosum. This condition is characterized by an inability to repair DNA damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) light, leading to sun-sensitive skin changes and a high risk of skin cancers. The fact that the lesions are on sun-exposed skin, the aggressive nature of the tumors, and the consanguinity of the parents (first cousins) support this diagnosis. While other conditions like Epidermodysplasia Verruciformis could be considered due to the warty lesions, Xeroderma Pigmentosum fits the overall clinical picture more comprehensively. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Xeroderma Pigmentosum** - The most likely diagnosis given the sun sensitivity, aggressive skin tumors, and genetic background.\n2. **Epidermodysplasia Verruciformis** - Considered due to the warty lesions, but less likely than Xeroderma Pigmentosum.\n3. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** - Possible due to the sun-exposed nature of the lesions, but unusual for such aggressive presentation at a young age.\n4. **Bloom Syndrome** - Autosomal recessive disorder with sun sensitivity, but typically involves more systemic features.\n5. **Tuberous Sclerosis Complex** - Unlikely due to the lack of neurological or ophthalmologic involvement.\n6. **Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome (Gorlin Syndrome)** - Possible, but would expect more systemic features like jaw keratocysts or palmar pits.\n7. **Muir-Torre Syndrome** - A subtype of Lynch syndrome with skin manifestations, but usually involves internal malignancies.\n8. **Ataxia-Telangiectasia** - Unlikely due to the absence of neurological symptoms or telangiectasias.\n9. **Dyskeratosis Congita** - Typically involves nail and mucosal changes, which are not present here.\n10. **Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Cancer** - Unrelated to the skin findings described.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Congenital Defects', 'Pediatrics']"}

She also reported a 1-week history of left eye discomfort and left-sided tinnitus and a 1-day history of binocular horizontal diplopia. She denied any history of recent trauma. Ophthalmologic examination at the time revealed visual acuities of 20/30 OD and 20/40 OS. Intraocular pressures were 15 mm Hg OD and 21 mm Hg OS, with a widened pulse pressure of the left eye. Extraocular motility revealed a left eye abduction deficit. Pupils and confrontational visual fields were unremarkable. Hertel measured 16 mm and 17 mm, respectively. Slitlamp examination of the right eye was unremarkable, but examination of the left eye revealed a large subconjunctival hemorrhage and engorged episcleral veins (Figure 1). Fundus examination of both eyes was unremarkable. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Dural cavernous fistula", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 63-year-old woman who's been dealing with some pretty uncomfortable symptoms in her left eye. It's been swollen and red for about three weeks, and she's also been feeling some discomfort there for a week. Plus, she's got this tinnitus on the left side, which is interesting. And just recently, she started experiencing double vision. That's a lot going on!\n\nFirst off, the eye swelling and redness make me think of something like orbital cellulitis. It's pretty common for infections to cause swelling and redness, especially if there's some kind of discharge or fever, but she didn't mention any of that. So, maybe not orbital cellulitis just yet.\n\nThe tinnitus is a curious symptom. It's on the same side as the eye issues, so there might be a connection. Could it be something vascular, like a carotid-cavernous fistula? That would explain the tinnitus and the eye symptoms, like the swelling and those engorged veins.\n\nSpeaking of veins, the engorged episcleral veins are a big clue. They suggest something is causing increased pressure or blood flow in the eye. A carotid-cavernous fistula could definitely do that, but let's not jump to conclusions.\n\nThe double vision is another piece of the puzzle. It's horizontal, which usually points to an issue with the lateral rectus muscle. And guess what? The muscle is controlled by the abducens nerve, which can be affected by things like increased pressure in the orbit. So, that fits with our vascular theory.\n\nBut wait, what about the widened pulse pressure in the left eye? That's a bit unusual. It could be related to blood flow changes, maybe from a vascular issue like a dural shunt. Those can cause some weird blood flow patterns.\n\nNow, let's think about other possibilities. Could it be something like a thyroid eye disease? That can cause eye swelling and muscle issues, but it usually doesn't cause tinnitus or these specific vascular signs.\n\nWhat about a orbital lymphoma? It could cause swelling and some of these symptoms, but it's not really known for causing tinnitus or these acute vascular changes.\n\nOkay, let's put it all together. Considering the combination of symptoms—especially the tinnitus, the engorged veins, the double vision, and the widened pulse pressure—a carotid-cavernous fistula seems like a strong contender. It ties together the vascular and neurological symptoms nicely.\n\nBut, we should also consider other vascular issues, like a dural arteriovenous shunt. Those can cause similar symptoms by altering blood flow in the head.\n\nIn the end, after thinking it through, I'm leaning towards a carotid-cavernous fistula as the most likely diagnosis. It just fits well with everything we're seeing. But, we should definitely keep dural arteriovenous shunt in mind as a close second.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the symptoms and examination findings, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step presenting a unique potential diagnosis:\n\n1. **Orbital Cellulitis** - This condition often presents with eye swelling and redness, but typically includes signs of infection like fever or discharge, which are not present here.\n\n2. **Carotid-Cavernous Fistula** - This vascular issue could explain the combination of eye swelling, redness, tinnitus, and engorged episcleral veins due to abnormal blood flow.\n\n3. **Dural Arteriovenous Shunt** - Similar to a carotid-cavernous fistula, this could cause altered blood flow leading to tinnitus and ocular symptoms.\n\n4. **Thyroid Eye Disease** - This condition can cause eye swelling and muscle issues, but it doesn't typically cause tinnitus or the specific vascular signs seen here.\n\n5. **Orbital Lymphoma** - This could cause swelling and some of the symptoms, but it's not known for causing tinnitus or acute vascular changes.\n\n6. **Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis** - This could lead to eye swelling and neurological symptoms, but usually presents with more severe systemic signs.\n\n7. **Temporal Arteritis** - This condition can cause eye symptoms, but it's more common in older individuals and often includes jaw claudication or headaches.\n\n8. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension** - This can cause tinnitus and eye symptoms due to increased intracranial pressure, but usually includes papilledema.\n\n9. **Orbital Varix** - This is a vascular anomaly that can cause intermittent proptosis and eye symptoms, but may not explain all the findings.\n\n10. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome** - This rare condition can cause painful ophthalmoplegia and might explain some symptoms, but it's less likely given the vascular findings.\n\nAfter considering all the symptoms and test results, the top two differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Carotid-Cavernous Fistula** - This remains the most likely diagnosis due to the combination of eye symptoms, tinnitus, and vascular findings.\n2. **Dural Arteriovenous Shunt** - This is a close second, as it could also explain the altered blood flow and associated symptoms.\n\nThese vascular conditions best account for the unique combination of symptoms presented by the patient.", "topic": "['Ophthalmology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Audiology and Hearing']"}

She denied additional ocular symptoms and reported no relevant medical, ocular, or family history; medication use; or allergies. The findings of a review of systems were unremarkable. A workup for posterior uveitis was initiated, and the patient began therapy with oral antiviral and oral corticosteroid medications. One week later, her symptoms had worsened, and she was referred for consultation. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/15 OD and 20/60 OS. Intraocular pressures, extraocular movements, visual fields by confrontation, and pupil responses were normal. Anterior segment examination and dilated fundus examination of the right eye had normal findings. However, the left eye had 3+ anterior chamber cell and 1+ flare, nongranulomatous keratic precipitates, and a clear lens. The dilated fundus examination revealed 2+ vitritis, a hyperemic disc with blurred margins, macular striae with a blunted foveal reflex, and vascular sheathing with segmental periarteriolar inflammatory plaques in multiple quadrants. The peripheral retina had well-demarcated peripheral retinal whitening with scalloped margins and intraretinal hemorrhages in all quadrants (Figure 1A and B). Four days later, repeat fundus photography showed that the peripheral lesions had coalesced into larger circumferential necrotic regions (Figure 1C). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Acute retinal necrosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her 30s who's seeing floaters in her left eye. That's pretty common, but it can mean a lot of things. Hmm, she's also got some inflammation in the eye, like cells in the anterior chamber and vitritis. That's pointing towards some kind of uveitis. But what's causing it? Let's see.\n\nFirst, I'm thinking about acute retinal necrosis. Those symptoms and the retinal changes she's showing fit the bill. It's a condition that can be caused by herpes viruses, like HSV or CMV. That's a strong possibility.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. What about other causes of uveitis? Behçet's disease could be a contender. It can cause similar symptoms, with the ocular inflammation and retinal vasculitis. Plus, it's a systemic condition that can affect the eyes.\n\nOh, and there's also sarcoidosis. It's another systemic disease that can cause uveitis and retinal issues. But usually, you'd expect more systemic symptoms or findings like granulomas, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nNow, let's think about CMV retinitis. It's more common in people with weakened immune systems, but it can happen in healthy individuals too. The retinal changes, like the perivascular inflammation and necrosis, could fit.\n\nHmm, what about Eale's disease? It's a bit of a wildcard, but it can cause retinal inflammation and neovascularization. It's not as common, but it's worth considering.\n\nOh, and we can't forget about syphilis. Ocular syphilis can cause a range of eye problems, including uveitis and retinal changes. It's a sneaky disease that can mimic a lot of other conditions.\n\nNow, let's go back to acute retinal necrosis. The progression of her symptoms, with the retinal lesions coalescing, really points to this. It's a classic sign of ARN.\n\nBut wait, let's not rule out other herpes viruses, like HSV. It can cause similar retinal problems and is a common cause of ARN.\n\nOkay, what about toxoplasmosis? It's another condition that can cause retinal inflammation, but usually, you'd see more distinct retinal lesions, like a 'headlight in fog' appearance.\n\nAnd then there's tuberculosis. It can cause ocular inflammation and retinal changes, but you'd often expect some systemic symptoms or a history of exposure.\n\nFinally, let's consider fungal endophthalmitis. It's rare, but it can cause similar symptoms, especially in certain risk groups. The retinal changes and inflammation could fit.\n\nSo, after thinking it all through, I'd say acute retinal necrosis, likely from a herpes virus like HSV or CMV, is the most likely diagnosis. But I'm keeping an open mind about the other possibilities, especially Behçet's disease and syphilis.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Acute Retinal Necrosis (ARN)** - This is a strong contender given the symptoms of floaters, inflammation, and retinal changes, which are characteristic of ARN, often caused by herpes viruses like HSV or CMV.\n\n2. **Behçet's Disease** - This condition can cause similar ocular inflammation and retinal vasculitis, although systemic symptoms are typically present.\n\n3. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Retinitis** - While more common in immunocompromised individuals, CMV retinitis can occur in healthy people and presents with perivascular inflammation and retinal necrosis.\n\n4. **Eale's Disease** - This is a less common condition that can cause retinal inflammation and neovascularization, fitting some of the patient's symptoms.\n\n5. **Ocular Syphilis** - This can mimic various ocular conditions, including uveitis and retinal changes, making it a consideration.\n\n6. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Retinitis** - Similar to ARN, HSV can cause retinal necrosis and inflammation.\n\n7. **Toxoplasmosis** - Typically presents with more distinct retinal lesions, but can cause retinal inflammation.\n\n8. **Tuberculosis** - Can cause ocular inflammation and retinal changes, often with systemic symptoms or exposure history.\n\n9. **Fungal Endophthalmitis** - A rare condition that can cause similar symptoms, especially in certain risk groups.\n\n10. **Sarcoidosis** - A systemic disease that can cause uveitis and retinal issues, but usually with additional systemic findings.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnosis is **Acute Retinal Necrosis (ARN)**, likely due to a herpes virus such as HSV or CMV, given the progression of symptoms and retinal findings.

Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/30 OS. Anterior segment examination revealed ocular surface dryness and a nuclear sclerotic cataract in the right eye. On dilated fundoscopy, multiple yellow-white subretinal deposits were scattered throughout the left posterior pole, with parafoveal coalescence but sparing the far periphery. There was no concomitant vitritis (Figure, A). Optical coherence tomography showed choroidal thickening and irregularity of the overlying retinal pigment epithelium (Figure, B). The right eye was unremarkable. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Waldenström macroglobulinemia", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an elderly gentleman, and he's been referred for something called birdshot chorioretinopathy. He's got a history of cataract surgery on one eye and some other health issues like hypertension, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis, and osteoporosis. But he's not complaining about any new vision problems or pain, which is interesting.\n\nWhen we look at his eyes, the left one has these yellow-white deposits under the retina. They're mostly around the center but not out towards the edges. And there's no vitritis, which is inflammation in the eye, so that's something to note. The right eye seems totally fine.\n\nNow, birdshot chorioretinopathy is often linked with HLA-A29, so that's a strong possibility. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet. We should consider other conditions that could look like this.\n\nOne thing that comes to mind is sarcoidosis. It can cause granulomatous inflammation and sometimes has these kinds of deposits. But usually, you'd expect to see more signs of inflammation, like vitritis, which isn't there.\n\nAnother possibility could be a fungal infection like candidiasis. That can cause white lesions in the retina too. But this guy doesn't have any symptoms like fever or systemic illness that you'd expect with an infection.\n\nWhat about APMPPE? That's another condition with similar retinal findings. It often follows a viral illness, but this guy hasn't had any recent illness or symptoms like that.\n\nOh, and there's serpiginous choroiditis too. That can cause similar subretinal lesions, but it usually has more distinct, serpentine patterns and often comes with vitritis.\n\nWe should also think about tuberculosis. It can cause choroidal granulomas, but you'd usually see more systemic symptoms or a history suggestive of TB exposure.\n\nAnd then there's syphilis, which can cause a range of eye problems, including choroidal lesions. But again, you'd expect some systemic symptoms or a positive history.\n\nNow, considering his history of ulcerative colitis, maybe we should think about ocular manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease. Those can sometimes cause eye issues, but they usually come with other symptoms.\n\nAlright, let's put it all together. Given the distinct appearance of these lesions and the lack of inflammation or systemic symptoms, birdshot chorioretinopathy is still the most likely diagnosis. But we can't completely rule out sarcoidosis or APMPPE without further testing.\n\nSo, here's the final list: birdshot chorioretinopathy, sarcoidosis, APMPPE, fungal infection, serpiginous choroiditis, tuberculosis, syphilis, ocular manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease, and maybe even a masquerade syndrome like lymphoma.

On examination of the swelling on the right side, there was a diffuse swelling around the pinna measuring approximately 6 cm over the preauricular, postauricular, and infra-auricular region. It was a nontender, soft swelling without fluctuation and abnormal pulsations. There were similar findings in the left side. Mouth opening was adequate, secretions from both parotid ducts were normal, and facial nerve function was intact on both sides. He had undergone fine-needle aspiration cytology and incisional biopsy. The results of both were consistent with reactive lymphadenitis. He was prescribed oral antibiotics for 1 week but showed no improvement. A contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan of the head and neck showed bilateral multiple enhancing lymph nodes in the postauricular region, the largest measuring 16 × 11 mm2 on the right side and 15.4 × 10.6 mm2 on the left, along with bilateral intraparotid nodes, the largest measuring 16.4 × 10.2 mm2 on the right and 15.3 × 10.7 mm2 on the left side. His serum eosinophil count was slightly elevated, and his erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 15 mm/h. However, the IgE level was not measured.

The biopsy specimen included skin and subcutaneous tissue along with 2 underlying lymph nodes. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Kimura disease", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a farmer in his 50s with this weird swelling around his ears. It's been going on for six months, and it's not painful, but it itches sometimes. That's interesting. No fever or weight loss, so it doesn't seem like something super acute or systemic. \n\nFirst off, the swelling is bilateral and nontender, which makes me think of something more chronic or inflammatory. Could it be parotitis? But wait, the parotid glands are usually more painful when inflamed, and the secretions are normal, so maybe not. \n\nLet's consider infections. There's no fever, and antibiotics didn't help, so a simple bacterial infection seems unlikely. Hmm, what about tuberculosis? It can be sneaky and chronic like this. But usually, there are other symptoms like weight loss or night sweats. Still, it's worth keeping in mind. \n\nThe biopsy shows reactive lymphadenitis. That's a clue. It suggests some kind of chronic immune response. Could it be something like Kimura's disease? That's known for causing lymphadenopathy and eosinophilia, and this guy has slightly elevated eosinophils. \n\nBut wait, Kimura's often has more pronounced features like lymphadenopathy elsewhere or asthma, and this guy doesn't have any of that. So maybe it's not Kimura's. \n\nWhat about sarcoidosis? It can cause lymphadenopathy and skin changes, but usually, there are other symptoms like lung issues or more systemic signs. This doesn't quite fit either. \n\nOkay, let's think about autoimmune issues. Sjögren's syndrome can cause swelling around the ears due to lymphocytic infiltration, but it usually comes with dry mouth and eyes, which this guy doesn't have. \n\nI'm also thinking about IgG4-related disease. It can cause swelling and lymphadenopathy, and it's known for forming tunefactive lesions. But we don't have IgG4 levels here, so it's hard to say for sure. \n\nLet's not forget about Castleman disease. It can cause lymphadenopathy and has different forms, some of which are more indolent like this. But usually, there are more systemic signs, so maybe not. \n\nOh, and there's Rosai-Dorfman disease. It's a rare condition that causes lymphadenopathy and can have skin involvement. It's worth considering, but it's pretty rare, so maybe it's a stretch. \n\nSo, where does that leave us? I think the most likely possibilities are IgG4-related disease or Rosai-Dorfman disease. Both fit the chronic nature and lymphadenopathy. But without more specific tests, it's tough to be certain. \n\nIn the end, I'm leaning towards IgG4-related disease because it matches the clinical picture and the persistent nature of the swelling. But Rosai-Dorfman is still a contender. I guess we need more tests to really pin this down.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the farmer's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Parotitis** - Although the parotid glands are involved, the lack of pain and normal secretions make this less likely.\n2. **Tuberculosis** - Chronic and can be asymptomatic, but usually accompanied by other systemic symptoms.\n3. **Kimura's Disease** - Characterized by lymphadenopathy and eosinophilia, but typically involves more systemic features.\n4. **Sarcoidosis** - Can cause lymphadenopathy and skin changes, but often includes lung involvement or other systemic signs.\n5. **Sjögren's Syndrome** - Causes swelling due to lymphocytic infiltration, but usually presents with dry mouth and eyes.\n6. **IgG4-related Disease** - Fits the chronic nature and lymphadenopathy, but requires specific serological tests for confirmation.\n7. **Castleman Disease** - Can cause lymphadenopathy, but often has more systemic manifestations.\n8. **Rosai-Dorfman Disease** - A rare condition causing lymphadenopathy and possible skin involvement, worth considering due to the chronicity.\n9. **Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia** - Could cause lymphadenopathy, but usually presents with other hematological abnormalities.\n10. **Benign Lymphoepithelial Cyst** - Could cause localized swelling, but less likely to be bilateral and chronic.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top two possibilities are **IgG4-related Disease** and **Rosai-Dorfman Disease**, as both align with the chronic and lymphadenopathic nature of the condition. Further specific tests, like IgG4 levels, would be needed to confirm IgG4-related disease, while Rosai-Dorfman disease remains a consideration due to its rarity and fit with the clinical presentation.", "topic": "['Otolaryngology', 'Salivary Gland Disorders', 'Dental Medicine']"}

It's been there for a couple of weeks, and he's wondering what's up with that.\n\nFirst off, let's consider the possibility of an infection. Given the location, things like syphilis or herpes could be suspects. But he says he hasn't been taking any new meds or engaging in risky behavior, so maybe not? Still, can't rule it out just yet.\n\nNow, what about benign skin stuff? A cherry angioma could be a possibility. They're pretty common and usually harmless. But, I don't know, it seems a bit odd for it to just show up out of the blue on the glans penis.\n\nOh, and there's always the worry about something more serious, like a malignant condition. With his history of myeloma, we can't ignore that. Maybe it's a myeloma-related skin issue or even a secondary cancer.

That would be more common in this area.\n\nOh, and let's not overlook the possibility of a drug reaction, even though he said he didn't start anything new.

It's a form of squamous cell carcinoma in situ and could definitely match the lesion.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top possibilities are plasma cell tumor, given his myeloma history, followed by squamous cell carcinoma, and then Zoon's balanitis. Lymphoma and Bowen's disease are also up there. And finally, let's not completely rule out infections like syphilis or herpes, even if they seem less likely.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided and the steps considered, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the lesion on the glans penis of the 60-year-old man with a history of IgA kappa multiple myeloma:\n\n1. **Plasma Cell Tumor** - Given the patient's history of multiple myeloma, this is a strong consideration as it could be related to his previous condition.\n\n2. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - This is a common skin cancer that could present as a persistent lesion in this area, especially in older adults.\n\n3. **Zoon's Balanitis** - A chronic inflammatory condition that could cause a persistent erythematous papule on the glans penis.\n\n4. **Cutaneous Lymphoma** - Considering the patient's medical history, a cutaneous manifestation of lymphoma is plausible.\n\n5. **Bowen's Disease** - A form of squamous cell carcinoma in situ that could match the lesion's description.\n\n6. **Cherry Angioma** - A benign vascular lesion, though less likely given the location and context.\n\n7. **Syphilis** - Although the patient denies risky behavior, syphilis remains a possibility due to its varied presentations.\n\n8. **Herpes Simplex** - Typically presents with vesicular lesions, but atypical presentations can occur.\n\n9. **Bacillary Angiomatosis** - Associated with immunocompromised states, this could be a consideration given the patient's history.\n\n10. **Drug Reaction** - Although unlikely given no new medications, some reactions can occur unexpectedly.\n\nThese differential diagnoses are ranked based on the patient's history, the lesion's characteristics, and the likelihood of each condition. Plasma cell tumor and squamous cell carcinoma are top considerations due to the patient's history and the nature of the lesion.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Urology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Hematology', 'Myeloma']"}

Nonenhanced computed tomography of the paranasal sinuses revealed a soft-tissue mass extending from the nasopharynx into the left sphenoid sinus with erosion of the sphenoid sinus floor and the clivus (Figure 1A). The sella was apparently normal with no disruption of its floor. The intracranial and orbital soft tissues were grossly normal, as were the remaining soft tissues under the skull base. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Ectopic pituitary adenoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a man in his 50s who's dealing with some nasal congestion and nosebleeds. That's not uncommon, but let's dig a bit deeper. He's got a history of chronic hepatitis C, hypothyroidism, and he's also struggled with alcoholism. These could be important, so let's keep them in mind.\n\nNow, the CT scan shows a soft-tissue mass starting from the nasopharynx and making its way into the left sphenoid sinus. It's even eroding the floor of the sphenoid sinus and the clivus. That's pretty aggressive. The sella looks okay, which is good, and there's nothing unusual in the intracranial or orbital areas. So, it's pretty localized.\n\nGiven the location and how it's behaving, my first thought is nasopharyngeal carcinoma. It's known for being aggressive like this and is pretty common in men. Plus, it's linked to Epstein-Barr virus, which could be a factor here.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. There are other possibilities. How about squamous cell carcinoma? It's another aggressive type that can occur in the nasopharynx and sinuses. It's often linked to smoking and alcohol use, which could fit our patient's history.\n\nThen there's the possibility of a chordoma. These tumors start from the clivus and can extend into the nasopharynx. The clivus erosion on the scan could point to this. Chordomas are rare, but they do occur in this area.\n\nOh, and what about angiofibroma? These are usually in younger males and tend to be benign, but they can be quite aggressive in how they grow. The nasal symptoms fit, but the patient's age is a bit off.\n\nLet's not forget about lymphoma. It can show up in the nasopharynx and sinuses, especially in someone with a compromised immune system, like from hepatitis C. It's not as common, but it's worth considering.\n\nThere's also the possibility of a metastatic tumor. With his history of alcoholism and hepatitis C, he's at higher risk for liver cancer, which could theoretically spread to this area. It's a long shot, but let's keep it in mind.\n\nNow, thinking about the hepatitis C, could this be related to a plasma cell disorder like plasmacytoma? These can show up as destructive lesions and are linked to chronic infections. It's not the most common choice, but it fits some of the facts.\n\nWhat about a fungal infection like mucormycosis? This can cause aggressive sinus disease, especially in someone with a compromised immune system. But usually, there are other symptoms, and it's more acute.\n\nLastly, there's the chance of a benign tumor like an inverted papilloma. These can grow into the sinuses and cause erosion, but they're usually not as aggressive as what we're seeing here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think nasopharyngeal carcinoma is still the top suspect. It matches the demographics, the aggressive behavior, and the location. Squamous cell carcinoma is a close second, given the alcohol history and aggressive nature. Chordoma is also up there because of the clivus involvement. The rest, like lymphoma, metastatic tumor, and plasmacytoma, are possibilities but less likely based on the information we have.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma**  \n2. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**  \n3. **Chordoma**  \n4. **Angiofibroma**  \n5. **Lymphoma**  \n6. **Metastatic Tumor**  \n7. **Plasmacytoma**  \n8. **Mucormycosis**  \n9. **Inverted Papilloma**  \n10. **Sinonasal Undifferentiated Carcinoma**\n\nAfter considering all the patient's symptoms, history, and the CT scan findings, the top three most likely diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma** - This is the most likely diagnosis given the patient's age, gender, and the aggressive nature of the mass extending from the nasopharynx into the sphenoid sinus. It's also associated with Epstein-Barr virus, which could be relevant.\n\n2. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - This is a close second due to the patient's history of alcoholism, which is a risk factor. It's an aggressive type of cancer that can occur in the nasopharynx and sinuses.\n\n3. **Chordoma** - This is also a strong contender because the mass is eroding the clivus, a characteristic feature of chordomas, which originate from the clivus and can extend into the nasopharynx.\n\nThe other possibilities, while less likely, should still be considered in the broader differential diagnosis.", "topic": "['Radiology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Rhinology and Sinus Disease', 'Clinical Decision Support', 'Endocrinology']"}

While in the emergency department, she developed monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) with hemodynamic instability and was successfully cardioverted. She continued to have nonsustained monomorphic VT, so intravenous amiodarone and oral metoprolol were initiated. She was admitted for further evaluation. Results of tests of electrolyte levels and coronary angiography were normal. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast revealed normal-sized cardiac chambers and normal biventricular function without delayed enhancement. The presenting electrocardiogram (ECG) is shown in Figure 1. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Outflow tract ventricular tachycardia", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her late 40s who's been having these scary palpitations and even came close to passing out a few times. That's definitely concerning. She's got a history of hypertension, which is something to keep in mind. When she got to the emergency room, she had this monomorphic ventricular tachycardia episode. That's a type of irregular heart rhythm that starts in the ventricles, and it's serious because it can be life-threatening if not treated quickly. They had to shock her back to a normal rhythm, which they did successfully. But then, she kept having these shorter bursts of the same type of VT, so they started her on some strong medications, amiodarone and metoprolol, to try and control it.\n\nNow, let's think about what could be causing this. The first thing that comes to mind is some kind of structural heart problem. You know, like coronary artery disease or maybe cardiomyopathy. But wait, they did a coronary angiography, and it came back normal. That's a big relief because it rules out blocked arteries as the cause. Plus, the cardiac MRI showed her heart chambers are normal in size and function, and there's no delayed enhancement. That's a fancy way of saying there's no visible scar tissue or damage in the heart muscle. So, it's not looking like a structural issue.\n\nHmm, so if it's not a structural problem, what's next? Let's think about other possibilities. Could it be an electrolyte imbalance? But no, her electrolyte levels are normal too. That's another thing off the list. What about something like arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy? But the MRI didn't show any of the typical signs of that, like fatty infiltration in the right ventricle. So, that's probably not it either.\n\nOkay, so we're dealing with a non-ischemic cause. Maybe it's something like idiopathic ventricular tachycardia. That's when the VT happens without any obvious heart disease. It's like the heart just decides to misbehave sometimes. Or could it be right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia? That's a possibility too, especially since the MRI was clean and this type of tachycardia often occurs in people with normal-looking hearts.\n\nOh, and let's not forget about bundle branch reentrant VT. That's when the electrical signal gets stuck in a loop in the heart's wiring, causing the fast rhythm. It's more common in people with some types of heart muscle disease, but it can happen without obvious signs on an MRI.\n\nSo, putting it all together, it seems like idiopathic VT or right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia could be the top suspects here. Both fit with what we're seeing: normal tests but still having these VT episodes. Bundle branch reentrant VT is a bit of a long shot without more evidence of specific heart disease, but it's still on the list. And we can't completely rule out something rare like a cardiac sarcoidosis or a hidden cardiomyopathy that's not showing up on the scans. But for now, idiopathic VT and right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia are our best guesses.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Idiopathic Ventricular Tachycardia** - This is a plausible cause given the normal cardiac structure and function seen in the tests.\n2. **Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Tachycardia** - Common in individuals with normal heart structure, this could explain the monomorphic VT episodes.\n3. **Bundle Branch Reentrant Ventricular Tachycardia** - Although more typical in hearts with some structural abnormality, it's still a possibility.\n4. **Cardiac Sarcoidosis** - A less common condition that might not show obvious signs on MRI but could cause VT.\n5. **Early or Mild Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy** - Could be present without clear MRI findings.\n6. **Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia** - A genetic condition that can cause exercise-induced VT.\n7. **Myocardial Bridging** - A condition where a coronary artery dives into the heart muscle, potentially causing ischemia.\n8. **Focal Atrial Tachycardia** - Although less likely, could potentially mimic VT.\n9. **Long QT Interval Syndrome** - A genetic disorder affecting the heart's electrical activity.\n10. **Apical Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy** - A form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that might not be evident on MRI.\n\nAfter considering all the patient's information and test results, the top differential diagnoses are **Idiopathic Ventricular Tachycardia** and **Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Tachycardia**, as they align well with the normal structural findings and the nature of the VT episodes. **Bundle Branch Reentrant Ventricular Tachycardia** and **Cardiac Sarcoidosis** are also considered, though they are less likely without additional supporting evidence.", "topic": "['Cardiology', 'Rhythm Disorders', 'Challenges in Clinical Electrocardiography']"}

There was no known history of travel in relation to onset of the lesions. Limited clinical examination revealed well-marginated brown atrophic patches on the bilateral palms extending focally onto the volar aspect of the wrist and centrally surmounted by spiny keratotic pits in the palmar creases. Two punch biopsy specimens were obtained for diagnostic clarification (Figure, C and D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her 60s with a 2-year history of itchy and sometimes burning dark patches on her palms. That's interesting. It's been spreading from one palm to the other and now even onto her wrists. Hmm, that's quite specific.\n\nFirst, I'm thinking about contact dermatitis. It's common and can definitely cause itchy patches, especially on the hands. But, would it explain the spreading pattern and those spiny, keratotic pits? Maybe not.\n\nNext, let's consider psoriasis. It often shows up with well-defined red plaques, but it can also appear on the palms. The pits could be like the pitting we see in nail psoriasis. But, it's usually more widespread, isn't it?\n\nNow, what about eczema or dyshidrotic eczema? It causes blisters and itching, but those are usually vesicular, not really what we're seeing here with these hyperpigmented patches.\n\nOh, and there's lichen planus. It can cause pruritic, flat-topped papules, and sometimes hyperpigmented lesions. The involvement of the wrists is a bit unusual, but it's worth considering.\n\nLet's not forget about mycosis fungoides, a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. It can present with patches, especially in unusual areas like the palms. The atrophic patches and spiny pits are intriguing and could fit.\n\nHow about arsenic poisoning? It can cause pigmented lesions, but we'd expect more systemic signs or a known exposure history, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nChronic dermatitis herpetiformis could be another option. It's related to gluten sensitivity and causes itchy blisters, but again, not quite the same as these patches and pits.\n\nNow, let's think about Bowen's disease. It's a form of squamous cell carcinoma in situ and can appear as persistent patches. The location and the spiny pits could be explained by this.\n\nThere's also the possibility of a drug eruption. Some medications can cause pigmented lesions, but we'd need a medication history to support this.\n\nLastly, let's consider tinea manuum. It's a fungal infection that affects the palms, but it usually causes scaling, not these kinds of patches and pits.\n\nOkay, let's rank these based on the evidence. Mycosis fungoides seems to fit well with the atypical presentation and palm involvement. Bowen's disease is also a strong contender given the persistent patches and potential for malignant change. Contact dermatitis and psoriasis are possible but less likely given the specific features. Lichen planus and drug eruption could be considered, but there's not enough evidence. Arsenic poisoning and tinea manuum seem less likely without supporting history or symptoms. Chronic dermatitis herpetiformis doesn't quite match the lesion description. So, mycosis fungoides and Bowen's disease top the list.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the condition described, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Contact Dermatitis** - This is a common condition that can cause itchy patches on the hands, especially if there's exposure to an irritant or allergen.\n\n2. **Psoriasis** - Known for causing well-defined red plaques, psoriasis can also present on the palms and may include pitting similar to what's seen in nail psoriasis.\n\n3. **Eczema (Dyshidrotic)** - This type of eczema causes blisters and itching, but typically presents with vesicular lesions rather than hyperpigmented patches.\n\n4. **Lichen Planus** - Characterized by pruritic, flat-topped papules, lichen planus can also lead to hyperpigmented lesions and might explain the wrist involvement.\n\n5. **Mycosis Fungoides** - A form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, mycosis fungoides can present with patches on the palms, and the atrophic patches and spiny pits align with this diagnosis.\n\n6. **Arsenic Poisoning** - Known to cause pigmented lesions, but usually accompanied by systemic signs or a known exposure history, which is not mentioned here.\n\n7. **Chronic Dermatitis Herpetiformis** - Associated with gluten sensitivity, this condition causes itchy blisters, but not typically the described patches and pits.\n\n8. **Bowen's Disease** - A form of squamous cell carcinoma in situ, Bowen's disease can appear as persistent patches and could explain the spiny pits.\n\n9. **Drug Eruption** - Certain medications can cause pigmented lesions, but a medication history would be needed to support this diagnosis.\n\n10. **Tinea Manuum** - A fungal infection of the palms, usually causing scaling rather than the described patches and pits.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are **Mycosis Fungoides** and **Bowen's Disease**, as they best fit the atypical presentation and specific features of the lesions. Contact dermatitis and psoriasis are also possibilities but are less likely given the unique characteristics of the case.

On examination, his visual acuity was initially 20/80 OD and 20/200 OS; it deteriorated over the next 2 months to finger counting bilaterally. The Weber test gave a nonlateralizing result, and bone conduction hearing was absent bilaterally. There was length-dependent loss of vibratory sensation and absent reflexes at both lower extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated abnormal enhancement of bilateral optic nerves (Figure, A). Optical coherence tomography and fluorescein angiogram were normal. Nerve conduction studies showed mild sensory axonal polyneuropathy. Laboratory tests were notable for elevated thyrotropin (63 mlU/ml), low levels of free thyroxine (T4) (0.2 ng/dL), and elevated levels of cerebrospinal fluid protein (94 mg/dL). Cerebrospinal fluid IgG index, oligoclonal bands, aquaporin 4 antibody, paraneoplastic panel, and protein electrophoresis test results were all normal. He was treated empirically with high-dose steroids and plasmapheresis, with no improvement in symptoms. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cobalt toxicity", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 63-year-old man who's suddenly losing his vision and hearing. That's pretty alarming. He's also got this painful tingling in his feet, which he's had for about a year. That's a long time to be dealing with that kind of discomfort. \n\nFirst off, the vision loss. It's happening in both eyes, and it's getting worse pretty quickly. The MRI shows something weird going on with his optic nerves. They're enhancing, which usually means inflammation or something like that. So, I'm thinking about optic neuritis. That's when the optic nerve gets inflamed, and it can cause vision loss like this. \n\nBut wait, there's also the hearing loss. It's bilateral, and he can't hear bone conduction. That's not just your run-of-the-mill hearing loss. It's like something is affecting the nerves responsible for hearing. Maybe it's related to the optic nerve issue? \n\nNow, about those painful sensations in his feet. He's losing vibratory sensation, and his reflexes are gone in the lower extremities. That sounds like some kind of peripheral neuropathy. It's like his nerves are not working right, which fits with the hearing and vision problems. \n\nOkay, let's look at the lab results. His thyroid hormones are off. He's got high TSH and low T4, so he's hypothyroid. That can cause all sorts of symptoms, including neuropathy. But would it cause vision and hearing loss like this? I'm not so sure. \n\nThe CSF is interesting. The protein is high, but there aren't any oligoclonal bands or other signs of multiple sclerosis. That's good to know because MS could explain the optic neuritis and neuropathy. But without those bands, it's less likely. \n\nHe didn't respond to steroids or plasmapheresis. That's a big deal. Those treatments usually work for autoimmune issues like Guillain-Barré or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. So, whatever this is, it's not responding to the usual treatments. \n\nLet's think about other possibilities. Could it be a vitamin deficiency? Like B12? That can cause neuropathy and affect the optic nerves. But would it cause hearing loss? I'm not convinced. \n\nHow about amyloidosis? That can cause neuropathy and might affect the eyes and ears. But usually, there are other signs, like organ involvement or abnormalities in blood tests. We don't have any of that here. \n\nSarcoidosis could be a possibility. It can cause all sorts of neurological issues, including optic neuritis and hearing loss. But we don't have any lung or skin involvement, which is common in sarcoidosis. \n\nLet's not forget about chronic infections. Syphilis can cause lots of neurological problems, including optic neuropathy and hearing loss. But we didn't do any syphilis tests, so that's a blind spot. \n\nIn the end, I'm thinking this might be some kind of unusual autoimmune or inflammatory condition. Maybe something like Susac's syndrome, which affects the eyes, ears, and brain. It's rare, but it fits the symptoms. \n\nBut I'm still not completely sure. There are just so many possibilities, and we don't have all the pieces of the puzzle. I think we need to consider more tests or even a biopsy to get a definitive answer.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's symptoms, with a focus on conditions that could explain the combination of vision loss, hearing loss, and neuropathy:\n\n1. **Optic Neuritis** - Given the bilateral optic nerve enhancement on MRI, optic neuritis is a strong consideration, often associated with multiple sclerosis or other inflammatory conditions.\n\n2. **Susac's Syndrome** - This rare condition involves a triad of symptoms: vision loss due to retinal issues, hearing loss, and neurological problems, which aligns well with the patient's presentation.\n\n3. **Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)** - Although the patient didn't respond to typical treatments, CIDP can cause neuropathy and sometimes involves cranial nerves, potentially affecting vision and hearing.\n\n4. **Sarcoidosis** - This condition can lead to optic neuritis, hearing loss, and neuropathy, but typically involves other organ systems as well, which are not mentioned here.\n\n5. **Vitamin B12 Deficiency** - While B12 deficiency can cause neuropathy and affect the optic nerves, it is less likely to cause hearing loss.\n\n6. **Amyloidosis** - This condition can cause neuropathy and may affect the eyes and ears, but usually presents with other systemic symptoms or abnormal blood tests.\n\n7. **Neurosyphilis** - A chronic infection that can cause a wide range of neurological symptoms, including optic neuropathy and hearing loss, but was not tested for in this case.\n\n8. **Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes (MELAS)** - A mitochondrial disorder that can cause neurological symptoms, including vision and hearing loss, but typically involves other systemic features.\n\n9. **Autoimmune Inner Ear Disease** - Could explain the hearing loss, and when combined with other autoimmune processes, might account for the optic nerve involvement and neuropathy.\n\n10. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - Although the paraneoplastic panel was negative, some paraneoplastic syndromes can present with neurological symptoms, including vision and hearing loss, and might not be detected in initial tests.\n\nAfter considering all the information, Susac's syndrome emerges as a strong candidate due to the specific combination of symptoms.

On examination, she was hypertensive (blood pressure, 185/85 mm Hg) although not tachycardic and was afebrile. She was locally tender to palpation in the right lower quadrant with rebound and voluntary guarding. Her abdomen was not tympanitic. The patient had no abdominal scars, hernias, or palpable masses.

We've got a woman in her 50s who's suddenly dealing with some pretty intense right lower quadrant pain. It's been going on for 12 hours, and she's also been vomiting and noticed melena. That's quite a mix of symptoms. She's got a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome, diabetes, a stroke, and coronary artery disease. That's a lot to consider.\n\nFirst off, appendicitis comes to mind. It's a classic cause of right lower quadrant pain, especially with her symptoms of vomiting and tenderness. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet.\n\nNext, I'm thinking about the possibility of a bowel obstruction. The vomiting could fit, but there's no mention of the typical bloating or tympanic sound when examining the abdomen, so maybe that's not it.\n\nNow, considering her history of coronary artery disease, could this be related to the heart? Maybe something like mesenteric ischemia? That could explain the pain and vomiting, and her history makes it plausible.\n\nOh, and what about renal colic? It's another cause of severe abdominal pain, but usually, there's radiation to the groin or some urinary symptoms, which she doesn't have. So, probably not that.\n\nLet's not forget about diverticulitis. It can cause similar pain, but usually, there's fever or some changes in bowel habits, neither of which she has. Hmm, maybe not the best fit.\n\nNow, thinking about her melena, that suggests some bleeding in the upper GI tract. Could it be related to a peptic ulcer? But she doesn't have a history of ulcers, and there's no hematemesis. So, maybe not.\n\nGallbladder issues like cholecystitis or cholangitis could be possible too. They can cause right upper quadrant pain, but sometimes it can radiate or refer to the lower quadrant. But again, no jaundice or fever, so it's a bit iffy.\n\nWhat about gynecological issues like ovarian torsion? That could cause acute pain, but usually, there are some gynecological symptoms or findings, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nNow, let's think about the lab results. Her white blood cell count is really high, which suggests some kind of infection or inflammation. That could point to appendicitis or maybe even something like pancreatitis. But her lipase levels aren't that high, so pancreatitis is less likely.\n\nHmm, putting it all together, appendicitis seems like a strong contender. But with her history of coronary artery disease, I'm still worried about mesenteric ischemia. That could explain the severe pain and vomiting, and it's a pretty serious condition that we can't ignore.\n\nSo, after going through everything, I think mesenteric ischemia might be the top suspect here. It fits with her symptoms, history, and the lab results. Yeah, that seems like the most likely diagnosis.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with a focus on one potential diagnosis per step, without repetition:\n\n1. **Appendicitis** - Given the right lower quadrant pain, vomiting, and elevated white blood cell count, appendicitis is a strong initial consideration.\n\n2. **Mesenteric Ischemia** - The patient's history of coronary artery disease and symptoms of severe pain and vomiting make mesenteric ischemia a plausible and serious possibility.\n\n3. **Bowel Obstruction** - Although the typical bloating and tympanic sounds are absent, bowel obstruction could still be considered due to the vomiting and abdominal pain.\n\n4. **Renal Colic** - While the lack of urinary symptoms makes it less likely, renal colic is a common cause of severe abdominal pain and should be considered.\n\n5. **Diverticulitis** - Although fever and changes in bowel habits are typically present, diverticulitis could still be a possibility given the abdominal pain.\n\n6. **Peptic Ulcer Disease** - The melena suggests upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which could be due to a peptic ulcer, despite the absence of hematemesis or a history of ulcers.\n\n7. **Cholecystitis** - While the pain is typically in the right upper quadrant, cholecystitis could potentially present with referred pain to the lower quadrant.\n\n8. **Ovarian Torsion** - Acute lower abdominal pain in a female patient raises the possibility of ovarian torsion, especially with her history of polycystic ovarian syndrome.\n\n9. **Pancreatitis** - Although the lipase level is not markedly elevated, pancreatitis could still be considered given the abdominal pain and vomiting.\n\n10. **Gastroenteritis** - This is a less likely possibility given the lack of diarrhea or fever, but it could be considered if other causes are ruled out.\n\nAfter reviewing all the information, **mesenteric ischemia** emerges as the most likely diagnosis due to the combination of severe abdominal pain, vomiting, elevated white blood cell count, and the patient's significant cardiovascular history.

The abdominal pain was associated with diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal bloating. On examination, the patient was afebrile and her abdomen was soft and nondistended without guarding or rebound but tender in the left lower quadrant. The patient had a palpable nodule in the posterior vaginal fornix and fullness in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen on bimanual examination. Laboratory investigations had normal findings with the exception of an elevated cancer antigen 125 level of 158 U/mL (to convert to kilounits per liter, multiply by 1.0). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple abnormal findings that included a bulky uterus with a thickened myometrium, endometriomas, right pleural effusion, pelvic peritonitis and ascites, enlarged lymph nodes, and solid extracolonic implants in the omentum caudal to the transverse colon (Figure, A) and in the cul-de-sac adjacent to the upper rectum (Figure, B). Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed 2 areas of focus corresponding with the extracolonic implants. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Perforation by foreign bodies", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a postmenopausal woman in her mid-50s who's come to the ER with some pretty severe abdominal pain. She's had this pain for about 5 days, and it's a solid 10 out of 10 on the pain scale. That's intense. She's also dealing with diarrhea, nausea, and a bloated feeling. \n\nNow, she's got a history of endometriosis and adenomyosis. That's important to keep in mind. On examining her, she's not running a fever, and her abdomen is soft but tender in the left lower part. There's a nodule in the back of her vaginal area and some fullness in the left lower abdomen. \n\nHer lab tests are mostly normal, but her CA-125 is elevated at 158 U/mL. That's something to note. CA-125 can be high in various conditions, not just ovarian cancer. \n\nThe CT scan shows a lot going on. There's a bulky uterus with a thickened myometrium, endometriomas, and even a right pleural effusion. Plus, there's pelvic peritonitis, ascites, enlarged lymph nodes, and these solid implants in the omentum and cul-de-sac. That's quite a bit. \n\nOkay, let's think about what this could be. Endometriosis could explain some of this, especially with her history. But those implants and the pleural effusion? That's unusual for endometriosis. \n\nOvarian cancer is a big concern here. The elevated CA-125 and those implants could point to that. But wait, the implants are solid, not cystic. That's a bit odd for ovarian cancer, which often has cystic features. \n\nWhat about adenocarcinoma of the colon? That could explain the solid implants and the lymph node enlargement. But would it explain the pleural effusion? Maybe, if it's really advanced. \n\nLymphoma is another thought. It can cause lymph node enlargement and pleural effusion. But would it cause those solid implants in the omentum? Hmm, not typically. \n\nLet's not forget about the possibility of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor. It could metastasize to the omentum, but would it explain the pleural effusion and CA-125 elevation? Maybe, if it's really widespread. \n\nNow, what about the idea of endometriosis-associated cancer? That's a rare one, but it could fit. Endometriosis can, in rare cases, develop into cancer, and that could explain the solid implants and CA-125 elevation. \n\nOkay, let's wrap this up. Considering everything, I think endometriosis-associated cancer is the most likely diagnosis. It ties together her history, the imaging findings, and the lab results. It's rare, but it makes sense here. \n\nSo, the final list of differential diagnoses, in order of likelihood, is: endometriosis-associated cancer, ovarian cancer, adenocarcinoma of the colon, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and lymphoma. That seems to fit best with what we're seeing.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnoses for this patient, in order of likelihood, are:\n\n1. **Endometriosis-associated cancer**: This diagnosis aligns with the patient's history of endometriosis, the presence of solid extracolonic implants, elevated CA-125 levels, and the findings from the CT and MRI scans.\n\n2. **Ovarian cancer**: While the elevated CA-125 and the presence of ascites and pleural effusion are concerning for ovarian cancer, the solid nature of the implants is atypical, making this diagnosis less likely than endometriosis-associated cancer.\n\n3. **Adenocarcinoma of the colon**: This could explain the solid implants and lymph node enlargement, but it less commonly presents with a pleural effusion or significantly elevated CA-125 levels.\n\n4. **Gastrointestinal stromal tumor**: This could result in metastasis to the omentum, but it is less likely to cause a pleural effusion or elevate CA-125 levels to this extent.\n\n5. **Lymphoma**: While lymphoma can cause lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion, it typically does not present with solid implants in the omentum.\n\nThese diagnoses take into account the patient's history, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging results.

Associated symptoms included dysphagia and fever and chills. A previous otolaryngology evaluation revealed an intranasal mass with enlargement of multiple submandibular lymph nodes. A needle aspiration biopsy of 1 of the submandibular lymph nodes revealed atypical cells with mature lymphocytes. Computed tomography of the sinus confirmed a nasal polyp and a soft tissue mass in the right lacrimal gland region. The excised nasal polyp was benign. Incisional biopsy of the lacrimal gland lesion revealed chronic inflammatory infiltrate composed of predominantly T cells with scattered B cells and mature plasma cells, but no evidence of a lymphoproliferative process. The patient was referred for evaluation in our clinic. Ocular history was noncontributory. On examination, visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/25 OS. Intraocular pressure was unremarkable and ocular motility was intact in both eyes. Clinical evaluation revealed a firm mass of 5 × 4 × 3 cm fixed to the superotemporal orbital rim in the right lacrimal gland region (Figure 1) with intact overlying skin.

We've got a woman in her 50s with hypothyroidism and she's been dealing with these painless lumps in her neck for about 10 months. That's quite a while. She's also having some trouble with her right eye, like it's a bit achy and her vision isn't as sharp as it used to be. And there's more—she's having difficulty swallowing and even experiencing fever and chills. That's a lot going on.\n\nNow, she's already seen an ENT specialist, and they found an intranasal mass and some swollen lymph nodes under her jaw. They did a needle biopsy on one of those lymph nodes, and it showed some atypical cells, but they were mixed with mature lymphocytes. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nThe CT scan showed a nasal polyp and something in her right lacrimal gland. They took out the nasal polyp, and it turned out to be benign. That's a relief, but we still have the lacrimal gland issue to figure out. The biopsy from that area showed a chronic inflammatory infiltrate with mostly T cells and some B cells and plasma cells. No signs of anything cancerous like a lymphoproliferative process, though.\n\nSo, what could this be? Let's start with the obvious. Lymphoma is a possibility because of the lymph node enlargement and the atypical cells. But the biopsy didn't show anything definitive for lymphoma, so let's keep looking.\n\nHow about Sjögren's syndrome? It can cause swelling in the lacrimal gland and some of the systemic symptoms she's experiencing. But, we don't have any mention of dry mouth or dry eyes, which are pretty common with that.\n\nMaybe it's an IgG4-related disease? That can cause glandular swelling and systemic symptoms too. The histology with lots of T cells and plasma cells could fit, but we'd usually see more IgG4-positive plasma cells.\n\nOr could it be sarcoidosis? That can cause all sorts of systemic issues, including eye problems and lymphadenopathy. The chronic inflammatory infiltrate could match, but we'd expect more granulomas.\n\nLet's not forget about orbital inflammatory syndrome. It could explain the eye symptoms and the mass in the lacrimal gland. But, it usually doesn't come with fever and chills or lymph node enlargement.\n\nWhat about a chronic infection like tuberculosis? It can cause systemic symptoms and lymph node changes. But, we'd expect more histological evidence of infection, like caseating granulomas.\n\nCould it be something like Kimura's disease? That's a chronic inflammatory condition that can cause lymphadenopathy and a mass like this. The eosinophilia and IgE elevation would fit, but we don't have those lab results.\n\nMaybe it's a benign mixed tumor, a pleomorphic adenoma? Those can occur in the lacrimal gland and cause a painless mass. But, the systemic symptoms and lymph node changes don't really match.\n\nLet's think about Wegener's granulomatosis, or GPA. It can cause a lot of systemic symptoms, including eye issues and lymphadenopathy. The chronic inflammatory infiltrate could fit, but we'd expect more granulomas or necrosis.\n\nLastly, could it be something like Rosai-Dorfman disease? That's a rare condition with lymphadenopathy and inflammatory infiltrates. The histology with emperipolesis could match, but we don't have that finding here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top possibilities are IgG4-related disease, Kimura's disease, and orbital inflammatory syndrome. They all fit different parts of the picture, but we need more lab work or a repeat biopsy to be sure.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Lymphoma** - Given the lymph node enlargement and atypical cells found in the biopsy, lymphoma is a primary consideration.\n\n2. **Sjögren's Syndrome** - This autoimmune disorder can cause lacrimal gland swelling and systemic symptoms, although dry mouth and dry eyes are typically present.\n\n3. **IgG4-related Disease** - Characterized by glandular swelling and systemic symptoms, this condition could fit the histological findings of chronic inflammatory infiltrate with T cells and plasma cells.\n\n4. **Sarcoidosis** - This condition can cause systemic issues, including eye problems and lymphadenopathy, but typically involves granuloma formation.\n\n5. **Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome** - This could explain the eye symptoms and lacrimal gland mass, but usually doesn't involve systemic symptoms like fever and chills or lymphadenopathy.\n\n6. **Tuberculosis** - A chronic infection that can cause systemic symptoms and lymph node changes, but would likely show caseating granulomas histologically.\n\n7. **Kimura's Disease** - A chronic inflammatory condition that can cause lymphadenopathy and a mass, often with eosinophilia and elevated IgE levels.\n\n8. **Pleomorphic Adenoma** - A benign tumor of the lacrimal gland, but this doesn't typically involve systemic symptoms or lymph node changes.\n\n9. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)** - Can cause systemic symptoms, including eye issues and lymphadenopathy, but would likely show granulomas or necrosis.\n\n10. **Rosai-Dorfman Disease** - A rare condition with lymphadenopathy and inflammatory infiltrates, characterized by emperipolesis, which is not noted in this case.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are IgG4-related disease, Kimura's disease, and orbital inflammatory syndrome.

His medical history was remarkable for asthma and prostate cancer, and review of systems was negative except for his visual loss. On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/400 OD and 20/20 OS. Pupils were reactive with no relative afferent pupillary defect, and intraocular pressure measurements were unremarkable, as were results of the external and slitlamp examinations. Dilated fundus examination of the right eye showed submacular hemorrhage with pigment epithelial detachment (Figure 1A). Results of a dilated fundus examination of the left eye were unremarkable.

A man in his early 50s suddenly can't see well out of his right eye. That's pretty alarming. He's got a history of prostate cancer, which is important to keep in mind. No trauma or pain, so that's interesting. \n\nFirst, I'm thinking about age-related macular degeneration. It's pretty common in this age group and can cause sudden vision changes if there's bleeding or fluid under the retina. \n\nBut wait, there's no family history mentioned, and he's a bit on the younger side for AMD. Still, it's a strong contender given the symptoms and his age. \n\nNow, what about a macular hole? That can cause sudden vision loss too. But usually, there are other signs on the OCT, like a distinct hole, which I don't see here. So, maybe not that. \n\nCentral serous chorioretinopathy could be another option. It often happens in middle-aged men and can cause sudden vision loss with fluid under the retina. But, it's more common in people with stress or steroid use, and there's no mention of that here. \n\nHmm, what about a vascular issue like a branch retinal artery occlusion? That can cause sudden vision loss, but usually, you'd see retinal whitening or a cherry-red spot, and there's no mention of that. \n\nOcular melanoma is another thought. It can cause bleeding under the retina, but it's pretty rare. Plus, you'd usually see a mass on the ultrasound, which isn't mentioned. \n\nTrauma could cause commotio retinae, but he denied any trauma, so that's unlikely. \n\nInfectious causes like endophthalmitis or choroiditis could cause vision loss, but you'd expect pain, redness, or systemic symptoms, which he doesn't have. \n\nOh, and there's the possibility of a vitreous hemorrhage, but that would usually have floaters or more obvious bleeding in the vitreous on exam. \n\nSo, putting it all together, age-related macular degeneration seems like the most likely cause, given his age and the submacular hemorrhage. But, I can't completely rule out something like ocular melanoma without further testing. \n\nIn the end, AMD is the top suspect, but I'd want to do more tests to be sure and rule out other possibilities.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the sudden decrease in visual acuity in the right eye of the patient:\n\n1. **Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**\n2. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy**\n3. **Ocular Melanoma**\n4. **Branch Retinal Artery Occlusion**\n5. **Macular Hole**\n6. **Commotio Retinae**\n7. **Vitreous Hemorrhage**\n8. **Endophthalmitis**\n9. **Choroiditis**\n10. **Retinal Detachment**\n\nAfter considering all the patient's symptoms and test results, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most likely diagnosis. The presence of submacular hemorrhage and pigment epithelial detachment in a man in his early 50s aligns well with AMD, even though he is slightly younger than the typical age of onset. While ocular melanoma is also a consideration due to the subretinal hemorrhage, it is less common and would typically require further imaging to confirm.

A complete blood cell count revealed a white blood cell count of 1800/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001), with 2% neutrophils (absolute neutrophil count, 36/μL [to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001]), hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10), and platelet count of 10 × 103/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 1). Her blood glucose level was 326 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555). The patient was administered broad-spectrum antibiotics empirically, and a dermatologist was consulted. Two punch biopsy specimens from the lower back plaque were obtained and sent for histologic analysis and tissue culture (bacteria, atypical mycobacteria, and fungus). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Mucormycosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 3-year-old girl undergoing treatment for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. She's on a bunch of medications, including cytarabine, vincristine, dexamethasone, pegaspargase, and intrathecal methotrexate. Now, she's come in with this skin lesion. It's a pretty distinctive-looking thing—violaceous to black with a central hemorrhagic bulla. That's a fancy way of saying it's got a dark, almost black color with a bloody blister in the middle. And there's some redness around it. \n\nFirst off, the fact that she's got this kind of lesion and she's on chemotherapy is a big clue. Chemotherapy can really knock down the immune system, making her susceptible to all sorts of infections. So, infection is definitely on my radar. \n\nLet's think about what kind of infections could cause something like this. With her being so immunocompromised, viral infections are a possibility. I know that certain viruses, like the herpes simplex virus, can cause skin lesions. They often start as little blisters, and if they get worse, they could look like what we're seeing here. \n\nBut wait, there's more to consider. Fungal infections are also common in people with weakened immune systems. Mucormycosis, for example, can cause some pretty nasty skin lesions. They can be black and necrotic, which fits the description. And it's not just limited to the skin; it can spread quickly if not treated. \n\nOh, and we can't forget about bacterial infections. Ecthyma gangrenosum is one that comes to mind. It's associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and can cause those black, hemorrhagic papules. It's definitely something to consider, especially since she's neutropenic. \n\nNow, let's not jump to conclusions too quickly. We should also think about non-infectious causes. Medication reactions can sometimes cause skin issues. Could this be a reaction to one of her medications? It's possible, but the appearance of this lesion is pretty specific, so I'm leaning towards an infectious cause. \n\nOkay, so what's the next step? We've got some biopsy samples sent for histology and culture. That should give us more information. If it's a fungal infection like mucormycosis, we might see those broad, non-septate hyphae on the histology. If it's bacterial, we might grow something in culture. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I think we're looking at ecthyma gangrenosum caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the most likely culprit. It fits with her neutropenic state and the appearance of the lesion. But we should keep an open mind until we get those biopsy results back. \n\nIn the end, it's a complex case, and we need to be thorough. But given what we know, ecthyma gangrenosum seems like the best fit.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the skin lesion in the 3-year-old girl undergoing treatment for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia:\n\n1. **Ecthyma Gangrenosum** - This condition is associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, particularly in immunocompromised patients, and is characterized by hemorrhagic papules or plaques.\n\n2. **Mucormycosis** - A fungal infection that can cause black, necrotic skin lesions, especially in those with weakened immune systems.\n\n3. **Herpes Simplex Virus Infection** - Can cause blistering skin lesions, which can become more severe in immunocompromised individuals.\n\n4. **Vaccinia** - Although rare, it can cause skin lesions with a central necrotic or hemorrhagic appearance.\n\n5. **Rickettsial Infection** - Certain types, like Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, can cause a characteristic rash, but it's less common in this context.\n\n6. **Disseminated Candidiasis** - Can cause skin lesions in severely immunocompromised patients, though they typically appear differently.\n\n7. **Aspergillosis** - A fungal infection that can cause skin lesions, but they often have a different appearance.\n\n8. **Bacterial Septicemia** - Can lead to skin manifestations, including petechiae or purpura, in the setting of severe infection.\n\n9. **Medication Reaction** - Although less likely given the lesion's appearance, some medication reactions can cause skin changes.\n\n10. **Leukemia Cutis** - Involvement of the skin by leukemic cells, which can cause nodules or plaques, but typically not with this appearance.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the most likely diagnosis is **Ecthyma Gangrenosum** due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, given the patient's neutropenic state and the characteristic appearance of the lesion.

A biopsy specimen was obtained from the left vulvar ulcer (Figure 1C). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cytomegalovirus ulcers", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an elderly woman who's feeling really tired and drowsy. That's not great, especially since she's also dealing with some painful ulcers down there. And she's been on cotrimoxazole, which can mess with blood cell counts. So, I'm thinking about drug reactions first. Stevens-Johnson syndrome comes to mind because it can cause ulcers and is a reaction to meds sometimes.\n\nBut wait, she's also got leukopenia. That's a low white blood cell count, which could mean her immune system is taking a hit. Cotrimoxazole can definitely cause that, so maybe it's agranulocytosis. That's when the meds really knock down those neutrophils.\n\nOh, and she was in the hospital not too long ago for pneumonia. That could have weakened her system, making her more vulnerable to infections. So, I should consider if something like a bacterial or fungal infection is at play here. Vulvar ulcers could be from an infection, right?\n\nHmm, what about autoimmune issues? Lupus or something similar could cause ulcers and fatigue. They often come with blood count issues too. I should keep that in mind.\n\nNow, let's not forget about the possibility of a vitamin deficiency. She's got anemia, which could be from a deficiency, like vitamin B12. That can cause fatigue and affect blood cells.\n\nOh, and necrotizing fasciitis is a scary thought. It's serious, but it could explain the ulcers and her overall poor condition. I should consider that too.\n\nAlso, herpes simplex virus can cause ulcers, especially in the genital area. It's worth thinking about, especially with her immune system possibly compromised.\n\nWhat about Behçet's disease? It can cause ulcers and systemic symptoms. It's rare, but it fits some of what's going on.\n\nNow, let's think about the biopsy. If it shows something like vasculitis, that could point to an autoimmune issue. That would be important.\n\nFinally, I should consider if this could be some type of paraneoplastic syndrome. Sometimes cancers can cause strange symptoms like this. It's a long shot, but it's worth considering.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think Stevens-Johnson syndrome is still a strong possibility because of the drug history and her symptoms. But I shouldn't ignore agranulocytosis or the chance of a serious infection. Autoimmune disorders like lupus and Behçet's are also on my radar. And I'll keep vitamin deficiencies and paraneoplastic syndromes in the back of my mind. Necrotizing fasciitis is less likely, but I won't rule it out completely. Herpes is a possibility too, given the ulcers. Alright, that's my take.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome** - Given the patient's recent use of cotrimoxazole and the presence of ulcers, this severe drug reaction is a strong consideration.\n\n2. **Agranulocytosis** - The low white blood cell count, particularly the neutrophils, suggests this condition, often linked to medication like cotrimoxazole.\n\n3. **Bacterial or Fungal Infection** - The history of recent hospitalization for pneumonia and the presence of ulcers raise the possibility of a secondary infection.\n\n4. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** - This autoimmune disease can cause ulcers, fatigue, and blood count abnormalities, making it a plausible option.\n\n5. **Vitamin B12 Deficiency** - The anemia and fatigue could be attributed to a vitamin deficiency, which can also affect blood cell production.\n\n6. **Necrotizing Fasciitis** - Although less likely, this severe condition could explain the ulcers and the patient's overall poor condition.\n\n7. **Herpes Simplex Virus Infection** - The genital ulcers and potential immune compromise make an HSV infection a possibility.\n\n8. **Behçet's Disease** - This rare condition causes ulcers and systemic symptoms, fitting some of the patient's presentation.\n\n9. **Vasculitis** - If the biopsy indicates vasculitis, it could point towards an autoimmune process affecting blood vessels.\n\n10. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - The array of symptoms could potentially be linked to an underlying malignancy, making this a consideration.\n\nReranking these possibilities based on the patient's symptoms and history, the top three differential diagnoses would be:\n\n1. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome** - The combination of drug history and ulcer presentation makes this a leading possibility.\n\n2. **Agranulocytosis** - The significant leukopenia and recent medication use support this diagnosis.\n\n3. **Autoimmune Disorder (e.g., SLE or Behçet's Disease)** - The systemic nature of symptoms and blood abnormalities make an autoimmune disorder a strong contender.\n\nThese diagnoses are prioritized based on the strength of association with the patient's symptoms and history, while also considering the potential severity and urgency of each condition.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Geriatrics', 'Urology', 'Gynecology', 'Obstetrics and Gynecology']"}

After ruling out infectious causes, an ultrasonography-guided thoracoamniotic shunt was placed successfully at 32 weeks’ gestation. Results of follow-up ultrasonography on postoperative day 3 showed improvement in the fetal hydrothorax and resolution of hydrops and identified a feeding vessel originating from the descending aorta supplying a lung mass (Figure 1A). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Bronchopulmonary sequestration", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a pregnant woman in her late 30s, and everything seemed fine on the ultrasound at 19 weeks. But then, at 32 weeks, things changed. The baby has fetal hydrops, which is a big red flag. There's a large left-sided hydrothorax, a mediastinal shift, and ascites. That's a lot going on. \n\nFirst, I need to consider what could cause this. Fetal hydrops can be due to a variety of reasons. My first thought is congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, or CCAM. It's a lung lesion that can cause these kinds of symptoms. \n\nBut wait, I shouldn't jump to conclusions. I need to think about other possibilities. How about a congenital diaphragmatic hernia? That could cause similar issues if there's abdominal contents pushing into the chest. \n\nOh, and I can't forget about cardiac issues. Conditions like hypoplastic left heart syndrome could lead to these findings too. \n\nNow, let's not overlook the possibility of a vascular anomaly. A bronchopulmonary sequestration could fit here, especially since it often has a systemic blood supply, like from the aorta. \n\nI should also think about other rare conditions. Maybe something like a neuroblastoma? It's not common, but it could present with these symptoms. \n\nAnd what about a congenital pulmonary airway malformation? That's another term for CCAM, but it's worth considering separately. \n\nI should also consider a fetal lung tumor, like a teratoma. Those can cause mass effects and hydrops. \n\nOh, and I can't ignore the possibility of a lymphatic issue, like a lymphangioma. Those can cause fluid accumulation. \n\nNow, let's think about the systemic supply from the descending aorta. That's a big clue. Bronchopulmonary sequestration often has that kind of blood supply. \n\nFinally, I should consider a congenital lobar emphysema. It's less likely, but it could cause some of these findings. \n\nOkay, let's put it all together. With the systemic arterial supply and the resolution of hydrops after the shunt, bronchopulmonary sequestration seems like the most likely diagnosis. It fits well with the imaging findings and the clinical outcome.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the fetal condition described is bronchopulmonary sequestration. This condition is characterized by a lung mass with a systemic blood supply, often from the descending aorta, which matches the findings in the ultrasound. The presence of a large left-sided hydrothorax, mediastinal shift, and ascites, along with the improvement after a thoracoamniotic shunt, further supports this diagnosis. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Bronchopulmonary Sequestration** - This is the most likely diagnosis given the systemic arterial supply from the descending aorta and the clinical presentation.\n2. **Congenital Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation (CCAM)** - A possible cause of fetal hydrops and lung lesions, but typically does not have a systemic arterial supply.\n3. **Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia** - Could cause similar symptoms if abdominal contents herniate into the chest, but the systemic supply is not typical.\n4. **Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome** - A cardiac anomaly that could lead to hydrops, but the findings do not strongly suggest a primary cardiac issue.\n5. **Neuroblastoma** - A rare possibility, but less likely given the specific imaging findings.\n6. **Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformation** - Similar to CCAM, but the systemic supply is atypical.\n7. **Fetal Lung Tumor (Teratoma)** - Could cause mass effects and hydrops, but the systemic supply pattern is less typical.\n8. **Lymphangioma** - Could cause fluid accumulation, but the systemic arterial supply does not fit.\n9. **Congenital Lobar Emphysema** - Less likely, as it typically does not present with these findings.\n10. **Other Vascular Anomalies** - Less likely given the specific findings and systemic supply.\n\nThe diagnosis of bronchopulmonary sequestration is most consistent with the clinical and imaging findings, including the systemic blood supply from the descending aorta and the improvement after shunt placement.", "topic": "['Surgery', \"Women's Health\", 'Obstetrics and Gynecology', 'Obstetrics']"}

A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed an inhomogeneous nodule in the subcutaneous layer with a largest diameter of approximately 5 cm. No enlarged lymph nodes were detectable in the groin. Results of a complete blood cell count and levels of alkaline phosphatase, lactic dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein were unremarkable. An ultrasonography-guided core needle biopsy was performed, and histopathologic evaluation showed the aspects of a small round-cell tumor, which was confirmed to be a Ewing sarcoma by immunohistochemical and molecular analysis (with positivity for the EWS-FLI1 fusion gene [OMIM 133450]). The patient then underwent disease staging with computed tomography (CT) of the chest and whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). The CT findings were negative for secondary lesions; the FDG-PET scan demonstrated, as expected, high uptake in the right thigh (maximum standard uptake variable [SUVmax], 8.4) at the site of the subcutaneous tumor and at a second lesion in the left ankle joint (SUVmax, 12.0). The patient reported vague pain around the left ankle but no functional limitations and no history of trauma at that site. A radiograph of the ankle did not show calcifications within the soft-tissue lesion. An MRI scan of the ankle showed a 1.5-cm soft tissue mass in the posterior recess of the ankle joint with a low to intermediate signal in T1- and T2-weighted sequences and moderate contrast enhancement throughout the lesion (Figure 1). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Tenosynovial giant cell tumor", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an adolescent girl with a growing, painless mass in her right thigh. That's been there for about three months. The MRI shows it's about 5 cm, and it's in the subcutaneous layer. No lymph nodes are enlarged, which is interesting. Her blood tests are all normal, so nothing alarming there.\n\nNow, the biopsy results are in, and it's showing a small round-cell tumor. That's a big clue. And with the EWS-FLI1 fusion gene present, it's confirmed to be Ewing sarcoma. That's a pretty specific finding.\n\nNext, we have the CT and PET scans. The CT doesn't show any secondary lesions, which is good. But the PET scan lights up not only the thigh but also a spot in the left ankle. That's unexpected. The uptake in the ankle is actually higher than in the thigh. Hmm, that's something to consider.\n\nThe patient mentions some vague pain in the ankle but nothing that's stopping her from moving around. And no history of trauma, which rules out an injury-related cause. The radiograph doesn't show any calcifications, so that's something to note.\n\nThe MRI of the ankle shows a small mass, about 1.5 cm, in the posterior recess. It's got a low to intermediate signal in T1 and T2 sequences and enhances moderately with contrast. That sounds like it could be a few things.\n\nSo, what could this ankle lesion be? Given the Ewing sarcoma in the thigh, my first thought is that it could be a metastasis from the primary tumor. That's a strong possibility.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. It could also be something like an osteoid osteoma. Those can show increased uptake on PET scans and cause pain, although the pain is usually more pronounced.\n\nAnother possibility is a synovial sarcoma. Those can occur near joints and have a similar appearance on MRI. They might show high uptake on PET scans too.\n\nThere's also the chance of a benign process like synovitis. That could cause some uptake on the PET scan, especially if there's any inflammation.\n\nOr it could be a different type of tumor, like a non-ossifying fibroma. Those are benign but can appear as incidental findings on imaging.\n\nNow, considering the context, the most likely explanation is still a metastasis from the Ewing sarcoma. The high PET uptake and the MRI findings fit that.\n\nBut I shouldn't ignore other possibilities. An osteoid osteoma is still a contender, given the PET findings and the location.\n\nA synovial sarcoma is also a strong candidate. It matches the MRI characteristics and could explain the PET uptake.\n\nSynovitis is less likely but can't be completely ruled out. It might explain the PET uptake if there's inflammation.\n\nAnd a non-ossifying fibroma, while benign, could be an incidental finding.\n\nAfter thinking it through, I'm leaning towards the ankle lesion being a metastasis from the Ewing sarcoma. It's the most straightforward explanation given the high PET uptake and the patient's primary diagnosis.\n\nBut I should keep synovial sarcoma in mind as a close second. It fits the imaging findings and could be a separate entity from the primary tumor.\n\nOsteoid osteoma and synovitis are still possibilities, but they seem less likely given the overall context.\n\nAnd a non-ossifying fibroma, while possible, doesn't quite fit the clinical picture as well as the other options.\n\nSo, in order, I'd say the lesion is most likely a metastasis from the Ewing sarcoma, followed by synovial sarcoma, then osteoid osteoma, synovitis, and lastly, a non-ossifying fibroma.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the lesion in the left ankle, considering the context of the confirmed Ewing sarcoma in the right thigh:\n\n1. **Metastasis from Ewing Sarcoma** - Given the primary diagnosis and the high uptake on the PET scan, this is the most likely explanation.\n2. **Synovial Sarcoma** - This matches the MRI characteristics and could explain the PET uptake, making it a strong contender.\n3. **Osteoid Osteoma** - Although less likely, it could explain the PET findings and is a possibility to consider.\n4. **Synovitis** - This could cause PET uptake due to inflammation, but it's less likely given the overall context.\n5. **Non-ossifying Fibroma** - A benign tumor that could be an incidental finding, but it doesn't fit the clinical picture as well.\n6. **Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis (PVNS)** - A condition that can cause joint-related masses and PET uptake.\n7. **Osteomyelitis** - Infection could cause increased PET uptake, but there's no specific indication of infection here.\n8. **Lipoma** - A benign soft tissue tumor, less likely given the PET uptake.\n9. **Hemangioma** - A vascular lesion that could enhance on MRI, but typically doesn't show high PET uptake.\n10. **Neurofibroma** - A benign nerve sheath tumor, unlikely given the PET findings and clinical context.\n\nThese possibilities are ranked based on the likelihood and fit with the clinical and imaging findings.

Treatment involved a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics, steroids, and medications for seizure prophylaxis. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Persistent left superior vena cava", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 63-year-old woman who's in a stupor and has a new facial droop. That's pretty concerning. A stupor usually means something serious is going on in the brain, and the facial droop could mean there's some kind of nerve involvement or brain issue. \n\nNow, she has a history of atrial fibrillation and has been on warfarin. Atrial fibrillation can lead to blood clots, and with warfarin in the mix, there's a risk of bleeding. So, I'm thinking stroke or bleeding in the brain could be possible. \n\nBut wait, there's more. She's got a history of having her atrial and ventricular septal defects repaired. That's interesting because any heart defect, even if repaired, can increase the risk of infections spreading to the brain. \n\nThe CT scan shows a right frontal lobe abscess. That's a brain abscess, which is a pocket of infection. And it's growing mixed oral flora. Hmm, that suggests the infection might have come from the mouth, maybe through the bloodstream. \n\nSo, let's think about what could cause a brain abscess. There's the possibility of bacteria traveling from the heart to the brain, especially with her history of heart defects. Or, it could be from an infected heart valve, which is called infective endocarditis. \n\nNow, considering her atrial fibrillation and the fact she's on warfarin, I should also think about a hemorrhagic stroke. Warfarin increases bleeding risk, so maybe that's playing a role here. \n\nBut wait, the abscess is with mixed oral flora. That makes me think of an infection that started in the mouth. Could it be something like endocarditis that led to this abscess? \n\nOh, and let's not forget about the possibility of a cryptogenic stroke. Sometimes strokes happen without a clear cause, and with her atrial fibrillation, that's a possibility too. \n\nNow, considering everything, I should also think about other heart-related issues. Could this be related to her septal defect repairs? Maybe there's a residual defect or something that's making her more prone to infections. \n\nAnd what about other sources of infection? Could there be something else, like a lung infection or even a dental infection, that's led to this abscess? \n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the top possibilities are a paradoxical embolism from a pulmonary source, followed by infective endocarditis, and then a cryptogenic stroke. These seem to fit with her history and the test results. \n\nYeah, that makes sense. The paradoxical embolism could explain the abscess and her heart history, while infective endocarditis fits with the mixed flora. And the cryptogenic stroke is a good catch-all for any unexplained stroke risk from her atrial fibrillation.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 63-year-old woman with a brain abscess and her complex medical history:\n\n1. **Paradoxical Embolism**: Given her history of atrial septal defect (ASD) and ventricular septal defect (VSD) repair, a paradoxical embolism could have occurred, where a blood clot from the venous system bypassed the lungs and entered the arterial circulation, potentially leading to a brain abscess.\n\n2. **Infective Endocarditis**: The presence of mixed oral flora in the abscess suggests a possible infection originating from the heart valves, which could have spread to the brain.\n\n3. **Cryptogenic Stroke**: Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke, and despite the lack of clear evidence, a cryptogenic stroke remains a possibility due to her atrial fibrillation and the brain abscess.\n\n4. **Hemorrhagic Stroke**: Warfarin therapy increases the risk of bleeding, and a hemorrhagic stroke could have contributed to the development of the brain abscess.\n\n5. **Dental Infection**: An infection from a dental source could have spread to the brain, given the mixed oral flora found in the abscess.\n\n6. **Lung Infection**: A pulmonary infection could have served as a source of emboli, leading to the brain abscess.\n\n7. **Residual Septal Defect**: Despite previous repairs, a residual defect could predispose her to infections or embolic events.\n\n8. **Valve Vegetation**: Vegetations on the heart valves could break off and travel to the brain, causing an abscess.\n\n9. **Atrial Myxoma**: A cardiac tumor like an atrial myxoma could have embolized and led to the abscess formation.\n\n10. **Hypercoagulable State**: An underlying hypercoagulable state could contribute to thrombus formation and embolism, leading to the brain abscess.\n\nReranking these based on the patient's history and test results, the top three differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Paradoxical Embolism**\n2. **Infective Endocarditis**\n3. **Cryptogenic Stroke**\n\nThese diagnoses align with her history of septal defects, atrial fibrillation, and the presence of mixed oral flora in the abscess.", "topic": "['Congenital Defects', 'Neurology', 'CNS Infections', 'Cardiology', 'Rhythm Disorders']"}

We've got an 8-month-old baby with a painful ulcer in the anogenital area. It started as these pink patches that turned into pustules and then ulcers. That's pretty rapid. The baby seems otherwise okay, no fever or anything, just some fatigue. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nThe ulcer itself is symmetric and has this cribriform base with central necrosis. The borders are rolled and pink-to-violaceous. That sounds quite specific. Let's see what that could mean.\n\nFirst, I'm thinking about infections. Could it be something like a bacterial infection? Maybe a staph or strep infection. Those can cause skin issues, but usually, you'd expect some fever or more systemic signs. And the lab cultures didn't show a primary bacterial cause, though there were some bacteria in the wound. So, maybe not a straightforward infection.\n\nNext, I'm considering inflammatory conditions. Behçet's disease comes to mind. It's known for causing ulcers with a similar appearance. But, wait, Behçet's is rare in infants. Could it still be that? Possibly, but let's keep looking.\n\nWhat about zinc deficiency? That can cause skin problems, but the zinc levels are normal here. So, that's not it.\n\nHmm, how about Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis? It can cause skin ulcers, but you'd usually see other symptoms too, like bone lesions. There's no mention of that here, so probably not.\n\nLet's think about other autoimmune issues, like Crohn's disease. It can cause perianal disease, but usually, there are gastrointestinal symptoms too. This baby doesn't have any, so it's unlikely.\n\nCould it be an infection we didn't catch? Like a mycobacterial or fungal infection? The cultures were negative, but sometimes they can be tricky. Still, I think we can put that lower on the list.\n\nOh, what about a vasculitis like Pyoderma Gangrenosum? It can cause ulcers, but it's more common in older kids or adults. And there are usually other signs. So, maybe not.\n\nLet's not forget about trauma. Could this be non-accidental trauma? The parents deny any new exposures, and there's no other evidence of trauma. So, that seems unlikely.\n\nFinally, there's the possibility of an unusual condition like Acrodermatitis Enteropathica. It causes skin lesions, but usually, there are other symptoms like diarrhea. This baby doesn't have that, so it's probably not that.\n\nSo, after thinking it through, Behçet's disease still seems like a strong possibility, even though it's rare in infants.

The remainder of the neurologic examination results were normal. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cavernous sinus syndrome", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an 8-year-old boy who's been feeling really tired for a couple of weeks, and now he's got double vision, droopy eyelid, and some swelling around his left eye. That's quite a mix of symptoms. \n\nFirst off, the droopy eyelid and double vision make me think of something going on with the muscles around the eye. Could it be myasthenia gravis? That's known for causing muscle weakness that gets worse with activity. \n\nBut wait, there's also the fatigue. That's a bit more general, but it could fit with myasthenia gravis since that can cause widespread muscle fatigue. \n\nNow, let's think about the eye itself. The pupil on the left side is really big and not reacting to light. That's strange. It could mean something is affecting the nerves that control the eye muscles or the pupil. Maybe it's a problem with the oculomotor nerve, like a palsy. \n\nHmm, what could cause a third nerve palsy in a kid? Aneurysms are rare in children, but they can happen. It's something to keep in mind. \n\nBut let's not forget the proptosis and swelling around the eye. That suggests something might be pushing from behind the eye, like a mass or inflammation. Orbital cellulitis is a possibility, but usually, that's painful and comes with fever. \n\nCould it be a tumor? Rhabdomyosarcoma is a type of cancer that can occur in the orbit and cause these kinds of symptoms. It's definitely something to consider. \n\nOh, and there's the fatigue again. If it's myasthenia gravis, we'd expect muscle weakness, but not necessarily proptosis. So maybe it's not that. \n\nLet's think about other causes of proptosis. Thyroid eye disease can cause bulging eyes, but it's rare in kids and usually comes with other symptoms. \n\nWhat about inflammation like orbital pseudotumor? That can cause swelling and proptosis without pain. It's a possibility. \n\nNow, let's put it all together. We've got droopy eyelid, double vision, a big unreactive pupil, and swelling around the eye. Plus, there's the fatigue. \n\nMyasthenia gravis could explain the muscle weakness, but not the proptosis. A third nerve palsy could explain the eye symptoms, but not the fatigue. \n\nRhabdomyosarcoma could explain the proptosis and swelling, but not the pupil reaction issue. Orbital pseudotumor could explain the swelling and proptosis, but not the pupil problem. \n\nHmm, what about a neuroblastoma? That's a type of cancer that can cause proptosis and fatigue, and sometimes affects the nerves. It's a bit of a long shot, but it could fit. \n\nSo, after thinking it all through, I'm leaning towards neuroblastoma. It seems to tie together the proptosis, fatigue, and some of the eye symptoms. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the symptoms and examination findings, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 8-year-old boy:\n\n1. **Myasthenia Gravis** - This condition is known for causing muscle weakness that worsens with activity, which could explain the ptosis and double vision.\n\n2. **Third Cranial Nerve Palsy** - The left eye's unreactive pupil and limited movement suggest a potential issue with the oculomotor nerve.\n\n3. **Orbital Cellulitis** - Although typically painful and associated with fever, it's important to consider due to the proptosis and periorbital swelling.\n\n4. **Rhabdomyosarcoma** - A type of orbital tumor that can cause proptosis and swelling, which aligns with some of the symptoms.\n\n5. **Orbital Pseudotumor** - A non-specific term for idiopathic orbital inflammation, which can cause painless proptosis and swelling.\n\n6. **Thyroid Eye Disease** - Though rare in children, it can cause proptosis and eyelid retraction, but usually accompanies other systemic symptoms.\n\n7. **Neuroblastoma** - A childhood cancer that can cause proptosis and systemic symptoms like fatigue, potentially affecting nerve function.\n\n8. **Orbital Lymphangioma** - A congenital vascular lesion that can cause proptosis and swelling, often without pain.\n\n9. **Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis** - A condition that can cause proptosis, ptosis, and cranial nerve palsies, often with associated systemic symptoms.\n\n10. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome** - A rare condition causing painful ophthalmoplegia, but the painless nature in this case makes it less likely.\n\nAfter considering all the symptoms and test results, the top differential diagnoses are **Myasthenia Gravis** and **Neuroblastoma**, as they both account for a combination of the muscle weakness, proptosis, and systemic fatigue. However, **Neuroblastoma** seems to fit more comprehensively with the symptom profile, including the proptosis and fatigue. Further diagnostic testing, such as imaging and blood tests, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.", "topic": "['Neurology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Pediatrics', 'Orbit', 'Oncology']"}

She had a history of migraine headaches, for which she took nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for symptomatic relief. At her examination, she reported feeling tired but denied other medical problems. On examination, her visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Intraocular pressure was 15 mm Hg OU, extraocular motility was normal, and findings of the anterior segment examination were normal. There was no afferent pupillary defect, and dilated fundus examination revealed healthy-appearing optic nerves and normal retinas. Automated perimetry demonstrated a right-sided homonymous hemianopia. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain performed the same day revealed subacute infarction of portions of the left occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes (Figure). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Moyamoya disease", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. A teenage girl is having blurry vision on the right side. That's interesting because it's only one side, so it might be something going on in the brain rather than the eyes themselves. Her visual acuity is perfect, and the pressures in her eyes are normal too. So, it's not likely a problem with the eyes directly. \n\nNow, she's got this right-sided homonymous hemianopia. That means she's missing the same half of the visual field in both eyes. This usually points to something happening in the brain, maybe the occipital lobe or the optic tract. \n\nThe MRI shows she's had a stroke affecting the left occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes. That fits with her symptoms because the left side of the brain controls the right visual field. But, strokes in teenagers? That's pretty rare. We need to figure out why this happened. \n\nShe's young, so we should think about unusual causes of stroke. Things like blood clotting disorders or vasculitis come to mind. Migraines can sometimes cause stroke-like symptoms too, and she has a history of migraines. Could they be playing a role here? \n\nLet's not forget about other possibilities like central nervous system vasculitis or even something like Moyamoya disease. These could cause the kind of blood flow problems that lead to a stroke. \n\nOh, and what about conditions that make blood more likely to clot, like antiphospholipid syndrome? That's something to consider too. \n\nNow, let's think about the migraine angle. Migraines can cause visual symptoms, but they usually don't cause strokes. Still, in someone so young, maybe we should consider migrainous infarction. \n\nWait, what about arterial dissection? That's when a tear in an artery can lead to a stroke. It's not common in teens, but it's worth thinking about. \n\nAnd then there's the possibility of a cardiac source of embolism. Even if she's young, sometimes heart problems can cause strokes. We should keep this in mind. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the top possibilities are migrainous infarction, antiphospholipid syndrome, arterial dissection, and CNS vasculitis. Each of these could explain the stroke in this young girl. \n\nBut, let's not forget to consider everything. We should also think about other rare causes like Moyamoya disease or a heart problem like a patent foramen ovale. \n\nIn the end, after thinking through all of this, I'm leaning towards migrainous infarction as the most likely cause. But, we should definitely investigate further to rule out or confirm the other possibilities.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the teenage girl's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Migrainous Infarction** - Given her history of migraines, this is a strong consideration.\n2. **Antiphospholipid Syndrome** - A condition that increases the risk of blood clots, which could lead to stroke.\n3. **Arterial Dissection** - A tear in an artery that could cause a stroke, although less common in teenagers.\n4. **Central Nervous System Vasculitis** - Inflammation of blood vessels in the brain that could lead to stroke-like symptoms.\n5. **Moyamoya Disease** - A rare condition causing narrowing of blood vessels in the brain.\n6. **Patent Foramen Ovale** - A heart condition that could allow blood clots to pass to the brain.\n7. **Thrombophilia** - General tendency for blood to clot, which could increase stroke risk.\n8. **Vasculitis (Systemic)** - Inflammation of blood vessels throughout the body that could affect the brain.\n9. **Cardiac Arrhythmia** - Abnormal heart rhythms that could lead to blood clots traveling to the brain.\n10. **Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis** - A clot in the veins that drain blood from the brain.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top possibilities are migrainous infarction, antiphospholipid syndrome, arterial dissection, and CNS vasculitis.

Symptom onset was approximately 3 months prior to presentation when the patient began reporting difficulty reading. She was initially evaluated by her local eye care professional and noted to have visual acuity of 20/100 OD and 20/25 OS with cecocentral visual field defect in the right eye. Results of ophthalmoscopic examination of the optic nerves at this time revealed mild elevation of the optic nerves. Magnetic resonance imaging findings of the orbits were normal. At presentation 3 months after onset of decreased vision, the patient reported that her vision continued to worsen. Best corrected visual acuity was measured at 20/400 OD and 20/40 OS. Both optic nerves were found to be mildly hyperemic with a few telangiectatic vessels on the left and trace temporal pallor on the right. Color vision was 3/13 in the right eye and normal in the left. There was no relative afferent pupillary defect. The patient’s 24-2 Humphrey visual field in the right eye is shown in the Figure. The left eye had a very similar pattern. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Leber hereditary optic neuropathy", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a woman in her early 50s who's been having trouble with her vision for the past three months. She's finding it hard to read, and her vision has gotten worse over time. That's definitely concerning.\n\nFirst, let's consider optic neuritis. It's a common condition that can cause decreased vision and usually affects young adults, but it can happen in people in their 50s too. The fact that her vision is worsening could fit, but usually, optic neuritis comes with pain, and there's no mention of that here.\n\nNext up, let's think about ischemic optic neuropathy. This condition often causes sudden vision loss, and it's more common in older adults. The fact that there's no pain and the vision loss is progressive makes me think this could be a possibility. Plus, the optic disc elevation and telangiectatic vessels are interesting clues.\n\nNow, what about compressive optic neuropathy? This happens when something like a tumor presses on the optic nerve. The gradual worsening of vision could fit, but usually, you'd expect some kind of mass to show up on the MRI, and this patient's MRI was normal. So, this seems less likely.\n\nLet's not forget about glaucoma. It can cause progressive vision loss, but it's usually associated with increased eye pressure and changes in the optic disc that we don't see here. So, glaucoma doesn't seem to match well.\n\nHow about a retinal cause like macular degeneration? This can cause central vision loss, but it wouldn't explain the optic nerve changes. So, that's probably not it.\n\nWe should also consider hereditary optic neuropathies like Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. This condition often affects young adults, but it can present later. The fact that there's no family history mentioned makes this less likely, but it's still worth considering.\n\nNext, let's think about toxic or nutritional optic neuropathy. This can cause progressive vision loss and could fit with the bilateral involvement. But we don't have any information about potential toxins or nutritional deficiencies, so it's hard to say for sure.\n\nInfiltrative optic neuropathy, like what you might see with sarcoidosis, could be another option. This can cause gradual vision changes, but we'd usually expect other systemic symptoms or abnormalities on MRI. Since those aren't present, this seems less likely.\n\nNow, what about papilledema? This is caused by increased intracranial pressure and can cause vision changes. The optic disc elevation could fit, but we'd usually expect headaches or other symptoms, and the MRI was normal. So, this doesn't seem to match.\n\nFinally, let's consider atypical cases of optic nerve drusen. These are deposits on the optic nerve that can cause progressive vision loss. The optic nerve changes could fit, but this is usually seen in younger patients, so it's a bit of a stretch.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think ischemic optic neuropathy is the most likely diagnosis. The progressive vision loss, optic disc elevation, and telangiectatic vessels all point in that direction. It's not a perfect fit, but it's the best explanation given the information we have.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Optic Neuritis** - Although it typically presents with pain, it's a common cause of vision loss in this age group.\n2. **Ischemic Optic Neuropathy** - The progressive vision loss and optic disc changes align with this condition.\n3. **Compressive Optic Neuropathy** - Despite the normal MRI, this remains a consideration due to the gradual vision decline.\n4. **Glaucoma** - While less likely, it can cause progressive vision changes, though typically with different optic disc findings.\n5. **Macular Degeneration** - This could explain central vision loss but not the optic nerve changes.\n6. **Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy** - Although more common in young adults, it could present later without a clear family history.\n7. **Toxic or Nutritional Optic Neuropathy** - This is a possibility given the bilateral involvement, but more information is needed.\n8. **Infiltrative Optic Neuropathy** - Conditions like sarcoidosis could cause these symptoms, but systemic signs are usually present.\n9. **Papilledema** - Caused by increased intracranial pressure, but typically accompanied by other symptoms and abnormal MRI findings.\n10. **Optic Nerve Drusen** - Usually seen in younger patients, but could cause progressive vision changes.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Ischemic Optic Neuropathy** emerges as the most likely diagnosis due to the progressive nature of the vision loss, optic disc elevation, and telangiectatic vessels.

She had 3 previous pregnancies (2 live births and 1 spontaneous abortion); her last child was born more than 5 years ago. Her chest pain began spontaneously 1 hour prior to presentation and was described as retrosternal with radiation to her upper and middle back. On physical examination, her blood pressure was 128/88 mm Hg, her pulse was regular at 96 beats per minute, her respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute, and her temperature was 36.9° C. Pulse oximetry was 100% in room air. The chest was nontender. Pertinent physical findings included normal central venous pressures, clear lung fields, normal first and second heart sounds, an audible fourth heart sound, and no murmurs. The electrocardiogram (Figure 1A) demonstrated anterior ST-segment elevations consistent with an anterior acute current of injury. Results from the chest radiography were normal. Initial troponin I concentration was 0.02 ng/mL but rose to 177.76 ng/mL over the ensuing 4 hours (the patient’s chest pain had resolved by this time). Urgent coronary angiography was performed (Figure 1B). Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow grade 2 was observed in the left anterior descending artery and second diagonal branch. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Spontaneous coronary artery dissection", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 44-year-old African American woman who's come to the ER with chest pain. She doesn't have the usual risk factors for heart disease, which is interesting. Her chest pain started out of the blue an hour ago, and it's sitting right in the middle of her chest, spreading to her upper and middle back. That sounds pretty serious.\n\nWhen we check her vitals, her blood pressure and pulse are okay, nothing too alarming there. Her oxygen levels are perfect, and she's not running a fever. Her chest isn't tender, which is good. But, I notice her heart sounds are a bit off; there's an extra heart sound, the fourth one, which can mean something's up with her heart.\n\nThe ECG shows ST-segment elevations in the front part of her heart. That's a big red flag for a heart attack. But, her initial troponin levels, which help confirm a heart attack, are really low. Hmm, that's odd. But wait, a few hours later, those levels skyrocket. That's more like what we'd expect with a heart attack.\n\nSo, we did a coronary angiography to get a better look at her arteries. And there it is, we've got reduced blood flow in one of her main heart arteries, the LAD. That's not good.\n\nNow, let's think about what could be causing this. The first thing that comes to mind is a blockage in the artery, like a blood clot. That's a pretty common cause of a heart attack.\n\nBut, wait a minute, she doesn't have the usual risk factors for heart disease. So, what else could it be? Maybe it's a spasm of the coronary artery. That can cause these symptoms too, even without the usual risk factors.\n\nOh, and there's also the possibility of a temporary issue with the coronary artery, like a dissection. That's when the layers of the artery wall split, which can block blood flow.\n\nAnother thought is myocarditis. That's when the heart muscle gets inflamed, often from a viral infection. It can mimic a heart attack with similar symptoms and test results.\n\nPrinzmetal's angina is another possibility. That's when the coronary arteries spasm, causing chest pain and ST-segment changes, just like we're seeing here.\n\nAnd then there's the idea of a coronary artery embolism. That's when a blood clot from somewhere else travels to the coronary artery and causes a blockage.\n\nWe shouldn't forget about coronary vasospasm either. Similar to Prinzmetal's angina, it involves the artery tightening up and restricting blood flow.\n\nThere's also a condition called SCAD, spontaneous coronary artery dissection. That's when the artery wall tears, which can lead to a blockage.\n\nOh, and let's not overlook the possibility of an aortic dissection. That's when the main artery from the heart tears, which can cause chest pain and other complications.\n\nLastly, there's the chance of aortic root disease, where the part of the aorta near the heart is affected, potentially causing similar symptoms.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the top possibilities are a coronary artery embolism, coronary vasospasm, SCAD, and myocarditis. These seem to fit best with what we're seeing in her tests and symptoms.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) due to Atherosclerotic Plaque Rupture** - This is a common cause of heart attacks, where a plaque in the coronary artery ruptures, leading to a blockage.\n\n2. **Coronary Artery Spasm** - This can cause chest pain and ST-segment elevations similar to a heart attack, even without traditional risk factors.\n\n3. **Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD)** - A condition where a tear occurs in the coronary artery wall, leading to potential blockage.\n\n4. **Myocarditis** - Inflammation of the heart muscle, often viral in origin, which can mimic a heart attack in presentation and test results.\n\n5. **Prinzmetal's Angina** - A type of angina caused by coronary artery spasms, leading to chest pain and ST-segment changes.\n\n6. **Coronary Artery Embolism** - A blood clot from another part of the body travels to and blocks a coronary artery.\n\n7. **Aortic Dissection** - A tear in the aorta that can cause chest pain and other symptoms similar to a heart attack.\n\n8. **Aortic Root Disease** - Conditions affecting the part of the aorta near the heart, potentially causing similar symptoms.\n\n9. **Coronary Vasospasm** - Similar to Prinzmetal's angina, involving the tightening of coronary arteries and restricting blood flow.\n\n10. **Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy** - A condition where the heart muscle weakens and cannot function properly due to extreme emotional or physical stress, mimicking a heart attack.\n\nAfter considering all the patient's information and test results, the top differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD)**\n2. **Coronary Artery Embolism**\n3. **Coronary Vasospasm**\n4. **Myocarditis**\n\nThese conditions align well with the patient's atypical presentation and the findings from her diagnostic tests.", "topic": "['Radiology', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Acute Coronary Syndromes', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiac Imaging']"}

The patient’s parents denied any associated fevers, chills, night sweats, sore throat, abdominal pain, or weight changes. Medical history was noncontributory. Physical examination showed bilateral, mobile, nontender cervical lymphadenopathy without erythema or swelling. Tonsils were symmetric and not enlarged. There was no noticeable thyromegaly or nodules. Laboratory testing was significant for an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (37 mmol/h). Ultrasonography demonstrated cervical lymphadenopathy bilaterally with the largest node measuring 3.8 cm in maximum dimension. Lymph node needle core biopsy demonstrated increased histiocytes and numerous plasma cells on tissue section (Figure, A). Scattered neutrophils and rare giant cells were also present. Findings of Grocott methenamine silver, acid-fast, and Warthin-Starry stains were negative. The CD-68 immunostain showed numerous histiocytes. The specimen stained positive for CD-30 and S-100 immunostains showing emperipolesis (Figure, B and C). Findings of a CD1a stain were negative. Lymphoid markers by flow cytometry showed a polyclonal mixed B-cell and T-cell population. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Rosai-Dorfman disease", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a child under 10 with swollen lymph nodes on both sides of the neck for 8 weeks. That's quite a while. And it didn't get better with antibiotics, which is interesting. Usually, if it were a simple bacterial infection, you'd expect some improvement, right?\n\nThe parents say there are no fevers, chills, or night sweats. That's good to know because those symptoms often point to something more serious like lymphoma or tuberculosis. No sore throat or weight changes either, which is reassuring.\n\nNow, let's look at the physical exam. The lymph nodes are mobile and not tender. That's a good sign. They're not red or swollen, and the tonsils look normal. No thyroid issues either. So, it doesn't seem like a typical infection or something hormonal.\n\nThe lab results show an elevated ESR. That indicates some inflammation going on, but it's not super high, so maybe not a severe infection or autoimmune issue. The ultrasound confirms the lymphadenopathy, and the largest node is 3.8 cm. That's pretty significant.\n\nThe biopsy is really telling. There are a lot of histiocytes and plasma cells. Hmm, that's interesting. A few neutrophils and rare giant cells too. The stains for infections like fungi, acid-fast bacteria, and certain viruses are all negative. That's a relief because it rules out a lot of scary infections.\n\nNow, let's talk about the immunostains. CD-68 shows lots of histiocytes, which makes sense. But CD-30 and S-100 are positive, and there's emperipolesis. That's a hallmark of Langerhans cell histiocytosis, but wait, the CD1a stain is negative. That's strange because you'd expect it to be positive in LCH.\n\nThe flow cytometry shows a polyclonal mix of B and T cells. So, it's not looking like a lymphoma, which is good news.\n\nOkay, let's think about what this could be. Initially, I thought about infectious mononucleosis, but there's no fever or sore throat, and the biopsy doesn't really match.\n\nKawasaki disease crossed my mind, but there are no symptoms like rash or conjunctivitis, and the lack of response to antibiotics doesn't fit.\n\nCastleman disease was another thought, but the biopsy findings don't quite match up. We don't see the typical hyaline vascular structures.\n\nLangerhans cell histiocytosis was a strong contender with the positive CD-30 and S-100, but the negative CD1a throws a wrench in that diagnosis.\n\nHmm, what about Rosai-Dorfman disease? The biopsy shows emperipolesis and lots of histiocytes, which fits. And the negative CD1a stain aligns with Rosai-Dorfman.\n\nSo, after going through everything, Rosai-Dorfman disease seems to be the best fit. It matches the clinical presentation and the biopsy findings. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis for the child is Rosai-Dorfman disease. This condition, also known as sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy, is characterized by the presence of histiocytes and emperipolesis, as seen in the biopsy findings. The positive CD-30 and S-100 immunostains, along with the negative CD1a stain, further support this diagnosis. The clinical presentation of prolonged, painless lymphadenopathy and the lack of response to antibiotics also align with Rosai-Dorfman disease. \n\nHere is the ranked list of differential diagnoses:\n\n1. **Rosai-Dorfman Disease** - The clinical presentation and biopsy findings, including emperipolesis and the specific immunostain profile, strongly support this diagnosis.\n2. Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis - Although the positive CD-30 and S-100 could suggest LCH, the negative CD1a stain makes this less likely.\n3. Infectious Mononucleosis - The lack of fever, sore throat, and negative biopsy findings for infectious agents make this less likely.\n4. Castleman Disease - The biopsy findings do not show the characteristic hyaline vascular structures.\n5. Kawasaki Disease - The absence of systemic symptoms like rash or conjunctivitis and lack of response to antibiotics do not support this diagnosis.\n6. Lymphoma - The polyclonal nature of the lymphocyte population on flow cytometry does not indicate a lymphoma.\n7. Tuberculosis - Negative stains for acid-fast bacteria and lack of systemic symptoms make this unlikely.\n8. Sarcoidosis - The biopsy findings and immunostain profile do not align with sarcoidosis.\n9. Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome - The clinical presentation and biopsy findings do not support this diagnosis.\n10. Chronic Granulomatous Disease - The biopsy findings and negative infectious stains do not indicate this condition.", "topic": "['Pediatrics', 'Otolaryngology']"}

He had no history of underlying medical diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, hepatitis, and tuberculosis. On physical examination, a whitish, firm, painless, nodular mass on the superficial layer of the left upper lip was observed (Figure, A). Given the possibility of a tumorous lesion, complete excision was planned under local anesthesia. In surgery, the 1.5 × 1.2 cm, whitish, firm, nodular, and well-encapsulated mass was excised completely without rupture of the capsule from the surrounding mucosa. On histopathologic examination, an encapsulated salivary gland tumor with epithelial and myoepithelial cells, ductlike structures, and mixed stroma was observed (Figure, B). One month after surgery, the surgical wound on the left upper lip was clean and well healed. One year later, there had been no recurrence, and the patient had no symptoms at the left upper lip. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Pleomorphic adenoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a man in his 30s with a slow-growing mass in his upper lip. It's been there for years, so it's probably not something too aggressive. He's healthy otherwise, no big medical issues like hypertension or diabetes. That's good to know.\n\nWhen I think about slow-growing masses in the lip, the first thing that comes to mind is a benign tumor. Pleomorphic adenoma is pretty common in the salivary glands, so that's a strong possibility. It's known for being a slow grower and usually isn't painful, which fits what we're seeing here.\n\nBut let's not jump to conclusions. What else could it be? Lipomas are pretty common too. They're benign, soft tissue tumors that can show up just about anywhere, including the lip. They're usually soft and doughy, though, not firm like this one. Still, it's worth considering.\n\nOkay, what about other benign salivary gland tumors? Warthin's tumor comes to mind. It's another benign tumor that can occur in the salivary glands, but it's more common in the parotid gland, not really the lip. Plus, it's more often found in older people who smoke. This patient is in his 30s and we don't know if he smokes, so maybe not.\n\nLet's think about malignant possibilities. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a type of malignant salivary gland tumor. It can show up in the minor salivary glands of the lip, but it's usually more aggressive. This mass has been growing slowly for years, which doesn't really fit the bill for something malignant.\n\nWhat about other types of tumors? Neurofibromas are benign nerve sheath tumors. They can appear as soft, slow-growing masses, but they're not typically found in the lip. It's a bit of a stretch, but I'll keep it in mind.\n\nNow, let's consider the histopathology. The mass has epithelial and myoepithelial cells, ductlike structures, and mixed stroma. That sounds just like a pleomorphic adenoma to me. It's got that classic mix of cell types and stromal variation.\n\nBut wait, could it be something else? Basal cell adenoma is another benign salivary gland tumor. It can have a similar appearance, but it's usually more monomorphic. The mixed stroma we're seeing here makes me think it's more likely a pleomorphic adenoma.\n\nLet's not forget about oncocytoma. It's a benign tumor that can occur in the salivary glands, but it's more common in the parotid gland. It's characterized by oncocytes, which we haven't heard anything about in this case.\n\nAnd then there's canalicular adenoma. It's a benign tumor that can show up in the minor salivary glands of the lip. It's known for having a more lobular architecture and ductlike structures, which kind of fits what we're seeing.\n\nSo, after thinking through all of this, I'm pretty confident that the most likely diagnosis is pleomorphic adenoma. The slow growth, the firmness, the histopathology – it all points in that direction. But I'm also considering canalicular adenoma as a close second, given the location and the structural features.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the mass in the upper lip, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Pleomorphic Adenoma** - A common benign salivary gland tumor known for its slow growth and mixed cellular components.\n2. **Lipoma** - A benign soft tissue tumor, though typically softer and more doughy than the mass described.\n3. **Warthin's Tumor** - Another benign salivary gland tumor, more commonly found in the parotid gland and in older individuals.\n4. **Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma** - A malignant salivary gland tumor, which usually presents more aggressively than the described mass.\n5. **Neurofibroma** - A benign nerve sheath tumor, not typically found in the lip region.\n6. **Basal Cell Adenoma** - A benign salivary gland tumor that is more monomorphic than pleomorphic adenoma.\n7. **Oncocytoma** - A benign tumor more commonly found in the parotid gland, characterized by oncocytes.\n8. **Canalicular Adenoma** - A benign tumor of the minor salivary glands, known for its lobular architecture and ductlike structures.\n9. **Schwannoma** - A benign nerve sheath tumor, which can present as a slow-growing mass.\n10. **Fibroma** - A benign fibrous tissue tumor, which could present as a firm, slow-growing mass.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the most likely diagnosis is **Pleomorphic Adenoma**, given the slow growth, firmness, and histopathological features. **Canalicular Adenoma** is also a strong contender due to the location and structural characteristics.", "topic": "['Pathology and Laboratory Medicine', 'Dermatology']"}

Physical examination revealed a single erythematous scaling plaque involving the left lower eyelid, including its border. Eyelashes were totally absent (Figure 1A). No other lesions were found after complete physical examination. Dermoscopy showed an erythematous background, telangiectatic vessels, whitish structureless areas, and whitish scales (Figure 1B). A 4-mm punch biopsy specimen was obtained (Figure 1C). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Discoid lupus erythematosus", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 40-year-old woman with a red, scaly patch on her eyelid. It's been there for 8 years and is slowly growing. That's a long time for a skin issue to stick around, so it's probably not something too dangerous, right? But still, it's persistent, so we should figure out what it is.\n\nFirst off, the location is key. It's on her eyelid, which is a sensitive area. Not all skin conditions like to hang out there, so that's a clue. Hmm, what usually shows up on the eyelids? I know discoid lupus erythematosus can appear there. It's known for those red, scaly plaques, and it can cause hair loss, which might explain why her eyelashes are gone.\n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. There are other things that could cause a red, scaly patch. Seborrheic dermatitis is pretty common and can show up around the eyes. It's usually more flaky and less persistent, but it's worth considering.\n\nOh, and there's psoriasis. It's another scaly, red skin condition, but it's not as common on the eyelids. Still, it's possible, especially if she has it elsewhere, which she doesn't seem to. But let's keep it in mind.\n\nNow, what about the dermoscopy? It shows telangiectatic vessels and whitish scales. That's interesting because telangiectatic vessels can be a sign of discoid lupus. But wait, those whitish scales could also point to something like psoriasis or even eczema.\n\nOkay, let's think about the biopsy. It's a crucial piece of the puzzle. If it shows interface dermatitis, that would lean towards discoid lupus. But if it shows psoriatic changes, like Munro microabscesses, then we're looking at psoriasis.\n\nHmm, what about other possibilities? Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, like mycosis fungoides, could present with persistent patches, but it's rare on the eyelids. And it usually has a different histological picture.\n\nLet's not forget about infections. There's lupus vulgaris, a form of cutaneous tuberculosis, which can cause persistent plaques. It's not common, but it's a possibility. And the biopsy would show granulomas if that's the case.\n\nOh, and there's also rosacea to consider. It can cause redness and scaling, especially on the face. But it usually involves the cheeks and forehead more than the eyelids.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Based on the location, appearance, and dermoscopy, discoid lupus erythematosus is still a strong contender. But we can't rule out psoriasis or even seborrheic dermatitis yet.\n\nLet's see how the biopsy results fit in. If they show interface dermatitis, we're likely dealing with discoid lupus. If it's more psoriatic changes, then psoriasis is possible.\n\nIn the end, after considering everything, discoid lupus erythematosus seems like the most likely diagnosis. But we should keep an open mind and consider other possibilities until we have all the facts.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the condition described:\n\n1. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus** - This is a strong contender given the location on the eyelid, the persistent nature of the plaque, and the dermoscopic findings of telangiectatic vessels.\n\n2. **Seborrheic Dermatitis** - Common around the eyes, it presents with flaky, red plaques, but is usually less persistent than the described lesion.\n\n3. **Psoriasis** - Although less common on the eyelids, psoriasis can present with scaly, erythematous plaques and could be considered if biopsy shows psoriatic changes.\n\n4. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides)** - Presents with persistent patches, but is rare on the eyelids and has distinct histological features.\n\n5. **Lupus Vulgaris** - A form of cutaneous tuberculosis that can cause persistent plaques; diagnosis would be supported by granulomas on biopsy.\n\n6. **Rosacea** - Can cause facial redness and scaling, but typically involves the cheeks and forehead more than the eyelids.\n\n7. **Eczema (Dermatitis)** - Could present with similar symptoms, but usually has a different dermoscopic pattern and patient history.\n\n8. **Sarcoidosis** - Can present with skin plaques, but usually has systemic involvement and distinct histological findings.\n\n9. **Lichen Planus** - Presents with purplish, itchy plaques, but is less common on the eyelids and has distinct histological features.\n\n10. **Chronic Blepharitis** - Involves inflammation of the eyelids, but typically lacks the scaly plaque and dermoscopic findings seen here.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus** remains the most likely diagnosis, given the specific location, persistence, and dermoscopic findings.

The lesions started to appear on the left pretibial region as small papules, which gradually increased in size and coalesced to form bigger plaques. No history of local trauma, prolonged standing, and occupational exposure to mineral dust or recent drug intake was recollected. He was not diabetic. On examination, large, ill-defined, erythematous plaques were present on the pretibial areas extending onto the lateral aspect of both legs. The plaques were surmounted by multiple, discrete atrophic scars. The periphery of the plaques showed increased vascularity in the form of telangiectasias and venous prominences, along with atrophy of the overlying skin (Figure, A). There were no lesions elsewhere on the body. A skin biopsy sample was obtained from the plaque and sent for histopathological examination (Figure, B and C). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cutaneous sarcoidosis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a guy in his late 20s with these itchy, red plaques on his legs. They've been there for a few months now, and they started as small bumps that grew and merged into bigger plaques. That's interesting. He doesn't remember any injury or anything that might have triggered this, and he's not diabetic. So, what could this be?\n\nFirst off, the location and appearance of these plaques are pretty specific. They're on the shins, which makes me think of conditions that affect the lower legs. Erythema nodosum comes to mind. It's known for tender red bumps on the shins, but these plaques aren't painful, so maybe not that.\n\nLet's consider necrobiosis lipoidica. It's associated with diabetes, but this guy isn't diabetic. Still, it can occur without diabetes, so it's worth keeping in mind. The plaques have these atrophic scars and telangiectasias, which fit the bill for necrobiosis lipoidica.\n\nGranuloma annulare is another possibility. It often appears as plaques with a granular, annular appearance, and it can show necrobiosis and mucin on histology. But, it doesn't typically have the vascular changes we're seeing here.\n\nWhat about sarcoidosis? It can cause erythema nodosum-like lesions, but usually, there are more systemic symptoms or lesions elsewhere. This guy only has the leg plaques, so it's less likely.\n\nChronic venous insufficiency could cause similar changes, but there's no history of prolonged standing or signs of venous hypertension. So, that's probably not it.\n\nNow, let's think about the histopathology. If the biopsy shows necrobiosis, mucin, and a granulomatous infiltrate, that would point towards necrobiosis lipoidica or granuloma annulare. But, if there are non-caseating granulomas, sarcoidosis might be the culprit.\n\nHmm, what if it's something more systemic like lupus? It can cause a variety of skin lesions, including those on the legs. But, there are no other symptoms or lesions to suggest lupus.\n\nLet's not forget about infections like chromoblastomycosis. It causes nodular plaques, but usually in tropical areas and with a different appearance under the microscope.\n\nNow, considering everything, necrobiosis lipoidica seems like a strong contender. The clinical and histological features match, even without diabetes. But, granuloma annulare is still a possibility if the histology shows necrobiosis and mucin.\n\nAfter thinking it through, I'd say necrobiosis lipoidica is the most likely diagnosis, followed by granuloma annulare. Sarcoidosis and lupus are less likely, but I'd want to see the biopsy results to be sure.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the condition described:\n\n1. **Erythema Nodosum** - Although the plaques are not painful, erythema nodosum is known for causing red bumps on the shins and should be considered.\n\n2. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica** - This condition is associated with diabetes but can occur without it. The presence of atrophic scars and telangiectasias aligns with necrobiosis lipoidica.\n\n3. **Granuloma Annulare** - This condition can present with plaques and may show necrobiosis and mucin on histology, making it a strong contender.\n\n4. **Sarcoidosis** - While it can cause similar lesions, the lack of systemic symptoms or other skin lesions makes it less likely.\n\n5. **Chronic Venous Insufficiency** - Unlikely due to the absence of a history of prolonged standing or signs of venous hypertension.\n\n6. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus** - Could be considered due to the potential for varied skin lesions, but there are no other supporting symptoms.\n\n7. **Chromoblastomycosis** - Typically found in tropical areas and has distinct microscopic features, making it less likely.\n\n8. **Erythema Induratum** - A form of panniculitis that can present with similar lesions, but usually, there are other systemic signs.\n\n9. **Lichen Planus** - Known for purplish, itchy bumps, but the described plaques don't perfectly match this condition.\n\n10. **Pretibial Lymphedema** - Could cause swelling and skin changes, but the described plaques and scars don't align well.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica**\n2. **Granuloma Annulare**\n3. **Sarcoidosis**\n\nThese conditions align best with the clinical presentation and potential histological findings.

There was 1+ conjunctival injection, diffuse corneal edema with Descemet folds, and the anterior chamber was shallow in both eyes. After the administration of multiple rounds of topical and oral medications, her intraocular pressure improved to 18 mm Hg OD and 19 mm Hg OS.

We've got a Korean American woman in her 60s with some pretty concerning eye issues. She's dealing with blurry vision, redness, headaches, nausea, and even severe tinnitus. That's a lot going on. Her eye pressure is way up there, and she's got these large pupils that aren't reacting much. That's definitely not normal.\n\nFirst off, the high eye pressure and shallow anterior chamber make me think of acute angle-closure glaucoma. It's a pretty common cause of these symptoms, especially in people of Asian descent. But, let's not jump to conclusions just yet.\n\nThe retinal detachments and choroidal thickening are interesting. They could be related to the high pressure, but they might also point to something else. I should consider other possibilities. Uveal effusion syndrome comes to mind. It's known for causing choroidal detachment and retinal issues without obvious inflammation.\n\nNow, let's think about the systemic symptoms like headaches and tinnitus. They're not typical for glaucoma, so maybe there's something more systemic going on. Could it be related to a vascular issue, like carotid-cavernous fistula? That could explain the tinnitus and eye symptoms, but it's a bit of a stretch.\n\nHmm, what about other causes of choroidal detachment, like hypotony? But wait, her eye pressure is high, not low, so that doesn't fit. I need to keep looking.\n\nThe imaging shows pinpoint hyperfluorescence and leakage, which makes me think of conditions like central serous chorioretinopathy. It's known for causing serous retinal detachments, but it's usually not bilateral or associated with such high pressure.\n\nI should also consider inflammatory causes, like Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease. It can cause choroidal detachment, retinal issues, and even neurological symptoms like tinnitus. That fits pretty well with what's going on.\n\nOkay, let's not forget about other possibilities like nanophthalmos. It's associated with a shallow anterior chamber and high pressure, but it usually has other distinct features that aren't mentioned here.\n\nI should also think about conditions that affect the sclera, like scleritis. It can cause choroidal detachment and systemic symptoms, but usually, there's more pain and inflammation.\n\nNow, what about malignant glaucoma? It's a bit unusual, but it can cause high pressure and retinal detachment. It's worth considering, especially if standard glaucoma treatments aren't working.\n\nAlright, let's put it all together. Based on everything, I think the top possibility is Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease. It explains the eye findings, the systemic symptoms, and fits the patient's demographic. Uveal effusion syndrome is a close second, given the choroidal and retinal findings. Acute angle-closure glaucoma is still a contender, but it doesn't explain everything. I'll keep malignant glaucoma and others on the list, just in case.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the provided information, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the condition described, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma** - This is a common cause of elevated intraocular pressure and shallow anterior chamber, especially in individuals of Asian descent.\n\n2. **Uveal Effusion Syndrome** - This condition is characterized by choroidal detachment and retinal issues without obvious signs of inflammation.\n\n3. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease** - This is an inflammatory condition that can cause choroidal detachment, retinal issues, and systemic neurological symptoms like tinnitus.\n\n4. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy** - Known for causing serous retinal detachments, although it's typically unilateral and not associated with high intraocular pressure.\n\n5. **Nanophthalmos** - Associated with a shallow anterior chamber and high intraocular pressure, but usually has other distinct anatomical features.\n\n6. **Scleritis** - Can cause choroidal detachment and systemic symptoms, but typically involves more pain and inflammation.\n\n7. **Malignant Glaucoma** - A rare condition that can cause elevated intraocular pressure and retinal detachment, often unresponsive to standard glaucoma treatments.\n\n8. **Carotid-Cavernous Fistula** - Could explain the tinnitus and some eye symptoms, but is less likely given the presentation.\n\n9. **Choroidal Melanoma** - Although less likely, it can cause choroidal thickening and retinal detachment.\n\n10. **Hypertensive Choroidopathy** - Associated with systemic hypertension leading to choroidal and retinal changes.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnosis is **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease**, as it best explains the combination of ocular and systemic symptoms. **Uveal Effusion Syndrome** is a close second, given the choroidal and retinal findings. **Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma** remains a contender, but it doesn't account for all the symptoms.

Her medical history was negative for any skin cancers. After 2 months of treatment, the patient presented with diffuse hyperpigmented macules. This was thought to be related to her chronic atopic dermatitis and she was prescribed topical steroids and moisturizing. Four months later the patient presented with diffuse macular cutaneous eruption and pruritus. A skin punch biopsy of the back revealed mild epidermal acanthosis, focal parakeratosis, and interface dermatitis with numerous dyskeratotic cells and underlying lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate with scattered dermal melanophages. Oral steroids were prescribed and 3 weeks later the rash had resolved; however, the patient developed numerous hypopigmented macules and patches, covering more than 30% of her body surface area (Figure, A) compared with the prior skin examination (Figure, B). A new biopsy showed epithelial basal vacuolar changes, underlying lichenoid lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with scattered eosinophils and interface dermatitis with marked pigment incontinence and a reduced number of junctional melanocytes (Figure, C). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Vitiligo", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an African American woman in her 30s with a history of metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. She's been treated with nivolumab, which is an anti-PD-1 antibody. That's important because these drugs can cause all sorts of skin reactions. \n\nSo, she starts off with these hyperpigmented spots after two months on the medication. At first, they thought it was just her chronic atopic dermatitis acting up, so they gave her some topical steroids. That's a pretty standard approach. \n\nBut then, a few months later, she's back with a widespread macular rash and itching. They did a skin biopsy, and the results showed some interesting things. There was mild epidermal acanthosis, focal parakeratosis, and interface dermatitis. Plus, they saw numerous dyskeratotic cells and a lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate with dermal melanophages. That sounds like a lichenoid tissue reaction, which can definitely be related to the nivolumab. \n\nThey put her on oral steroids, and the rash cleared up in three weeks. But then, something unexpected happened. She developed hypopigmented macules and patches all over, covering more than 30% of her body. That's a big change from before. \n\nThey did another biopsy, and this time they found epithelial basal vacuolar changes, a lichenoid lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with eosinophils, and interface dermatitis with marked pigment incontinence. There were fewer junctional melanocytes, which suggests some damage to the melanocytes. \n\nSo, what's going on here? The hypopigmentation after the steroids is a clue. Vitiligo came to mind first because it's known for causing depigmented patches, and it can be linked to autoimmune reactions. Nivolumab can trigger autoimmune responses, so that's a strong possibility. \n\nBut wait, let's not jump to conclusions. The lichenoid infiltrate and interface dermatitis make me think of lichen planus, which can also cause hypopigmentation. And the medication could be causing a lichenoid drug eruption. \n\nThen there's the possibility of a drug-induced leukoderma. That's when a drug causes widespread loss of pigmentation, and nivolumab could be the culprit here. \n\nI should also consider post-inflammatory hypopigmentation, but that usually happens after the inflammation has resolved, and the timeline doesn't quite fit. \n\nWhat about pityriasis versicolor? It's a fungal infection that can cause hypopigmented patches, but the biopsy findings don't support that. \n\nAnd there's alopecia areata, which is more known for hair loss, but it can cause skin changes too. It's unlikely here, but I shouldn't completely rule it out. \n\nOh, and chemical leukoderma is another one. That's when certain chemicals trigger widespread depigmentation. It's a long shot, but possible. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I think vitiligo is the most likely cause of the hypopigmentation. It fits with the autoimmune nature of nivolumab and the biopsy findings. But I should keep lichen planus and drug-induced leukoderma in mind as well. They're close seconds in the differential diagnosis.\n\n### Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the differential diagnoses for the patient's condition, in order of likelihood, are as follows:\n\n1. **Vitiligo**: This is the most likely cause of the hypopigmentation. Vitiligo is characterized by depigmented patches and can be linked to autoimmune reactions, which nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, can trigger.\n\n2. **Drug-induced Leukoderma**: Nivolumab could be causing a drug-induced leukoderma, leading to widespread loss of pigmentation.\n\n3. **Lichen Planus**: The lichenoid infiltrate and interface dermatitis observed in the biopsy suggest lichen planus, which can also result in hypopigmentation.\n\n4. **Lichenoid Drug Eruption**: This is another possibility given the lichenoid tissue reaction seen in the biopsy, likely triggered by nivolumab.\n\n5. **Post-inflammatory Hypopigmentation**: Although less likely, this condition can occur after inflammation has resolved, but the timeline doesn't perfectly align with the patient's symptoms.\n\n6. **Pityriasis Versicolor**: This fungal infection can cause hypopigmented patches, but the biopsy findings do not support this diagnosis.\n\n7. **Alopecia Areata**: While primarily associated with hair loss, alopecia areata can cause skin changes, but it's an unlikely cause in this scenario.\n\n8. **Chemical Leukoderma**: This is a possibility if exposure to certain chemicals triggered depigmentation, but it's a less likely explanation given the context.\n\n9. **Idiopathic Guttate Hypomelanosis**: Characterized by small, rounded, hypopigmented spots, but the widespread nature of the patient's hypopigmentation makes this less likely.\n\n10. **Progressive Macular Hypomelanosis**: This condition involves hypopigmented macules, but it typically doesn't cover large body surface areas as seen in this patient.\n\nThese diagnoses are ranked based on the clinical presentation, biopsy findings, and the known effects of nivolumab. Vitiligo remains the most likely diagnosis due to its autoimmune nature and association with immunotherapy agents like nivolumab.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Oncology', 'Vitiligo', 'Targeted and Immune Therapy']"}

Invasive hemodynamic measures showed elevated RA pressure (14 mm Hg), but normal pulmonary artery pressure (16/11 mm Hg) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (7 mm Hg). Cardiac index calculated by the Fick method was 2.46 L/min/m2. Aggressive diuresis was initiated. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Ebstein anomaly", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a young guy in his mid-20s who's been dealing with some pretty tough symptoms for the past 18 months. He's experiencing progressive shortness of breath, his belly is sticking out more than it should, and his legs are swollen. That's a lot to handle. So, what's going on here?\n\nFirst off, the chest X-ray shows a big heart, which is a bit concerning. The echocardiogram tells us more. It seems like his right ventricle is a bit bigger than normal and has gotten thicker, but it's still working okay. The right atrium, though, is really enlarged. And there's severe tricuspid regurgitation, which means the tricuspid valve isn't closing properly and blood is flowing backward.\n\nNow, let's think about what could cause this. Tricuspid regurgitation can be due to a few things. It could be from a problem with the valve itself, like maybe it's infected or damaged. Or it could be because the right ventricle has gotten bigger, stretching the valve. Hmm, let's keep that in mind.\n\nThe pressures in his heart are interesting. The right atrial pressure is high, but the pressures in the lungs and the left side of the heart are normal. That's a clue. It suggests the problem is mainly on the right side of the heart.\n\nSo, what could cause just the right side of the heart to struggle like this? Chronic lung diseases can do it, but there's no mention of lung issues here. What about a pulmonary embolism? That could raise pressures, but it usually causes sudden problems, not something that's been slowly getting worse over 18 months.\n\nLet's think about other possibilities. Could it be something like a heart muscle problem, maybe arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy? That could cause the right ventricle to change and the tricuspid valve to leak. Or maybe it's something like Ebstein's anomaly, where the tricuspid valve doesn't develop properly.\n\nOh, and what about conditions that affect the heart's rhythm? Maybe he's having lots of extra heartbeats, like in atrial fibrillation, which could make the right atrium enlarge over time.\n\nThere's also the possibility of a congenital heart defect, like an atrial septal defect, that's been hiding in plain sight until now. Or maybe he's been using drugs that stress the right side of the heart, like methamphetamines.\n\nOkay, let's put it all together. Considering everything, it seems like arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy could be a strong contender. It fits with the right ventricular changes and the tricuspid regurgitation. But we shouldn't forget about other possibilities like Ebstein's anomaly or even chronic atrial fibrillation. And let's not rule out conditions like pulmonary hypertension or congenital defects just yet.\n\nIn the end, after thinking it through, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy seems like the most likely cause. But it's always good to keep an open mind and consider other potential diagnoses.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with a focus on one potential diagnosis per step, without repetition:\n\n1. **Tricuspid Valve Endocarditis** - The severe tricuspid regurgitation and right-sided heart symptoms could suggest an infection of the tricuspid valve.\n\n2. **Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)** - This condition could explain the right ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction, as well as the tricuspid regurgitation.\n\n3. **Ebstein's Anomaly** - A congenital defect where the tricuspid valve is malformed, which could lead to right atrial enlargement and tricuspid regurgitation.\n\n4. **Chronic Atrial Fibrillation** - Frequent arrhythmias could cause right atrial enlargement and contribute to tricuspid regurgitation over time.\n\n5. **Pulmonary Hypertension** - Although the pulmonary artery pressure is normal, any previous elevations could have caused right heart strain.\n\n6. **Atrial Septal Defect (ASD)** - A congenital heart defect that could lead to right atrial and ventricular enlargement if left untreated.\n\n7. **Carcinoid Syndrome** - A rare condition that can cause fibrotic changes leading to tricuspid regurgitation, although typically associated with other symptoms.\n\n8. **Intravenous Drug Use** - Chronic drug use could lead to infective endocarditis or pulmonary hypertension, affecting the right side of the heart.\n\n9. **Constrictive Pericarditis** - Although not directly suggested by the findings, it could restrict right heart filling and cause similar symptoms.\n\n10. **Idiopathic Dilated Right Atrium** - A condition of unknown cause leading to right atrial enlargement and potentially tricuspid regurgitation.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)** emerges as the most likely diagnosis, given the right ventricular changes and tricuspid regurgitation. However, it's important to remain open to other possibilities, such as Ebstein's anomaly or chronic atrial fibrillation, which could also fit the clinical picture. Further diagnostic testing, such as cardiac MRI or electrophysiology studies, may be needed to confirm the diagnosis.", "topic": "['Cardiology']"}

He had difficulty rising from a seated position. Additional symptoms included progressive numbness and tingling of the hands and feet. His family also reported progressive memory impairment during this period. An extensive review of systems was otherwise unremarkable, except for a few months of intermittent nausea, increased abdominal bloating, and anorexia. Physical examination revealed normal vital signs, normal cardiopulmonary findings, atrophy in the calf muscles bilaterally, 4 of 5 symmetric strength in the upper and lower extremity extensor muscles, and an unsteady shuffling gait. He had decreased vibration and proprioception in both lower extremities, with hyperreflexia and a positive Babinski reflex on the left side. Mental status examination revealed delayed recall of 1 of 4 words. Complete blood cell count revealed a white blood cell count of 4.7 × 103/μL; hemoglobin level, 10.9 g/dL; hematocrit, 31.8%; and platelet count, 202 × 103/μL. Mean corpuscular volume was 119 fL. Results of renal function and liver function tests were normal. Because of the asymmetric hyperreflexia and concern for a spinal cord lesion, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine was performed (Figure 1). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Vitamin B12 deficiency", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 61-year-old man who's been dealing with some pretty tough symptoms for the past month. He's really weak, can't walk without help, and has trouble getting up from a chair. That's a big red flag for something neurological or muscular going on. Plus, he's got numbness and tingling in his hands and feet, and even some memory issues. That's a lot to unpack.\n\nFirst off, the weakness and difficulty walking make me think of something like Guillain-Barré syndrome. It's known for causing rapid muscle weakness, and it can definitely affect how someone walks. But, let's not jump to conclusions just yet.\n\nNow, the numbness and tingling are interesting. They could point to a peripheral neuropathy. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease comes to mind because it's a hereditary condition that causes these symptoms. But, wait, this has all happened pretty quickly over a month, which isn't typical for CMT.\n\nThe memory issues are a curveball. They could be due to something like vitamin B12 deficiency. B12 deficiency can cause anemia and neurological problems, including memory issues and numbness. Hmm, that's something to consider.\n\nThe blood work shows macrocytic anemia. That's a big clue. Macrocytic anemia can be caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. So, B12 deficiency is still on the table. But, let's not forget about alcohol use or liver disease, which can also cause macrocytic anemia. Although, there's no mention of liver dysfunction here.\n\nThe MRI shows something going on in the spinal cord. That's a game changer. It could be compression or a lesion. This makes me think of cervical spondylotic myelopathy or maybe even multiple sclerosis. Both can cause weakness, sensory changes, and affect walking.\n\nBut, wait a minute. The MRI finding doesn't quite match with B12 deficiency, which typically shows subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. So, maybe B12 deficiency isn't the best fit here.\n\nLet's think about other possibilities. Spinal cord compression from something like metastatic cancer could explain the symptoms and MRI findings. It's possible, especially in someone who's 61. But, there's no other evidence of cancer here, so it's a bit of a stretch.\n\nHow about multiple sclerosis? It can cause a range of neurological symptoms, including weakness and sensory changes. The MRI could show lesions, but usually, MS has more relapsing-remitting episodes. This case seems more progressive, so maybe it's not MS.\n\nAnother thought is syphilis, specifically neurosyphilis. It can cause neurological symptoms, including memory issues and muscle weakness. But, there's no mention of any syphilis testing, so it's hard to say.\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is another possibility. It causes muscle weakness and atrophy, and can affect walking. The MRI might show some nonspecific changes. ALS is known for having both upper and lower motor neuron signs, which this patient has.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Considering everything, ALS seems to fit the bill. It explains the muscle weakness, atrophy, and MRI findings. Plus, it matches the progressive nature of the symptoms. Yeah, ALS makes the most sense here.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Guillain-Barré Syndrome** - Given the rapid onset of muscle weakness and difficulty walking, this syndrome is a strong initial consideration.\n\n2. **Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease** - The numbness and tingling in the hands and feet could suggest a hereditary peripheral neuropathy like CMT, although the rapid progression is atypical.\n\n3. **Vitamin B12 Deficiency** - Macrocytic anemia and neurological symptoms, including memory issues and numbness, align with B12 deficiency, but the MRI findings do not perfectly match.\n\n4. **Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy** - The MRI showing spinal cord involvement and symptoms like weakness and gait disturbance could point to cervical spine issues.\n\n5. **Multiple Sclerosis** - This condition can cause a variety of neurological symptoms, but the progressive nature without clear relapses makes it less likely.\n\n6. **Metastatic Cancer** - Spinal cord compression from metastasis could explain the symptoms and MRI, but there's no other evidence of cancer.\n\n7. **Neurosyphilis** - This can cause neurological symptoms, but there's no mention of syphilis testing, making it speculative.\n\n8. **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)** - Muscle weakness, atrophy, and both upper and lower motor neuron signs make ALS a strong contender, fitting the progressive symptoms and MRI findings.\n\n9. **Friedreich's Ataxia** - This hereditary degenerative disease affects the nervous system and could explain some symptoms, but it typically presents earlier in life.\n\n10. **Spinal Stenosis** - Similar to cervical spondylotic myelopathy, spinal stenosis could cause neurological symptoms due to spinal cord compression.\n\nAfter considering all the information, **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)** emerges as the most likely diagnosis, given the combination of muscle weakness, atrophy, and the presence of both upper and lower motor neuron signs, along with the progressive nature of the symptoms.", "topic": "['Neurology', 'Neuroimaging', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine', 'Hematology', 'Dementia and Cognitive Impairment']"}

He also noted swelling in his left inguinofemoral region, left scrotum, and left femur. His symptoms started 2 days before admission and the pain was progressively worsening. The patient did not report vomiting, constipation, or change in his bowel habits. His history was significant for hypertension and hypothyroidism; his last colonoscopy, 4 years ago, revealed diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon. The patient’s condition was stable (blood pressure, 130/85 mm Hg, heart rate, 88 beats/min), but he was febrile (temperature, 38.6°C). Physical examination showed cellulitis in his left inguinal canal, scrotum, and femur along with sensitivity in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. Initial laboratory test findings exhibited white blood cell count of 16 700/μL (to convert to 109/L, multiply by 0.001) and C-reactive protein of 340 mg/L (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 9.524). Chest roentgenogram was negative for free air under the diaphragm but was remarkable for some air-fluid levels. The patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with oral contrast (diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium solution) (Figure, A and B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Complicated diverticulitis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. An elderly man comes in with pain in the left iliac fossa. That's the lower left part of the abdomen. He's also got fever and is breathing faster than normal. Hmm, fever and pain usually mean inflammation or infection. And he's got swelling in his groin, scrotum, and thigh. That's quite a bit of swelling. \n\nOkay, let's see what else is going on. He's got a history of diverticulosis in the sigmoid colon. That's a potential trouble spot. His vital signs are stable, but he's running a fever. That's a sign that his body is fighting something off. \n\nThe lab results show a high white blood cell count and high CRP. Both of those point towards an inflammatory or infectious process. So, we're definitely looking at something that's causing his body to react like this. \n\nNow, the chest X-ray doesn't show free air under the diaphragm, so that's good. No obvious sign of a perforated bowel there. But there are some air-fluid levels, which could mean something's not right in the gut. \n\nThe CT scan is going to be key here. It should give us a better look at what's happening in the abdomen and pelvis. \n\nSo, what could this be? Let's start with the obvious. With his history of diverticulosis, diverticulitis is a strong possibility. That's when these little pouches in the colon get inflamed or infected. \n\nBut wait, there's more. The swelling in his groin and scrotum is unusual. Could this be a hernia? An inguinal hernia could cause swelling and pain, especially if it's become incarcerated or strangulated. \n\nAnd then there's the possibility of an abscess. If the diverticulitis has progressed, it could have formed a pocket of pus. That would explain the fever and elevated white blood cell count. \n\nOh, and we shouldn't forget about other abdominal issues like appendicitis or even a bowel obstruction. Those can cause similar symptoms. \n\nBut the swelling in the scrotum and thigh is really throwing me off. That's not typical for diverticulitis or appendicitis. Could it be something like Fournier's gangrene? That's a serious infection of the scrotum and can spread quickly. \n\nLet's not jump to conclusions too fast. We need to consider everything. What about a psoas abscess? That's an infection in the muscle of the lower back and could cause pain and swelling in the groin and thigh. \n\nAnd then there's the possibility of a femoral hernia. Those can cause swelling and pain in the groin and thigh too. \n\nOkay, let's put it all together. Based on everything, I think the most likely diagnosis is a psoas abscess. It explains the pain, fever, and swelling. But we can't rule out other possibilities like a hernia or Fournier's gangrene without more information. \n\nSo, here's the final list: \n\n1. Psoas abscess\n2. Fournier's gangrene\n3. Inguinal hernia\n4. Femoral hernia\n5. Diverticulitis\n6. Sigmoid colon cancer\n7. Appendicitis\n8. Bowel obstruction\n9. Incarcerated hernia\n10. Necrotizing fasciitis\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the elderly man is a psoas abscess. This condition can explain the pain in the left iliac fossa, fever, and swelling in the groin, scrotum, and thigh. The high white blood cell count and elevated CRP levels support the presence of an inflammatory or infectious process, which aligns with an abscess. While other possibilities such as Fournier's gangrene, inguinal or femoral hernia, diverticulitis, and others should be considered, the combination of symptoms and test results makes a psoas abscess the most probable diagnosis.

He was currently being treated with oral amoxicillin. His mother reported a recent decrease in appetite, decreased feeding, increased irritability, and near-constant crying. On examination, he was inconsolable and crying. His pulse rate was 112 beats/min, blood pressure was 122/68 mm Hg, and temperature was 38.7°C. He had soft, bitemporal facial masses (Figure, A). He was proptotic and demonstrated a substantial change in his ocular appearance compared with photographs taken 4 weeks earlier that his mother brought for our review. He appeared to be orthophoric in primary gaze but had bilateral abduction deficits. His pupils were round and reactive, without an afferent pupillary defect.

We've got a 12-month-old boy with some pretty concerning symptoms. He's got swelling on both sides of his face, and his eyes are bulging out more than they should. That's definitely not normal for a baby. And it all started getting worse after he had an ear infection. Hmm, that's interesting. Ear infections can sometimes lead to other issues, so let's keep that in mind.\n\nThe poor little guy is also not eating well, is really irritable, and has been crying a lot. He's running a fever too. All of this together is pointing towards something more than just a simple infection. I mean, he's inconsolable, which makes me think he's in pain or really uncomfortable.\n\nNow, let's think about what could cause swelling and bulging eyes like that. Orbital cellulitis comes to mind. It's an infection that can cause the eyes to bulge, especially after an ear infection. But usually, it's more on one side unless it's really spread. So, that's a possibility.\n\nBut wait, there's also the chance of a vascular issue, like a hemangioma. Those can cause swelling and might be affected by an infection. They're pretty common in kids, but they don't usually cause this much trouble out of the blue. Still, let's not rule it out yet.\n\nWhat about a neuroblastoma? It's a type of cancer that can cause swelling around the eyes if it spreads to the orbits. And it can cause systemic symptoms like irritability and fever. That's something to consider, especially with how fast this all developed.\n\nOh, and there's the possibility of an allergic reaction. But would that cause the eyes to bulge like that? Probably not. So, let's put that one lower on the list.\n\nNow, let's think about the tests. They did a blood count and a head X-ray, and both were normal. That's good information. It makes me think there might not be a big infection or a fracture causing this. But it doesn't rule out something like a neuroblastoma or a vascular issue.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Orbital cellulitis is still high on the list because it fits the symptoms, but the fact that it's on both sides is odd. Neuroblastoma is a strong contender too because it explains the systemic symptoms and the eye changes. And let's not forget about the possibility of a hemangioma, even though it's less likely to cause such acute symptoms.\n\nAfter thinking it through, I'd say orbital cellulitis is the most likely, but we can't ignore neuroblastoma. Hemangioma is a bit further down the list. Allergic reaction seems the least likely given the symptoms. Yeah, that sounds about right.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the symptoms and history provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 12-month-old boy, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Orbital Cellulitis** - This is a strong contender given the bilateral proptosis and facial swelling following an ear infection, which can spread and cause such symptoms.\n\n2. **Neuroblastoma** - This type of cancer can cause periorbital swelling and systemic symptoms like irritability and fever if it metastasizes to the orbits.\n\n3. **Hemangioma** - A vascular tumor that can cause swelling, though it's less likely to cause acute symptoms unless complicated by an infection or rapid growth.\n\n4. **Allergic Reaction** - Though less likely, an allergic reaction could cause facial swelling, but it typically wouldn't cause proptosis.\n\n5. **Orbital Lymphangioma** - A congenital vascular lesion that can cause swelling and proptosis, potentially exacerbated by an infection.\n\n6. **Rhabdomyosarcoma** - A soft tissue cancer that can occur in the orbit and cause proptosis and swelling.\n\n7. **Dermoid Cyst** - Can cause swelling if it becomes infected, but bilateral involvement is less common.\n\n8. **Capillary Malformation** - A vascular anomaly that can cause swelling, though it's usually present at birth and stable over time.\n\n9. **Infectious Mononucleosis** - Can cause facial swelling and fever, but proptosis is not a typical feature.\n\n10. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis** - A rare condition that can cause bone lesions and orbital involvement, leading to proptosis and systemic symptoms.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top three most likely diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Orbital Cellulitis** - Given the recent ear infection and bilateral proptosis.\n2. **Neuroblastoma** - Due to the systemic symptoms and potential for orbital metastasis.\n3. **Hemangioma** - As a possible vascular anomaly that could be exacerbated by an infection.\n\nThese three conditions best explain the combination of symptoms and history provided.

The patient had been experiencing redness, tearing, and foreign-body sensation in both eyes for 7 months. She was diagnosed with giant papillary conjunctivitis and follicular conjunctivitis by ophthalmologists at other institutions and was treated with topical corticosteroids and oral doxycycline. Topical corticosteroid eyedrops (0.5% loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension) seemed to control her symptoms, but attempts to wean the medication resulted in recurrence. She denied any significant ocular history. Her medical history included hypothyroidism and breast cancer in the setting of Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic disorder with a predisposition to various cancers, including carcinoma of the colon, breast, and uterus. At the time of examination, visual acuity was 20/25 OU. Pupil anatomy, intraocular pressure, confrontation visual fields, and extraocular movements were within normal limits. Slitlamp examination revealed mild meibomian gland dysfunction bilaterally, and follicular conjunctivitis was evident on eversion of all 4 eyelids. The bulbar conjunctiva demonstrated hyperemia and elevation medially (Figure 1). The remainder of the examination, including dilated funduscopic examination, was within normal limits. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Benign lymphoid hyperplasia", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. The patient is a middle-aged woman dealing with redness, tearing, and a foreign-body sensation in both eyes for quite a while now, 7 months to be exact. That's a long time to be uncomfortable. She's already been to other ophthalmologists and they thought it might be giant papillary conjunctivitis and follicular conjunctivitis. They gave her some treatments like topical corticosteroids and oral doxycycline. The corticosteroids seem to be helping, but whenever she tries to stop them, the symptoms come back. That's a bit of a red flag, isn't it? It suggests something more chronic or maybe even an underlying issue that's not fully addressed.\n\nNow, let's see what else is going on with her. She has hypothyroidism and a history of breast cancer due to Lynch syndrome. Lynch syndrome is a genetic condition that predisposes her to various types of cancers. That's important to keep in mind, especially if we're thinking about anything unusual or related to her systemic health.\n\nDuring the eye exam, everything seems pretty normal at first glance. Her visual acuity is good, pupils and eye movements are fine, and the intraocular pressure is normal too. But then, when they look closer, there's mild meibomian gland dysfunction and follicular conjunctivitis. Hmm, that's interesting. And there's something about the bulbar conjunctiva being hyperemic and elevated medially. That sounds like it could be significant.\n\nSo, what could be going on here? Let's start with the basics. Dry eye syndrome is a common cause of these symptoms, especially with the meibomian gland dysfunction. But would dry eye symptoms really get worse when stopping corticosteroids? That doesn't quite fit.\n\nWhat about blepharitis? It's another common condition that could cause these symptoms, and it would explain the meibomian gland issues. But again, the recurrence of symptoms when stopping corticosteroids is a bit odd for just blepharitis.\n\nOkay, let's think about the follicular conjunctivitis. This could be due to a viral infection like adenovirus, but the chronic nature of her symptoms makes that less likely. Viral conjunctivitis usually resolves on its own, doesn't it?\n\nNow, considering her history of breast cancer and Lynch syndrome, could this be something more sinister like a tumor? That's a scary thought, but the symptoms don't quite match up with what we'd expect for something like that. There's no mass or lesion mentioned.\n\nLet's not forget about giant papillary conjunctivitis. It's a possibility, especially if she's been using contact lenses, but there's no mention of that here. So, maybe not.\n\nWhat about an allergic reaction? Allergic conjunctivitis could cause these symptoms, and it might explain the recurrence when stopping corticosteroids. But there's no mention of any allergies or typical allergy symptoms like itching.\n\nOh, and there's also the possibility of a chalazion. That could cause some of these symptoms, especially with the meibomian gland dysfunction. But would it cause bilateral symptoms? That's unlikely.\n\nNow, let's think outside the box. Could this be something like sarcoidosis? It's a systemic condition that can cause eye symptoms, and it might fit with her history and the chronic nature of her symptoms. That's a possibility worth considering.\n\nFinally, let's not forget about lymphoma. It's a long shot, but given her history of cancer and the persistent symptoms, it's something to keep in mind. Lymphoma can cause all sorts of strange symptoms, especially in the eyes.\n\nSo, after going through all of this, I think the top differential diagnoses are dry eye syndrome, blepharitis, follicular conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and sarcoidosis. Lymphoma is also a consideration, given her history. Each of these has some features that match her symptoms, but we need more information to narrow it down further.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the patient's condition, with each step offering a distinct possibility:\n\n1. **Dry Eye Syndrome** - This is a common condition that can cause redness, tearing, and foreign-body sensation, especially with meibomian gland dysfunction.\n\n2. **Blepharitis** - This condition could explain the meibomian gland issues and is known to cause similar symptoms.\n\n3. **Follicular Conjunctivitis** - Already diagnosed by previous ophthalmologists, this could be due to a viral infection or other causes.\n\n4. **Allergic Conjunctivitis** - Although there's no mention of allergies, this could cause recurrence of symptoms when stopping corticosteroids.\n\n5. **Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis** - A possibility if there's contact lens use, though not mentioned.\n\n6. **Chalazion** - Could cause some symptoms, especially with meibomian gland dysfunction, but less likely to be bilateral.\n\n7. **Sarcoidosis** - A systemic condition that can cause chronic eye symptoms and might fit with her history.\n\n8. **Lymphoma** - Given her cancer history, this is a consideration, though less common.\n\n9. **Pinguecula** - A non-cancerous growth that could cause some symptoms, especially with conjunctival elevation.\n\n10. **Medial Cannthal Tumor** - Although unlikely, this could explain the elevation and hyperemia medially.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are **Dry Eye Syndrome**, **Blepharitis**, **Follicular Conjunctivitis**, **Allergic Conjunctivitis**, and **Sarcoidosis**, with **Lymphoma** as a less likely but important consideration due to her history.

The patient’s salivary duct carcinoma was androgen receptor positive and HER2 positive. He had previously undergone parotidectomy followed by radiation therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and trastuzumab. He had continued with androgen-deprivation therapy and palliative radiation therapy for osseous metastases. The patient endorsed erythematous skin changes within the field of radiation and a 2-month history of painful right upper extremity lymphedema that began after his most recent radiation treatment. He denied fevers or other systemic symptoms associated with the onset of the skin lesions. Physical examination revealed numerous nontender, firm, pebblelike, pink papules on the right anterior neck, upper chest, and back, arising on a background of confluent blanchable violaceous erythema (Figure, A), as well as similar-appearing lesions on the right chest wall on a background of normal-appearing skin. Concurrent skin biopsies from the right chest wall, clavicular area, and upper right back were performed (Figure, B and C). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cutaneous metastasis", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a 46-year-old guy who's been dealing with salivary duct carcinoma. He's had quite a bit of treatment already, including surgery, radiation, and some hefty chemo drugs like carboplatin and paclitaxel. Plus, he's on trastuzumab because his cancer is HER2 positive, and he's also on androgen-deprivation therapy. Now, he's come in with these new itchy skin lesions on his right chest. That's interesting.\n\nFirst off, the fact that these lesions are itchy and on the right chest makes me think of a few things. Could it be something like a rash from the radiation therapy he had? Radiodermatitis is definitely a possibility since it's a known side effect. But wait, the lesions are described as nontender, firm, and pebblelike. That doesn't quite fit the typical radiodermatitis, which is usually more about redness and irritation.\n\nOkay, let's consider other options. Lymphedema is another thing he's dealing with, and it started after his radiation. Could these skin changes be related to that? Maybe it's lymphangiosarcoma, a rare but serious condition that can develop in areas with chronic lymphedema. That's a strong contender given his history.\n\nBut hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. The lesions are on the chest and neck, and they're itchy. What about something more benign like a dermatitis or eczema? That could explain the itchiness, but the firm, pebblelike nature of the papules is a bit unusual for simple dermatitis.\n\nHmm, let's think about his cancer treatment again. He's on trastuzumab, which can cause skin reactions, but those are usually more generalized, not localized to one area like this. And the androgen-deprivation therapy—could that be playing a role? I'm not sure it fits the bill here.\n\nOh, and we can't forget about the possibility of metastatic disease. Salivary duct carcinoma can spread, and skin metastases aren't unheard of. But would they present like this, as itchy papules? It's possible, but it seems less likely given the description.\n\nNow, let's not overlook the histological findings from the skin biopsies. They could give us a big clue. If they show atypical cells, that might point to something like lymphangiosarcoma or even metastatic carcinoma. But if it's more of a reactive process, maybe it's something like pseudolymphomatous angiokeratoma.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Initially, I thought lymphangiosarcoma was a strong possibility, but now I'm leaning towards pseudolymphomatous angiokeratoma. It fits the description of the lesions and the patient's history. Plus, it's a condition that can arise in areas with chronic changes like lymphedema.\n\nYeah, that seems to make the most sense. Pseudolymphomatous angiokeratoma explains the itchy, pebblelike papules and the background erythema. It's a benign condition, which is reassuring, and it aligns with the clinical and histological findings. I think that's our best bet.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the skin lesions on the patient's right chest, along with a final ranking of the possibilities:\n\n1. **Radiodermatitis** - Given the patient's history of radiation therapy, this is an initial consideration. However, the description of the lesions as firm and pebblelike doesn't fully align with typical radiodermatitis.\n\n2. **Lymphangiosarcoma** - This is a strong contender due to the patient's lymphedema and the characteristics of the lesions. Lymphangiosarcoma can develop in areas of chronic lymphedema, making it a plausible diagnosis.\n\n3. **Pseudolymphomatous Angiokeratoma** - This condition can present with itchy, pebblelike papules and could be related to the chronic changes in the skin due to lymphedema.\n\n4. **Dermatitis/Eczema** - While the itchiness could suggest a form of dermatitis, the firm nature of the papules is atypical for simple dermatitis.\n\n5. **Skin Metastases** - Given the patient's history of salivary duct carcinoma, skin metastases are a possibility. However, the presentation as itchy papules is less typical.\n\n6. **Trastuzumab-induced Skin Reaction** - Although the patient is on trastuzumab, the localized nature of the lesions makes this less likely.\n\n7. **Androgen-Deprivation Therapy-related Skin Changes** - This is unlikely to cause the specific type of lesions described.\n\n8. **Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) with Skin Involvement** - While CLL can have skin manifestations, there is no other indication of CLL in the patient's history.\n\n9. **Lichen Planus** - This condition can cause pruritic papules, but it typically has a more widespread distribution and different histological findings.\n\n10. **Angiosarcoma** - This is a more aggressive vascular tumor that could present with skin lesions, but it is less likely given the patient's history and the benign nature of the lesions.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. **Pseudolymphomatous Angiokeratoma** - This condition best explains the itchy, pebblelike papules and the background erythema in the context of chronic lymphedema.\n\n2. **Lymphangiosarcoma** - Although it is a more serious condition, it remains a strong consideration due to the patient's history of lymphedema and the nature of the lesions.\n\n3. **Skin Metastases** - While less likely, the patient's history of salivary duct carcinoma means that metastatic disease should not be entirely ruled out.\n\nThese diagnoses align with the clinical presentation and the patient's treatment history, and they should be further investigated through histological examination and other diagnostic means.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Oncology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Salivary Gland Disorders']"}

Let’s think step by step.\n### INPUT:\nA man in his 30s with a medical history of asthma, social history of smoking, and allergy to shellfish presented to the emergency department with tongue swelling. The patient reported a history of a local burn from hot food but denied any history of trauma, foreign body, or piercing. He was evaluated, given a presumptive diagnosis of sialadenitis, and discharged home with ibuprofen and clindamycin. He returned several days later with worsening tongue swelling, voice change, and subjective fever. Postcontrast axial computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a midline lesion within the oral tongue that was predominantly hypodense and demonstrated rim enhancement. No calcifications were seen within the lesion (Figure, A). The lesion was predominantly isointense to muscle on axial T1-weighted images without intravenous (IV) contrast (Figure, B). Axial T2-weighted images with fat saturation showed predominantly hyperintense signal relative to muscle as well as punctate internal foci of T2 hypointensity (not shown). The lesion was hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging (Figure, C) and hypointense on the apparent diffusion coefficient map (not shown). Sagittal T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with IV contrast and fat suppression demonstrated signal hypointense to muscle centrally with peripheral enhancement (Figure, D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Abscess", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got a man in his 30s who's come to the ER with a swollen tongue. He's got asthma, he smokes, and he's allergic to shellfish. Hmm, that's interesting. He mentioned his tongue started swelling after eating something hot. No trauma or anything like that, so it's not from an injury. They thought it might be sialadenitis at first and gave him some meds, but it got worse. Now he's got a voice change and a fever too. That's not good.\n\nSo, let's look at the imaging. The CT scan shows a hypodense lesion in the middle of his tongue with rim enhancement. No calcifications, which is something to note. On the MRI, it's isointense to muscle on T1, but on T2, it's hyperintense with some dark spots inside. It's also bright on diffusion-weighted imaging and dark on the ADC map. That sounds like restricted diffusion to me. The post-contrast T1 shows peripheral enhancement. Hmm, that's a classic sign of an abscess.\n\nOkay, let's think about what this could be. An abscess is definitely on the list. The rim enhancement and restricted diffusion are big clues. But let's not jump to conclusions. What about epiglottitis? That can cause tongue swelling and fever, but it usually involves the epiglottis, not the tongue itself. Still, it's worth considering.\n\nHow about a neoplasm like squamous cell carcinoma? It could cause a mass in the tongue, but we'd expect more irregular borders and maybe some calcifications. Plus, it doesn't usually restrict diffusion like this. So, maybe not that.\n\nAngioedema is another possibility. It can cause sudden swelling, especially with his history of allergies. But it doesn't usually show up as a distinct lesion on imaging, and we wouldn't see restricted diffusion. So, probably not angioedema.\n\nLudwig's angina could be another option. It's a type of cellulitis that can cause tongue swelling and fever. It can show restricted diffusion too. But it's usually more diffuse, not a well-defined lesion like this. Hmm, maybe.\n\nWhat about a vascular lesion like a hemangioma? They can be T2 hyperintense, but they don't usually restrict diffusion, and we'd see flow voids. So, probably not a hemangioma.\n\nOh, and there's the possibility of an infected cyst, like a thyroglossal duct cyst. Those can get infected and cause swelling and fever. They can show rim enhancement and restricted diffusion too. That's definitely something to consider.\n\nLet's not forget about cellulitis. It can cause swelling and fever, and it might show restricted diffusion. But it's usually more widespread, not a single lesion like this. So, maybe not cellulitis.\n\nNow, what about a dermoid cyst? Those can be T1 and T2 hyperintense, and they might restrict diffusion if they're infected. But we'd usually see a more defined cystic structure. Hmm, maybe.\n\nFinally, let's think about necrotic neoplasm. Those can have a similar appearance with a necrotic center and peripheral enhancement. They can restrict diffusion too. But we'd expect a more aggressive appearance on imaging, maybe with invasion into surrounding tissues. So, probably not that.\n\nAlright, let's put it all together. Based on the imaging and his symptoms, an abscess is still the most likely diagnosis. It fits the rim enhancement and restricted diffusion perfectly. But we should also consider an infected cyst, like a thyroglossal duct cyst, as a close second. Ludwig's angina is another possibility, but it's less likely given the well-defined nature of the lesion. Everything else seems less likely based on the imaging characteristics. So, abscess is our top choice, followed by infected cyst, and then Ludwig's angina.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the provided information and imaging findings, the top differential diagnosis for the man's condition is an abscess. The rim enhancement and restricted diffusion observed on the MRI are classic indicators of an abscess. Following closely as a potential diagnosis is an infected cyst, such as a thyroglossal duct cyst, which can also present with similar imaging characteristics. Ludwig's angina is another consideration, although it is less likely due to the well-defined nature of the lesion. Other possibilities, such as neoplasms, vascular lesions, and cellulitis, are less likely given the specific imaging findings. Therefore, the ranked differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. Abscess\n2. Infected cyst (e.g., thyroglossal duct cyst)\n3. Ludwig's angina\n4. Epiglottitis\n5. Squamous cell carcinoma\n6. Angioedema\n7. Vascular lesion (e.g., hemangioma)\n8. Dermoid cyst\n9. Necrotic neoplasm\n10. Cellulitis\n\nThese rankings are based on the combination of clinical presentation and imaging characteristics.", "topic": "['Radiology', 'Trauma and Injury', 'Neuroimaging', 'Neurology', 'Otolaryngology']"}

Let’s think step by step.\n### INPUT:\nA previously healthy 18-year-old college student presented to the emergency department with a 6-month history of fatigue, dry cough, dyspnea, and unintentional weight loss of 18 kg (from 100 to 82 kg). Four months ago, he was treated for presumed pneumonia with azithromycin without improvement. He did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use intravenous drugs. He was born in the United States and had not traveled outside of the country. He took no medications. On examination, his temperature was 37°C, heart rate 110/min, blood pressure 123/72 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 20/min. He had a palpable 2×2-cm firm, nontender, right supraclavicular lymph node and decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion in the right lower lung field. No hepatosplenomegaly or leg edema was noted. Routine laboratory tests, including complete blood cell counts, renal function, electrolytes, and hepatic function, were within normal limits. A chest x-ray demonstrated diffuse homogeneous opacification of the right lung field. Computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a 15 × 11-cm centrally necrotic mass in the right anterior mediastinum displacing the trachea to the left, a large right pleural effusion, and compression of the superior vena cava (Figure 1). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Hodgkin lymphoma", "predict": " Thinking\n\nAlright, let's think about this. We've got an 18-year-old college student who's been dealing with fatigue, a dry cough, shortness of breath, and a pretty significant weight loss of 18 kg over the past six months. That's quite a bit of weight to lose unintentionally, and it's definitely concerning. He was treated for what was thought to be pneumonia four months ago, but azithromycin didn't do the trick. So, we can probably rule out a simple bacterial infection. \n\nNow, let's consider what's going on here. The symptoms have been lingering for a while, and the fact that he didn't respond to antibiotics makes me think we're dealing with something more complex. The weight loss and persistent cough could point towards something like tuberculosis. It's known for causing those kinds of symptoms, especially when it gets into the lungs. \n\nBut wait, there's more. He's got a palpable, firm, and nontender lymph node in the right supraclavicular area. That's interesting because this area is often associated with thoracic or abdominal pathologies. Plus, there's decreased breath sounds and dullness in the right lower lung field. This could mean there's something occupying space in the lung, like fluid or a mass. \n\nThe chest x-ray shows diffuse opacification of the right lung field, and the CT scans reveal a large mass in the right anterior mediastinum. This mass is 15 × 11-cm and necrotic, which is pretty significant. It's also causing the trachea to shift to the left and there's a large pleural effusion. This kind of mass could be a number of things. Hodgkin lymphoma comes to mind because it can present with mediastinal masses and these kinds of systemic symptoms. \n\nBut let's not jump to conclusions just yet. We should consider other possibilities too. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is another contender. It can also cause lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms. And then there's lung cancer, although it's less common in someone this young. \n\nOh, and let's not forget about infections. Tuberculosis can cause necrotic masses and lung issues, so it's still on the table. We should also think about fungal infections like histoplasmosis or coccidioidomycosis, which can cause similar symptoms and lung findings. \n\nNow, considering the patient's age and the fact that he's otherwise healthy, we should also think about germ cell tumors. These can occur in the mediastinum and present with a mass. \n\nSo, where does that leave us? Based on everything, Hodgkin lymphoma seems like a strong possibility given the mediastinal mass and systemic symptoms. But we can't rule out non-Hodgkin lymphoma or a germ cell tumor just yet. Tuberculosis and fungal infections are still possibilities too, especially with the necrotic mass. \n\nIn the end, after considering all the information, I think Hodgkin lymphoma is the most likely diagnosis. But it's important to keep an open mind and consider the other possibilities as well.\n\n## Final Response\n\nBased on the information provided, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis for the 18-year-old college student:\n\n1. **Hodgkin Lymphoma** - Given the mediastinal mass, systemic symptoms, and the patient's age, Hodgkin lymphoma is a strong contender.\n\n2. **Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma** - Similar to Hodgkin lymphoma, it can cause lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms, and should be considered.\n\n3. **Tuberculosis** - The persistent cough, weight loss, and necrotic mass make tuberculosis a possibility, especially given its ability to cause lung issues.\n\n4. **Germ Cell Tumor** - These can occur in the mediastinum and present with a mass, making them a plausible option.\n\n5. **Lung Cancer** - Although less common in young individuals, lung cancer could explain the mass and symptoms.\n\n6. **Fungal Infection (Histoplasmosis/Coccidioidomycosis)** - These infections can cause lung symptoms and necrotic masses, and should be considered.\n\n7. **Sarcoidosis** - This condition can cause lung issues and lymphadenopathy, although it typically doesn't present with a large necrotic mass.\n\n8. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)** - This can cause respiratory symptoms and necrotic lesions, but is less likely given the patient's age and presentation.\n\n9. **Castleman Disease** - A rare condition that can cause lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms, although it's less common in this age group.\n\n10. **Mediastinal Fibroma** - A benign tumor that could explain the mass, but is less likely given the systemic symptoms.\n\nAfter considering all the information, the top three differential diagnoses are:  \n1. **Hodgkin Lymphoma**  \n2. **Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma**  \n3. **Tuberculosis**  \n\nThese three conditions best explain the combination of systemic symptoms, mediastinal mass, and lung findings in this patient.", "topic": "['Adolescent Medicine', 'Pediatrics', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Lymphomas', 'Hematology']"}
