Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Amit P. Desai Medicine: A 55-year-old woman with a history of autoimmune hepatitis was admitted to this hospital because of increasing lethargy, anorexia, and abdominal pain. Approximately 7 years before this admission, the patient received a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis at another hospital, and she began taking prednisone. During the next 6 years, splenomegaly, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, jaundice, and lethargy occurred, as did recurrent episodes of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and encephalopathy. A diagnosis of portal hypertension was made, and approximately 6 months before this admission, a transjugular intrahepatic porto-systemic shunt TIPS procedure was performed at another hospital. Approximately 3.5 months before this admission, the patient moved to Massachusetts. The following week, she was seen in the emergency department of this hospital because of intermittent headaches, weakness, dizziness, fatigue, and increasing abdominal and ankle swelling. She also had a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Her medications included pred-nisone, lactulose, omeprazole, rifaximin, neomycin, ursodiol, lisinopril, folate, potassium chloride, and insulin. On examination, the patients vital signs were normal. Conjunctival injection and icterus, subconjunctival hemorrhages, and 2 pedal edema were present bilaterally, and the abdomen was soft, without tenderness or guarding; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of urea nitrogen, globulin, magnesium, amylase, and N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Ultrasonography of the abdomen with noninvasive Doppler evaluation of the abdominal vasculature revealed splenomegaly, 19 cm in maximal diameter normal range, 14 cm, and patency of the TIPS. The patient was advised to continue her medications at home, and referrals to a primary care physician and a hepatologist were made. Nine days later, the patient was found unresponsive on the floor at home. On examination by emergency medical services personnel, the capillary blood glucose level ranged from 30 to 39 mg per deciliter 1.7 to 2.2 mmol per liter; a glucose infusion was administered, and her condition improved. She was admitted to this hospital. Her physical and laboratory evaluations and imaging studies had not changed from previous examinations. She was discharged home on the second day. During the next month, testing for antinuclear antibody was positive at 1:40 and 1:160 dilutions, with a speckled pattern, and tests for antibodies to smooth muscle and viral hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Eight weeks before the current admission, she was readmitted to this hospital because of increasing fatigue and confusion of 1 weeks duration; she reportedly had stopped taking many of her medications. On examination, she was oriented only to self. The vital signs were normal, the skin jaundiced, the conjunctivae hyperemic, and the abdomen distended and soft, without tenderness. There was 1 peripheral edema, and the remainder of the general and neurologic examination, except mental status, was normal. An electrocardiogram ECG showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities. The glycated hemoglobin level was normal, testing for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus and parvovirus B19 was negative, and the result of a test for EpsteinBarr virus suggested past infection; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed 3 glucose 1000 mg per deciliter and 1 bilirubin, with 20 to 50 white cells, 3 to 5 red cells, few bacteria and squamous cells, and very few transitional cells per high-power field; calcium oxalate and mucin were present. Abdominal ultrasonogra-phy did not reveal a substantial amount of ascites. The patients medications were readministered and her mental status improved. A urine culture grew moderate mixed bacteria, and ciprofloxa-cin was administered for 3 days. The patient was discharged on the fourth day. On follow-up examination on an outpatient basis, increasing peripheral edema was treated with spironolactone and a short course of furosemide, and the condition improved. Insulin was administered on a sliding scale for glucose levels that were as high as 512 mg per deciliter 28.4 mmol per liter. The thyrotropin level was 6.17 U per milliliter reference range, 0.40 to 5.00, and the level of free thyroxine T4 was normal. Five days before the current admission, the patient returned to this hospital because of confusion, increasing lethargy, nonradiating mid-abdominal pain, and vomiting. An abdominal ultrasound examination was performed to as-sess the patency of the TIPS. Transverse images, obtained with and without the use of color-flow Doppler techniques, showed a patent TIPS, with normal velocities and hepatopetal flow in the main portal vein. Splenomegaly was also noted, with the spleen measuring 19.5 cm in maximal diameter. Furosemide was administered intravenously and then orally, and other medications were continued, with symptomatic improvement. Hepatology consultants calculated a Model for End-Stage Liver Disease MELD score of 20 on a scale of 6 to 40, with higher scores indicating more severe disease, and an outpatient evaluation for liver transplantation was recommended. The blood level of IgA was 561 mg per deciliter reference range, 69 to 309; blood levels of IgG and IgM were normal, with a normal pattern and without a detectable M component, and a follow-up measurement of blood levels of lactic acid was also normal. Dr. Sheela Agarwal: Magnetic resonance imaging of the liver performed after the intravenous administration of gadolinium revealed marked morphologic features of nodular cirrhosis and signs of portal hypertension, including spleno-megaly 19 cm in maximal diameter, upper abdominal varices, and a small amount of ascites. The main portal vein appeared patent, with proper positioning of the TIPS Fig. 1. Dr. Desai: The patient was discharged on the fourth day, with the plan that a visiting nurse would follow up. The next day, the patients anorexia and leg edema were exacerbated, and her oral intake decreased. Constant, ill-defined midabdominal pain occurred, without fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hematuria, hematochezia, melena, chest pain, dyspnea, lightheadedness, or syncope. She returned to this hospital the following day. The patients medications included prednisone, lactulose, rifaximin, furosemide, spironolactone, glimepiride, insulin, neomycin, potassium chloride, folic acid, lisinopril, ursodiol, calcium and vitamin D supplements, and omeprazole. She was allergic to intravenous contrast material, which caused angioedema. She was born in Central America, spoke only Spanish, and immigrated to the United States more than 25 years previously. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. There was no family history of liver or other gastrointestinal disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or cardiac disease. On examination, the temperature was 37.1C; the other vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. The patient had a depressed affect. There were bilateral subconjunctival hemorrhages and diffuse jaundice. The abdomen was soft, with normal bowel sounds and epigastric and mild lower abdominal tenderness during deep palpation and without distention, hepatomegaly, or a palpable spleen. There was no evidence of as-terixis, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. An ECG was unchanged, as compared with the ECG obtained 8 weeks before this admission. The patient was admitted to this hospital. Outpatient medications were continued; ceftriaxone and metronidazole were administered intravenously, and nutritional supplements were provided. Dr. Agarwal: On the second day, computed tomography CT of the abdomen performed after the oral administration of contrast material revealed cirrhosis with splenomegaly span, 16.2 cm and a TIPS in the proper position. In addition, diffuse wall thickening within the cecum and ascending colon, pericolonic fat stranding, and surrounding subcentimeter lymph nodes were present Fig. 2. The differential diagnosis for these findings includes ischemic, infectious, and inflammatory causes, although the right-sidedness is suggestive of neutropenic colitis. Dr. Desai: Hypotension, to 75/45 mm Hg, developed 2.5 hours after CT was performed. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Normal saline was infused, albumin and 4 units of red cells were transfused, and antihypertensive agents and diuretics were stopped; there was gradual improvement in blood pressure. Blood specimens were obtained for culture, and vancomycin, linezo-lid, ciprofloxacin, and cefepime were administered. Later that day, melena occurred. On the fifth day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ",

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Robert L. Carruthers Neurology: A 68-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of diplopia of 2 days duration. The patient had a history of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, with chronic renal insufficiency. He had been in his usual health until 2 days before admission, when diplopia developed, along with nausea and vomiting, mild headache, and a sensation of unsteadiness while walking. The diplopia resolved when he closed the right eye. The next day, he remained in bed because of fatigue and a sensation of light-headedness when standing. Nausea persisted, without vomiting. On the day of admission, he noted weakness and clumsiness of his left hand while buttoning his shirt. At a scheduled follow-up visit, he was seen by his nephrologist, who noted dysconjugate gaze, with no other neurologic findings, and referred him to the emergency department at this hospital. The patient reported mild nausea and continued diplopia, whereby one image appeared above and to the right of the other with both eyes open; the diplopia had been constant since onset. He did not have headache, neck stiffness, photophobia, vertigo, weakness, numbness, fevers, or chills. He had had a chronic decrease in vision in the right eye due to a cataract, which had not changed. He had not had this combination of symptoms in the past. The diagnosis of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ANCAassociated vascu-litis consistent with granulomatosis with polyangiitis had been made 21 months before this admission. The disorder was characterized by sinus pain and renal insufficiency due to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis; a renal-biopsy specimen obtained at another hospital reportedly showed crescentic glomerulonephritis. The patients condition had improved after treatment with plasma exchange, methyl-prednisolone, and cyclophosphamide; 11 months before this admission, the administration of rituximab was also begun. His baseline blood creatinine level was reportedly 5.4 mg per deciliter 477 mol per liter. He also had hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease, and a remote history of steato-hepatitis, bilateral inguinal herniorrhaphies, and laminectomies and lateral fusion between the third and sixth vertebrae of the cervical spine. His medications were rituximab an infusion every 4 months, predni-sone 7.5 mg daily, furosemide, amlodipine, meto-prolol, ranitidine, calcium carbonate with vitamin D, calcium acetate, sodium bicarbonate, dapsone, omeprazole, erythropoietin as needed, and topical mupirocin calcium cream. He was allergic to trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole which caused a rash, simvastatin, and azathioprine. He was married and retired. He drank alcohol in moderation, had a smoking history of 40 pack-years and had quit smoking 5 years earlier, and did not use illicit drugs. There was no family history of autoimmune disorders or neurologic diseases. On examination, the patient was fatigued but arousable. The temperature was 37.2C, the blood pressure 139/91 mm Hg, the pulse 91 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93 while he was breathing ambient air. There was mild ptosis on the left side. His pupils and extraocular movements were normal. There was subjective diplo-pia in primary gaze, with greater vertical than horizontal separation. There was left-sided upper and lower facial weakness. Soft-palate elevation was diminished on the left side; tongue protrusion, voice, and hearing were normal. The left hand was held in flexion; strength was 45 mildly decreased in the left wrist extensors, 45 in the left finger abductors, and normal in the right arm. Dysdia-dochokinesia of the left arm was thought to be caused by weakness. There were fasciculations in the left calf. Plantar responses were flexor, with fanning of the toes. Gait was not assessed. The platelet count and results of coagulation and liver-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, globulin, and ammonia; other test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to this hospital. Dr. Michael H. Lev: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head Fig. 1A was performed without the administration of gadolinium because of chronic renal insufficiency. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery FLAIR images showed mild, scattered white-matter changes, predominantly in the periventricular and subcortical regions, as well as in the midbrain region where there were more changes on the right side than on the left side. These findings are consistent with a chronic microangiopathic disease. Dr. Carruthers: On day 2, the temperature rose to 38.6C. Blood cultures were obtained and re-mained sterile. Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampi-cillin, and acyclovir were administered. A lumbar puncture was performed, and the opening pressure was normal. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Lev: On day 3, repeat MRI of the head was performed Fig. 1B and 1C. FLAIR images showed new, progressive, hyperintense punctate and linear cortical and subcortical foci bilaterally. There were some foci with restricted diffusion suggestive of infarction; these were most notable in the right cingulate, precentral, and postcentral gyri but also in the right midbrain, thalamus, and corona radiata and in the putami-na on both sides. Dr. Carruthers: Methylprednisolone 1 g daily was administered intravenously for 2 days. Hemodialysis was begun. Testing for antitreponemal antibodies was negative. On day 5, the patient became unresponsive during hemodialysis; the temperature was 38.8C, the pulse 90 to 99 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 40 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 92 to 94 while he was breathing supplemental oxygen at a rate of 4 liters per minute by nasal cannula. On examination, he was unable to speak and had impaired upward gaze. Measurement of arterial blood gases revealed that the pH was 7.52, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide 34 mm Hg, and the partial pressure of oxygen 81 mm Hg. Hemodialysis was stopped, and the trachea was intubated. The patient was transferred to the neurologic intensive care unit. Glucocorticoids were discontinued. Testing for hepatitis B and C viruses was negative. On day 6, the temperature rose to 39.0C. The thyrotropin level was normal; screening of the blood and urine for toxins was negative. A repeat lumbar puncture was performed; analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid CSF and other test results are shown in Table 1. Sputum cultures grew few colonies of yeast; cultures of blood, urine, and CSF remained sterile. Dr. Lev: Follow-up MRI of the head Fig. 1D revealed a new punctate focus of restricted diffusion in the right pons, along the corticospinal tract; FLAIR images showed new, diffuse hyper-intense signal in the cerebellar vermis bilaterally. Previously noted findings were unchanged or became slightly less conspicuous. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck revealed no evidence of stenotic or embolic disease. The next day, conventional angiography re-vealed no evidence of intracranial vasculitis. Computed tomography CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed atelectasis and cholelithiasis but no evidence of cholecystitis. Dr. Carruthers: Transthoracic echocardiography revealed no evidence of vegetations. There was no evidence of vasculitis or viral infection on ophthal-mologic examination. Bacterial, fungal, and myco-bacterial blood cultures remained sterile, and testing for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus and for IgG and IgM antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi, Bartonella henselae, and Bar-to nella quintana was negative. A tunneled hemo-dialysis catheter was placed. The administration of levetiracetam was begun. On day 8, the patient remained unresponsive, with a temperature as high as 38.4C. The morning cortisol level was normal; blood tests for IgG and IgM anti-bodies to eastern equine encephalitis virus and West Nile virus and a urinary histoplasma antigen test were negative. Additional test results are shown in Table 1. Valproic acid was administered. Dr. Lev: On day 10, MRI of the head Fig. 1E and spine revealed numerous new punctate cerebellar infarcts, without susceptibility changes suggestive of microhemorrhage. The spinal cord was normal, and the previously noted findings were unchanged. Dr. Carruthers: The next day, generalized fasciculations developed. Methylprednisolone 250 mg every 6 hours was administered intravenously. In consultation with the patients family, the goals of care were adjusted to comfort measures, and the trachea was extubated. On day 16, the patient died. An autopsy was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ",

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Kai-How Farh Pediatrics: A 10.9-month-old boy with microcephaly and developmental delay was admitted to this hospital because of episodes of cyanosis. The patient was born at another hospital after 39 weeks of gestation to a 36-year-old multigravida who had received prenatal care. Prenatal ultrasonography reportedly revealed mild hydronephrosis. Labor was induced because of maternal hypertension. Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. On examination, microcephaly was noted; there were no dysmorphic features. The weight was 2.9 kg 13th percentile, the length 50.8 cm 60th percentile, and the head circumference 29.5 cm 1st percentile Fig. 1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Results of the Massachusetts Newborn Screening Panel, which can identify more than 60 disorders, were normal. On the patients 18th day of life, radiographs of the head showed no abnormalities other than a small calvarium. Testing for toxoplasma and rubella was positive for IgG antibodies and negative for IgM antibodies; testing for cytomegalovirus was negative. At 3 weeks of age, he was evaluated by the genetics service at a second hospital because of microcephaly. His parents reported that he rolled his eyes when upset and had labored breathing after feeding but was otherwise well. On examination, there was microcephaly, the coronal ridges were palpable, and there were no other abnormalities. Array-comparative genomic hybridization testing revealed 16p11.2 duplication, which was thought to be benign. His infant formula was changed, and symptoms associated with feedings improved. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI that was performed when the infant was 6.5 weeks of age reportedly revealed a small brain, delayed myelination, and partial agenesis of the posterior corpus callosum. At 5 months of age, the patient was unable to roll over, constipation had developed, and his mother noted poor visual tracking. One month later, neurologic examination revealed pupils that were equal in size and reactive to light, decreased visual fixation, and failure to track. There was decreased truncal control, axial hypotonia, and near-normal tone in the arms and legs, which the patient could move normally. Muscle bulk and deep-tendon reflexes were normal; plantar reflexes were flexor. Neuro-ophthalmologic examination did not reveal optic-nerve hypoplasia. A diagnosis of cortical blindness was made. Genetic testing for the primary microcephaly syndromes was suggested. Twenty days before the current admission, episodes of head bobbing and perioral cyanosis occurred during feedings. Three days later, the patient was admitted to the second hospital, where he reportedly had episodes of respiratory distress with agitation or repositioning. On examination during an episode, he had near-agonal breathing with costal retractions and without tachypnea, an oxygen saturation between 80 and 89, head bobbing, grunting, back arching, limb extension, increased muscle tone, cool and mottled arms and legs, perioral cyanosis, and a decreased heart rate of approximately 75 beats per minute. The episodes occurred several times daily, resolved with oxygen administration, and when protracted, were followed by long naps. Growth measurements are shown in Figure 1 in the Supplementary Appendix, and laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Computed tomography of the head reportedly revealed hypodensi-ties in frontal and parietal white matter, mild prominence of the ventricles, and extra-axial spaces containing cerebrospinal fluid possibly normal features for a patient of this age, with no acute hemorrhage, mass, or midline shift. Evaluation for gastroesophageal reflux revealed reflux below the level of the clavicles, without aspiration; an examination with a pH probe revealed no evidence of reflux during the episodes of cyanosis. An electroencephalogram showed slowing of the background rhythm, without evidence of seizure activity during an episode. Famotidine and lactulose were administered, and a nasojejunal feeding tube was placed. The patient was discharged on the seventh hospital day but was readmitted 2 days later because of recurrent episodes of respiratory distress and cyanosis. Oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula. Chest radiographs reportedly showed mild bronchial-wall thickening and low lung volumes. Testing for respiratory viruses was negative. Evaluation of the respiratory and upper gastrointestinal tracts reportedly revealed small diaphragmatic excursions, mild esophagitis, and reflux below the level of the carina, with slow clearing. The transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. On the 10th hospital day, the patient was transferred to this hospital. Medications on transfer included lactulose and lansoprazole. The parents reported that the patient was unable to roll over or sit up without assistance. He received infant formula orally. Immunizations were current, including one dose of seasonal influenza vaccine. He had no known allergies. He lived with his parents and older sibling and received early-intervention services. His parents were white, with no known history of consan-guinity. His mother had had two spontaneous miscarriages; his parents and sibling were healthy, and the maternal and paternal head circumferences were normal. His maternal grandmother had a bifid uvula, but the three-generation family history was otherwise unremarkable. On examination, the temperature was 36.2C, the blood pressure 116/55 mm Hg, the pulse 120 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 50 breaths per minute with deep subcostal retractions, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing oxygen at a rate of 1 liter per minute through a nasal cannula. The lungs were clear. On neurologic examination, the eyes were open when the patient was awake, with no tracking to visual stimuli, but the eyes closed in response to bright light and blinked in response to threat. The pupils contracted from 4 mm to 2 mm bilaterally, and a red reflex was seen. The face was symmetric, without facial diplegia. When the patient was in the supine position, the legs were abducted, the arms extended, and the hands fisted. There were spontaneous, symmetric, and antigravity limb movements. Head control and truncal tone were poor; he was unable to sit up without support and leaned toward the left. Pa-tellar reflexes were brisk 3, and there was sustained clonus at the left ankle and 5 beats of clonus at the right ankle; plantar grasp reflexes were present bilaterally. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, urea nitrogen, total protein, albumin, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, creatine kinase, triglycerides, thyrotropin, copper, and carbohydrate-deficient transferrin were normal, as were the anion gap and results of liver-function tests; other test results are shown in Table 1. Lansoprazole, lactulose, lorazepam as needed for agitation, and glycerin suppositories were administered. On the first hospital day, the patient had two episodes of respiratory distress and cyanosis that were similar to previously reported episodes. The temperature was 35.3C, the blood pressure 98/50 mm Hg, the pulse 75 to 130 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 50 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while he was breathing oxygen at a rate of 3 liters per minute through a nasal cannula. Venous blood gas measurements are shown in Table 1. The patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit. Bilevel positive airway pressure was administered by face mask, with improvement. On the second day, apnea and cyanosis occurred intermittently. Otolaryngologic examination revealed incomplete vocal-cord adduction. Bronchoscopy revealed mild main-stem and lower-lobe broncho-malacia on the left side. A central venous catheter was placed in the right saphenous vein. Gabapentin was begun. Blood and urine amino acid profiles were reported to be normal selected values are shown in Table 1. Dr. Paul A. Caruso: MRI that was performed the next day, without the administration of contrast material, revealed pontomedullary hypoplasia, a diminutive corpus callosum, and a myelin disorder most consistent with hypomyelination. A sagittal T1-weighted image shows a diminutive pons and medulla, which can be best visualized when compared with an image of an age-matched normal brain Fig. 1. Although the diminutive brain stem may be in part explained by white-matter depletion, the findings raise concern for a component of malformation. The corpus callo-sum is diminutive; the anterior genu and body have formed but are abnormally thin, and the splenium appears deficient as it merges posteriorly with the hippocampal commissure and fornices. The white-matter volume appears reduced as compared with an MRI scan from an age-matched developmentally normal child Fig. 1. By 11 months of age, normal myelination usually results in low signal in parts of the supratento-rial white matter on T2-weighted imaging, but on this patients T2-weighted images, there was hyperintense signal abnormality Fig. 1, which suggests an underlying delay in myelination or a genetic myelin disorder. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed no abnormalities. Dr. Farh: On the ninth day, the patients work of breathing increased, and there was associated bradycardia. Swelling at the site of the central catheter was noted. The catheter was removed and cultured, and broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents were administered. Test results are shown in Table 1. The trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was begun. Cultures of the blood, urine, and catheter tip were negative, as were tests for respiratory viruses. Ultrasonogra-phy revealed thrombosis of the right common femoral vein. Low-molecular-weight heparin was administered subcutaneously. Dr. Caruso: Because of concern for an underlying disorder of myelination, the patient underwent magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the white matter on the 16th day. During this study, the conventional MRI revealed that thrombus had formed in the sagittal and straight sinuses and that the vein of Galen had become engorged Fig. 2. Dr. Farh: The administration of betaine, folinic acid, riboflavin, hydroxocobalamin, pyridoxine, and carnitine was begun. On the 20th day, a lumbar puncture was performed. The results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis are shown in Table 1. The administration of low-molecular-weight heparin at a dose of 200 U per kilogram of body weight twice daily was required to achieve a therapeutic level. Diagnostic test results were received.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Naina Rastalsky Medicine: A 68-year-old man with multiple myeloma was seen in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital because of increasing skin tightness, joint pain, and swelling of the hands and feet. The patient had been well until 2 years before this presentation, when anemia was noted on routine examination at another hospital. During the next 7 months, endoscopic and colonoscopic screening examinations were negative. Pathological examination of a bone marrowbiopsy specimen and aspirate revealed 30 plasma cells; flow-cytometric studies revealed an IgG lambda M component. A diagnosis of multiple myeloma was made. Skeletal radiographs reportedly revealed multiple lytic lesions. Lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone were administered, followed by cyclophosphamide. Nine months before this presentation, the patient was admitted to this hospital; melphalan hydrochloride was administered, and autologous stem-cell transplantation was performed. Results of follow-up studies were consistent with complete remission. Three months before this presentation, the patient was seen by an orthopedist at this hospital for evaluation of low-back pain of 1 years duration. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the lumbar spine, performed after the administration of intravenous gadolinium, revealed multilevel degenerative changes, multiple enhancing lesions in the lumbar spine and left iliac bone, and compression fractures of the first and second lumbar vertebrae, findings consistent with the history of multiple myeloma. Two months before this presentation, swelling and pain in the hands occurred, followed by pedal edema, tightening of the skin of the hands and feet, and diffuse hyperpigmentation on the trunk, arms, and legs. Maintenance therapy with lenalido-mide was begun, but it was stopped during the first cycle because of worsening symptoms. Diffuse joint pain occurred and hyperpigmentation increased. One month before this presentation, on evaluation in the outpatient cancer center of this hospital, the red-cell indexes and results of liver-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, thyrotropin, iron, iron-binding capacity, ferritin, and folate; other test results are shown in Table 1. Total urine protein was 90 mg per liter reference range, 0 to 135. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of a fat pad was performed, and pathological examination of the specimen revealed no evidence of malignant cells or amyloid. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed trace mitral regurgitation, trace tricuspid insufficiency, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 64 and showed that the ascending aorta was 41 mm in diameter reference diameter, 36 mm; there was no evidence of amyloid or pericardial effusion. Urinalysis was normal. The patient was referred to the rheuma-tology clinic of this hospital. On presentation, the patient rated the joint pain at 6 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He had hyperlipidemia, hypertension, low-back pain, and gastroesophageal reflux disease; he had undergone colonic polyp-ectomies and had a history of prostate cancer for which radical prostatectomy was performed 11 years earlier. Medications included acyclovir, ro-suvastatin, and omeprazole. Allopurinol caused a rash. He lived with his wife and worked in an office. He had stopped smoking 20 years earlier, drank alcohol in moderation, and did not use illicit drugs. His mother and maternal uncle had rheumatoid arthritis. On examination, the blood pressure was 112/63 mm Hg and the pulse 100 beats per minute; the temperature, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were normal. A systolic murmur, grade 26, was heard at the right and left upper sternal borders. There was swelling and tenderness in the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interpha-langeal joints bilaterally and swelling below the knees to the toes, without erythema or warmth. The range of motion was decreased in the meta-carpophalangeal and ankle joints. The skin on the metacarpophalangeal joints and legs below the knees to the toes was hyperpigmented. The blood level of C-reactive protein was 54.7 mg per liter reference value, 8.0; testing for antibodies to Ro SSA, La SSB, Sm, RNP, Jo-1, Scl-70 topoi-somerase I, and cyclic citrullinated peptide was negative, and the level of creatine kinase was normal. A tapering course of prednisone was administered. Five weeks later, after returning from a vacation in Aruba, the patient was seen for follow-up appointments at the hematology clinic of the other hospital and the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. He reported severe fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, and weight loss of approximately 3.5 kg. He rated the joint pain at 2 out of 10, but substantial stiffness persisted while he was taking prednisone. On examination, the blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg, the pulse 100 to 111 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96 while he was breathing ambient air; the temperature was normal. The metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints remained swollen but were less tender, and the wrists were slightly full. There was 1 pitting edema below the knees; the skin was deeply tanned and firm in a manner that was out of proportion to the degree of pitting edema. Test results are shown in Table 1. The stool was dark brown and positive 3 for blood. The administration of omeprazole was increased to twice daily, and an endoscopic examination was scheduled. One week later six weeks after this presentation, the patient was admitted to the other hospital because of worsening anemia Table 1. The hematocrit rose to 27.9 after leukocyte-reduced red cells were transfused. Endoscopy revealed severe acute gastritis with marked erythema and friability. He was discharged on the third day. During the next 2 months, melena and anemia persisted. Colonoscopy at the other hospital revealed a benign polyp, 5 mm in diameter, which was excised. Multiple units of red cells were transfused, and intravenous immune globulin IVIG was administered monthly, with some improvement in joint pain and stiffness. Skin tightness persisted, and a skin biopsy was performed. Dr. Rosalynn M. Nazarian: Examination of histo-logic sections of a punch-biopsy specimen from the dorsum of the left hand revealed a fibrosing dermopathy, with interstitial mucin deposition and collagen expansion of the dermis extending to the subcutaneous tissue Fig. 1A. The epidermis appeared normal. Adnexal atrophy with loss of surrounding fat was identified. A sparse lym-phoplasmacytic infiltrate was present at the junction of the dermis and the subcutaneous fat Fig. 1B. There were areas of marked fibroblast hypocellularity in the middle and deep reticular dermis, with diffuse loss of CD34 expression in dermal spindle cells Fig. 1C. A colloidal iron stain revealed finely granular mucin deposits interspersed between dermal collagen bundles Fig. 1D. An elastic-tissue stain revealed preservation of dermal elastic fibers, with straightening and parallel arrangement Fig. 1E. Dr. Rastalsky: Three months after this presen-tation, prednisone was administered for persistent stiffness. The patient reported extreme fatigue and increasing dyspnea on exertion during the preceding 3 months. Results of tests performed at the other hospital are shown in Table 1. Chest imaging was performed because of the worsening shortness of breath. Dr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: Computed tomography CT of the chest revealed reticulation in the sub-pleural region at the lung bases and bronchiolec-tasis Fig. 2A. There was no evidence of pulmonary edema. These findings were suggestive of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia. Soft-tissue windows showed a small pleural effusion on the right side and minimal dilatation of the main pulmonary artery that could be correlated with pulmonary hypertension Fig. 2B. The esophagus was diffusely dilated and contained contrast material throughout. A representative sagittal image showed generalized osteopenia, multiple lytic lesions throughout the spine and ribs, and multiple healed fractures, including one in the sternum Fig. 2C. These skeletal findings were consistent with the history of multiple myeloma. Dr. Rastalsky: The patient was admitted to this hospital 3.5 months after this presentation. On examination, there were bilateral bronchial breath sounds, crackles at the base of the left lung, extensive hardening of the skin from the hands to the elbows and from the toes to above the knees, and deep bronze discoloration on the trunk, arms, and legs. Joint motion was limited by skin thickening. Test results are shown in Table 1. An endoscopic examination was performed. Dr. Nazarian: During the endoscopy, a gastric-biopsy specimen was obtained from the antrum; examination of the specimen revealed expansion of the lamina propria and prominent fibromus-cular hyperplasia. Other areas showed ectatic mu-cosal capillaries with occasional fibrin thrombi Fig. 3. This constellation of findings was consistent with gastric antral vascular ectasia which is also referred to as watermelon stomach because the condition is characterized by the parallel arrangement of longitudinal folds containing dilated vessels that converge at the pylorus, and this arrangement resembles the stripes on a watermelon. Dr. Rastalsky: IVIG and bortezomib were administered. The patient was discharged on the fourth day. Five days later, the patient reported increased discomfort and inability to bend his joints and was using a wheelchair. Test results are shown in Table 1. During the next 4 days, confusion developed and he had difficulty with word-finding. Oral intake was poor. Four months after this presentation, he was brought to the emergency department of this hospital; on examination, he was alert, oriented to person only, and had difficulty with word-finding and verbal expression. The blood pressure was 98/63 mm Hg, and there was periorbital and facial edema; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Test results are shown in Table 1. The peripheral-blood smear showed 2 to 4 schistocytes per high-power field. Urinalysis showed 2 albumin by dipstick, a specific gravity of 1.015, and a pH of 6.0; the urinary sediment was packed with pigmented, coarsely granular casts and had 10 nondysmorphic erythrocytes per high-power field and no cellular casts. The ratio of total spot-urine protein to creatinine was 4.0. CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, was negative. The patient was readmitted to this hospital.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Ms. Caren T. Harris Pediatric Surgery: A 9-year-old girl was admitted to this hospital because of loss of consciousness and seizures. The patient had had recent inguinal pain and swelling but had been otherwise well until the morning of admission, in early autumn, when she fell down one stair at home and struck her head. A hematoma developed on the right side of the forehead, without loss of consciousness or other injury. Shortly thereafter, she ate breakfast and then attended a previously scheduled appointment in the outpatient surgery clinic of this hospital to evaluate inguinal pain and swelling on the left side that had lasted for approximately 3 weeks and was near the site of an inguinal herniorrhaphy that had been performed 9 months earlier. On examination, there was mildly tender lymphadenopathy inferior to the left inguinal crease, with a 2-mm punctate lesion superficial to one of the lymph nodes. There were no findings suggestive of cellulitis. Ultrasound studies were scheduled for the next day. Shortly after the patient visited the clinic, approximately 2 hours after she fell down the stair, she fell again from a standing position to the ground at a shopping mall, hitting her head a second time. The patients mother reported that the patient was on the ground, moaning, and frothing at the mouth and that she had tonic clonic movements, with both arms flexed and both feet extended. The patient also had urinary incontinence and one episode of vomiting. The movements resolved within 30 to 60 seconds. Emergency medical services were called. On examination, the patient was in a supine position, crying, and drifting in and out of consciousness. The pulse was 120 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute. The pupils were sluggishly reactive. The patient had spontaneous movement of all limbs, with posturing movements such as bilateral arm retractions to her chest and foot inversions. Oxygen was administered at a rate of 15 liters per minute through a nonrebreather mask, a cervical collar was applied, and she was placed on a backboard and transported by ambulance to this hospital. During transport, one episode of vomiting occurred. The capillary blood glucose level was 108 mg per deciliter, and cardiac monitoring revealed sinus tachycardia without ectopy. She arrived at the emergency department 40 minutes after the second fall. The history was obtained from the patients mother. The patient was born after a full-term gestation, had had normal growth and development, and was right-handed. She had undergone bilateral inguinal herniorrhaphies 9 months earlier. Three weeks before this admission, after returning from a 2-month visit to Puerto Rico, the patient reported discomfort and swelling in the left inguinal region. Her pediatrician prescribed a course of amoxicillin, which she began taking 9 days before this admission; the prescription was changed to amoxicillinclavu-lanic acid after 2 days and then stopped 2 days later by the patients mother because of lack of improvement and possible facial swelling. The patient had received all routine childhood vaccinations, took no other medications, and had no other known allergies. She was born in Puerto Rico and moved to the United States with her mother at 4 years of age. She lived with her mother, stepfather, and siblings in an urban area and was a student. She returned to Puerto Rico in the summers to visit her father. During the most recent visit, she was exposed to mosquitoes, stray kittens, and a pet dog. Her father had hypertension, and other relatives had asthma; there was no family history of seizures or other neurologic diseases. On examination, the patient had incomprehensible speech, was intermittently moaning, and did not follow commands; she had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 10 on a scale of 3 to 15 with lower scores indicating a lower level of consciousness. The temperature was 36.4C, the blood pressure 71/51 mm Hg, the pulse 95 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute; the oxygen saturation ranged from 97 to 100 while she was breathing ambient air. There was a hematoma 2.5 cm by 2.5 cm on the forehead and facial abrasions on the right side. The pupils were round, equal, and sluggishly reactive to light, decreasing from 4 mm to 3 mm in diameter. The patient opened her eyes and had spontaneous movement of her arms and legs, with intermittent diffuse posturing movements. On passive movement, there was more rigidity on the right side than on the left. The left inguinal area contained two palpable lymph nodes 5 mm in diameter and a 2-mm punctate lesion superficial to one of the lymph nodes, without overlying warmth, erythema, or fluctuance. The remainder of the examination was normal. The white-cell count was 14,000 per cubic millimeter reference range, 4500 to 13,500, the blood level of potassium was 3.2 mmol per liter reference range, 3.4 to 4.8, the phosphorus level was 3.5 mg per deciliter reference range, 4.5 to 5.5, and the glucose level was 134 mg per deciliter reference range, 70 to 110. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, white-cell differential count, platelet count, and anion gap were normal, as were blood levels of other electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, amylase, and lipase and results of renal- and liver-function tests. Screening of the blood for toxins was negative. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 134 beats per minute. Diazepam was administered, and the posturing movements transiently resolved; the blood pressure increased to 125/84 mm Hg. Computed tomography CT of the cervical spine and head was performed. Dr. Sandra P. Rincon: CT of the cervical spine, performed with a cervical collar in place, revealed straightening of the normal cervical lordosis and no acute osseous injury. CT of the head revealed a small subgaleal hematoma adjacent to the right frontal bone, without evidence of an underlying fracture. There was no evidence of acute intra-cranial hemorrhage. A small arachnoid cyst was seen in the right middle cranial fossa. Ms. Harris: Approximately 40 minutes after arrival, the patient became less responsive and posturing movements were present. The blood pressure was 119/88 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute; the oxygen saturation decreased to 84 while she was breathing ambient air. On examination without the cervical collar, the neck was supple. Vomitus was suctioned from the airway, and high-flow oxygen was administered. Etomidate and rocuronium bromide were administered intravenously, and the trachea was intubated for airway protection. The patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. Three hours after arrival in the emergency department, magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head was performed. Dr. Rincon: MRI of the head revealed restricted diffusion involving the cortex of the right temporal lobe, right occipital lobe, right superior and inferior parietal lobule, and right cingulate gyrus, as well as the right insula and right thalamus Fig. 1A and 1B; fluid-attenuated inversion recovery FLAIR images showed hyperintense signal and mild mass effect related to gyral swelling. Given the patients recent seizure activity, these findings are consistent with excitotoxicity. In a patient with seizure activity, signal abnormality and contrast enhancement due to disruption of the bloodbrain barrier can be observed on MRI and are typically transient. In this case, T1-weighted images that were obtained after the administration of contrast material showed no abnormal enhancement Fig. 1C. Three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography of the intracranial circulation revealed increased flow-related enhancement of the right middle cerebral artery, the right posterior cerebral artery, and their branches Fig. 1D that was due to marked hyperemia on the side of the epileptic focus. Findings associated with hyperemia can also be observed on perfusion imaging. Because seizure-related MRI findings are usually transient, follow-up imaging can be helpful to differentiate abnormalities due to seizures from those due to other causes. The MRI findings could be explained by the patients recent seizure activity, but the differential diagnosis for these findings also includes MELAS mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes, an inherited disorder of intracellular energy production that causes seizures and strokelike cortical lesions that cross vascular territories. Although the findings on imaging, including the pattern of involvement and the absence of contrast enhancement, argue against an infectious cause, infectious causes should also be considered. Ms. Harris: Levetiracetam was administered. Electroencephalography EEG followed by 24-hour EEG monitoring revealed continuous generalized background slowing in the delta and theta ranges, frequent intermittent focal delta-range slowing over the right hemisphere with maximal slowing at times over the right anterior quadrant or right temporal region, and frequent sharp waves in the right frontotemporal region. Seven hours after the patients arrival, lumbar puncture was performed. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid CSF revealed clear, colorless fluid, with a glucose level of 92 mg per deciliter reference range, 50 to 75 and a total protein level of 33 mg per deciliter reference range, 5 to 55, as well as 5 red cells per cubic millimeter and no white cells, other nucleated cells, or xanthochromia. Grams staining revealed very few neutrophils and mononuclear cells and no organisms. Cultures of the blood, urine, and CSF were obtained. Management decisions were made, and additional diagnostic tests were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ",

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Sahir Kalim Medicine: A 78-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of hypercalcemia and renal failure. The patient had been in his usual health until approximately 4 months before the current admission; he had been admitted to this hospital then because of dyspnea, cough, rib pain, flank pain, and one episode of hematuria that had reportedly occurred 1 week earlier. On examination, the vital signs were normal; there were rales in the bases of both lungs and a systolic ejection murmur grade 26. Urinalysis showed no evidence of blood. Dr. P. Gabriel Peterson: Imaging studies that were performed during that hospitalization included chest radiography and computed tomographic CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. These studies revealed basilar atelectasis, changes consistent with mild congestive heart failure, and a new subpleural nodular opacity 1.3 cm in diameter in the right middle lobe Fig. 1A. There was also bilateral mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with coarse calcifications, a finding that was unchanged from imaging studies that had been obtained 2 years earlier Fig. 1B. Dr. Kalim: During that admission, the patients cough, dyspnea, and flank pain improved with supportive care. At discharge, recommendations included outpatient follow-up with CT of the chest, cytologic examination of a urine specimen, and possible cystoscopy. Four months later, on the day of the current admission, the patient was seen in a clinic affiliated with this hospital for a follow-up visit. He reported that two episodes of hematuria had occurred during the previous 2 months, with fatigue but no fevers, chills, numbness, headache, neck stiffness, difficulty swallowing, incontinence, trauma, or infection. He had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, benign prostatic hypertrophy, mild cognitive decline, and choreiform movements. He had undergone aortic-valve replacement and repair of an aortic aneurysm 2 years earlier; he had had a positive tuberculin skin test with a reportedly negative evaluation 6 years earlier. His medications included donepezil hydrochloride, citalopram, tamsulosin, ranitidine, quetiapine, aspirin, psyllium, and a multivitamin. He had no known allergies. He was born in Europe and had lived in South America for 10 years; he had immigrated to the United States when he was in his 40s. He lived with his wife and was retired after working in the construction and food industries. He maintained a low-salt and low-cholesterol diet, had stopped smoking 30 years earlier, had stopped drinking alcohol 1 month earlier, and did not use illicit drugs. His father had had asthma and a myocardial infarction at 62 years of age, his mother had had heart failure in her 70s, a brother had had a stroke in his 80s, and his son had died in his 30s because of arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy; his other children were healthy. On examination, the blood pressure was 108//66 mm Hg, and the pulse 68 beats per minute. The first and second heart sounds were normal; a systolic murmur, grade 1/6, was heard at the left base. The remainder of the examination was unchanged from baseline. The platelet count and red-cell indexes were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, total and direct bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed clear yellow urine, with a specific gravity of 1.009, a pH of 5.5, and trace albumin by dipstick, and was otherwise normal. After the test results were known, the patient was advised to go the emergency department of this hospital. In the emergency department, the patient reported diffuse nonradiating lower abdominal pain, which he rated at 4 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain).  He also reported severe constipation, increasing urinary frequency over a period of 1 week, decreased oral intake, weakness and fatigue of 1 month’s duration, and weight loss of 4.5 kg during the previous 3 months.  He had no fevers, chills, night sweats, cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rashes, chest pain, palpitations, syncope, or leg swelling.  On examination, the blood pressure was 149//65 mm Hg, the pulse 50 beats per minute, the temperature 36.4°C, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air.  The abdomen was soft and mildly tender in the lower quadrants, without rebound, and the remainder of the examination was unchanged.  Blood levels of lactate dehydrogenase and vitamin A were normal, and testing was negative for hepatitis B virus surface antibodies and antigen and hepatitis C virus antibodies;  additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.  Repeat urinalysis revealed 1+ occult blood and albumin by dipstick;  examination of the urinary sediment revealed 0 to 2 red cells and white cells, few bacteria, and few squamous cells per high-power field.  The urinary sodium level was 55 mmol per liter, the creatinine level was 0.44 mg per milliliter (3890 μmol per liter), and the osmolality was 329 mOsm per kilogram of water.  A chest radiograph revealed a tortuous calcified aorta, evidence of aortic-valve replacement, and no evidence of pneumonia or effusion.  Electrocardiography (ECG) showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 50 beats per minute;  the results were otherwise unchanged from earlier tracings.  The patient was admitted to this hospital.  Normal saline was infused, and salmon calcitonin was administered.  The calcium level decreased to 13.4 mg per deciliter (3.35 mmol per liter), at which time the ionized calcium level was 1.73 mmol per liter (6.92 mg per deciliter;  reference range, 1.14 to 1.30 mmol per liter [4.56 to 5.20 mg per deciliter]).  Two additional liters of saline were infused.  On the second day, hemodialysis was performed, and the ionized calcium level decreased to 1.27 mmol per liter (5.08 mg per deciliter).  The next day, pamidronate was administered.  Dr. Peterson: During the next 8 days, additional imaging studies were obtained.  CT of the chest, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed multiple small pulmonary nodules, many of which were subpleural (Figure 1C).  The nodules were unchanged from imaging studies obtained 2 years earlier, and the new nodule in the right middle lobe that had been seen on the previous study had resolved.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed a right renal cyst (2.9 cm in diameter) and an enlarged prostate.  A bone scan showed no evidence of bone metastases.  Thyroid ultrasonography revealed bilateral colloid cysts but no extrathyroid nodules.  A skeletal survey showed diffuse osteopenia, with lucent lesions in the calvarium and possibly the mandible, as well as subtle, indeterminate lucent lesions in the legs that raised concerns about multiple myeloma or metastatic cancer.  Dr. Kalim: Cytologic examination and culture of the urine were negative.  On the sixth hospital day, testing for cryoproteins was negative.  Pathological examination of a bone marrow–biopsy specimen showed 7% plasma cells and an increased number of monoclonal plasma cells with kappa light chains.  The patient was discharged on the 11th hospital day;  sodium bicarbonate was added to his previous medication regimen.  Eleven days later (21 days after the current admission), at an outpatient visit, additional test results were obtained (Table 1). Dr. Peterson: The next week, 1 month after the current admission, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET) revealed marked FDG avidity in the mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy (Figure 1D).  Dr. Kalim: Two weeks later, the patient was readmitted to this hospital because of worsening renal failure.  Levels of complement (C3 and C4) were normal, and testing was negative for antibodies to double-stranded DNA, SSA (Ro), SSB (La), Sm, and RNP;  other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.  A renal biopsy was performed. Dr. Eugene J. Mark: Pathological examination of the renal-biopsy specimen revealed two glomeruli with global sclerosis (out of the six examined), interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy affecting 30% of the cortex. The principal finding was a focal but dense infiltrate of mononuclear cells that was composed predominantly of lymphocytes, with some histiocytes and plasma cells and without eosinophils. There were foci of tubulitis that was characterized by disruption of basement membrane by the inflammatory cells (Figure 2A). Interstitial fibrosis resulted in tubular atrophy (Figure 2B). These findings indicate chronic active tubulointerstitial nephritis. In addition, localized collections of histiocytes were present. The epithelioid character of the histiocytes, as well as their circumscription, can be described as granulomatous or as poorly formed granulomas (Figure 2C).1 The glomeruli that were observed in the renal-biopsy specimen were normal apart from the global sclerosis in areas of inflammation (Figure 2D). Dr. Kalim: The patient was discharged on the fourth hospital day. Four weeks later, a diagnostic procedure was performed. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ",

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Blair Wylie Obstetrics and Gynecology: A 38-year-old pregnant woman gravida 2, para 0 was admitted to this hospital at 33 weeks 3 days of gestation because of headache and visual symptoms. The patient had been in her usual health until 2 weeks before admission, when neck pain developed. Eleven days before admission, she was seen in the emergency department and the labor and delivery unit because of neck and back pain, occipital headache, vomiting, and a self-reported temperature of 38.9C. On examination, the back was tender; the vital signs and remainder of the examination were normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed yellow, cloudy urine, with trace ketones, 1 albumin, and 2 urobilinogen; urine sediment showed a few squamous cells per high-power field and mucin. Hydromorphone and cyclobenzaprine were administered, with some improvement. The patient was discharged home. A urine culture grew abundant mixed bacteria, with small amounts of two potential pathogens. The headache improved spontaneously after 3 days. On the day of presentation, the patient felt the onset of a panic attack followed by tunnel vision; she began to hyperventilate and her vision went black from the periphery to the center. The symptoms lasted for approximately 2 minutes and were followed by spots in her visual fields, headache, neck pain that radiated to her arms, nausea, and dizziness both unsteadiness and vertigo. The capillary glucose level, which was obtained by the patient, was 122 mg per deciliter 6.8 mmol per liter. She called her caregivers and was advised to go to the labor and delivery unit. On presentation, the patient reported normal fetal movement and no fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, leaking fluid, or contractions. She had received prenatal care, including screenings for syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus, gonorrhea, and chlamydia all of which were negative and routine ultrasound examinations. During the third trimester, a glucose-tolerance test was positive. She had intermittent atypical chest pain that had lasted for several years; 2.5 months before admission, an evaluation of the pain included electrocardiography ECG, which revealed nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes, and trans-thoracic echocardiography, which was normal. At 17 years of age, she had presented at 20 weeks of gestation with sepsis and a stillborn fetus; dilation and evacuation had been performed. She also had anemia Table 1 with a history of iron deficiency, bipolar disorder, panic attacks associated with syncope and tingling on the left side, recurrent pelvic pain with pelvic adhesions, benign ovarian cysts, asthma, and seasonal allergic rhinitis; she had had a positive purified protein derivative skin test with a normal chest radiograph, which had been treated with isoniazid and vitamin B6  for 9 months. She had undergone multiple laparoscopies, including cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis, lysis of adhesions, and ovarian cystectomies. Medications included a prenatal multivitamin and ferrous sulfate; antidepressants were discontinued by the patient at the start of the current pregnancy. She was allergic to loperamide, morphine which caused chest discomfort, meperidine hydrochloride which caused hives, and contrast material which caused a rash. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She was born in Guatemala, had immigrated to the United States 15 years earlier, and had last visited Guatemala 3 years earlier. She lived with her boyfriend. She had worked in an office but was currently receiving disability benefits because of her bipolar disorder. Her mother had had breast cancer and died in her 50s. On examination, the temperature was 35.9C, the blood pressure 117/68 mm Hg, the pulse 104 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. Her abdomen was gravid, soft, and nontender, with active fetal movements. The fetal heart-rate tracing was reassuring. There was no peripheral edema or abdominal tenderness. Reflexes were normal, as were the remaining general and neurologic examinations. The capillary glucose level was 111 mg per deciliter 6.2 mmol per liter. Blood levels of uric acid, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, total protein, globulin, and total and direct bilirubin were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Intravenous fluids, acetaminophen, and butal-bitalacetaminophencaffeine were administered, followed by prochlorperazine, oxycodoneacet-aminophen, and diphenhydramine; the patients condition partially improved. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head could not be performed because of the patients anxiety; preliminary magnetic resonance venography showed no evidence of sinus thrombosis. After 24 hours of observation in the labor and delivery unit, the patients symptoms had not resolved, and she was admitted to the hospital. She reported occipital headache, which she rated at 9 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain. Dr. Ramon Gilberto Gonzalez: Later that day, MRI of the head was performed without the administration of contrast material Fig. 1A and 1B. Diffusion-weighted images showed multiple at least eight small hyperintense lesions scattered throughout both cerebral hemispheres, in white and gray matter; the largest lesion 7 mm in maximal diameter was located in the left cen-trum semiovale, with no evidence of associated intracranial mass or hemorrhage. The lesions were thought to reflect infarcts that had occurred at least 6 hours earlier. Results of magnetic resonance angiography and venography were normal. Dr. Wylie: Ultrasonography of the legs revealed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. ECG showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 108 beats per minute and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes. Holter monitoring did not reveal an arrhythmia. A lumbar puncture was unsuccessful; the patient declined further attempts. Aspirin 81 mg daily, metoclopramide, and prenatal vitamins were administered. On the third day, the prothrombin time, prothrombin-time international normalized ratio, and activated partial-thromboplastin time were normal, as were results of tests for factor VIII, partial-thromboplastin timelupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin IgG and IgM antibodies, functional antithrombin III, functional protein C, activated protein C resistance, and prothrombin gene mutation; other test results are shown in Table 1. Betamethasone was administered in two 12-mg intramusclar doses 24 hours apart to promote fetal lung maturity. An active, well-grown fetus was seen on ultrasound examination. The patients headache resolved. The next day, on evaluation by ophthalmology consultants, she reported no acute change in vision, eye pain, or eye redness, but she did have floaters, which she described as worms. On examination, there was binocular horizontal diplopia which could be relieved with the use of corrective lenses and a pterygium on the left side, with no evidence of papilledema, embolic phenomena, or vasculitis on funduscopic examination. Testing revealed antibodies to hepatitis A virus; screening for hepatitis B and C viruses was negative. Dr. Gonzalez: Repeat MRI of the head Fig. 1C revealed multiple foci of restricted diffusion, including a few that were new in the bilateral frontal and right occipital lobes. These findings were thought to be consistent with multiple small acute infarcts. Dr. David M. Dudzinski: On the fifth day, trans-thoracic echocardiography Fig. 2; and Videos 1, 2, and 3, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org revealed a hyperkinetic left ventricle without wall-motion abnormalities and with obliteration of the left ventricular cavity during systole. The right ventricular apex was akinetic and aneurysmal. In both ventricles, there was prominent accumulation of sessile, smooth-bordered endocardial material with an echodensity that was distinctly different from that of the myocardium; this finding was not present on the previous echocardiogram. Thrombus in the left ventricle would be unlikely in this case given the diffuse accumulation of endocardial material and the absence of global or regional dysfunction. Apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy could produce a hyperkinetic ventricle with obliteration of the left ventricular cavity during systole but not one in which the wall has an echodensity that is different from that of the myocardium. Thus, the findings were suggestive of endocar-dial deposits. There was no patent foramen ovale or clinically significant valvulopathy specifically no valvular thickening, vegetations, tethering, or malcoaptation and only trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Tissue Doppler echocardiography, Doppler assessment of the transmitral flow velocity and pulmonary-vein flow velocity, and assessment of the color M-mode propagation velocity revealed that the left ventricular diastolic function was normal. Dr. Wylie: Consultations with the infectious diseases, hematology, and rheumatology services were requested. The level of lipoproteina was normal, and testing was negative for antibodies to 2-glycoprotein 1, SSA Ro, SSB La, Sm, and RNP and for IgG antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptides. A continuous intravenous infusion of heparin was initiated. Additional diagnostic tests were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ",

A diagnosis of dilated nonischemic cardiomyopathy had been made when the patient was in his late 40s. When he was 48 years of age, a dual-chamber pacemaker and implantable cardioverterdefibrillator ICD was placed. Dr. Jodi L. Zilinski Echocardiology: Four months before admission, transthoracic echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40 Fig. 1A, 1B, and 1C; and Videos 1 and 2, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Dr. Herrington: Several days before admission, malaise, fatigue, increasing dys-pnea, and chest tightness developed. One day before admission, the patient was seen by his primary care provider. The systolic blood pressure was reportedly between 80 and 89 mm Hg, the pulse higher than 100 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 77 while he was breathing ambient air. Emergency medical services were called; on examination, the patients mentation was normal, and the cardiac rhythm was rapid atrial fibrillation. During transport by ambulance to another hospital, ventricular tachycardia developed, and the patient became unresponsive and apneic. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was begun, and the trachea was intubated. In the emergency department, blood levels of magnesium and alkaline phosphatase were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Ventricular tachycardia was followed by transient pulseless electrical activity, with hypoten-sion, hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and acidosis. Oxygen, multiple external shocks, epinephrine, amiodarone, dopamine, and sodium bicarbonate were administered. After approximately 25 minutes, atrial fibrillation was restored, and the blood pressure rose to 98/20 mm Hg. Norepinephrine bitartrate, insulin, midazolam, cisatracurium, furosemide, fentanyl, vasopressin, sodium bicarbonate, magnesium, calcium gluconate, potassium chloride, potassium phosphate, heparin, and normal saline were administered. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit ICU. Dr. Zilinski: Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 15, severe diffuse hypokinesis, regional wall-motion abnormalities, mild left ventricular dilatation, normal wall thickness, and moderate mitral regurgitation, without pericardial effusion. Dr. Herrington: Chest radiographs reportedly showed increasing consolidation of the right middle and upper lobes. The patient was paralyzed, and mechanical ventilation was continued. Furosemide and chlorothiazide were administered for oliguria, and broad-spectrum antibiotic agents for presumed aspiration pneu-monia; venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO was initiated for persistent hypoxemia. On the second day, the patient was transferred to this hospital and admitted to the ICU. Medications on transfer included norepi-nephrine, dopamine, fentanyl, midazolam, vaso-pressin, insulin, and cisatracurium. The patient had muscle weakness that had begun approximately 15 years earlier, when increasing weakness of his hands developed. When the patient was 40 years of age, episodes of lightheadedness occurred; a diagnosis of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was made, and prophylactic anticoagulation with warfarin was begun. When he was 41 years of age, he noted difficulty walking with occasional stumbling, gripping and releasing tools, and climbing stairs and ladders. Electromyography, which was performed at another hospital, reportedly revealed brief-duration, low-amplitude, polyphasic motor-unit potentials. During the next 3 years, his symptoms worsened, and his left forearm was fractured after a fall. On examination when the patient was 44 years of age, extraocular movements were normal, and mild bilateral ptosis, moderate bilateral facial weakness, and slight thinning of the tem-poralis muscles were present. His speech had a nasal quality, without dysarthria or tongue weakness. The muscle weakness was rated as 4 on the Medical Research Council MRC scale which ranges from 0 paralysis to 5 normal strength and involved the neck flexors, finger extensors, and intrinsic muscles of the hands; strength was normal in the proximal muscles of the arms. Muscle tone was normal throughout. After the patient firmly grasped the examiners hand, he had difficulty releasing his grip quickly. Tapping of the finger extensor muscles on the dorsal forearm and on the abductor pollicis in the thenar eminence produced muscle contractions that relaxed slowly. There was slight weakness of the hip flexor muscles, normal strength in the quadriceps and hamstrings, and weakness of the dorsiflexors MRC score, 3 and plantar flexors MRC score, 4 of the feet. The patient was able to point to a target with his fingertip, perform the heelkneeshin test, and carry out rapid, rhythmic tapping movements with his hands and feet. Vibration sense was mildly decreased in his toes. He rose from a chair without the use of his arms and had a high-stepping gait. Deep-tendon reflexes were hypoactive in the arms and absent at the ankles. Rombergs sign was absent. Over the course of the next few years, weakness progressed. When the patient was 47 years of age, he had difficulty lifting 5-gallon buckets at work; examination reportedly revealed weakness of the neck flexors MRC score, 4, wrist and finger extensors MRC scores, 4, and finger flexors and distal leg muscles MRC scores, 3 and normal strength in the deltoid, biceps, triceps, hip flex-ors, quadriceps, and hamstrings. Deep-tendon reflexes were absent. The patient also had obstructive sleep apnea, sudden sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear which had begun when he was 45 years of age and which was unresponsive to glucocorticoid therapy, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, morbid obesity, cho-lelithiasis which had required cholecystectomy, problems with ejaculation, noninsulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus, gastroesophageal reflux disease, depression, vitamin B12 and vitamin D deficiencies, and episodes of pneumonia that were thought to be related to aspiration. Medications that he was taking before this acute illness included warfarin, pravastatin, pioglitazone, met-formin, ketoconazole, atenolol, citalopram, furo-semide, pantoprazole, and bupropion all daily, as well as a vitamin B12 supplement monthly and a vitamin D supplement weekly. He reportedly had allergies to morphine, codeine, and tramadol. He was married and lived with his wife and children. He worked in a retail store. He drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke. His father and one sister had an undefined neuromuscular problem. His father had had lung cancer, and his mother uterine cancer; both died when they were in their 70s. One of his children had scoliosis and a neuromuscular disorder similar to that of the patient. On examination, the patient was sedated and paralyzed. Coarse breath sounds in the lungs and active bowel sounds were present. There was trace edema of both legs, and the abdomen was soft and nondistended. The pupils were sluggishly reactive; oculocephalic and corneal reflexes were absent. The arms and legs had minimal withdrawal and possible posturing. The blood levels of magnesium and amylase were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Sodium bicarbonate, insulin, glucose solution, and furose-mide were administered, and urine output increased 450 mm3 of urine over a 2-hour period. A cannula was placed for distal perfusion, and ECMO was continued. Dr. Stacey Verzosa: A chest radiograph Fig. 2 showed bilateral diffuse consolidation that was most confluent in the left lower lung, an enlarged cardiac silhouette, bilateral layering pleu-ral effusions, and the presence of medical devices, including a dual-chamber pacemaker and ICD and an ECMO catheter. Dr. Herrington: Electroencephalography revealed alternation of low-amplitude bursts with near-complete suppression of cerebral activity. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration was begun, without improvement in neurologic function. Overnight, multiple units of red cells and fresh-frozen plasma were transfused, and albumin was administered. Heparin, insulin, vaso-pressin, and norepinephrine were administered. Results of a cosyntropin stimulation test were normal. On the second day, computed tomography of the head revealed no evidence of hemorrhage or mass lesions. Dr. Zilinski: Repeat transthoracic echocardiog-raphy revealed severe diffuse left ventricular hy-pokinesis, with regional variation and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 13 Fig. 1D, 1E, and 1F; and Videos 3 and 4. Dr. Herrington: Fentanyl and midazolam were discontinued, and hydrocortisone was administered, without improvement in the patients level of consciousness. Portable electroencephalogra-phy revealed generalized slowing with near-total suppression of cerebral activity and without evidence of epileptiform abnormalities. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. On the fifth hospital day, in consultation with the patients family, mechanical respiratory support was withdrawn and comfort measures were instituted; shortly thereafter, the patient died. An autopsy was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ",

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Omar Kattan Medicine: An 84-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of chest pain, dyspnea, and a rash. The patient had been in her usual health and able to perform normal activities of daily living including walking one block until 3 days before admission, when fatigue, anorexia, nausea, and dry heaves developed. On the day of admission, substernal chest discomfort occurred; she awoke in the late evening with pain in the upper chest that she rated at 5 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain, with associated tightness, dyspnea, and nausea. On evaluation by emergency medical services personnel, the blood pressure was 116/80 mm Hg, the pulse 164 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute labored, and the oxygen saturation 97 while she was breathing ambient air. An electrocardiogram ECG showed tachycardia with a regular wide QRS complex. Amiodarone and ondansetron were administered intravenously; the pulse slowed to 100 beats per minute, and the chest pain and tightness diminished. When the patients daughter arrived at the emergency department of this hospital, she reported that 2.5 months before this admission, the patient had been admitted to another hospital for 1 day because of throat tightness and dyspnea. At that time, an ECG had shown sinus rhythm and left bundle-branch block, and cardiac telemetry had been negative. The troponin level had been elevated, at 0.06 ng per milliliter reference value, 0.03. A chest radiograph had shown small pleural effusions and hyperinflation. During that admission, a rash was noted; the patient had reported a history of intermittent rash or bruises on the face, neck, and trunk of approximately 3 years duration, with worsening during the previous 6 months. The acute symptoms resolved, and the patient was discharged the next day, with instructions to undergo transthoracic echocardiography and a stress test at an outpatient clinic and a biopsy of her rash by a dermatologist; none of these tests had been performed before she was admitted to this hospital. The patient had hypertension, long-standing bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, and a history of colonic polyps. Medications were aspirin, calcium carbonate, vitamin D supplements, and biotin. She was allergic to sulfa drugs, which caused a rash. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She lived alone and her children lived nearby. Her father had had an abdominal aortic aneurysm; there was no other family history of cardiovascular or dermatologic disease. On examination, the patient was in respiratory distress and responded to questions with one- or two-word answers. The temperature was 36.6C, the blood pressure 109/69 mm Hg, the pulse 94 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 84 while she was breathing ambient air. She had jugular venous distention to 11 cm of water, poor air movement, diffuse bilateral lung crackles, and scattered purpuric lesions on the face, neck, trunk, and arms. The remainder of the examination was normal. Oxygen supplementation was administered through a nonrebreather face mask, and the oxygen saturation rose to higher than 90. An ECG showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 81 beats per minute and left bundle-branch block. Dr. Michael T. Lu: A chest radiograph Fig. 1A showed patchy and confluent opacities in both lower lobes and small bilateral pleural effusions. These findings are compatible with pulmonary edema. Dr. Kattan: Blood levels of hemoglobin, urea nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, albumin, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, amylase, and lipase were normal, as were the platelet count, prothrombin time, and prothrombin-time international normalized ratio; other test results are shown in Table 1. Testing for influenza types A and B, hepatitis B and C viruses, and Lyme disease was negative. Urinalysis revealed slightly cloudy, yellow urine, with 1 protein by dipstick, squamous cells, and mucus. Cardiac ultrasonography, performed at the bedside in the emergency department, revealed decreased cardiac function, with poor visualization of the right ventricle and no evidence of pericardial effusion. Thoracic ultra-sonography revealed lung sliding and multiple B-line artifacts bilaterally. Bilevel positive airway pressure was administered but was discontinued when vomiting occurred. Aspirin, atorvastatin, furosemide, ondansetron, and morphine were administered, and a heparin infusion was begun. A cardiology consultation was obtained, and the patient was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit ICU 4 hours after presentation. On examination in the cardiac ICU, the patient appeared to be in respiratory distress and reported having air hunger. The respiratory rate was 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen satu-ration 93 while she was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute. There was trace edema of the legs. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. In the cardiac ICU, dyspnea persisted and fatigue increased. The blood levels of triglycerides, high-density lipoproteins, low-density lipopro-teins, glycated hemoglobin, vitamin B12, and folate were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. One dose of ticagrelor was administered, followed by a nitroglycerin infusion and doses of vancomycin, cefepime, and furosemide. Dr. Lu: A chest radiograph Fig. 1B showed progression of the multifocal opacities in the lungs and enlarging pleural effusions. These findings are compatible with worsening pulmonary edema. Dr. Mohammed Ali: Transthoracic echocardiog-raphy was performed to evaluate the ongoing chest pain and the shortness of breath that was associated with respiratory failure. The left ventricular systolic function was moderately impaired; the left ventricle had a normal size and increased wall thickness. The right ventricular size and systolic function were normal, and the estimated right ventricular systolic pressure was 46 mm Hg. The left atrium was enlarged, with thickening of the anterior and posterior mitral-valve leaflets and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation but no other valvular disease. Bilateral pleural effusions and a small pericardial effusion without hemodynamic significance were noted. Pulsed-wave Doppler imaging of the mi-tral valve revealed a restrictive filling pattern, with a very high early diastolic filling velocity E wave, a short deceleration time 130 msec, and a low late diastolic filling velocity A wave Fig. 2; and Video 1, available with full text of this article at NEJM.org. Dr. Kattan: Approximately 10 hours after the patients arrival in the cardiac ICU approximately 14 hours after presentation, she was sedated and paralyzed, and the trachea was electively intubated. Mechanical ventilation was initiated. Dr. Ali: Shortly thereafter, a pulmonary-artery catheter was inserted, and coronary-artery angiography revealed diffuse, minimal nonobstructive coronary artery disease. On hemodynamic assessment, the pressure was 13/11 mm Hg with a mean of 10 mm Hg in the right atrium, 487 mm Hg in the right ventricle, and 49/27 mm Hg with a mean of 34 mm Hg in the pulmonary artery; the pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure was 25 mm Hg. Cardiac output, measured by means of thermo-dilution, was 2.9 liters per minute cardiac index, 1.7 liters per minute per square meter of body-surface area. Additional furosemide was administered. Dr. Kattan: On the morning of the second day, the patient was breathing spontaneously, and the trachea was extubated. Cool oxygen was admin-istered through a face tent at a concentration of 40. Indirect immunofluorescence testing for antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies ANCA was negative, as was testing for antibodies to proteinase 3 and myeloperoxidase. On the third day, the blood iron level was 16 g per deciliter 3 mol per liter; reference range, 30 to 160 g per deciliter 5 to 29 mol per liter, the blood iron-binding capacity was 196 g per deciliter 35 mol per liter; reference range, 230 to 404 g per deciliter 41 to 72 mol per liter, and the total complement level was 191 U per milliliter reference range, 63 to 145. Levels of C3, C4, ferritin, and thyrotropin were normal, and testing for antinuclear antibodies ANA, human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, celiac disease, and cryoproteins was negative. The patient was transferred to the cardiac telemetry unit. Analysis of a urine specimen revealed a high level of kappa Bence Jones protein in three molecular forms, as well as trace albumin. A dermatology consultation was obtained to evaluate the rash. Dr. Daniel Y. Sugai Dermatology: On examination of the skin, there were purpuric and ecchy-motic plaques, macules, and papules on the face particularly affecting the perioral region, neck, trunk, and arms Fig. 3, as well as violaceous macules on the dorsal and lateral tongue and perianal ecchymoses. There was no purpura around the eyes after pinching pinch purpura and no macroglossia. The conjunctivae were clear, and the nails were normal. Dr. Kattan: A diagnostic procedure was performed.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Amulya Nagarur Medicine: An 80-year-old man with end-stage renal disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral arterial disease, hypertension, coronary arteriosclerosis, congestive heart failure, abdominal aortic aneurysm, hyperlipidemia, and gout was admitted to this hospital because of anorexia, weight loss, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and an ileocecal mass. Three years before this admission, the patient had been seen in the emergency department of this hospital because of neck pain. Computed tomography CT of the neck revealed evidence of degenerative disk disease of the cervical spine and a pulmonary nodule 8 mm in diameter in the left upper lobe. Dr. Shaunagh McDermott: Three months after that initial visit, follow-up CT of the chest was performed, and the nodule in the left upper lobe had not changed in size. Five months after the initial visit, combined 18F-fluorodeoxyglucosepositron-emission tomography and CT FDG-PETCT revealed that the pulmonary nodule had increased in size to 1 cm in diameter, was tethered to the overlying pleura in the left upper lobe, and had increased FDG uptake; a contiguous nodule 7 mm in diameter with increased FDG uptake and new nodules in the right middle lobe were also present. In addition, there was intense diffuse FDG uptake in the stomach, as well as wall thickening of the most distal aspect of the terminal ileum and the cecum in the region of the ileocecal valve, with adjacent inflammatory fat stranding Fig. 1. Dr. Nagarur: Lung biopsy, upper endoscopy, and colonoscopy were recommended, but the patient declined to undergo these procedures. Approximately 9 months after the initial visit, induration 8 mm in diameter developed at the site of a tuberculin skin test that had been performed during a hemodialysis appointment at an outpatient care unit. Chest radiography was performed; pulmonary lesions were not noted. Eleven months after the initial visit 25 months before this admission, severe abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant and pain in the right flank developed acutely, and the patient presented to the emergency department at this hospital. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. McDermott: CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material Fig. 2A, revealed a hema-toma in the right anterior pararenal space that arose from a subcapsular hematoma in the right kidney, with extravasation of blood into the ret-roperitoneal space. In addition, the soft-tissue mass at the ileocecal junction had increased in size. Dr. Nagarur: The patient was admitted to the hospital, and coil embolization of the right renal artery was performed. On the fourth hospital day, a colonoscopy was performed, and a nonob-structive fungating mass 4 cm by 2 cm was visualized at the ileocecal valve Fig. 3. Examination of a biopsy specimen of the mass showed severely active chronic colitis with fibrinopuru-lent exudate. On the 11th hospital day, colonoscopy was repeated and upper endoscopy was performed. In addition to the ileocecal mass, there were a few small inflammatory nodules with a patchy distribution in the lower two thirds of the esophagus, an oozing cratered ulcer in the gastric body with a visible vessel that was clipped, a few nonbleeding superficial ulcers in the gastric antrum, and diffuse, moderately erythematous mucosa in the duodenal bulb. Histopathological examination of biopsy specimens revealed erosive gastritis with reactive foveolar hyperplasia and markedly active chronic ileitis and ileocolitis with ulceration and non-necrotizing granulomas; no fungal forms or acid-fast bacilli were seen. The patient was discharged home while taking omeprazole. Eight weeks after that discharge approximately 23 months before this admission, the patient was seen in the gastroenterology clinic at this hospital. He reported having two or three bowel movements each day, with formed stools and without blood or pain during defecation. He had a reduced appetite but no abdominal pain. The weight was 65.3 kg decreased from 78.0 kg 3 years earlier, and the abdominal examination was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 67 mm per hour reference range, 0 to 13, and the C-reactive protein level was 55.5 mg per liter reference value, 8.0. The dose of omepra-zole was increased. Approximately 19 months before this admission, 2 weeks after the patient was discharged from a hospital stay for pacemaker placement, he was seen in the primary care clinic with a 5-day history of diarrhea, lower abdominal pain, and tenderness. The weight was 59.3 kg. A stool culture was negative for enteric pathogens, and a test for Clostridium difficile was positive. A 10-day course of oral metronidazole was prescribed; the frequency of diarrhea initially decreased but returned to three or four times a day after the medication was stopped. A 14-day course of oral vancomycin was prescribed, and the symptoms abated. Sixteen months before this admission, severe abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant de-veloped acutely, and the patient presented to the emergency department at this hospital. He reported feeling weak; the right lower quadrant was tender on palpation. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. McDermott: CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed persistent irregular wall thickening of the terminal ileum, with mild adjacent inflammatory fat stranding Fig. 2B. Dr. Nagarur: Hemodialysis was performed, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. Cipro-floxacin and metronidazole were administered, and the abdominal pain improved during the next 3 days. A stool culture and examinations for ova and parasites were negative, and a test for C. difficile was positive; ciprofloxacin was discontinued, and the patient was discharged with a prescription for a 14-day course of oral metro-nidazole. Thirteen months before this admission, the patient returned to the gastroenterology clinic. He reported that he had had three or four loose, nonbloody bowel movements each day for several weeks, with associated generalized abdominal pain. His appetite continued to be reduced, and he felt weak and fatigued. The weight was 55.8 kg, and the abdominal examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. McDermott: CT angiography of the abdomen and pelvis had been performed 2 days before this visit to the gastroenterology clinic, during routine follow-up after a recent endovas-cular procedure for the repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The imaging studies revealed an increase in the circumferential wall thickening of the terminal ileum and cecum Fig. 2C. Dr. Nagarur: A diagnosis of Crohns disease was considered. Treatment with prednisone and methotrexate was recommended, but the patient declined the treatment. Eleven weeks before this admission, generalized weakness, diffuse abdominal discomfort and tenderness, and hypo-tension developed during an outpatient hemodi-alysis session. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and fever to a temperature of 38.4C developed. Cefepime and vancomycin were administered intravenously. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. McDermott: CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed increased diffuse wall thickening of the terminal ileum and cecum, with persistent mesenteric fat stranding and lymphadenopathy Fig. 2D. Dr. Nagarur: By the third hospital day, the fever had resolved and the abdominal pain had improved but diarrhea had developed; a test for C. difficile was again positive. Cefepime and van-comycin were discontinued. The patient was discharged home with prescriptions for budesonide, a 4-week course of ciprofloxacin and metronida-zole, and a 6-week tapering course of oral van-comycin. Three and a half weeks before this admission, the patient underwent endarterectomies of the right common femoral artery and the right superficial femoral artery at this hospital. Diarrhea and tenderness of the right lower quadrant developed postoperatively. The patient was uncertain whether he had been taking the budesonide and oral vancomycin that had been prescribed during his most recent hospitalization. Urinalysis revealed cloudy urine with 3 leukocyte esterase, 3 occult blood, 2 albumin, and negative nitrites by dipstick, as well as more than 100 white cells and 20 to 50 red cells per high-power field. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. McDermott: CT of the abdomen revealed persistent circumferential wall thickening of the terminal ileum and cecum and extensive adjacent fat stranding that had increased slightly since previous imaging studies had been obtained Fig. 2E. Dr. Nagarur: On the sixth hospital day, a bowel movement contained blood; a test for C. difficile was negative. The patient was discharged home on the seventh hospital day with prescriptions for budesonide, a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin, and a tapering course of oral vancomycin. During the 24 hours after discharge, the patient had four episodes of diarrhea containing bright red blood and returned to the emergency department of this hospital. He reported abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant and fatigue. The temperature was 38.3C, and the abdomen was tender in the right lower quadrant. While the patient was in the emergency department, he had two bowel movements that were loose and melanotic. A stool culture, an assay for Shiga toxin, and examinations for ova and parasites were negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Pantoprazole was administered, and a series of hematocrit measurements showed minimal change. By the fourth hospital day, the melena had resolved and the abdominal pain had lessened, although diarrhea persisted. The patient was discharged home on the sixth hospital day. On the day of this admission, the patient was brought to the emergency department of this hospital by ambulance because of shortness of breath. He reported progressive fatigue and weakness that had persisted since the most recent hospitalization; on the day of this admission, he had been unable to get out of bed. Medications included aspirin, metoprolol, atorva-statin, cilostazol, budesonide, omeprazole, allo-purinol, sevelamer carbonate, several vitamins, darbepoetin alfa, tramadol, acetaminophen, and vancomycin. Adverse drug reactions included cough with lisinopril, edema with nifedipine, confusion with morphine and oxycodone, and rash with hydrochlorothiazide, felodipine, and clonidine. The patient had emigrated from Southeast Asia 22 years earlier and now lived in an urban area of New England with his wife and daughter. His family history was negative for gastrointestinal, renal, and immunodeficiency diseases. He drank alcohol rarely and did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs. On examination, the patient appeared thin and chronically ill. The temperature was 36.7C, the pulse 104 beats per minute, the blood pressure 114/65 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while he was breathing ambient air. Crackles were heard in the posterior lower lung fields on auscultation. The abdomen was mildly tender, and the legs were edematous. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Chest radiography revealed changes consistent with mild interstitial pulmonary edema, with small bilateral pleural effusions and a confluent opacity in the left lower lobe. Hemodialysis was performed. The shortness of breath resolved, but weakness and fatigue persisted. The patient was admitted to the hospital. A diagnosis was made.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Danielle M. Panelli Obstetrics and Gynecology: A 71-year-old woman with mul-lerian carcinoma was evaluated at this hospital during the fall because of fever, fatigue, and myalgias. The patient had been well until 1 year before this evaluation, when explosive diarrhea developed. Examination of biopsy specimens obtained during flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy revealed evidence of microscopic colitis. Predni-sone was administered, and the diarrhea resolved; after the prednisone therapy was tapered and then stopped, diarrhea recurred. Budesonide was prescribed. Three months before this evaluation, the patient was seen at a local gastroen-terology clinic. She had abdominal bloating and reported that reducing the dose of budesonide had been associated with recurrent diarrhea. She was following a lactose-free, gluten-free diet. On examination, the abdomen was distended and soft and had no masses. Budesonide was continued, and discontinuation of daily aspirin was recommended. Six weeks later and 6.5 weeks before this evaluation, the patient was seen by her primary care physician because of increased abdominal bloating, which was reported to be worse late in the day. She also reported that sexual intercourse had been difficult that week because her vagina seemed shorter. On examination, the abdomen was distended, with mild diffuse tenderness and slightly hyperactive bowel sounds. Results of a bimanual pelvic examination were normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anion gap, blood level of total bilirubin, and results of renal-function tests were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Four days later, imaging studies of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained. Dr. Kathryn P. Lowry: Computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed moderate ascites Fig. 1A and extensive peritoneal nodularity with omental caking Fig. 1B, findings consistent with peritoneal carcinomatosis. The ovaries were normal in size, and the uterus appeared enlarged Fig. 1C. Dr. Panelli: Seven days later and 5 weeks before this evaluation, the patient was seen in the gynecologic oncology clinic at another hospital. Results of coagulation tests were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Ultrasound-guided paracentesis was performed, and cytologic examination of an aspirate of peritoneal fluid revealed adenocarcinoma, a finding that is most consistent with high-grade serous carcinoma of a gynecologic origin. One week later and 4 weeks before this evaluation, the patient was seen in the gynecologic oncology surgery clinic at this hospital. She had a history of colitis, hypertension, type 1 second-degree atrioventricular block, the sick sinus syndrome, Sjogrens syndrome, Raynauds phenomenon, atopy, chronic upper-airway cough syndrome, osteopenia, vitamin B12 deficiency, and glaucoma and had undergone laparoscopy with salpingec-tomy for an ectopic pregnancy. Medications included oral budesonide, diltiazem, cetirizine, and probiotics and intramuscular cyanocobalamin. She had allergies to tetracyclines, sulfamethoxa-zole, and latex; atorvastatin had caused elevated serum aminotransferase levels. The patient lived with her husband in a rural area of New England; she typically traveled to coastal New England during the summer but had not done so during the preceding year. She did not have pets. There was no family history of cancer. On examination, the temperature was 37.3C, the pulse 99 beats per minute, the blood pressure 169/91 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 49.3 kg. The abdomen was distended, and a fluid wave was present. The vaginal mucosa was atrophic, the uterus was anteverted and mobile, and there were no cul-de-sac nodularities or adnexal masses. The anion gap and results of coagulation and renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of magnesium, globulin, and total bilirubin; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Three days later and 3.5 weeks before this evaluation, the patient underwent surgical exploration and cytoreduction for a presumptive diagnosis of mullerian adenocarcinoma. Clindamycin and gentamicin were administered preoperatively; phenylephrine, insulin, calcium chloride, fentanyl, hydromorphone, lactated Ringers solution, albumin, and 3 units of packed red cells were admin-istered during the procedure. Operative findings included approximately 2 liters of straw-colored ascitic fluid, tumor nodules in the splenic hilum and parenchyma and studding the right hemi-diaphragm, replacement of the gastrocolic omen-tum by tumor, and obliteration of the cul-de-sac by a large pelvic mass invading and partially obstructing the rectosigmoid colon. Gastrocolic omentectomy, splenectomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, resections of the pelvic mass and rectosigmoid colon with primary reanastomosis, and plasma energy vaporization of tumor nodules on the right hemidiaphragm were performed. Resection specimens were submitted for histopathological examination. Dr. Kristen M. Basnet: The primary resection specimen consisted of a 15.2-cm aggregate of large bowel, uterus, and adnexal structures that were firmly adherent one to another and contained a 15.0-cm irregular, firm, tan-white mass Fig. 2A. The cervix, the spleen, and portions of the omentum were submitted separately for examination. Microscopic examination revealed high-grade carcinoma in the ovaries, invading the muscularis propria of the large bowel Fig. 2B, and adjacent to the fallopian tubes Fig. 2C. The tumor was also seen adjacent to the uterine se-rosa and in the omentum, spleen, and mesentery of the transverse colon. The tumor was composed of nests and cords of pleomorphic cells with high mitotic activity Fig. 2D and had slit-like spaces and psammomatous calcifications Fig. 2E. On immunohistochemical staining, the tumor cells were positive for PAX8 Fig. 2F and negative for p53. The findings were consistent with high-grade carcinoma of mullerian origin. Mullerian carcinoma may most recognizably originate in a pelvic organ, such as the ovary, fallopian tube, or uterus, but it may also be found multifocally in the peritoneum without clear evidence of a particular site of origin, as was the case with this patient. Dr. Panelli: The patient had persistent hypoten-sion after surgery and was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit, where phenylephrine and mechanical ventilatory support were continued. A right pneumothorax was managed with chest-tube placement. On the first day after surgery, the trachea was extubated. The next day, phenyl-ephrine was discontinued, 2 units of packed red cells were transfused, and the patient was trans-ferred to the inpatient unit, where the chest tube was removed 1 day later. Quadrivalent meningo-coccal conjugate vaccine serogroups A, C, Y, and W, 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, and Haemophilus inf luenzae type b conjugate vaccine were administered. On the seventh day after surgery, the patient was discharged home. Three days after discharge and 16 days before this evaluation, the patient was seen in the gynecologic oncology surgery clinic at this hospital for follow-up. She was thought to be recovering well, and the staples were removed from her surgical incision. A plan was made to schedule chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin at the other hospital. Eighteen days after discharge and 1 day before this evaluation, the patient returned to the gynecologic oncology surgery clinic because of fatigue, anorexia, abdominal pain, bloating, and alternating constipation and diarrhea. She had not yet begun chemotherapy. She reported that abdominal pain and irregular bowel movements had been present since surgery and that the night before this presentation, she had tried medical marijuana, which she had obtained from a friend, as a treatment for pain before going to sleep. When she awoke 14 hours later, she felt drowsy and the abdominal pain persisted. Abdominal imaging was performed. Dr. Lowry: CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed postsurgical changes that had occurred since she had undergone the peritoneal cytoreduction, total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, splenectomy, and rectosigmoid colon resection. Ascites had decreased, and only trace residual perihepatic fluid was present Fig. 3A. No abscesses were identified. There was no evidence of obstruction or inflammatory changes of the bowel Fig. 3B, and the rectosigmoid anastomosis was unremarkable in appearance Fig. 3C. Dr. Panelli: The patient was admitted to the hospital. On admission, she reported feeling very tired. The temperature was 36.8C, the pulse 97 beats per minute, the blood pressure 154/85 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 29 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while she was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft and mildly distended, without tenderness. The anion gap and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of magnesium, globulin, and total bilirubin; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Intravenous normal saline and oral senna, docu-sate, and magnesium citrate were administered. By the second hospital day, the patient had had multiple bowel movements and the abdominal pain had decreased, but fatigue persisted and fever to a temperature of 39.2C, chills, myalgias, and subjective weakness developed. She underwent further evaluation. The pulse was 93 beats per minute, the blood pressure 138/64 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95 while she was breathing ambient air. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Additional studies were performed, and the laboratory called with critical information that led to a presumptive diagnosis.

Nicolas Gonzalez Castro Neurology: A 62-year-old man with sarcoidosis and heart disease was admitted to this hospital because of new-onset diplopia and weakness. The patient was in his usual health until approximately 2 weeks before admission, when nausea, dizziness, tinnitus, and unsteady gait developed; these symptoms were associated with subjective fevers. Five days before admission, a diagnosis of respiratory infection with inner-ear symptoms was made; the symptoms decreased transiently. Three days before admission, the patient awoke at 4 a.m. and noted diminished muscle control, which was more severe in the arms than in the legs, and shaking in the hands. Reaching for his eyeglasses required intense concentration and slowing of reaching movements. He had difficulty rising and was unable to walk. He was admitted to another hospital, where sequential examinations revealed fluctuating arm weakness and dysarthria, which sometimes lessened with repeated testing. The complete blood count, white-cell differential count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and C-reactive protein; results of tests of renal and liver function were also reportedly normal. A chest radiograph reportedly showed small, bilateral pleural effusions, with no consolidation or pneumothorax. Results of computed tomography CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, and CT angiography of the head and neck were reportedly normal. Cerebrospinal fluid CSF obtained by lumbar puncture contained 4 red cells and 188 white cells per cubic millimeter, with 88 lymphocytes, 5 segmented neutrophils, and 7 monocytes. Other test results were pending. Results of electromyography were reportedly normal. Antibiotic agents and prednisone were administered. During the hospitalization, horizontal diplopia developed, which disappeared when one eye was covered. On the third evening, sweats and chills occurred. The next day, he was transferred to this hospital. On admission, the patient reported diplopia, tremors that were more pronounced in his arms than in his legs and that worsened when he used those limbs, increased urinary frequency, night sweats, and chills, with no numbness, tingling, pain, headaches, neck stiffness, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or rashes. He had had worsening heart failure during the previous 4 years, and a diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis had been made 16 months before admission, after evaluation by positron-emission tomography PET and CT of the chest had revealed increased, high 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in lymph nodes of the chest and abdomen. Pathological examination of tissue obtained by means of medi-astinoscopy had reportedly revealed confluent, nonnecrotizing granulomas with extensive hyalin-ization; silver and acid-fast staining had shown no organisms. A 4-month course of prednisone was administered between 16 months and 12 months before this admission. Four months before this admission, a 4-month course of pred-nisone and methotrexate was begun and was completed shortly before the onset of symptoms. The patient also had hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease with stent placement, congestive heart failure, complete heart block, ventricular arrhythmias for which an automatic implantable cardioverterdefibrillator had been implanted, mild asthma associated with allergies which he had had since childhood, allergic rhinitis, and recent dental surgery, for which he had received unknown antibiotics for a period of 7 days. Medications were cholecalciferol, doxazosin, atorvas-tatin, sotalol, low-dose aspirin, folic acid, a multivitamin, fluticasone by inhalation, enoxaparin subcutaneously, and, as needed, ipratropium by inhalation and nitroglycerin sublingually. He had received that years seasonal influenza vaccine. He lived with his wife and worked in an office. He did not drink alcohol, smoke, or use illicit drugs. His mother was more than 90 years of age and had a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which was being treated with prednisone; his father had had a stroke, and his siblings were healthy. On examination, the patient was alert and oriented. The temperature was 36.2C, the blood pressure 93/53 mm Hg, the pulse 75 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93 while the patient was breathing ambient air. He had subtle deficits in episodic memory, including difficulty in recounting elements of his own recent medi-cal history. The pupils were round and reactive to light, constricting from 3 mm in diameter to 2 mm. Extraocular movements were full, without nystagmus or saccadic breakdown. He had horizontal diplopia in all directions, with mild ptosis of the right eyelid. Tremors of the cheeks occurred on smiling, and the patient was unable to puff out his cheeks. Other cranial-nerve examinations were normal; however, the first cranial nerve was not tested. Motor examination revealed myoclonus of the arms, with no fasciculation or cogwheel rigidity. Strength was rated 4 out of 5 in the fingers on the left hand with extension and was otherwise rated 5 out of 5. Light-touch sensation was preserved throughout. The deep-tendon reflexes were rated 1 and were symmetric at the triceps, biceps, brachioradialis, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, and soleus. Plantar responses were mute on both feet. There was prominent arm-shaking on finger-to-nose testing when the patients eyes were open; the shaking was less pronounced when his eyes were closed. Rapid alternating movements were normal, as were the results of heel-to-shin testing and mirroring testing. Gait and stance were not tested. Blood levels of troponin T were normal, as were results of urine analysis and renal function tests; other test results are shown in Table 1. Blood and urine cultures were obtained. One dose of cefepime was administered, followed by ceftri-axone, vancomycin, and ampicillin, and cardiac and bronchodilator medications. During the first hospital day, nausea and vomiting occurred, and the temperature rose to 38.8C. Sequential neurologic examinations initially revealed increased somnolence, decreased orientation and ability to be aroused, slow verbal responses with dysfluent speech, and no evidence of dysarthria or dysphagia. Diplopia, right-eyelid ptosis, and coarse omnidirectional nystagmus in the primary position i.e., when the patient was looking forward were present, with no nuchal rigidity. Cytologic examination of CSF obtained by means of lumbar puncture revealed an increased number of lymphocytes and background proteinaceous debris; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Grams staining of a sputum specimen showed no leukocytes, a moderate number of squamous epithelial cells, and mixed flora; sputum cultures grew very few enteric gram-negative rods, Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus, and normal flora. Blood and urine cultures remained sterile. The temperature rose to 40.1C. Acyclovir was added on the second hospital day. On the third hospital day, gluco-corticoids were begun for hypotension. On the fourth hospital day, hyponatremia and progressive generalized weakness occurred, and fevers continued. Dr. R. Gilberto Gonzalez: CT images of the head on the fourth hospital day, obtained before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, were normal for the patients age Fig. 1A. Dr. Gonzalez Castro: Indirect immunofluorescence testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies was negative. Portable electroencephalography revealed generalized rhythmic delta activity and bifrontal triphasic waves, with diffuse irregular deltatheta slowing. Lorazepam was administered, which resulted in improvement in generalized rhythmic delta activity but not in mental status. On the fifth hospital day, somnolence increased and mental status worsened. Cytologic examination of CSF obtained by means of a repeat lumbar puncture showed an increased number of lymphocytes with admixed neutrophils, macrophages, and occasional plasma cells, and no evidence of malignant cells; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Pressors for hypotension were administered intravenously; morphine sulfate and propofol were administered, the trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation begun. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. The next day, blood levels of thyrotropin, vitamin B12, folate, and cortisol were normal, as were results of liver function tests; testing for 1,3-beta-d-glucan was negative. Methylprednisolone and amiodarone were begun, and sotalol was stopped. Liposomal amphotericin was administered for 2 days. On the seventh hospital day, levetiracetam was begun. The next day, the level of N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide was 8227 pg per milliliter reference range, 0 to 900, and tropo-nin T levels remained low. On the ninth hospital day, another lumbar puncture was performed, and the CSF was analyzed Table 1. Later that evening, the pupils became nonreactive. Neuro-surgical consultation was obtained, and additional imaging studies were performed. Dr. Gonzalez: Contrast-enhanced CT of the head revealed new, extensive hypoattenuation in the periventricular and subcortical white matter, sulcal effacement, and marked expansion of the corpus callosum, which indicated brain swelling and edema. Leptomeningeal enhancement was also present Fig. 1B. Dr. Gonzalez Castro: Immune globulin was transfused. On the 10th hospital day, the pupils measured 6 mm in diameter and were nonreactive. The corneal reflexes were stronger in the right eye than in the left; there was very weak movement of the legs and no arm movement on stimulation. Mannitol was administered. An additional repeat brain imaging study was performed. Dr. Gonzalez: CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, showed interval progression of diffuse cerebral swelling, with new, diffuse hemispheric sulcal effacement and development of descending trans-tentorial herniation Fig. 1C. Dr. Gonzalez Castro: After consultation with the patients family, comfort measures were instituted, and the patient died later that day. An autopsy was performed.

The patient's brain imaging studies showed extensive hypoattenuation in the periventricular and subcortical white matter, sulcal effacement, and marked expansion of the corpus callosum, which is consistent with brain swelling and edema. The patient's clinical course, including progressive generalized weakness, hyponatremia, and worsening mental status, is consistent with a diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis. The patient's death was likely due to complications of neurosarcoidosis, such as brain herniation. The final diagnosis is neurosarcoidosis.",

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Kristyn M. Spera Neurology: A 53-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis was admitted to this hospital because of progressive asymmetric hypoesthesia and weakness in the legs. The patient had been in her usual health until 4 months before this admission, when hypoesthesia developed in the lateral aspect of the left foot. During the following 2 days, the hypoesthesia spread to involve the toes and midfoot. On evaluation by her primary care physician, the patient reported that her chronic low-back pain, which radiated to the buttocks, had increased in intensity, but there was no pain in the legs, fever, weight loss, or bowel or bladder changes. On neurologic examination, perception of light touch and pinprick was absent on the left toes and left forefoot; the remainder of the examination was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and blood levels of vitamin B12, glycated hemoglobin, and thyrotropin were normal. The patient was referred to the neurology clinic of this hospital for further evaluation. During the next 5 days, hypoesthesia progressed to involve the proximal portion of the left foot, as well as the ankle and the lateral lower leg. The patient was evaluated in the outpatient neurology clinic, where she reported gradual progression of hypoesthesia involving the left leg but no pain or bowel or bladder incontinence. She was alert, cooperative, and articulate; she appeared well and was afebrile. Results of cranial-nerve examinations were normal although the first cranial nerve was not tested. Strength was 4 out of 5 during flexion and extension of the toes on the left foot, dorsiflexion and plantar flexion of the left ankle, ever-sion and inversion of the left foot, and flexion of the left knee; otherwise, strength was 5 out of 5. Perception of vibration was markedly diminished at the left hallux. Perception of light touch and pinprick was decreased on the left foot and the left lateral leg. Deep-tendon reflexes of the arms and legs were normal. The plantar reflex was flexor on the right side and absent on the left side. The remainder of the examination was normal. The patient was referred for nerve-conduction studies. Dr. Michael P. Bowley: Seven days later 3 months before this admission, nerve-conduction studies were performed. The sensory and motor responses were normal and symmetric, and F-wave minimal latencies in the tibial nerves were normal. Hoffmans reflex or H reflex, which is the electro-physiological correlate of the Achilles deep-tendon reflex was absent at the left soleus and normal at the right soleus. Needle electromyography of the left leg showed diminished recruitment of long-duration, polyphasic motor-unit potentials in proximal and distal muscles of the L5 myotome. Results of electromyography of the right leg were normal. On the basis of these findings, imaging studies were obtained. Dr. William A. Mehan, Jr.: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the lumbar spine, performed with and without the administration of contrast material, revealed disk protrusions, hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum, and facet arthropa-thy, processes that resulted in neural foraminal narrowing that was moderate on the left side at the level of L4L5 and moderate to severe on both sides at the level of L5S1. Nerve roots between the L3 and S1 levels had a thickened and clumped appearance and showed enhancement on contrast-enhanced images Fig. 1. Distal to the dorsal-root ganglia, the peripheral nerves were symmetric and did not show enhancement. Dr. Spera: A lumbar puncture was performed for cerebrospinal fluid CSF analysis. Oligoclonal banding was not present in concentrated CSF. Cytologic studies of the CSF showed increased lymphocytes that were polymorphous and occasionally reactive and appeared to be benign. Im-munophenotypic evaluation of the CSF did not reveal evidence of a monoclonal B-cell or unusual T-cell population; other test results are shown in Table 1. A provisional diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy was made, and intravenous immune globulin was administered 4 weeks and 1 week before the patient was admitted to this hospital. Despite the administration of intravenous immune globulin, symptoms in the left leg did not improve, and hypoesthesia and weakness developed in the right leg and progressed centripetally. The patient had several falls at home and began to use a cane, then a walker, and ultimately a wheelchair. When the patient was no longer able to stand from a seated position, she presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. On evaluation in the emergency department, the patient reported episodes of bowel and bladder incontinence that she attributed to leg weakness interfering with her ability to walk to the bathroom quickly. She reported no fevers, weight loss, or night sweats. Rheumatoid arthritis had been diagnosed 18 months before this admission, and therapy with methotrexate and predni-sone had been initiated. Because of persistent disease activity, therapy with etanercept was initiated 7 months before this admission, after an interferon- release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis had been negative. On serial computed tomographic CT scans of the chest, there were subcentimeter pulmonary nodules in the bilateral lower lobes that had remained unchanged over a period of 4 years. The patient also had gastroesophageal reflux disease, uterine fibroids, and -thalassemia minor. Results of routine screening mammography performed 1 month before this admission were normal. Medications were omeprazole, methotrexate, prednisone, folic acid, gabapentin, and duloxetine. The patient had recently stopped taking etanercept, because she thought her progressive symptoms could be related to that medication. She resided in New England and worked in a health care environment in a nonclinical role. She had previously traveled to the southwestern United States. She was a current smoker with an 18-pack-year history of smoking, and she did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her sister had multiple sclerosis; there was no family history of cancer. On examination, the temperature was 36.3C, the blood pressure 168/78 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was breathing ambient air. Motor strength was 4 out of 5 in both legs and 4 out of 5 on both sides during hip flexion; the remainder of the motor examination was normal. Perception of vibration and temperature was markedly diminished in both legs from the toes to above the knees. Deep-tendon reflexes were 1 and symmetric at the patellae and were absent at the soleus. The plantar reflex was absent on both sides. The patient was unable to stand without assistance. Two firm, nontender subcutaneous nodules approximately 1 cm in diameter with overlying excoriations were present in the left submandibular area. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, C-reactive protein, and angiotensin-converting enzyme and results of kidney- and liver-function tests were normal. With the exception of the presence of a stable microcytic anemia, the complete blood count and white-cell differential count were normal. Blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus HIV type 1 p24 antigen, HIV type 1 and type 2 antibodies, and Treponema pallidum were negative. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Mehan: MRI of the spine was performed with and without the administration of contrast material Fig. 2A and 2B. Contrast-enhanced images showed diffuse, irregular, abnormal hyper-intensity in the spinal cord that extended from T10 inferiorly to the conus; there was probable mild expansion of the spinal cord, diffuse abnormal signal throughout the spinal canal, marked thickening and enhancement of the nerve roots, and severe mass effect on the conus. MRI of the head was also performed with and without the administration of contrast material Fig. 2C and 2D. Contrast-enhanced images and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images showed abnormal diffuse hyperintensity in the sulci of both hemispheres with no leptomeningeal enhancement; there were periventricular patchy, ill-defined foci of enhancement on both sides. CT of the chest revealed no clinically significant change in the previously identified pulmonary nodules and no lymphadenopathy. Dr. Bowley: Repeat nerve-conduction studies revealed asymmetric attenuation in the amplitudes of sensory and motor responses which was worse on the left side than on the right and no evidence of primary demyelination. Electromyography showed abnormal spontaneous activity in the bilateral thoracic paraspinal muscles at the level of T8 and in the bilateral gluteus maximus, tensor fasciae latae, lateral gastrocne-mius, and right tibialis anterior muscles. Diffusely diminished recruitment of normal-appearing motor-unit potentials was observed in all the muscles tested in both legs. Dr. Spera: Repeat lumbar puncture was performed, and CSF analysis revealed a protein level of 4620 mg per deciliter and a glucose level lower than 2 mg per deciliter 0.1 mmol per liter. There were abundant lymphocytes that were polymorphous, enlarged, reactive, and atypical and were of uncertain clinical significance. Im-munophenotypic evaluation of the CSF revealed B cells with indeterminate surface and cytoplasmic expression of kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains; other test results are shown in Table 1. Fine-needle aspiration of one of the submandibular nodules was performed but yielded insufficient material for pathological evaluation. Three induced-sputum samples were negative for acid-fast bacteria. Urinary retention, absence of rectal tone, and saddle anesthesia loss of sensation in the area of the buttocks and perineum developed. A diagnostic test was performed.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Katherine L. Tuttle Pediatrics: A 9-day-old girl was admitted to this hospital because of nonbilious vomiting, acidosis, and azotemia. The patient had been born at another hospital by induced vaginal delivery after 41 weeks 3 days of gestation. The pregnancy had been complicated by maternal obesity. The patient was placed with an adoptive family immediately after birth. Her birth mother had received prenatal care, and screening tests for gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis B virus had been negative; a screening test for immunity to rubella virus was positive, as was a screening test for group B streptococcal colonization. Spontaneous rupture of membranes, which occurred 2 hours before birth, revealed meconium-stained amniotic fluid, and five doses of penicillin were administered before delivery. The 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores were 8 and 9, respectively. At birth, the weight was 3.9 kg 87th percentile, the length 51.5 cm 80th percentile, and the head circumference 36.5 cm 85th percentile; the vital signs and physical examination were normal. A diet of organic cows milkbased infant formula with a probiotic was begun shortly after birth; the patient drank the formula avidly, and urine and stool output were normal for her age. The results of newborn blood-spot screening tests i.e., a panel of tests for multiple congenital diseases, primarily inborn errors of metabolism and screening tests for hearing ability and critical congenital heart disease were normal, and the patient received intramuscular vitamin K, erythromycin ophthalmic ointment, and a hepatitis B immunization before discharge. Five days before this admission, at a routine pediatric examination, the patients adoptive parents reported that she had been drinking 60 ml of formula every 3 to 4 hours, with some spit ups, and that she produced four yellow-brown stools each day. She appeared well, with mild jaundice, and was scheduled to return 10 days later for another routine appointment. One day before this admission, nonprojectile, nonbloody, nonbilious vomiting occurred after each feed. The baby was fussier and less active than usual and drank only 30 to 45 ml of formula per feed before falling asleep, as compared with the 90 to 105 ml per feed she had had the previous day. Her father called the pediatrician during the evening and was advised to take the baby to the emergency department at another hospital. On presentation to the other hospital, the patient was alert and responded appropriately to physical examination. The temperature was 37.8C, the pulse 120 beats per minute, the blood pressure 85/59 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 36 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while she was breathing ambient air. The weight was 3.5 kg. The anterior fontanelle was sunken; the remainder of the examination was normal. A lumbar puncture was performed. Samples of blood, urine, stool, and cerebrospinal fluid were obtained for culture. Tests for respiratory syncy-tial virus and rotavirus were negative. Blood levels of total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed orange urine, with a pH of 5.0, a specific gravity higher than 1.030, 3 protein, and 2 bilirubin. A chest radiograph was normal. Multiple attempts to place an intravenous catheter were unsuccessful; ampicillin and ceftriaxone were administered intramuscularly, and an enteral electrolyte solution was administered through a nasogastric tube and did not cause vomiting. Early during the following day, the patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit ICU at this hospital for further evaluation and treatment. The patient had lived with her adoptive family in an urban area of New England since birth. Her biologic half-brother had autism and eczema and had undergone placement of tympanostomy tubes. The patient had no known exposure to sick persons. On admission to this hospital, the results of physical examination were unchanged. A peripheral intravenous catheter was inserted, and a bolus of normal saline was administered, followed by a continuous infusion of 10 dextrose in water with 0.225 normal saline. The point-of-care blood glucose level was 84 mg per deciliter 4.7 mmol per liter; reference range, 60 to 100 mg per deciliter 3.3 to 5.6 mmol per liter. Ampicillin and cefepime were administered intravenously. Tests for respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumo-virus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza viruses were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was fed a cows milkbased formula, and vomiting recurred. Enteral feeding was stopped, the administration of intravenous fluid was continued, and vomiting ceased. The next day, the physical examination was normal. The results of an acylcarnitine profile analysis were normal, as were the results of blood amino acid analysis, with the exception of an alanine level of 582 nmol per milliliter reference range, 139 to 474. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed clear, yellow urine, with a pH of 6.0, a specific gravity of 1.008, and 1 glucose. An electrocardiogram was normal. Dr. Rene Balza: An upper gastrointestinal series showed severe spontaneous gastroesophageal reflux; there was no evidence of intestinal malrota-tion. Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder revealed mild pyelectasis in the left kidney and was otherwise normal; limited abdominal ultra-sonography revealed no evidence of pyloric ste-nosis. Dr. Tuttle: The cultures of blood, urine, stool, and cerebrospinal fluid that had been performed at the other hospital remained negative, and am-picillin and cefepime were discontinued. Oral administration of an electrolyte solution was begun and did not cause vomiting. On the third hospital day, the patient was transferred to the pediatric unit. Her home diet of an organic cows milkbased formula with a probiotic was resumed. Overnight, she vomited once, approximately 2 hours after a feed. Vomiting after feeds continued during the next day. A diet of an oral electrolyte solution was resumed, and vomiting ceased. On the fifth hospital day, oral administration of an amino acidbased formula was begun and did not cause vomiting. The results of repeat newborn blood-spot screening tests were reported as normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Over the next 2 days, the patient continued to receive the amino acidbased formula without vomiting; the administration of intravenous fluid was stopped. Laboratory test results obtained on the sixth and seventh hospital days are shown in Table 1. The patient was discharged home on the seventh hospital day, at which time the weight was 3.4 kg. Three days after discharge, the patient was seen for follow-up by her pediatrician. Her parents reported that she had had five episodes of spitting up during the previous 24 hours, that she had appeared tired and pale, and that her oral intake had decreased, such that she had consumed only 5 to 25 ml of the amino acidbased formula per feed that day. She was also producing frequent loose, small-volume, greenish stools 10 in a 24-hour period; during the bowel movements, borborygmi were audible and the patient arched her back. On examination, the patient appeared pale and sleepy but aroused during the examination. The temperature was 37.3C, the pulse 132 beats per minute, and the weight 3.0 kg. The anterior fon-tanelle was sunken, the lips were dry, skin turgor was decreased, and the capillary refill time was between 2 and 3 seconds. The patient vomited once in the clinic. The point-of-care blood glucose level was 98 mg per deciliter 5.4 mmol per liter. The patient was fed an oral electrolyte solution and then was referred to the emergency department of this hospital. On arrival at the emergency department, the patient was lethargic and her skin appeared ashen; she cried weakly and without tears. The temperature was 37.8C, the pulse 166 beats per minute, the blood pressure 73/50 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 58 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while she was breathing ambient air. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Samples of blood and stool were obtained for culture. Blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed clear, yellow urine, with a pH of 6.0, a specific gravity of 1.030, and 2 protein by dipstick; on microscopic examination, there were 0 to 2 red cells per high-power field, 5 to 10 white cells per high-power field, and 5 to 10 hyaline casts per low-power field. The patient was admitted to the pediatric ICU. A bolus of normal saline was administered intravenously, followed by a continuous infusion of 5 dextrose with sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride. The patient received an oral electrolyte solution without vomiting. Dr. Balza: The next day, a central venous cath-eter was placed; abdominal radiography, which was performed to assess its position, revealed an abnormal bowel-gas pattern with narrowing of the lumen and separation of the bowel loops, findings suggestive of bowel-wall thickening or asci-tes Fig. 1A. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed fluid-filled bowel loops with thickened walls measuring up to 3 mm in thickness, as well as a small amount of associated free intraperitoneal fluid in the right half of the abdomen Fig. 1B and 1C. Dr. Tuttle: Stools continued to be loose and were guaiac-positive. Enteral feeds were discontinued, and the administration of total parenteral nutrition was initiated. Pantoprazole, ampicillin, cefepime, and metronidazole were administered intravenously. Over the next 2 weeks, additional diagnostic studies were performed, and a diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ",

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Timothy W. Churchill: A 53-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of shock and recurrent ventricular tachycardia after defibrillator placement for non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 4 weeks before this admission, when he was on vacation in the Caribbean and his wife noted that he was unresponsive, gurgling, and diaphoretic in the early morning. When he awoke, he reported chest pain, palpitations, and light-headedness. The patient was taken by ambulance to a local hospital, where the heart rate was 65 beats per minute, the blood pressure 100/56 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100 while he was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The troponin T level was 1.56 ng per milliliter normal range, 0.01, and the lactate level was 1.9 mmol per liter 17 mg per deciliter; normal range, 0.5 to 1.6 mmol per liter 5 to 14 mg per deciliter. A complete blood count and levels of electrolytes, magnesium, calcium, and amylase were normal, as were results of tests of renal and thyroid function; a d-dimer level was undetectable. While the patient was in the local hospital, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia developed at a heart rate of 201 beats per minute; electrocardioversion resulted in restoration of sinus rhythm. Aspirin, clopidogrel, enoxaparin, rosuvastatin, amiodarone, and tirofiban were administered. The patient was transferred by air to a hospital in Florida. On examination at the second hospital, the temperature was 36.8C, the heart rate 57 beats per minute, the blood pressure 122/90 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood troponin I level was 116.00 ng per milliliter normal range, 0.05. A complete blood count, results of renal-function tests, levels of electrolytes and thyrotropin, and the prothrombin and partial-thrombo-plastin times were normal. An electrocardiogram Fig. 1A showed sinus bradycardia, a ventricular ectopic beat, first-degree atrioventricular delay, and delayed intraventricular conduction. Aspirin, amiodarone, enoxaparin, and atorvastatin were administered. Ventricular tachycardia recurred at a heart rate of 176 beats per minute. Despite the administration of an intravenous bolus of amiodarone, ventricular tachycardia persisted. Electrocardioversion restored sinus rhythm. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and cardiac studies were performed. Coronary angiography revealed no evidence of obstructive coronary disease. On ventriculogra-phy, the left ventricle was mildly and diffusely hypokinetic, and the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 22 mm Hg normal range, 8 to 15. Transthoracic echocardiography Fig. 1B revealed a dilated left ventricle with an end-diastolic dimension of 60 mm normal range, 42 to 58 and an ejection fraction of 35 normal range, 55 to 70; there was diffuse hypokinesis that was most notable in the inferior and septal territories, mildly increased wall thickness, and mild mitral regurgitation see Video 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Dr. Churchill: Additional laboratory test results included negative nucleic acid amplification tests of the blood for DNA of adenovirus, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, cytomegalovirus, enterovirus, and My-coplasma pneumoniae, as well as negative nucleic acid amplification tests of a nasopharyngeal swab for DNA of Bordetella pertussis, coronavirus, influenza, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus. In addition, serologic testing was negative for antibodies to coxsackievirus, human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, Lyme disease, and Trypano-soma cruzi, as well as for IgM antibodies to cyto-megalovirus, EpsteinBarr virus viral capsid antigen, and parvovirus. Aspirin, metoprolol succinate, and amiodarone were prescribed, and the patient was discharged with a wearable defibrillator vest after a follow-up visit had been scheduled at this hospital. Ten days before this admission, the patient had consultations at this hospital with a cardiologist specializing in the management of heart failure and an electrophysiologist. Vital signs were notable for a heart rate of 49 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 108/70 mm Hg; the examination was otherwise normal. An electrocardiogram Fig. 2A showed sinus bradycar-dia and first-degree atrioventricular delay, as well as right bundle-branch block and a left anterior fascicular block which together constitute bifas-cicular block. Aspirin was stopped, spironolac-tone was added, and placement of an implantable cardioverterdefibrillator ICD was scheduled. On the morning of this admission, during placement of a dual-chamber ICD, episodes of ventricular tachycardia with varying foci were induced. These episodes were terminated with overdrive pacing. After the procedure, ventricular tachycardia developed, with a heart rate of 108 beats per minute Fig. 2B. The blood pressure was 88/53 mm Hg, and a lidocaine infusion was administered. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. During the next 10 hours, multiple additional episodes of monomorphic ventricular rhythms occurred, with the heart rate ranging from 90 to 140 beats per minute. The rate of lidocaine infusion was increased, and amiodarone was administered. Early in the morning of the second hospital day, ventricular tachycardia recurred, with associated dyspnea and a blood pressure of 66/40 mm Hg. Normal saline and norepinephrine were administered intravenously. Chest radiography revealed ICD leads in the appropriate position, and bedside echocardiography revealed no evidence of peri-cardial effusion. The ventricular tachycardia was terminated with antitachycardic pacing, and the ICD was reprogrammed to provide atrial pacing at a rate of 110 beats per minute. The patient was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit ICU. A review of systems was notable for intermittent episodes of dyspnea. He had no dizziness, orthopnea, edema, or chest pain. He had a history of a kidney stone. Medications on admission to the cardiac ICU were metoprolol succi-nate, amiodarone, and spironolactone; he had no known allergies to medications. There was no family history of coronary artery disease, cardio-myopathy, heart failure, dysrhythmia, sudden death, or autoimmune disease. The patient was employed as a corporate executive. He had traveled extensively, including trips to urban areas in Mexico and Brazil during the previous 6 months. Three months before this admission, during a trip to Mexico, diarrhea had developed and spontaneously resolved after 2 weeks. He had two healthy adult children. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit substances. On examination in the cardiac ICU, the temperature was 36.8C, the heart rate 91 beats per minute, the blood pressure 102/56 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 94 while the patient was breathing ambient air. He appeared to be comfortable and was conversant. The jugular venous pulse was 8 cm of water. The site of ICD placement in the left deltopectoral groove was slightly tender. Auscultation revealed a soft apical systolic murmur and a third heart sound, as well as scattered crackles in the lungs. The arms and legs were warm and had no edema. He had no rashes or lymphadenopathy. The rest of the examination was normal. Results of blood tests of liver and thyroid function, tests for antinuclear antibodies, and serum protein electrophoresis were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram showed a wide QRS complex QRS duration, 240 msec at a heart rate of 100 beats per minute, with a rightward axis. A trans-thoracic echocardiogram Fig. 2C showed a dilated left ventricle with an end-diastolic dimension of 62 mm and an ejection fraction of 25; there was diffuse dysfunction that was most notable in the anterior, septal, and inferior territories, as well as some thinning of the basal interventricular septum to 7 mm. In addition, there was mild hypokinesis of the right ventricle, biatrial enlargement, moderate mitral regurgitation, and mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation see Video 4, available at NEJM.org. During the second hospital day, ventricular tachycardia persisted despite the administration of lidocaine and amiodarone; an infusion of esmolol was begun. Diagnostic tests were performed.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Jaime L. Schneider Medicine: A 64-year-old man was admitted to this hospital with a 2-week history of fever, chills, arthralgias, abdominal and testicular pain, and leukocytosis. Twenty-five years before the current admission, while the patient was living in China, he received a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. At that time, he completed a 14-month course of a four-drug regimen for tuberculosis with unknown medications. Although the treatment was completed, a chronic cough that produced scant white sputum persisted. Two years later, the patient immigrated to the United States, and examination of an induced sputum sample for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was reportedly negative. The patient also had a history of hepatitis B virus HBV infection; 12 years before the current admission, he had a positive test for HBV surface antigen. At that time, a nucleic acid amplification test for HBV DNA was negative. Thereafter, annual surveillance for cancer was performed with abdominal ultrasonography and measurement of the blood alpha-fetoprotein level. An elevated alpha-fetopro-tein level was never detected. Ultrasonography was notable for the presence of simple hepatic and renal cysts and heterogeneous hepatic echotexture, but followup examination with magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the liver revealed no signal abnormality. Three years before the current admission, the patient was evaluated for chronic cough. Radiography of the chest revealed a nodular opacity at the apex of the right lung. Follow-up examination with computed tomography CT of the chest revealed a calcified granuloma at the right apex and evidence of bronchiectasis, and plans were made for annual surveillance with CT. Fourteen days before the current admission, anorexia and fatigue developed, along with pain and tightness in the back and calves. Six days later, the patient was seen by his primary care physician at this hospital. He reported no antecedent trauma. The temperature was 37.0C. There was tenderness in the bilateral lumbar paraspinal muscles. Results of a neurologic examination  including tests of mo-tor strength, sensation, reflexes, coordination, and gait  were normal. Radiography of the lumbar spine revealed multilevel degenerative disk disease that was most pronounced at the L4 to L5 level, with preserved vertebral-body height. Ibuprofen was prescribed. Later that day, the temperature reached 38.9C. Fever, chills, sweats, and rigors persisted and were associated with myalgias of the back and calves that were severe enough to impair walking. Ibuprofen provided only temporary relief of the fever and myalgias. The patient visited a traditional Chinese doctor, who performed mox-ibustion i.e., the application of burning dried mugwort directly to the body and administered a cathartic agent, which had no effect. Left testicular pain and swelling developed, and the patient returned to his primary care physician 5 days after the previous visit. He reported no dysuria, hematuria, lymphadenopathy, headache, nuchal rigidity, or rash. The examination was notable for a temperature of 37.8C shortly after the administration of ibuprofen, the presence of moxi-bustion marks on the upper back, and a swollen, tender area on the upper lateral aspect of the left testicle. Screening tests for Lyme disease and nucleic acid amplification tests for babesia, ehrlichia, and anaplasma DNA were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood and urine cultures and imaging studies were performed. Dr. Aoife Kilcoyne: On ultrasonography of the scrotum, both testes had normal echotexture and normal Doppler flow, with no focal lesions. Bilateral subcentimeter epididymal cysts were identified. Radiography of the chest revealed a nodular opacity at the apex of the right lung, which had not changed from previous studies and was most likely related to previous granulo-matous disease. There were new ill-defined opacities at the lung bases that, in the appropriate clinical context, could reflect multifocal pneumonia. Dr. Schneider: A 7-day course of levofloxacin was prescribed. Fever recurred with a temperature of up to 39.0C and was associated with chills, rigors, anorexia, myalgias, and arthralgias. These symptoms persisted for the next 3 days, and the myalgias and arthralgias appeared to worsen when the temperature was highest. The patient also had intermittent sharp abdominal pain, two episodes of nonbloody diarrhea, and a weight loss of 1 kg. His primary care physician referred him to the emergency department of this hospital. Additional patient history was obtained in the emergency department. The patient reported brief, sharp, stabbing chest pain that was not related to exertion, as well as a chronic cough that produced thin, white sputum. He also noted that blurry vision had developed in the left eye 2 days earlier, with no vision loss. He had pruritus and tinea cruris. A review of systems was negative for headache, jaw claudication, other rashes, and joint pain. No sick contacts were reported. Medications included levofloxacin, aspirin, nystatin powder, and triamcinolone cream. The use of tamsulosin had caused nasal discharge. The patient had smoked a half pack of cigarettes per day for more than 40 years, but he did not use illicit drugs. He drank one glass of wine per night, although he had previously consumed up to two drinks of whiskey daily. The patient had retired from restaurant work 2 years earlier, and his last international trip had been to China 3 years earlier. His father died from lung cancer at 71 years of age, and his mother died at 39 years of age from an unknown cause. The patient had six siblings, a son who had a hemangioma, and a daughter who had an irregular heartbeat. There was no family history of pulmonary, ocular, infectious, or rheumatologic diseases. On examination, the temperature was 37.8C and then rose to 38.3C, the blood pressure 126/64 mm Hg, the heart rate 74 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was awake and alert, and he appeared somewhat fatigued. The eyes had no scleral icterus, and the oropharynx had no erythema, exudates, or ulcerations. The neck was supple, with a normal range of motion, and the spine and paraspinal muscles were non-tender. There was no cervical or axillary lymph-adenopathy. Auscultation revealed faint rales at the lung bases and scattered bilateral rhonchi and wheezes, with no cardiac murmur or rub. The bowel sounds were normal, and the abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, with no rebound, guarding, or hepatosplenomegaly. There was no rash, joint deformity, erythema, warmth, swelling, effusion, or tenderness. The joints had full range of motion. The stool was guaiac-negative. Motor strength was normal and symmetric in the arms and legs, and distal pulses were intact. The levels of troponin T, creatine kinase, lipase, lactate dehydrogenase, prostate-specific antigen, and thyrotropin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cultures of urine and blood were performed. A respiratory viral panel was negative for adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and metapneu-movirus. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with premature atrial beats and was otherwise normal. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Kilcoyne: Radiography of the chest revealed persistent opacities at the lung bases and right apex. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed mildly increased enhancement of the gallbladder wall, as well as pericholecystic fluid. These findings are nonspecific; in the absence of gallstones, they could occur in the context of volume overload or as manifestations of a systemic condition, such as chronic liver disease. Scattered subcentimeter hypodensities were present in the liver that most likely represented simple cysts. Bilateral small pleural effusions and trace peritoneal fluid were present. Ultraso-nography of the right upper quadrant revealed thickening of the gallbladder wall, along with gallbladder sludge. Sonographic Murphys sign was negative. Dr. Schneider: The patient was admitted to the hospital. Levofloxacin was discontinued, and acetaminophen and one dose of doxycycline were administered. Over the next 6 days, the patient remained febrile, with a temperature ranging from 38.1 to 39.6C. Additional tests were performed Table 2. Hepatobiliary radionuclide scanning revealed patent cystic and common bile ducts, with no evidence of acute cholecystitis. Ophthalmologic evaluation revealed only mild cataracts and dry eyes, with no evidence of an eye infection or retinopathy. Dr. Kilcoyne: Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, performed on the fifth hospital day, revealed bilateral pleural effusions that were larger than they had been on the day of admission. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine revealed no evidence of diskitis, osteomyelitis, or epidural abscesses. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the liver revealed scattered sub-centimeter simple hepatic cysts. Thoracentesis was performed on the right side with the use of ultrasonographic guidance. Dr. Schneider: The pleural fluid was consistent with a transudative effusion. A test of the pleural fluid for adenosine deaminase was negative, as was a Grams stain and an acid-fast smear; cultures for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi were performed. Cytologic examination of the urine, which was performed because of the history of smoking and microscopic hematuria, revealed no malignant cells. Transthoracic echocardiography and transesophageal echocardiography revealed no valvular vegetation. On the seventh hospital day, swelling, pain, and tenderness recurred in the left scrotum. The temperature reached 40.1C. Urinalysis revealed 2 blood and 10 to 20 red cells per high-power field. Dr. Kilcoyne: Follow-up ultrasonography of the scrotum Fig. 1, performed 10 days after the first ultrasound study had been obtained, revealed new engorgement of testicular vessels that was greater on the left side than on the right side. Both testes were heterogeneous in echotexture. The findings were suggestive of epididymo-orchitis. Dr. Schneider: Ceftriaxone was administered, and additional diagnostic tests were performed.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Joshua A. Cohen Medicine: A 57-year-old man presented to this hospital with confusion, cough, fever, and unintentional weight loss. The patient had been in his usual state of health until approximately 7 weeks before this presentation, when malaise and anorexia developed. Four weeks later, a nonproductive cough developed, along with fevers to a maximum temperature of 37.6C, and the patient sought medical attention at another hospital. A chest radiograph showed an opacity in the left lower lobe Fig. 1A. In addition, computed tomography CT of the chest, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed consolidation in the left lower lobe. The patient was admitted to the other hospital, and intravenous cefdinir and azithromycin were administered initially. The next day, treatment was switched to oral levofloxacin. After the patient had received levofloxacin for 6 days, he was discharged home. One day after discharge, fever and cough persisted and the patient was readmitted to the other hospital. A sputum culture was obtained. Treatment with levofloxacin was stopped, and intravenous piperacillintazobactam and vancomycin were administered. After 2 days of parenteral therapy, the patient had some symptom relief; piperacillintazobactam and vancomycin were discontinued, and amoxicillin clavulanic acid was administered. The patient was discharged home with a plan to complete a 10-day course of antibacterial therapy. Fatigue, cough, and malaise continued. Night sweats and fevers to a maximum temperature of 37.8C occurred daily, anorexia worsened, and weakness developed, such that the patient could not walk without assistance. Ten days after the second discharge 2 days before this presentation, the patients wife noted that the patient was incoherent, disoriented, angry, and belligerent, and she found him urinating inappropriately around their home. On the evening of presentation, she found him showering while clothed. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was taken to the other hospital. On the patients presentation to that hospital, the temperature was 38.3C, the heart rate 111 beats per minute, the blood pressure 135/73 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94 while he was breathing ambient air. He was confused and unable to answer questions appropriately. Laboratory test results were notable for a tropo-nin I level of 13.4 ng per milliliter reference range, 0.04, a lactate level of 2.4 mmol per liter 22 mg per deciliter reference range, 0.4 to 2.0 mmol per liter; 6 to 18 mg per deciliter, and a white-cell count of 21,800 per cubic millimeter reference range, 4500 to 10,500. Blood cultures were obtained. Electrocardiography reportedly revealed sinus tachycardia, premature atrial beats, and submillimeter inferior ST-segment elevations. Because the patient had tachy-pnea and increased somnolence, the trachea was intubated and mechanical ventilation initiated. Intravenous vancomycin, piperacillintazobactam, ciprofloxacin, lorazepam, and propofol were administered, and the patient was transferred by helicopter to the emergency department of this hospital for consideration of coronary angiography. On the patients arrival at this hospital, a limited history was obtained from his wife. There was no report of chest pain, dyspnea, edema, or symptoms of arrhythmia. He had a history of eczema. He took no medications and had no known ad-verse reactions to medications, but he had a history of anaphylaxis to bee stings. The patient smoked cigarettes and had smoked 1 pack daily for the past 41 years; he also drank 8 to 10 beers per night, occasionally along with 2 to 3 glasses of wine, and smoked marijuana daily. He was a farmer, and he restored farmhouses and cleaned horse stables. He owned sheep and goats and had previously owned exotic birds. There was a family history of cancer; his sister had died of breast cancer at 42 years of age, and his father had died of an unknown cancer when he was in his 40s. The temperature was 37.2C, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/82 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was receiving mechanical ventilation at a rate of 18 breaths per minute, with a tidal volume of 500 ml, a positive end-expira-tory pressure of 8 cm of water, and a fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.80. The pupils were 2 mm in diameter and sluggishly reactive. When the level of sedation was reduced, the patient opened his eyes and grimaced spontaneously but did not follow commands. He did not blink in response to threat or withdraw from noxious stimuli. The corneal reflexes were intact. The toes were down-going bilaterally. There was no rash. The rest of the examination was normal. Blood levels of phosphorus, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, globulin, lipase, glycated hemoglobin, and thyrotropin and the activated partial-thromboplastin time were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A serum test was negative for acetaminophen, ethanol, tricyclic antidepressants, and salicylates, but urine toxicology screening was positive for cannabi-noids. Cultures of the blood, urine, and sputum were obtained. Nucleic-acid testing of a naso-pharyngeal swab was negative for influenza virus types A and B and respiratory syncytial virus. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 99 beats per minute, with 1-mm concave ST-segment elevations and PR-segment depressions in leads 2, 3, and aVF; a subtle PR-segment elevation in lead aVR; and submillimeter upsloping ST-segment depressions in lateral and anterior leads Fig. 1B. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Melissa C. Price: A chest radiograph showed a persistent patchy opacity in the left lower lobe Fig. 2A, without evidence of pulmonary edema or pleural effusions. CT of the head, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed subtle hypoattenuation and loss of differentiation between gray and white matter in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery, findings that raised concerns about an acute-to-subacute infarct; there was no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the intravenous and oral administration of contrast material, revealed consolidation in the left lower lobe Fig. 2B, which had progressed since CT was last performed, 4 weeks earlier at the other hospital. Changes consistent with segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli were present in the right lower lobe, without evidence of strain on the right side of the heart. A wedge-shaped subpleural consolidation in the right lower lobe Fig. 2C was consistent with a pulmonary infarct. There were new bilateral small pleural effusions. Multiple splenic and renal wedge-shaped hypoattenuating lesions were consistent with infarcts Fig. 2D. Dr. Cohen: While the patient was in the emergency department, a 23-second episode of ventricular tachycardia occurred. Aspirin was administered rectally and magnesium and cefepime intravenously; infusions of propofol, normal sa-line, and amiodarone were also administered. Cardiac catheterization was considered but deferred. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Price: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI and magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck revealed numerous bilateral acute-to-subacute cerebral infarcts Fig. 2E and punctate infarcts scattered throughout the cerebellar hemispheres. A few scattered punctate foci of susceptibility artifact raised concerns about micro-hemorrhages. Time-of-flight imaging revealed a linear susceptibility signal in the distal branches of the superior division of the left middle cerebral artery and loss of flow-related enhancement in the left superior middle cerebral artery, findings suggestive of thrombosis. Transthoracic echocardiography TTE was performed. Dr. Danita Y. Sanborn: TTE revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35, with diffuse hypokinesis that was most prominent in the inferior territory. On studies obtained after the administration of agitated saline, there was no evidence of a patent foramen ovale. The mitral-valve leaflets were focally thickened, with mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation. A small circumferential pericardial effusion was present Fig. 3A. Dr. Cohen: Tests were negative for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin IgM and IgG antibodies, 2-glycoprotein IgM and IgG antibodies, anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, and antirheumatoid factor antibody; a test for anti-neutrophil antibody was positive at titers of 1:40 and 1:160, with a homogeneous pattern. Intravenous vancomycin and thiamine and enteral doxy-cycline, atorvastatin, omeprazole, and metoprolol were administered. On the second day, the temperature was 38.4C and repeat cultures of the blood, urine, and sputum were obtained. Tests were negative for anti-Ro SSA, anti-La SSB, and antiJo-1 antibodies, as well as IgM and IgG antibodies to brucella and coxiella the agent causing Q fever and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody. Ultra-sonography of the arms and legs was negative for a thrombus. Bronchoscopy with bronchoal-veolar lavage BAL revealed blood-tinged secretions in multiple airway segments. Gram staining of the BAL fluid revealed no leukocytes or organisms. Fungal wet preparation and acid-fast stains of the BAL fluid were negative, as was staining for Pneumocystis jiroveci and nucleic-acid testing for influenza virus types A and B and respiratory syncytial virus. In addition, direct fluorescence antibody testing of the BAL fluid was negative for adenovirus, human metapneumo-virus, and parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3. A diagnostic test was performed.

Niccum Medicine: A 64-year-old man was admitted to this hospital in the spring because of acute renal failure. The patient had been generally well until 4.5 months before this admission, when fevers, malaise, mild cough, and pain in the left flank developed. He was evaluated at an outside urgent care clinic, where chest radiography was reportedly normal. A clinical diagnosis of sinusitis was made, and amoxicillinclavulanic acid was prescribed. When symptoms did not abate, doxycycline was prescribed. The flank pain was attributed to muscular strain, and a short course of prednisone and cyclobenzaprine was administered. Four months before this admission, a fever with a temperature of up to 38.9C and worsening cough developed. The patient was evaluated in an urgent care clinic at this hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.6C, the heart rate 58 beats per minute, the blood pressure 125/71 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98 while he was breathing ambient air. Auscultation of the lungs revealed crackles in the left lower lung field; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Chest radiography revealed faint air-space opacities in the left lower lobe and left perihilar region, and amoxicillinclavulanic acid was prescribed for empirical treatment of pneumonia. Dr. Victorine V. Muse: Two months before this admission, repeat chest radiography revealed persistence of the air-space opacity in the left perihilar region. Three weeks later, computed tomography CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. Because of a known allergy to intravenous contrast material, prednisone and diphenhydramine were administered prophylactically. The images showed centrilobular nodules and patchy opacities in both lung bases, as well as mediastinal and left hilar lymph-adenopathy Fig. 1A and 1B. Dr. Niccum: Two days later, early satiety, nausea, and nonbloody diarrhea developed, along with orthopnea, edema in the legs, abdominal distention, decreased urine output, and weight gain. Symptoms progressed during the subsequent 3 weeks. Routine laboratory testing revealed a creatinine level of 5.78 mg per deciliter 511 mmol per liter normal range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter 53 to 133 mmol per liter and a blood urea nitrogen level of 80 mg per deciliter 29 mmol per liter normal range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter 3 to 9 mmol per liter. The patient was referred to the emergency department at this hospital for management of acute renal failure. The patient had a history of congenital aortic stenosis due to a subaortic membrane, hypertro-phic cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, complete heart block, ascending aortic aneurysm with severe aortic insufficiency, diverticulosis, and gout. He had undergone a subaortic membrane resection when he was 10 years of age and an open revision surgery with aortic-valve repair and septal myomectomy when he was 50 years of age. When he was 52 years of age, a permanent pacemaker was placed after complete heart block had developed. He had undergone pulmonary-vein isolation when he was 58 years of age. Medications were rivaroxaban, sotalol, eplerenone, furosemide, simvastatin, potassium chloride, allo-purinol, and ibuprofen. Known medication allergies included intravenous iodinated contrast material, which caused hives. The patient lived with his wife in a suburban community in New England and had recently retired from a career in the information technology industry. He had traveled to Ventura County in California the preceding autumn, as well as to Europe and to the southeastern United States several years earlier. He had a 20-pack-year history of cigarette smoking and had quit smoking 9 years earlier. He drank alcohol socially and had never used illicit drugs. His mother had congestive heart failure and his father had peripheral vascular disease. His nephew had a thoracic aortic aneurysm, and his brother had died from a ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysm. On examination, the patient appeared well and was not in acute distress. The temperature was 36.5°C, the pulse 60 beats per minute, the blood pressure 135//60 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while he was breathing ambient air. The heart sounds were regular, and a systolic murmur (2/6) was present at the right upper sternal border. There was edema in the legs. The remainder of the examination was normal; specifically, there were no ulcerations noted on the skin or oropharynx, and he had no rashes. Urinalysis revealed 3+ blood and 2+ protein, and microscopic examination of the sediment revealed 10 to 20 red cells per high-power field, including acanthocytes. Results of kidney function tests were unchanged from those obtained earlier that day; results of additional laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder revealed echogenic kidneys but no evidence of hydronephrosis. Intravenous methylprednisolone was initiated empirically for the treatment of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, and the patient was admitted to this hospital. The next day, additional laboratory test results were received. Tests for hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis C antibody, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen, and antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2 were negative. An assay for antinuclear antibodies was positive at 1:40 with a speckled pattern; cryoglobulins and antibodies to the Goodpasture antigen were not detected. Blood levels of C3 and C4 were normal. Urine tests for Bence Jones protein were negative, and results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal. A test for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) was positive, with a perinuclear staining pattern, and an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay confirmed the presence of myeloperoxidase ANCA at a titer of 743 U (reference range, <2.8). Oral cyclophosphamide therapy was begun. On hospital day 3, a central venous catheter was placed, and therapeutic plasma exchange was initiated; intravenous methylprednisolone treatment was discontinued, and administration of high-dose oral prednisone was begun. On hospital day 6, intravenous rituximab was administered. On hospital day 7, intermittent hemodialysis was initiated owing to persistent uremia and acidosis. On hospital day 14, a fever with a temperature of up to 38.4°C developed, along with a mild cough and sore throat. Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.010 and 2+ bacteria; nitrites and leukocyte esterase were not detected. On hospital day 16, the urine culture grew abundant Enterobacter cloacae, and intravenous cefepime treatment was initiated. After seven sessions of therapeutic plasma exchange and administration of two rituximab infusions, the patient was discharged home. Prednisone (40 mg daily), cyclophosphamide, and ciprofloxacin were prescribed. After discharge, a fever with a temperature of up to 38.9°C persisted, as did fatigue, malaise, and watery diarrhea. The patient also reported the development of painful oral ulcers. Two days after discharge, dyspnea on exertion developed, along with productive cough, and the patient returned to the emergency department at this hospital. On arrival, the patient appeared ill and in respiratory distress. The temperature was 36.1°C, the pulse 104 beats per minute, the blood pressure 140//70 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 54 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. Examination revealed numerous shallow ulcerations on the tongue and lips, diffuse wheezing with inspiratory crackles, and marked edema in the legs; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cytomegalovirus DNA was detected in the blood (4680 international units [IU] per milliliter). Blood samples were obtained for culture. The patient was readmitted to this hospital. Dr. Muse: Radiography of the chest revealed pulmonary interstitial edema with patchy opacities in the left retrocardiac region. CT of the chest revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities with intralobular septal thickening and worsening mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy (Fig. 1C and 1D). Dr. Niccum: Intravenous cefepime, vancomycin, and azithromycin were administered empirically. The next day, hemodialysis was performed, and 4 liters of fluid were removed by ultrafiltration for the management of congestive heart failure. During the last hour of the dialysis session, the dyspnea began to worsen and hypoxemia developed; supplemental oxygen was administered through a nonrebreather face mask. Ipratropiumalbuterol nebulizers were administered, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for management of hypoxemic respiratory failure. A diagnostic test was performed.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Kevin L. Ard: A 63-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital in the spring because of fever, confusion, headache, garbled speech, fatigue, vision changes, lym-phocytic pleocytosis, and an elevated protein level in the cerebrospinal fluid CSF. Approximately 5 years before the current presentation, the patient had received a diagnosis of primary membranous nephropathy at another hospital. Treatment with oral prednisone and cyclosporine was initiated. Two years later, the patient was referred to the nephrology clinic of this hospital for worsening proteinuria and hypertension; rituximab, prednisone, and cyclo-phosphamide were administered. During the next 21 months, he received four doses of rituximab, the last of which was administered 3 months before this presentation. Three months before this presentation, the patient had a flash of light accompanied by transient sharp pain in the left retro-orbital area and forehead, with monocular blurry vision. He was subsequently evaluated at the other hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI and computed tomography CT of the head were normal. Intravenous normal saline was administered, and he was discharged. One week later, the patient was reevaluated at the same hospital for an episode of garbled and nonsensical speech with impaired comprehension that resolved after 10 minutes. A CT angiogram and an MRI of the head reportedly showed a sub-acute infarct in the right side of the pons; intravenous alteplase was administered. Transthoracic echocardiography TTE was normal. Mild word-finding difficulties and confusion persisted. After discharge, the patient had worsening vision with floaters in the left eye, headache, photophobia, sonophobia, and fatigue. Three weeks later, he was evaluated by a neuro-ophthalmologist, who prescribed oral butalbitalacetaminophen caffeine therapy and ophthalmic prednisolone drops for suspected uveitis. The vision improved, and headaches decreased during the subsequent 2 weeks; how-ever, 1 week later, he was readmitted to the other hospital with sudden onset of weakness on the right side, facial droop, and garbled speech. The weakness resolved after 10 minutes. CT and MRI of the head and TTE were reportedly unchanged from the previous imaging studies. An electroencephalogram EEG showed focal left temporal slowing, and treatment with levetirace-tam was initiated. The garbled speech resolved after 2 days, and he was discharged from the hospital. During the next week, the patient had recurrent staring spells that lasted for 1 minute, during which his family thought he appeared vacant; low-grade fever also developed, and within 48 hours, the temperature increased to 39.4C and the garbled speech recurred. He was readmitted to the other hospital, and CT of the head was again reportedly normal. Blood levels of calcium, albumin, globulin, ammonia, thyrotropin, lactate, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of liver-function tests and urinalysis. Tests for Lyme disease antibodies, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, hepatitis C virus antibodies, rapid plasma reagin, antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ANCA were negative, and levels of complement were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A lumbar puncture was performed; tests for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi and West Nile virus were negative, and a Venereal Disease Research Laboratory VDRL test of the CSF was nonreactive Table 2. The patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation. A review of systems provided by the patients family was notable for somnolence, fatigue, generalized weakness, unsteadiness, headaches, staring spells, floaters in the left eye, photopho-bia, sonophobia, mild neck stiffness, unintentional weight loss of 10 kg in the past 6 months, and nocturia. The patient reported no muscle or joint pain, rash, eye pain, diplopia, oral lesions, cough, dyspnea, nausea, or abdominal pain. His medical history was notable for hypertension, dyslipidemia, early-onset coronary artery disease for which he had received percutaneous coronary intervention in his 50s and for which he had undergone aortocoronary bypass grafting in his 60s, congenital color blindness, colonic polyps, and prostatic hypertrophy. Medications included cyclophosphamide, levetiracetam, aspirin, pravastatin, metoprolol, losartan, hydrochloro-thiazide, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, ome-prazole, calcium carbonate, cholecalciferol, ferrous sulfate, a multivitamin, and fluticasone. He had not taken other antibiotic agents or non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs. The patient was a retired government employee and lived with his wife in northern New England. He had recently traveled to Florida and to rural Canada and had spent time hunting. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for approximately 30 years but had quit 7 years before the current presentation. He drank two beers per week and did not use illicit substances. His family history included coronary artery disease in both parents and valvular disease in his mother, psoriatic arthritis in a sister, and sar-coidosis in several siblings; there was no history of renal or neurologic disease. The temperature was 37.2C, the heart rate 73 beats per minute, the blood pressure 128/78 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 96 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 20.4. He appeared cachectic, with bitemporal wasting. He was somnolent and difficult to arouse with voice; he was oriented to self and intermittently to place, month, and year. His thoughts were perseverative. On mental-status examination, he was unable to name days of the week backward he named a month and then named the days forward and was unable to perform serial sevens calculations. Occasional word-finding difficulties were noted, although repetition, naming, and reading were generally intact. When asked to remember three words, he could recall only one word after 5 minutes. He reported that nine quarters equaled 4.25. His affect and speech were intact. The cranial-nerve examination revealed blurriness in the visual fields, discomfort with eye movements, and limited upward gaze. There was no weakness or pronator drift; a low-amplitude intention tremor was present in the left hand. The muscle tone was increased in both legs, with diffuse hyperreflexia, pectoralis reflexes, and seven beats of ankle clonus. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, glycated hemoglobin, bilirubin, albumin, prealbumin, total protein, lactate dehydrogenase, high-density and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and thyrotropin were normal, as were the prothrombin time, partial-thromboplastin time, and results of liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A comprehensive urine toxicology screen was negative, and a serum toxicology screen was negative for acetaminophen, salicylates, ethanol, and tricyclic antidepressants. Screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus HIV types 1 and 2 and Treponema pallidum were negative. Cultures of the blood and urine were obtained. Dr. Pamela W. Schaefer: A chest radiograph was normal. CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no hemorrhage, acute infarction, or mass lesion. Opacification of the right maxillary sinus was noted. MRI of the head Fig. 1 and magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck revealed signal hyperintensity in the sulci on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, with associated subtle enhancement on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images; additional sub-arachnoid and subdural foci characterized by restricted diffusion with no enhancement; nonspecific changes in the white matter; opacifica-tion of the right maxillary sinus; and no vascular abnormality. MRI of the spine revealed multilevel degenerative changes, without mass effect on the spinal cord, cord signal abnormality, or abnormal enhancement. Dr. Ard: Intravenous acyclovir, ceftriaxone, am-picillin, vancomycin, and thiamine were administered. On the second hospital day, the temperature was 37.6C, and myoclonic jerks were noted; marked lethargy, photophobia, and nonsensical speech persisted. The patient was intermittently impulsive and uncooperative. The white-cell count was 17,960 per microliter reference range, 4500 to 11,000, and the blood levels of vitamin B12, angiotensin-converting enzyme, complement, and haptoglobin and CD4 T-cell subset counts were normal. ANCA, antinuclear antibodies, crypto-coccal antigen, cytomegalovirus CMV DNA, EpsteinBarr virus DNA, galactomannan, and B. burgdorferi antibodies were not detected in the blood. A lumbar puncture was performed; the opening pressure was 10 cm of water, and the CSF was yellow and slightly turbid. Additional results of CSF analysis are shown in Table 2. CSF was obtained for culture, cytologic examination, and an autoimmune encephalopathy panel. An EEG showed intermittent periods of theta slowing in the bilateral posterior quadrants, with no epileptiform discharges. On examination by an ophthalmologist, bilateral visual acuity, visual fields, and intraocular pressure were normal, and there was no afferent pupillary defect. Slit-lamp examination of the eyes revealed bilateral posterior vitreal detachment but no cells in the anterior or posterior chambers. Dilated-eye examination revealed edema in both optic nerves, with tortuous vessels. There was no evidence of anterior uveitis, retini-tis, or retinal necrosis. On the third hospital day, the temperature was 36.7C, and the white-cell count was 8300 per microliter. The patient reported improved strength. Tests for bartonella antibodies and Tropheryma whipplei DNA were negative. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed a diffuse decrease in gamma globulin, with an IgG level of 378 mg per deciliter reference range, 614 to 1295, an IgA level of 30 mg per deciliter reference range, 69 to 309, and an IgM level of 7 mg per deciliter reference range, 53 to 334; the serum free light chain levels and the results of immunoelectro-phoresis were normal. A CSF VDRL test was nonreactive, and CSF testing was negative for cryptococcal antigen, eastern equine encephalitis antibodies, enterovirus RNA, West Nile virus RNA, herpes simplex virus HSV types 1 and 2 DNA, and varicellazoster virus VZV DNA. On the fourth hospital day, the patient reported feeling better and having increased strength, which allowed him to walk. Blood tests for cryoglobulin, 1,3--d-glucan, and thyroid peroxidase antibodies were negative. On the fifth hospital day, the patient was calm and cooperative; oriented to person, place, and time; and able to follow complex commands. CSF tests for listeria antibodies, Epstein–Barr virus DNA, and human herpesvirus 6 DNA were negative, as were blood and urine tests for histoplasma antigens. A whole-body positron-emission tomographic (PET)–CT scan did not show fluorodeoxyglucose avidity. The results of a repeat lumbar puncture are shown in Table 2. A repeat ophthalmologic examination revealed the presence of vitreous cells, which were more numerous in the left eye than in the right eye; persistent edema in the left optic nerve; and an increase in the blind spot of the left eye on Humphrey visual-field testing. A fluorescein angiogram showed no evidence of ocular vasculitis. A diagnosis was made. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ",

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Natasha Merali Medicine: A 76-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of lethargy and altered mental status. The patient had been well until 2 months before this evaluation, when she was admitted to another hospital for community-acquired pneumonia. Empirical treatment with ceftriaxone and azithromycin was administered, and her condition partially improved. Two weeks later, the patient presented to the other hospital with recurrent dyspnea and lethargy. A partly loculated right pleural effusion was identified. Empirical treatment with vancomycin and piperacillintazobactam was administered intravenously. Thoracostomy placement of a chest tube for drainage was performed, and pleural fluid analysis revealed an exudative pleural effusion; Grams staining showed no neutrophils or microorganisms, culture showed no growth, and cytologic testing showed no malignant cells. After a 1-week admission, the dyspnea abated, and the patient was discharged with instructions to complete a 2-week course of antibiotic therapy. Two weeks before this evaluation, generalized weakness and lethargy developed, along with new diffuse headache. The patients family thought that she appeared somnolent and clumsy while walking. Four days later, her family took her to the other hospital for evaluation. A review of systems was notable for dys-pnea, leg edema, and hematochezia and no fever, chills, chest pain, cough, dysuria, hematuria, or melena. The temperature was 37.2C, the heart rate 74 beats per minute, the blood pressure 1761/01 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while she was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The patient was alert and oriented but appeared to be confused when recalling recent events. She had jugular venous distention, diffuse lung rales, and 2 symmetric pitting edema of the lower legs up to the knees. The blood urea nitrogen level was 83 mg per deciliter 29.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 6 to 20 mg per deciliter 2.1 to 7.1 mmol per liter, the creatinine level 4.9 mg per deciliter 433 mol per liter; reference range, 0.4 to 1.1 mg per deciliter 35 to 97 mol per liter, and the hematocrit 26 reference range, 34 to 45. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. R. Gilberto Gonzalez: Chest radiography re-vealed a small right pleural effusion and moderate interstitial pulmonary edema. Computed tomography CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a chronic subcortical infarct of the right frontal lobe, as well as diffuse involutional changes and nonspecific white-matter hypoden-sities. Dr. Merali: Oral labetalol, clonidine, and hydra-lazine and intravenous furosemide were admin-istered to treat possible hypertensive emergency. During the next 2 days, the patients headache and anemia worsened and dizziness developed. On the seventh hospital day, there was an acute episode of nonbloody emesis, followed by a generalized tonicclonic seizure lasting 1 minute. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit ICU of the other hospital. Dr. Gonzalez: Repeat CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed findings similar to those of the previous study. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head Fig. 1, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed two foci of restricted diffusion in the right frontal lobe and the left cerebellar hemisphere, each measuring 1 cm in diameter, with surrounding signal hyperintensity on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery FLAIR images. In addition, there was diffuse ventricular enlargement, with surrounding smooth hyperintensity on T2-weighted and FLAIR images; this finding is suggestive of communicating hydrocephalus with transependymal flow of cerebrospinal fluid CSF. T2-weighted and FLAIR images also showed multiple foci of hyperintensity scattered throughout the deep white matter. Dr. Merali: Video electroencephalography revealed epileptiform discharges predominantly in the frontal lobe, with generalized slowing. Levetiracetam, vancomycin, and ceftazidime were administered; intermittent hemodialysis was initiated. During the next 3 days, the patient began to have a right gaze preference, left hemineglect, and aphasia. The temperature increased to 39.4C, and chills developed. Blood specimens were obtained for microbiologic culture. Lumbar puncture was deferred, pending additional imaging studies to rule out a space-occupying lesion. Empirical treatment with vancomycin, ceftazi-dime, ampicillin, metronidazole, and acyclovir was administered intravenously. At the request of her family, the patient was transferred to the ICU of this hospital. On arrival at this hospital, additional history was obtained from the patients family. Two years earlier, the patient had received a diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma, which was treated with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin. Therapy was discontinued after three of six cycles because of ileus, renal injury, and neutropenic fever. Robotic subtotal gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were then performed; histologic examination of the resected tissue revealed a nearly complete response of the adenocarcinoma. Five months before the current evaluation, CT with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose FDGpositron-emission tomography performed at the other hospital revealed FDG avidity in nonenlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, retroperito-neum, porta hepatis, and right cervical region. Biopsy was offered, but the patient chose to undergo active surveillance. Additional medical history included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and stage 5 chronic kidney disease. Medications included torsemide, amlodipine, clonidine, hydrala-zine, hydrochlorothiazide, labetalol, rosuvastatin, insulin, levothyroxine, cholecalciferol, mirtazap-ine, and oxycodone. There were no known drug allergies. Four decades before the current admission, the patient had immigrated to the United States from an island off the west coast of Africa. She was widowed, had four children, and lived with a pet parrot in an urban area of New England. Two months before hospitalization, she had been independent in activities of daily living and had received minimal assistance, such as with buying groceries, from family members. The patient had traveled to her country of origin 8 years earlier and to South America and the Caribbean in the past year. She had had no sexual partners in the past three decades. She did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. Her sister had received a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer at 60 years of age; there was no family history of rheumatologic, neurologic, cardiovascular, or renal disease. On examination, the temperature was 36.8C, the heart rate 93 beats per minute, the blood pressure 170/92 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 23.8. The patient was somnolent and variably oriented to self but not to situation, location, or time. She intermittently opened her eyes spontaneously but did not follow commands or reliably withdraw in response to noxious stimuli. Her face and pupils appeared symmetric; a right gaze preference and left hemineglect were present. There was no evidence of jugular venous distention, rales, or edema, and the abdominal examination was normal. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus HIV type 1 and type 2 antibodies and p24 an-tigen was nonreactive. A test for antitreponemal antibodies was positive, and a rapid plasma re-agin test was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Gonzalez: Repeat CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed foci of hypoattenuation in the left superior cerebellar hemisphere and the right frontal lobe that corresponded to the foci of restricted diffusion on MRI observed at the other hospital. Dr. Merali: Empirical treatment with vancomy-cin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, metronidazole, and acyclovir was administered intravenously. On the second hospital day, a lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was 15 cm of water. The CSF was slightly yellow, with a glucose level of 18 mg per deciliter 1.0 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter 2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter and a protein level of 173 mg per deciliter reference range, 5 to 55. There were 236 nucleated cells per microliter reference range, 0 to 5, of which 69 were neutrophils, 19 lymphocytes, and 12 mono-cytes. Grams staining of the CSF showed abundant neutrophils and mononuclear cells; no organisms were identified. Transthoracic echo-cardiography revealed mild left ventricular hypo-kinesis and aortic sclerosis. On the fourth hospital day, new right esopho-ria developed and the patient was less responsive. The trachea was intubated and mechanical ventilation was initiated for airway protection. Dr. Gonzalez: Repeat MRI of the head Fig. 2, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed enlargement of the previously observed lesions in the right frontal lobe and left cerebellum. There were additional foci of reduced diffusivity, with corresponding hyperintense signal abnormalities on T2-weighted and FLAIR images, involving both cerebral hemispheres, deep gray matter, the brain stem, and the cerebellum. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multifocal narrowing of branches of the bilateral middle and posterior cerebral arteries. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed small bilateral pleural effusions and no other abnormalities. Dr. Merali: Empirical treatment with methyl-prednisolone was started. The next day, repeat lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was 16 cm of water. The CSF was slightly yellow, with a glucose level of 179 mg per deciliter 9.9 mmol per liter and a protein level of 181 mg per deciliter. There were 286 nucleated cells per microliter, of which 83 were neutrophils, 9 lymphocytes, and 8 monocytes. Grams staining of the CSF showed abundant neutrophils and moderate mononuclear cells; there were no organisms. A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ",

Thomas: A 26-year-old pregnant woman was transferred to this hospital for evaluation and treatment of cardiogenic shock after a cardiac arrest resulting from ventricular tachycardia. The patient had had two previous uncomplicated pregnancies and was currently pregnant at 32 weeks of gestation with monochorionic, diamniotic twins. Her pregnancy had been monitored for polyhydramnios by her obstetrician with the use of serial fetal ultrasonography. Three weeks before presentation to this hospital, one of the patients preschool-age children had an ear infection and the other had a sore throat. The patient had erythema in the eyes with greenish drainage, for which topical erythromycin and sulfacetamide were prescribed. One week later, a nonproductive cough complicated by a sore throat and ear pain developed. The patient also noted new edema in her legs that was not associated with pain, redness, or warmth. However, during the subsequent week, progressive pain in her right leg occurred, which prompted her to seek care at an emergency department of another hospital. On examination, the temperature was 37.0C, the pulse 113 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg. Pitting edema of the legs was noted, with no associated erythema, warmth, or tenderness on palpation of the calves. Ultrasonog-raphy of the right leg reportedly showed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis, and a rapid test for streptococcal antigen was negative. While the patient was in the emergency department, painful uterine contractions with back discomfort developed; the cervix was 2 cm dilated. She was admitted to the labor and delivery unit for management of preterm labor. Intramuscular betamethasone and magnesium sulfate were administered for maturation of the fetal lungs and tocolysis, respectively. Continuous intravenous infusion of lactated Ringers solution was initiated. Subcutaneous heparin was not administered, because delivery was thought to be imminent. After 24 hours of magnesium sulfate therapy, the uterine contractions remained unchanged, and no further cervical dilatation was noted. Because of concern about preterm labor, she remained hospitalized, with continuous monitoring of the fetal heart rate. Five days after admission to the labor and delivery unit, the patient had tenderness in the left leg, and the edema in both legs had worsened. She also had episodes of severe coughing but reported no chest pain or shortness of breath. On examination, the temperature was 36.9C, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the blood pressure 96/51 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98 while the patient was breathing ambient air. Auscultation of the lungs revealed expiratory wheezes. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Doppler ultrasound examination of the legs revealed an occlusive thrombus in the left peroneal vein. The hematology service was consulted, and an intravenous heparin infusion was initiated. Intravenous furosemide and oral azithro-mycin and guaifenesin were also administered. The next morning, after the patient had eaten breakfast, she had sudden severe, crushing chest pain and became unresponsive and pulseless. Telemetry revealed monomorphic ventricular tachycardia at a rate of 178 beats per minute, with a right bundle-branch block pattern with a superior axis. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated, and after the administration of epinephrine and cardioversion, the return of spontaneous circulation was achieved within 4 minutes. Intravenous infusions of norepinephrine, vasopressin, dopamine, propofol, and fentanyl were administered. The trachea was intubated, and ventilatory support was initiated. An emergency cesarean section was performed, and two healthy male infants were delivered, with an estimated intraop-erative blood loss of 1600 ml. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Andrew S. Fox: Computed tomography CT of the chest Fig. 1A and 1B, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities with interlobular septal thickening, findings that were consistent with pulmonary edema; bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion; cardiomegaly with biventricular enlargement; and dilatation of the main pulmonary artery, which measured 3.8 cm in diameter. No pulmonary embolus was identified. Dr. Thomas: A transthoracic echocardiogram showed biventricular dilatation and severely de-creased biventricular systolic function, moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion. Furosemide was administered intravenously, and the patient was transferred to a nearby tertiary care center for further treatment. On arrival at the second hospital, 210 minutes after the cardiac arrest, the pulse was 177 beats per minute, and the mean arterial pressure was 65 mm Hg while the patient was receiving intravenous infusions of norepinephrine, dopamine, and vasopressin. Physical examination was notable for diffusely coarse breath sounds, rapid regular heart sounds, and generalized edema. Thirty minutes after arrival at the second hospital, the patient underwent cannulation for femoral veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO, and an intravenous infusion of milrinone was initiated. Ventricular tachycardia recurred; intravenous magnesium and lidocaine were administered, and the arrhythmia was terminated with cardioversion. Plans were made to transfer the patient by helicopter to this hospital, and intravenous vecuronium was given in preparation for transport. During the flight, severe vaginal bleeding developed, and 2 units of packed red cells were transfused; however, the heparin infusion was continued, given the presence of the ECMO circuit. On arrival at this hospital, 10 hours after the cardiac arrest, additional information was obtained from the patients sister and grandmother. The patient had a history of childhood asthma, obesity, anxiety, and depression. She had previously delivered two healthy, full-term children; her current pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus and polyhydramnios of one of the fetuses. Her medication history included insulin, inhaled albuterol, sertraline, iron sulfate, and folic acid. She had had no known adverse drug reactions. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She was married and had two healthy preschool-age children, in addition to her two newborns. Her mother had died from ovarian cancer; her sister was healthy. On examination, the temperature was 36.2C, the pulse 123 beats per minute, and the mean arterial pressure 76 mm Hg without intrinsic arterial pulsatility while the patient was receiving ECMO support. The respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was receiving oxygen through volume assistcontrol mechanical ventilation, with a delivered tidal volume of 290 ml and a fraction of inspired oxygen of 1.0. The weight was 105 kg, the height 163 cm, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 39.5. The central venous pressure was 4 mm Hg. The pupils were equal and briskly reactive to light; once the patient was weaned off propofol, she was able to follow commands and move her arms and legs. Breath sounds were coarse bilaterally and diminished at the bases. Heart sounds were distant. The abdomen was soft and obese; no active bleeding was noted from the surgical incision, but large-volume vaginal bleeding and clots were observed. The arms and legs were warm and had moderate symmetric pitting edema. The femoral venous and arterial cannulas were secured in place in the right groin. The blood level of thyrotropin was normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Tests for influenza viruses, adenovirus, human meta-pneumovirus, and parainfluenza virus were negative. Dr. Fox: Chest radiography Fig. 1C, performed at the time of transfer to this hospital, revealed interstitial opacities, a small left pleural effusion, and a dense retrocardiac opacity on the left side. The venous ECMO drainage cannula and a central venous catheter were visible in the right atrium. Dr. Thomas: An electrocardiogram Fig. 2A showed normal sinus rhythm, right bundle-branch block, borderline-low QRS voltage, and Q waves with T-wave inversions in the anterior and lateral leads. Dr. Doreen DeFaria Yeh: Transthoracic echocar-diography Fig. 2B; and Videos 1 and 2, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org, performed while the patient was receiving ECMO support, revealed a dilated left ventricular cavity with normal wall thickness and severe diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis that was most prominent in the anterior, anteroseptal, and lateral territories, with an estimated ejection fraction of 11. Additional notable findings included moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, moderate right ventricular dysfunction and dilatation, an estimated pulmonary-artery systolic pressure of 53 mm Hg, a small pericardial effusion, and a pleural effusion. The ECMO inflow cannula was visualized in the inferior vena cava, and consistent with systemic ECMO blood flows, the aortic valve was observed not to open during the cardiac cycle, which suggested very poor native left ventricular contraction. There was no evidence of intracardiac shunting. Dr. Thomas: The dose of milrinone was increased, and the dopamine infusion was discontinued. An oxytocin infusion and rectal misopro-stol were administered. Ongoing large-volume vaginal bleeding was observed, and an intrauterine balloon was placed to control the bleeding. A diagnosis and management decisions were made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ",

Medoff: A 70-year-old woman was evaluated at the pulmonary clinic of this hospital because of increasing dyspnea on exertion and abnormal findings on chest imaging. In childhood, the patient had eczema, recurrent episodes of bronchitis with a cough productive of mucus, and allergic rhinitis; these conditions abated in adulthood. Twenty years before this evaluation, she had community-acquired pneumonia. Fifteen years before this evaluation, she had an inhalation exposure to aerosolized brick and mortar at a construction site near her home; she subsequently had bronchitis that was treated with a course of nebulizers and inhaled glucocorticoids. Twelve years before this evaluation, the patient began to have episodes of coryza, nasal congestion, itchy and watery eyes, and wheezing, especially in the spring or with exposure to cats, dogs, or dust. She was seen by an allergist. Skin-prick testing elicited a response to dust mites, and intradermal testing elicited a response to tree mix and dog dander. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. Presumptive diagnoses of asthma and seasonal and environmental allergies were made. She received prescriptions for fexofenadine, mometasone, and inhaled albuterol, to be taken as needed. Eleven years before this evaluation, computed tomography CT of the abdomen incidentally revealed mild mosaic attenuation  a patchy ground-glass pattern  at the lung bases. Ten years before this evaluation, the patient was seen by her primary care physician because of several weeks of nonproductive cough, nasal congestion, and intermittent wheezing; she received prescriptions for oral loratadine and inhaled pirbuterol, to be taken as needed. Eight years before this evaluation, she was referred to an allergist. She was considered to have a cough in response to angiotensin-convertingenzyme inhibitors. Six years 3 months before this evaluation, she consulted with another allergist. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. The blood IgE level was 1532 kU per liter reference range at other institution, 127, with positive titers in response to cat dander, dog dander, and dust mites. Inhaled fluticasone was prescribed. Three months later, she had mild dyspnea on exertion and occasional wheezing. Pulmonary-function tests showed minimal change Table 1; inhaled fluticasonesalmeterol was prescribed. Five years 9 months before this evaluation, the patient was referred for pulmonary consultation. She reported intermittent wheezing, mild exertional dyspnea after climbing two flights of stairs or carrying groceries, occasional gastro-esophageal reflux, and snoring. The heart rate was 72 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95 while she was breathing ambient air at rest. Examination revealed upper-airway wheezing and was otherwise normal. After the patient climbed four flights of stairs, the heart rate was 102 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 91 while she was breathing ambient air. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph was reportedly normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, and hemoglobin were normal, as was the platelet count; the white-cell count was 11,900 per microliter reference range, 4500 to 11,000 and the eosinophil count was 390 per microliter reference range, 600, with a relative eosinophil count of 3.2 reference range, 0 to 3. Antinuclear antibody ANA and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ANCA levels were undetectable. Dr. Amita Sharma: Chest CT, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed bilateral mosaic attenuation, as well as several lung nodules measuring 2 to 4 mm in diameter. There was no evidence of bronchiectasis. Dr. Medoff: The patient was seen by an otolaryn-gologist. External and fiberoptic examinations, including examination of the vocal cords, were normal. A sleep study revealed mild sleep apnea, with an apneahypopnea index of 7.2 events per hour reference range, 5. The patient was unable to receive supplemental oxygen at night and positive-pressure ventilation owing to side effects. Five years before this evaluation, the patient underwent cardiac evaluation because of ongo-ing dyspnea on exertion. A transthoracic echocar-diogram was normal. Results of an exercise stress test treadmill test were submaximal, with a maximum heart rate at 74 of the age-predicted value but without abnormal findings on electrocardiography. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. Three months later, the patient attended follow-up with her pulmo-nologist; inhaled budesonideformoterol was substituted for inhaled fluticasonesalmeterol, and weight loss was advised. Dr. Sharma: Four years before this evaluation, repeat chest CT, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed bilateral mosaic attenuation and multiple bilateral lung nodules measuring 2 to 4 mm in diameter. All the findings were stable from the previous CT scan. Dr. Medoff: The patient was seen by a second pulmonologist, and inhaled budesonide was substituted for inhaled budesonideformoterol for the treatment of mild intermittent asthma. Results of pulmonary-function tests obtained 4 years before this evaluation are shown in Table 1. Subsequently, the patient was evaluated annually by her first pulmonologist, but after 3 years, she consulted with a third pulmonologist regarding recurrent dyspnea on exertion. Results of pulmonary-function tests obtained 7 months before this evaluation are shown in Table 1. Dr. Sharma: At that time, chest CT, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed bilateral mosaic attenuation and a nodule measuring 6 mm in diameter in the posterior right upper lobe, along with other, diffuse lung nodules measuring 2 to 4 mm in diameter. Dr. Medoff: The blood hemoglobin level, platelet count, and white-cell count were normal; the eosinophil count was 437 per microliter, with a relative eosinophil count of 4.9. The ANA titer was 1:1280, with a homogeneous staining pattern. The IgE level was 2685 kU per liter reference range at other institution, 114, with positive titers in response to cat dander, dog dander, dust mites, and Cladosporium herbarum. Treatment with oral montelukast and inhaled fluticasone umeclidiniumvilanterol was started, along with supplemental oxygen to be used at night and with exertion. After 1 month, the patients symptoms had not abated, and subcutaneous ben-ralizumab was prescribed. Three months before this evaluation, the pa-tients symptoms remained unchanged. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. One month later, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose FDGpositron-emission tomography and CT revealed no areas of abnormal FDG avidity in the lungs. Eight weeks later, the patient was referred to the pulmonary clinic of this hospital. The patient reported intermittent wheezing and progressive mild exertional dyspnea after climbing one to two flights of stairs. She had stopped playing a team aerobic sport because of difficulty breathing. The symptoms did not abate with use of the inhaler or benralizumab; they never occurred at rest. She occasionally had a nonproductive cough without hemoptysis, and she had a raspy voice that had become worse in recent months. Coryza, nasal congestion, and watery eyes were not present. She had gained 15 kg during the previous 5 years. The patients medical history included eczema, hypothyroidism, obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, borderline diabetes, calcium oxalate neph-rolithiasis, glaucoma, and colonic polyps. She had undergone tonsillectomy and multiple procedures for the treatment of nephrolithiasis, including shock-wave lithotripsy and ureteroscopy. Medications included oral aspirin, amlodipine, atenolol, atorvastatin, atovaquone, levothyroxine, loratadine, losartan, and montelukast, along with a multivitamin; inhaled fluticasoneumecli-diniumvilanterol; and subcutaneous benralizu-mab. Sulfa drugs had caused anaphylaxis, lisino-pril had caused a cough, and macrolides had caused diarrhea. The patient worked as an educator. She had no known exposure to asbestos, mold, solvents, or chemicals. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and did not have secondhand exposure to tobacco; she drank one glass of wine per week and did not use illicit drugs. She had traveled to coastal areas of Florida and Massachusetts, as well as other areas of New England, but she had not traveled to other areas of the United States or outside the country. The patient was married and lived in Massachusetts with her spouse. There had been no pets in her home for approximately 10 years. There were no damp areas in her home; she used a vacuum cleaner with a high-efficiency particulate air HEPA filter and allergen-proof bedsheets. The patients family history was notable for coronary artery and peripheral artery disease in her father, a sister, and her brother; skin cancer in her mother; breast cancer in a sister; and hypertension and diabetes in multiple relatives. She had two healthy adult children. There was no history of allergic, immunologic, pulmonary, or rheumatologic disease. The temperature was 36.6C, the heart rate 67 beats per minute, the blood pressure 142/91 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 92 while the patient was breathing ambient air. After she climbed two flights of stairs, the oxygen saturation was 87 while she was breathing ambient air. She had a cushingoid appearance. The nasal and oral mucosa appeared normal. There was no tracheal deviation or stridor. Lung auscultation revealed normal breath sounds. There was no clubbing or edema. Mild scattered eczematous plaques were present on the forearms and shins. There were mild Heberdens nodes but no other joint, skin, or nail abnormalities. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood hemoglobin level, white-cell count, differential count with 0 eosinophils, platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and cre-atine kinase level were normal. The IgE level was 1307 IU per milliliter reference range at this hospital, 0 to 100, and a hypersensitivity pneu-monitis panel was negative. The thyrotropin level was 8.07 IU per milliliter reference range, 0.40 to 5.00, and the aldolase level 9.3 U per liter reference range, 7.7. The ANA titer was 1:5120, with a homogeneous and speckled staining pattern; the anticytoplasmic antibody titer was 1:1280, with a filamentous and granular staining pattern; and ANCA testing was negative. A transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. Ten weeks after evaluation, at follow-up in the pulmonary clinic, a myositis antibody panel was negative, except for a weakly positive titer in response to anti-Ku antibodies. Tests were negative for ANCA, anticyclic citrullinated peptide, rheumatoid factor, and antidouble-stranded DNA, anti-Ro, anti-La, anti-Smith, antiribonu-cleoprotein, antitopoisomerase I antiScl-70, antimitochondrial, antithyroperoxidase, and anti histidyltransfer RNA synthase antiJo-1 antibodies. Dr. Sharma: Chest CT Fig. 1A and 1B, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed diffuse bilateral mosaic attenu-ation and multiple bilateral lung nodules, including a 6-mm nodule in the right upper lobe. There was no evidence of pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiectasis, or lymphadenopathy. Dr. Medoff: Five days later, the patient was evaluated by a rheumatologist at this hospital. A tapering course of oral prednisone was prescribed for the treatment of possible interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features. Ten weeks after the visit with the rheumatolo-gist, the eczematous rash had improved but dyspnea on exertion persisted during long walks. An examination in the pulmonary clinic was notable for clear lung fields and an oxygen saturation of 95 while the patient was breathing ambient air. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. Dr. Sharma: Chest CT, performed without the administration of contrast material, again showed extensive bilateral mosaic attenuation and numerous bilateral solid lung nodules, with the largest nodule, measuring 6 mm in diameter, located in the right upper lobe. There was no evidence of bronchiectasis or reticulation. Expiratory CT Fig. 1C and 1D confirmed the presence of air trapping. Diagnostic tests were performed.

Matza Medicine: A 68-year-old man was transferred to this hospital because of neurologic decline, progressive renal insufficiency, and leukopenia. Seven months before this admission, the patient was admitted to another hospital after routine laboratory testing had identified abnormalities, including a creatinine level of 3.2 mg per deciliter 283 mmol per liter; reference range, 0.50 to 1.40 mg per deciliter 44 to 124 mmol per liter, a blood urea nitrogen level of 54 mg per deciliter 19 mmol per liter; reference range, 7 to 30 mg per deciliter 2.5 to 11 mmol per liter, and a calcium level of 12.1 mg per deciliter 3.0 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.8 to 10.6 mg per deciliter 2.2 to 2.6 mmol per liter. Twelve months earlier, the creatinine level had been 1.7 mg per deciliter 150 mmol per liter. On admission to the other hospital, he reported unintentional weight loss of 14 kg over the preceding 12 months, malaise, waking every 2 hours to empty his bladder, and new mild exertional dyspnea. The temperature was 36.6C, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, the blood pressure 117/74 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 96 while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 68 kg and the body-mass index BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 23.5. Examination was notable for cachexia and hepato-splenomegaly with the liver and spleen palpable 6 cm below the costal margin without lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination was reportedly normal. Blood levels of magnesium, bilirubin, globulin, creatine kinase, uric acid, and N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Serum protein electrophoresis results were normal; urine protein electrophoresis revealed polyclonal light-chain bands. Dr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: Computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly revealed focal nodular soft-tissue thickening along the aortic arch, descending thoracic aorta, and abdominal aorta. Spleno-megaly and left paraaortic adenopathy were present. Small pulmonary nodules and patchy consolidation were observed, along with a small left pleural effusion. Dr. Matza: After treatment with intravenous normal saline and furosemide, the calcium level normalized and the creatinine level decreased to 2.3 mg per deciliter 203 mmol per liter. The patient was discharged on the fourth hospital day. Dr. Rory K. Crotty: A bone marrow biopsy performed 2 weeks later at the first hospital revealed hypercellular marrow and multiple non-necrotizing granulomas. Staining for acid-fast bacilli and fungi was negative. No cultures were obtained. Dr. Matza: The angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE level was 89 U per liter reference range, 9 to 67. A diagnosis of sarcoidosis was considered, and therapy with high-dose oral prednisone was started. One month later, the ACE level decreased to 41 U per liter, and the patients energy level and appetite improved. Attempts to taper the dose of prednisone were unsuccessful owing to increased fatigue and exertional dyspnea. Three months later, the patient was evaluated by a pulmonologist at the first hospital for pulmonary sarcoidosis. Trimethoprimsulfamethox-azole was initiated for prophylaxis against pneu-mocystis while the patient continued to receive high-dose prednisone. Tests of pulmonary function showed mild obstruction, with a clinically significant response after the use of a broncho-dilator, and moderate restriction, with moderately reduced diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide. A second attempt to taper the dose of prednisone was unsuccessful owing to increased fatigue and exertional dyspnea. During the next 2 months, intermittent confusion, progressive weakness in the legs, right foot drop, and increasing unsteadiness and gait instability developed; the patient began to use a walker to ambulate. He also had at least two falls. He required help from his wife to perform activities of daily living, including bathing and dressing. The patient was evaluated by a rheumatolo-gist at the first hospital. Complement levels were normal, as was the level of rheumatoid factor. Tests for antinuclear antibodies ANA, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ANCA, and anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies were negative. Weekly treatment with oral meth-otrexate and folic acid was started for presumed sarcoidosis. Eleven days later, the patient presented to a second hospital with a new facial droop on the left side, slurred speech, and confusion. The temperature was 36.4C, the heart rate 102 beats per minute, the blood pressure 141/86 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 99 while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The weight was 63 kg and the BMI 21.9. The patient was oriented to person, place, and time; neuro-logic examination was notable for a mild facial droop on the left side, mildly increased muscle tone, right foot drop, and symmetric mild weakness in the arms and upper legs. Cachexia, tachycardia, and splenomegaly were noted. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Pamela W. Schaefer: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head revealed a 12-mm right subdural hygroma with a midline shift of 10 mm, a right cerebellar cavernous malformation, and numerous punctate foci in the pons, left cerebellum, right occipital lobe, and left thalamus characterized by hyperintensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery FLAIR imaging and restricted diffusion. Dr. Matza: Clopidogrel and levetiracetam were initiated. Echocardiography did not show intra-cardiac thrombus or shunting; carotid ultrasonog-raphy did not show stenosis. Electromyography revealed evidence of mild L5S1 radiculopathy and right ulnar and median neuropathy, but there was no evidence of myopathy or upper motor neuron disease. Owing to progressive leuko-penia white-cell count, 1390 per microliter and thrombocytopenia platelet count, 51,000 per microliter, methotrexate, clopidogrel, levetirace-tam, and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole were discontinued; cyanocobalamin was started. On the fourth hospital day, a fever with a temperature of 38.3C developed; specimens of blood and urine were obtained for culture, and intravenous vancomycin and cefepime were initiated. The C-reactive protein level was 101.8 mg per liter. Blood tests for ANA, ANCA, rheumatoid factor, influenza type A and B antigens, human immunodeficiency virus HIV type 1 p24 anti-gen, antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, hepatitis B virus core antibodies, cytomegalovirus DNA, EpsteinBarr virus DNA, and parvovirus IgM were negative, as were urine tests for legionella antigen and histoplasma antigen. A rapid plasma reagin test was negative, and an interferon- release assay for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was reported as indeterminate. Dr. Shepard: CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed scattered ground-glass opacities in the lungs, nodular and consolidative opacities in the lungs, mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, small pleural effusions, and splenomegaly with the spleen measuring 16 cm in the cephalocaudad dimension; normal length, 13 cm. Focal soft-tissue thickening along the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta and prominence of the soft tissue surrounding the infrarenal abdominal aorta were also noted. The next day, magnetic resonance angiogra-phy was performed. A T2-weighted fat-saturated image Fig. 1A showed signal hyperintensity in the soft tissue around the infrarenal aorta and in the adjacent left paraaortic lymph nodes that was indicative of adenopathy, with a focal abdominal aortic pseudoaneurysm seen on time-of-flight imaging Fig. 1B. Dr. Matza: On the eighth hospital day, a bone marrow biopsy was performed. On the ninth day, the patient was transferred to this hospital. On the patients arrival, a review of systems was limited owing to delirium, and history was obtained in part from the patients family. The review was notable for months of fatigue, malaise, leg weakness, right foot drop, waxing and waning confusion, exertional dyspnea, and an inability to walk and perform activities of daily living. Palpitations, dry cough, easy bruising, and irritable bladder were present, but he had no chills, anorexia, joint pain, erythema, rashes, nodules, myalgia, chest pain, dizziness, productive cough, hemoptysis, orthopnea, wheezing, gastrointestinal symptoms, dysuria, hematuria, ocular or nasal symptoms, skin or nail changes, or headache. The patients medical history was notable for hypothyroidism, hypertension, hypercholesterol-emia, progressive kidney disease, degenerative joint disease of the lumbar spine, scoliosis, tubular adenoma, and leukopenia. Eight years before this admission, a mass in the bladder that measured 4.5 cm by 4.0 cm was noted on ultraso-nography, which had been performed for evaluation of hematuria. Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor was performed at another hospital, but the resection was reportedly incomplete. Histologic examination revealed non muscle-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma. Repeat cystoscopy and transurethral resection, performed 3, 8, and 16 months after the initial procedures, each revealed fragments of non muscle-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma, and intravesical bacille CalmetteGuerin BCG was administered. Cystoscopy, performed 1 year before this admission for the management of bladder stones, identified a recurrent polypoid bladder tumor, which was treated with trans-urethral resection. Outpatient medications included prednisone, methotrexate, folic acid, aspirin, levothyroxine, simvastatin, tamsulosin, cholecalciferol, sodium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate, omeprazole, tri-methoprimsulfamethoxazole, fluticasonesalmet-erol, and as-needed inhaled albuterol. Penicillin had caused an unknown reaction. The patient was a retired pharmacist and lived with his wife. He had a remote history of smoking a half pack of cigarettes daily for 2 years and drank alcohol infrequently. He had not traveled recently and had had no environmental, animal, or toxic exposures. There was no family history of autoimmune, neurologic, infectious, or pulmonary disorders. The temperature was 36.8C, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the blood pressure 122/76 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94 while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The weight was 54 kg and the BMI 18.8. He was anxious, cachectic, and appeared chronically ill. He correctly reported his name, location, and the time and date; however, he was unable to follow simple two-step commands. The cranial-nerve examination revealed a subtle facial droop on the left side. There were tremors in the arms and legs at rest and with motion, as well as right foot drop and diffusely increased tone. Finger nosefinger testing showed dysmetria. Bibasilar crackles greater in the left lung than in the right were heard on lung auscultation. Hepato-splenomegaly was present. There were diffuse ecchymoses on the trunk, arms, and legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. The international normalized ratio and blood levels of ammonia, bilirubin, creatine kinase, folic acid, globulin, haptoglobin, lactate dehydro-genase, lactic acid, and magnesium were normal. The ACE level was 36 U per liter reference range, 8 to 53. Serum protein electrophoresis showed no bands, but a mild, diffuse decrease in globulin was noted. The urine free kappa light-chain level was 134.2 mg per deciliter reference range, 0.4 to 15.1, and the urine free lambda light-chain level was 35.6 mg per deciliter reference range, 0.8 to 10.1, with a normal ratio 3.77; reference range, 0.50 to 4.00. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cultures of blood, urine, and sputum were obtained. During the first 3 days of this admission, the patient became lethargic; when he was awakened, his speech was incoherent and dysarthric. Dr. Schaefer: On the third hospital day, MRI of the head Fig. 2 with magnetic resonance angiography revealed a stable right subdural hygro-ma with a midline shift of 10 mm, as well as a stable right cerebellar cavernous malformation. There were punctate and patchy foci characterized by hyperintensity on FLAIR imaging and restricted diffusion in the midbrain, pons, medulla, left cerebellum, right occipital lobe, and left thalamus; the foci had increased in size and extent from the previous study. Dr. Shepard: Positron-emission tomography PETCT Fig. 1D through 1F revealed multiple foci of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose FDG uptake in periaortic soft tissue and paraaortic lymph nodes, in the axial skeleton cervical vertebral body, ribs, manubrium, and sacrum, and in the left testis. Dr. Matza: Blood tests for alpha-fetoprotein, 1,3--d-glucan, coxiella antibodies, cytomegalo-virus IgM and IgG, cryptococcal antigen, human chorionic gonadotropin, and Treponema pallidum antibodies were negative, as was a urine test for histoplasma antigen. Electroencephalographic monitoring showed frequent sharp, irregular delta and theta discharges; treatment with leveti-racetam was started. On the fourth hospital day, the temperature was 38.3C. Ultrasound images showed testes of normal size and echotexture without focal lesions, but the epididymides were enlarged and heterogeneous. The kidneys were normal in size, with diffusely echogenic parenchyma, and a 19-mm bladder stone was present. A transtho-racic echocardiogram showed normal ventricular function, no evidence of clinically significant valvular disease, and a mildly dilated aorta. Flow cytometry showed a markedly reduced CD4 T-cell count 11 per microliter; reference range, 348 to 1456. Antibody tests for bartonella and brucella were negative. Somnolence progressed, and on the fifth hospital day, the right pupil was noted to be slightly larger than the left and the patient had increased tremor. Fosphenytoin therapy was initiated, and he was transferred to the neurologic intensive care unit. The oxygen saturation declined to 90 while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute, and a CheyneStokes pattern of respiration was observed. The trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was initiated. A diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ",

Luccarelli Psychiatry: A 70-year-old man with bipolar disorder was evaluated at this hospital because of depressed mood, suicidal ideation, and gait disturbance. The patient had a long history of depressive episodes, with two previous hospitalizations for suicide attempts. Approximately two decades before the current admission, he was struck on the head with a beam while working at a construction site and had a 4-cm laceration. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital, where the wound was sutured but no further evaluation was conducted. Approximately 10 years before the current admission, around the time of his mothers death, the patient was evaluated at this hospital because of an episode of irritability, a reduced need for sleep, and grandiosity; he reported feelings of transcendence and being at one with God. He was admitted for 1 month to the psychiatry unit of a second hospital, where he was treated with lithium and elec-troconvulsive therapy. Thereafter, he received outpatient psychiatric treatment on a monthly basis, as well as therapy with valproic acid and fluoxetine. Approximately 9 years before the current admission, the patient fell on concrete stairs and had back pain with subsequent lower-leg weakness and urinary incontinence. He was evaluated at a third hospital, where magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the lumbar spine revealed multilevel degenerative changes, including L4L5 spinal stenosis and central disk protrusion. Acetaminophen and physical therapy were prescribed. Five years later 4 years before the current admission, the patient fell because of an unsteady gait and was evaluated at a fourth hospital. Neurologic examination revealed a memory deficit with an inability to recall any objects after 5 minutes on the three-item object-recall test and poor attention with an inability to perform serial sevens calculations, as well as action tremor in the arms and mildly unsteady gait, even with the use of a cane. The remainder of the physical examination was reportedly normal. The complete blood count, results of renal function tests, and levels of electrolytes, valproic acid, folate, vitamin B12, glycated hemoglobin, and thyrotropin were normal; serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. MRI of the head reportedly revealed no evidence of an infarct, intracranial hemorrhage, or a mass but showed mild prominence of ventricles, sulci, and cisterns. The dose of fluoxetine was decreased, and the patient was discharged 3 days later. Additional falls occurred 2 months and 4 months later, and both times, the patient was evaluated at the fourth hospital. Two months after the most recent fall, he hit the car in front of him while driving. His psychiatrist noted that he had bilateral tremor at rest; the dose of val-proic acid was reduced, and he was referred to a neurologist. Two months after the car crash, he fell while walking and was evaluated at the fourth hospital. The evaluation was notable for nystagmus and a normal valproic acid level 89 g per milliliter; reference range, 50 to 100 despite the dose reduction; the doses of valproic acid and trazodone were reduced, and physical therapy was provided. During the next 5 months, gait instability was reduced but persisted. The patient was evaluated by two other neurologists after reporting a feeling of imbalance. Audiometry revealed mild-to-moderate high-frequency sensori-neural hearing loss. Medications were considered to be a contributor to his balance dysfunction. During the next 12 months, the dose of val-proic acid was tapered and fluoxetine was stopped; the patient underwent trials of escitalopram and then sertraline for the treatment of depressive symptoms. He reported to his psychiatrist symptoms of confusion, some difficulty with memory, and decreased leg coordination. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 23 scores range from 0 to 30, with a score of 18 to 25 suggesting mild cognitive impairment. Dr. McKinley Glover: Fifteen months before the current admission, the patient began to have dizziness. MRI of the head Fig. 1, performed at this hospital, revealed an old infarct in the left corona radiata, features of mild small-vessel disease, mild diffuse brain parenchymal volume loss, and mild ventricular prominence. Dr. Luccarelli: Neuropsychiatric testing was performed, and the results did not suggest a neurodegenerative process. Given the patient’s progressively depressed mood, treatment with aripiprazole was started, with the dose adjusted over the following 12 months. Three months before the current admission, the patient reported worsening depression, with hopelessness, guilt, and increased sleep. That month, his son found him unable to walk and requiring assistance to move. On examination, he had tremor and muscle rigidity; on ambulation, he had a shuffling gait and required a cane. Treatment with aripiprazole was stopped, benztropine was started, and sertraline was replaced by fluoxetine. One month before the current admission, the patient was voluntarily hospitalized in the psychiatry unit of this hospital because of worsening depression, which he attributed to the progressive reduction in mobility and strength. He reported 3 weeks of frequent early morning awakenings, anhedonia, low energy, anorexia, difficulty concentrating, and low motivation, such that he had not paid bills or bathed. Examination was notable for tremor, muscle rigidity, and a shuffling gait. Blood levels of folate, vitamin B12, and glycated hemoglobin were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 antibodies and type 1 antigen and for antitreponemal antibodies were negative. Over the 5-day hospitalization, the dose of fluoxetine was increased and treatment with lurasidone was started. During the following 4 weeks, the patient’s ability to walk continued to deteriorate, and he required intermittent use of a walker and a wheelchair. His depressive symptoms persisted, and after he reported thoughts of suicide and feeling unsafe to his psychiatrist, he was voluntarily admitted to the inpatient psychiatry unit of this hospital. A review of systems was notable for malaise, anorexia, poor sleep, anhedonia, hopelessness, guilt, low energy, worsening gait, and chronic joint pain; he reported no recent falls or manic symptoms. The patient’s psychiatric history included bipolar depression with suicide attempts and multiple psychiatric admissions, obsessive–compulsive disorder, and skin picking. His medical history was notable for long-standing urinary incontinence, hypertension, and sleep apnea; he had undergone laser ablation of the prostate 4 years earlier, as well as bilateral inguinal hernia repair and rotator cuff repair. Medications at the time of admission included fluoxetine, lurasidone, valproic acid, aspirin, and lisinopril, as well as lorazepam and trazodone as needed. Lithium had caused tremor, aripiprazole had caused muscle rigidity and tremor, and gabapentin had caused grogginess. The patient did not smoke tobacco, and he drank alcohol less than once monthly; he had previously smoked marijuana several times daily but had been abstinent for 2 years. He was retired from employment as a laborer. He was divorced and resided in an assisted-living facility. His family history was notable for major depression in his mother and bipolar disorder in one of his children. The temperature was 36.1°C, the heart rate 74 beats per minute, the blood pressure 110//61 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.5. The patient was wheelchair-bound. He was described as well-groomed and cooperative, with appropriate eye contact. He was oriented to time, place, and person. His speech was fluent and indicated a logical thought process but was considered to be “slow.” Some of his responses seemed slow, but naming, repetition, attention, concentration, and memory were intact. His mood and affect were described as depressed, and he had suicidal ideation. Results of cranial nerve examination were normal, except for reduced facial expression. Motor examination showed mildly increased tone in the lower legs and left arm, with bradykinesia, and was otherwise normal. The gait was described as being “slow to start” with a “magnetic quality” and then as “shuffling” for a few steps. The remainder of the neurologic and general physical examinations was normal. The white-cell count, platelet count, and levels of hemoglobin, calcium, and albumin were normal, as were results of liver-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Glover: MRI of the head (Figure 2), performed with and without the administration of contrast material, revealed the old infarct in the left corona radiata, features of mild small-vessel disease, and mild diffuse brain parenchymal volume loss with prominence of the ventricles and sylvian fissures. There was no abnormal enhancement. Coronal reformatted images showed a callosal angle (the angle at which the two lateral ventricles meet at the level of the posterior commissure) of 66 degrees. Dr. Luccarelli: Diagnostic tests were performed. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ",

Shah: A 26-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of respiratory failure and altered mental status. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 days before the current admission, when she underwent elective abdominoplasty and liposuction at an ambulatory surgery center. During the procedure, anesthetic agents included intravenous propofol, fentanyl, midazolam, and ketamine, as well as local lidocaine injections. During recovery after the procedure, medications included intravenous cefazolin, enoxaparin, and ondansetron; oral oxycodone, tramadol, and gabapen-tin; and transdermal scopolamine. The patient was lethargic after the procedure but was able to be discharged home after a period of observation. Later that day, the patient was instructed by telephone to take a lower dose of postoperative oxycodone. The next day, on evaluation at the surgical center, she was found to be somnolent but arousable and able to answer questions with effort; the scopolamine patch was removed. Several hours after the patient returned home, her family noticed that she had increased respiratory effort and minimal responsiveness. She was taken by ambulance to the emergency department of a local hospital. In the emergency department, the temperature was 37.7C, the heart rate 130 beats per minute, the blood pressure 121/77 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 83 while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was lethargic, moaned intermittently, and responded with one-word answers; symmetric movement in the arms and legs was observed. Intravenous naloxone was administered, with minor improvement in her condition. Levels of electrolytes and results of kidney- and liver-function tests were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, rightward axis deviation, and nonspecific STT-wave changes. Dr. Dexter P. Mendoza: A chest radiograph showed diffuse confluent opacities in both lungs Fig. 1A. Computed tomography CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material as part of a pulmonary-embolism protocol, ruled out pulmonary embolism but revealed diffuse mixed ground-glass and consolidative opacities involving all lobes of the lungs, with relative sparing of the subpleural lung Fig. 1B. CT of the abdomen revealed postoperative changes. CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed mild effacement of the cerebral sulci and cisterns on both sides, a finding suggestive of mild diffuse cerebral edema Fig. 1C and 1D. There was also a small hypodensity in the left globus pal-lidus, a finding suggestive of infarction. Dr. Shah: Noninvasive bilevel positive airway pressure was initiated, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit ICU at the other hospital. Intravenous vancomycin, piperacil-lintazobactam, levofloxacin, and oseltamivir were administered empirically, and a triple-lumen central venous catheter was inserted. The next morning, the findings on a repeat chest radiograph appeared to be unchanged, but the patient had progressive lethargy, so intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation was initiated. Pink frothy secretions were noted. Intravenous methylprednisolone, propofol, and norepinephrine were administered. A nucleic acid test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coro-navirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 was negative. The tropo-nin I level increased to 4.31 ng per milliliter reference range, 0.029. The thyrotropin, car-boxyhemoglobin, and lipase levels were normal, and tests for Legionella pneumophila and Streptococcus pneumoniae urinary antigens were negative. Later that afternoon, the patient was transferred to the ICU at this hospital. A review of systems was unavailable because intubation was performed on arrival. Medical history that was obtained from family members included iron-deficiency anemia, anxiety disorder, insomnia, and two normal spontaneous vaginal deliveries. Regular medications included lorazepam as needed for sleep; postoperative medications included tramadol, gabapentin, and oxycodone as needed for pain. There were no known adverse reactions to medication. The patient had attended college and worked in an office. She lived with her husband and children. She drank alcohol intermittently and did not use tobacco or other substances. There was no family history of cardiopulmonary or neurologic disorders. The temperature was 36.6C, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 118/78 mm Hg while the patient was receiving norepinephrine at a rate of 8 g per minute. The height was 168 cm and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 27.8. The oxygen saturation was 99 while the patient was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator in volume-control mode tidal volume, 320 ml; positive end-expiratory pressure, 12 cm of water; respiratory rate, 18 breaths per minute; fraction of inspired oxygen, 1.0. The pupils were 2 mm and symmetrically reactive. The lung sounds were coarse. The abdominal incision was well approximated and without drainage; abdominal drains were in place on both sides. A neurologic examination with interruption of sedation showed spontaneous eye-opening but an inability to visually track and to follow commands. Brain-stem reflexes were intact. The legs withdrew equally and briskly in response to pain. The remainder of the examination was normal. A chest radiograph showed diffuse opacities in both lungs. Levels of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, alanine aminotransfer-ase, bilirubin, creatine kinase, lipase, and ammonia were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urine human chorionic gonadotropin was undetectable. Urine toxico-logic screening was negative except for the presence of opiates. Specimens of blood and urine were obtained for microbiologic culture. An electrocardiogram including posterior leads showed sinus rhythm, rightward axis deviation, diminutive Q waves, and minor nonspecific STT-wave abnormalities. An abdominal radiograph showed a nonspecific bowel gas pattern, subcutaneous emphysema, and surgical drains over the pelvis. On bedside cardiac ultrasonography, the left ventricle could not be visualized clearly, but right ventricular dilatation did not appear to be present. Intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and metroni-dazole were administered. Dr. Mendoza: CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed hypodensities in the left basal ganglia and right cerebellum that were suggestive of infarcts; the previously described cerebral edema had reduced slightly. A CT angiogram of the head and neck was normal. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a reduction in ground-glass opacities but an increase in consolidations, particularly in the lower lobes. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a small anterior abdominal hematoma and diffuse subcutaneous emphysema. Dr. Shah: A neurology consultation was obtained; aspirin and atorvastatin were administered. On hospital day 2, the findings on neuro-logic examination worsened, with only sluggish eye-opening and no motor responses to noxious stimuli. Intravenous mannitol at a dose of 1 g per kilogram of body weight was administered. Dr. Mendoza: Repeat CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed a hypodensity in the left glo-bus pallidus that had not changed from the previous study, as well as a hypodensity in the right cerebellum that was not definitive and was probably an artifact. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head showed infarcts within the globi pallidi and smaller punctate infarcts in the cerebral white matter. There were also innumerable diffuse microhemorrhagic foci affecting the cerebral white matter, including the corpus cal-losum Fig. 2. Dr. Shah: Bronchoscopy revealed bloody mucus in the distal trachea Fig. 3. Serial bronchoal-veolar lavage BAL performed in the right upper lobe revealed increasingly erythematous effluent. Lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies were not detected. Levels of C3 and C4 were normal. Tests for antinuclear antibodies and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. Tests for legionella, streptococcus, and galactomannan urinary antigens and antitrepo-nemal antibodies were negative, as was a repeat nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2. Dr. Yasmin Aghajan: On hospital day 3, the pa-tient underwent continuous electroencephalographic monitoring. The study was abnormal because of generalized rhythmic delta activity at a frequency of 1 Hz, which occasionally evolved to generalized periodic discharges superimposed on a disorganized background with irregular delta and theta slowing. There were no epilepti-form abnormalities. Although generalized rhythmic delta activity and generalized periodic discharges are on the ictalinterictal continuum, there were no features suggestive of seizures. The electroencephalographic findings were consistent with encephalopathy and the effects of propofol. A diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ",

She had been taking lorazepam as needed for sleep and had been prescribed tramadol, gabapentin, and oxycodone as needed for pain after her recent surgery. She had no known adverse reactions to medication and did not use tobacco or other substances. Her family history was unremarkable. The patient's symptoms began after she underwent elective abdominoplasty and liposuction at an ambulatory surgery center. She was given intravenous propofol, fentanyl, midazolam, and ketamine, as well as local lidocaine injections, during the procedure. After the procedure, she was given intravenous cefazolin, enoxaparin, and ondansetron, as well as oral oxycodone, tramadol, and gabapentin, and a transdermal scopolamine patch. The patient was lethargic after the procedure but was able to be discharged home after a period of observation. Later that day, she was instructed to take a lower dose of postoperative oxycodone. The next day, she was found to be somnolent but arousable and able to answer questions with effort; the scopolamine patch was removed. Several hours after she returned home, her family noticed that she had increased respiratory effort and minimal responsiveness. She was taken by ambulance to the emergency department of a local hospital. In the emergency department, the temperature was 37.7C, the heart rate 130 beats per minute, the blood pressure 121/77 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 83 while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was lethargic, moaned intermittently, and responded with one-word answers; symmetric movement in the arms and legs was observed. Intravenous naloxone was administered, with minor improvement in her condition. Levels of electrolytes and results of kidney- and liver-function tests were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, rightward axis deviation, and nonspecific STT-wave changes. A chest radiograph showed diffuse confluent opacities in both lungs.

Dudzinski: A 78-year-old man was evaluated in the cardiology clinic of this hospital because of biventricular myocardial wall thickening, progressive mi-tral regurgitation, and ventricular arrhythmias. The patient had been a distinguished multisport athlete in high school and college. However, in his 20s, he found that he was unable to perform competitively, and he noticed that he did not sweat as much as his teammates. After an episode of sports-related exertional dizziness, he was evaluated by a physician, and a diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was considered. Twenty-five years before the current evaluation, a transthoracic echocardiogram TTE reportedly showed a symmetric left ventricular wall thickness of 19 mm reference value, 11, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 74 reference range, 50 to 75, mitral valve thickening, and trace mitral regurgitation, with no left ventricular outflow gradient. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, incomplete right bundle-branch block, precordial J-point elevation, and QRS voltage that met the electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy Fig. 1A. The patients blood pressure was 160/90 mm Hg, and he started treatment with meto-prolol succinate and then also with amlodipine for elevated blood pressure. During the next 10 years, the patient had intermittent chest discomfort, exer-tional dyspnea, and leg edema. The chest discomfort and exertional dyspnea were most likely to occur when he was walking or after he had eaten a meal. He was evaluated by three cardiologists; treatment with metoprolol succinate and amlo-dipine was continued, treatment with enalapril was started, and triamterene hydrochlorothiazide was administered as needed for leg edema. A repeat TTE reportedly showed a symmetric left ventricular wall thickness of 20 mm, a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, right ventricular wall thickening, left atrial enlargement, mitral valve thickening, mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, aortic valve thickening, and mild ascending aortic dilatation 39 mm, with no evidence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and no evidence of systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. An exercise stress test followed by imaging performed with the use of sestamibi (known as a sestamibi stress test) revealed left ventricular wall thickening, with no perfusion defects. Coronary angiography revealed evidence of chronic total occlusion of the distal left anterior descending artery, with collateral flow from both the left and right coronary arteries. Left ventriculography revealed hyperdynamic left ventricular function and 2+ mitral regurgitation (see Video 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). The left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 28 mm Hg (reference range, 5 to 10), with no left ventricular intracavitary gradient, including during ventricular ectopic beats and during the Valsalva maneuver, and with no evidence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The blood pressure remained well controlled while the patient was taking metoprolol, amlodipine, and enalapril. Nine years before the current evaluation, the patient had complete heart block with symptomatic bradycardia (Figure 1B), with associated nausea, dizziness, and chest discomfort. A temporary transvenous pacing wire was placed; the results of coronary angiography performed at that time were unchanged from the previous study. The creatinine level was 1.2 mg per deciliter (106 μmol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.5 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 μmol per liter]); the blood levels of electrolytes and thyrotropin were normal, as were the results of serum protein electrophoresis. A dual-chamber implantable cardioverter–defibrillator (ICD) was placed. Four months later, atrial fibrillation developed. Cardioversion was performed with guidance by transesophageal echocardiography, resulting in sinus rhythm. However, atrial fibrillation recurred after 3 days. Treatment with amiodarone and warfarin was begun. During the next 5 years, recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias were detected on ICD interrogation. A repeat TTE showed a left ventricular wall thickness of 23 mm and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. Four years before the current evaluation, during a holiday trip, the patient was hospitalized in another state because of pulmonary edema that developed after he had consumed food that was high in sodium. He was treated with intravenous furosemide and discharged with a prescription for oral furosemide. Findings on TTE were reportedly similar to those observed previously. Treatment with amlodipine was stopped because of lightheadedness. At follow-up appointments during the next 4 years, the patient reported fatigue and exertional dyspnea that occurred after he had climbed one flight of stairs or when he was walking on an incline. In addition, he had nocturia once per night, slept on two pillows, and had intermittent wheezing, including episodes that awakened him from sleep. Treatment with oral furosemide (administered twice daily) was continued. Recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias were detected on ICD interrogation. Approximately 3.5 years before the current evaluation, the patient sustained a fall that was unrelated to his cardiac condition. At that time, computed tomography of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, did not reveal any evidence of hemorrhage or stroke but showed periventricular and deep white-matter hypodensities. Results of pulmonary-function testing were normal. The patient presented for the current evaluation at the request of his two teenage grandsons, who wanted to know about any familial cardiac risk factors that could influence their participation in sports. A review of systems was notable for intermittent palpitations, chronic dry eyes, reduced hearing, tinnitus in both ears (greater in the right ear than in the left ear), restless legs, and constipation. The patient reported no headache, paresthesia, stroke symptoms, diarrhea, skin changes, or intolerance to heat or cold. His medical history included cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, atrioventricular block and atrial fibrillation, dyslipidemia, hypertension, progressive renal insufficiency, cataracts, and prostatic hypertrophy with carcinoma in situ. Medications included furosemide, warfarin, amiodarone, aspirin, atorvastatin, metoprolol, enalapril, and tamsulosin, as well as inhaled fluticasone. Amiodarone had caused thyroiditis, which had been treated with a course of prednisone; there were no other known adverse reactions to medication. The patient was a retired executive and lived with his spouse in Massachusetts. His family history was notable for brain cancer in his father, obstructive lung disease and lung cancer in his mother, and lung cancer in his sister, who had died from the disease. There was also a history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in his sister and in a niece. His family was of Mediterranean origin; information about other relatives was limited. His son and grandsons were healthy, and his son had reportedly had normal results on an electrocardiogram and echocardiograms. The patient did not drink alcohol and had never used tobacco. On examination, the heart rate was 79 beats per minute and the blood pressure 106//60 mm Hg. The weight was 89 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 26.6. There was a left ventricular heave. Auscultation revealed splitting of the S2 heart sound, a grade 3/6 systolic murmur that could be heard throughout the precordium and did not change during the Valsalva maneuver, and a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex that radiated to the axilla; there was no S3 heart sound. There was trace leg edema and mild chronic venous stasis. The rest of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results were notable for a creatinine level of 1.5 mg per deciliter (133 μmol per liter), a urea nitrogen level of 39 mg per deciliter (13.9 mmol per liter; reference range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter [2.9 to 8.9 mmol per liter]), an international normalized ratio of 2.1 (reference range, 0.9 to 1.1), and an N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide level of 2523 pg per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 1800), as well as 1+ protein on urinalysis. The blood levels of iron, glycated hemoglobin, thyrotropin, and free thyroxine were normal, and a test for antinuclear antibodies was negative. An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing. A TTE was obtained, and additional diagnostic tests were performed. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ",

Alba: A 57-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of persistent cough and pulmonary opacities. Six years before the current admission, the patient received a diagnosis of poly-arteritis nodosa after fevers, arthralgias, abdominal pain, and testicular pain had developed. He was treated with six cycles of cyclophosphamide, followed by maintenance therapy with prednisone and weekly methotrexate. He was treated intermittently with escalating doses of prednisone because of episodic worsening of the arthralgias; the most recent such treatment was given 5 months before the current admission. At that time, owing to an exacerbation of pain associated with the arthralgias and at the direction of his physician, he increased the amount of oxycodone he had been taking. He also reported fever and weight loss. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Jeanna M. Harvey Barnes: Five months before the current admission, computed tomography CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. Chest CT Fig. 1A and 1B revealed mild centrilobular emphysema and small pulmonary nodules that appeared unchanged from those seen on imaging that had been performed 6 years earlier. There was also diffuse thickening of the bronchial wall, layering secretions in the trachea and right main-stem bronchus, a mildly patulous esophagus, and a small hiatal hernia. There were no clinically significant findings on imaging of the abdomen or pelvis. Dr. Alba: A test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. Serum protein electrophoresis results were normal, as was the IgG level. Three months before the current admission, the patient had fevers and a cough productive of green sputum. The temperature was 37.3C and the oxygen saturation 89 while he was breathing ambient air. Thrush was present in the orophar-ynx. Auscultation of the chest revealed crackles and wheezing in the right lung. Blood levels of electrolytes, lipase, amylase, lactate dehydrogenase, and troponin were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Harvey Barnes: A chest radiograph (Figure 1C) showed patchy and confluent opacities predominantly in the right mid and lower lung. Dr. Alba: The patient was admitted to this hospital, and empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin was administered. A blood test for cryptococcal antigen and a urine test for legionella antigen were negative. A sputum culture grew normal respiratory flora and Candida albicans; a test for Pneumocystis jirovecii was negative. During the next several days, fever resolved and the oxygen saturation and white-cell count normalized. On the fifth hospital day, the patient was discharged home to complete a 14-day course of levofloxacin. After he completed the course of levofloxacin, his cough and constitutional symptoms abated partially but did not return to baseline. His primary care physician prescribed inhaled fluticasone–salmeterol and as-needed inhaled albuterol. Six weeks after the patient was discharged from this hospital (approximately 5 weeks before the current admission), his wife began to have a nonproductive cough and rhinorrhea; several days later, the patient had similar symptoms, along with increased production of brown sputum. He sought medical attention after awakening with coughing and dyspnea. The temperature was 38.4°C and the oxygen saturation 89% while he was breathing ambient air. Dr. Harvey Barnes: A chest radiograph (Figure 1D) obtained 1 month before the current admission showed patchy opacities in the right upper, middle, and lower lobes. Dr. Alba: Electrolyte levels were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was again admitted to this hospital, and empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin; oral prednisone; and inhaled albuterol and ipratropium was administered. A sputum culture grew normal respiratory flora and C. albicans. After two days, the patient was discharged home to complete a 7-day course of levofloxacin. Over the course of the next 3 weeks, the patient had malaise, productive cough, fever, and sweats. He stopped smoking cigarettes. Eight days before the current admission, the patient was referred to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. On examination, the temperature was 37.2°C and the oxygen saturation 94% while he was breathing ambient air. There were crackles in both lung bases and in the right middle lung field, with no wheezes. Blood levels of electrolytes and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests and urinalysis; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Harvey Barnes: A chest radiograph (Figure 2A) showed multifocal reticulonodular and patchy opacities, which were confluent in the right lower lobe. CT of the chest (Figure 2B and 2C), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multifocal clustered, centrilobular nodules and opacities in a tree-in-bud pattern with scattered areas of focal consolidation that were present predominantly in the right middle and lower lobes. There was associated mild mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy that had not been present on the previous chest CT examination. Dr. Alba: The patient was again admitted to this hospital, and additional testing was performed. Tests for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies were negative, and blood levels of C3 and C4 were normal. A urine test for legionella antigen was negative. On the third hospital day, a bronchoscopy and a transbronchial biopsy were performed. The bronchoalveolar-lavage (BAL) fluid obtained from the right middle lobe was cloudy; analysis of the fluid revealed 888 nucleated cells per microliter (of which 48% were neutrophils and 2% were lymphocytes, with no eosinophils). Gram’s staining of the BAL fluid revealed neutrophils and sparse growth of gram-positive cocci. Staining for acid-fast organisms was negative; culture grew normal respiratory flora and C. albicans. Tests of the BAL fluid for influenza virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, P. jirovecii, histoplasma antigen, and blastomyces antigen were negative, as were cultures for cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus. An interferon-γ release assay for M. tuberculosis was also negative. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day, with follow-up scheduled in the pulmonary clinic for 3 weeks later. Four days after the patient was discharged, a BAL test for galactomannan returned a positive result (antigen index, ≥3.750; negative test, <0.5), and the patient was readmitted to this hospital. He reported ongoing dyspnea, cough with thick white sputum, and persistent fever with a temperature of up to 39.3°C.  A review of systems was notable for diffuse chronic arthralgias, a bitter taste in the mouth, and intermittent dysphagia.  There was no chest pain, edema, orthopnea, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, or rash, and he had no known current sick contacts.  The weight was 5 kg lower than that recorded 1 year earlier.  Medical history was notable for polyarteritis nodosa, deep venous thrombosis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), pancreatitis in the context of choledocholithiasis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, osteopenia, and chronic neuropathic pain.  Medications included aspirin, prednisone, methotrexate, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, folate supplementation, metformin, atenolol, simvastatin, pregabalin, and as-needed oxycodone, as well as inhaled fluticasone–salmeterol and albuterol as needed.  Lisinopril had reportedly caused pancreatic inflammation;  there were no other known adverse reactions to medications.  The patient was of White European ancestry.  He lived in New England with his wife and was retired from an office position.  Three decades earlier, he had worked in a machine shop where solvents, fuels, and sulfur compounds were used but had had no known exposure to these agents.  There was no history of exposure to mold, pets, or asbestos.  He had received influenza and pneumococcal vaccines.  He and his wife had traveled within the United States and to the Caribbean.  He had smoked 1.5 packs of cigarettes per day for 30 years but had quit in the weeks before the current admission.  He had previously smoked marijuana, rarely consumed alcohol, and never used other substances.  There was no family history of autoimmune or pulmonary disease;  his father had died from colorectal cancer, and his mother had had esophageal cancer and had died after a stroke.  His three adult children were healthy.  The temperature was 36.6°C, the heart rate 75 beats per minute, the blood pressure 135//69 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 91% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute.  He had a slightly cushingoid appearance and was tachypneic, although he was able to speak in full sentences.  Auscultation of the chest revealed rales at the right lung base, rhonchi during both the inspiratory and expiratory phases that were more pronounced in the right lung than in the left lung, and intermittent inspiratory wheezing in the right lung.  The rest of the examination was normal.  Dr. Harvey Barnes: A chest radiograph (Figure 2D) showed progression of the diffuse bilateral reticulonodular opacities, with additional patchy opacities in the right lung and left lower lobe, as compared with the image obtained 1 week earlier.  Dr. Alba: Blood levels of electrolytes, amylase, lipase, N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney and liver function;  other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.  Urinalysis was normal, and a urine test for legionella antigen was negative.  The BAL-fluid culture obtained during the previous admission grew enterococcus species, C. albicans, and C. glabrata;  no mycobacteria grew in any of three induced sputum samples obtained during the previous admission.  Empirical treatment with intravenous voriconazole was initiated, and ongoing treatment with methotrexate was interrupted.  Cytologic analysis of the BAL fluid and the transbronchial-biopsy specimen obtained during the previous admission revealed evidence of acute inflammation, bronchial columnar cells, and pulmonary macrophages.  There were no malignant cells.  Evaluation of the bronchial mucosa revealed no abnormalities.  On the second hospital day, the temperature was 37.9°C and the oxygen saturation 91% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 5 liters per minute.  Dr. Harvey Barnes: Repeat CT of the chest (Figure 2E and 2F) was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material as part of a pulmonary embolism protocol.  This imaging study revealed extensive centrilobular pulmonary nodules, opacities in a tree-in-bud pattern, and patchy ground-glass opacities.  There was bronchial wall thickening with mucus plugging, predominantly affecting the lower lobes.  There were additional areas of nodular consolidation that were more prominent in the right lung than in the left lung.  These findings indicated a progression of disease as compared with the chest CT performed 1 week before the current admission.  There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism.  Dr. Alba: Additional induced sputum samples were obtained for culture;  Gram’s staining revealed abundant neutrophils and abundant mixed gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.  On the third hospital day, the temperature was 36.9°C and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute. Diagnostic tests were performed. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ",

There is bronchial wall thickening with mucus plugging, predominantly affecting the lower lobes. There are additional areas of nodular consolidation that are more prominent in the right lung than in the left lung. These findings indicate a progression of disease as compared with the chest CT performed 1 week before the current admission. There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism. The patient's BAL-fluid culture obtained during the previous admission grew enterococcus species, C. albicans, and C. glabrata; no mycobacteria grew in any of three induced sputum samples obtained during the previous admission. The patient's cytologic analysis of the BAL fluid and the transbronchial-biopsy specimen obtained during the previous admission revealed evidence of acute inflammation, bronchial columnar cells, and pulmonary macrophages. There were no malignant cells. Evaluation of the bronchial mucosa revealed no abnormalities. The patient's additional induced sputum samples were obtained for culture; Gram’s staining revealed abundant neutrophils and abundant mixed gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. The patient's diagnostic tests were performed. The patient's diagnosis is likely to be a pulmonary infection, possibly caused by a fungal or bacterial pathogen.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Jessica L. Logeman Medicine: A 55-year-old man was transferred to this hospital for evaluation of a mediastinal mass that was identified as part of an evaluation for waxing and waning fevers, night sweats, and fatigue. The patient had been well until 3 months before admission to this hospital, when fatigue and a transient pruritic maculopapular rash on the forearm developed. During the next 6 weeks, the forearm rash resolved but fatigue persisted. The patient began to take naps during the daytime and was unable to put in full days at his job in construction work. He also began to have night sweats and fevers with temperatures of up to 37.8C. Twenty-seven days before admission to this hospital, the patient found that he was unable to work because of fatigue, and he sought evaluation in the emergency department of another hospital. Blood tests for anaplasma and babesia nucleic acids were negative, but screening and confirmatory tests for Lyme disease IgM and IgG were positive. A diagnosis of Lyme disease was made, and treatment with doxycycline was initiated. Because gastrointestinal upset developed, doxycycline was discontinued and amoxicillin was prescribed for the remainder of the 14-day course. Sixteen days before admission to this hospital, the patient began to have chest discomfort, which he described as a sensation of a softball in his left lower chest. The chest discomfort limited his ability to breathe, and his primary care physician referred him to the emergency department of the other hospital. On evaluation, he reported increasing fatigue and malaise, night sweats, and fevers, along with diffuse arthralgias and myalgias, headache, photophobia with some visual flashes, dyspnea on exertion, edema, a pruritic erythematous rash on his chest, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort and distention, and watery diarrhea that occurred three times per day. On examination, the temperature was 36.8C, the blood pressure 145/84 mm Hg, the heart rate 61 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 83.9 kg and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 28.1. There was a faint diffuse erythematous macular rash on the anterior portion of the chest. The abdomen was mildly distended and diffusely tender. Blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and lipase were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood was obtained for microbiologic culture. An electrocardiogram was normal. Intravenous normal sa-line and oral acetaminophen were administered, as was empirical treatment with intravenous piperacillintazobactam, hydromorphone, and ondansetron. The patient was admitted to the other hospital. Dr. Reece J. Goiffon: Fifteen days before admission to this hospital, computed tomography CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis Fig. 1A, 1B, and 1C, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a bi-lobed heterogeneous soft-tissue mass, measuring 6.1 cm by 2.8 cm, in the anterior mediastinum. There were multiple enlarged subcarinal and mediastinal lymph nodes measuring up to 15 mm in short-axis diameter, multiple enlarged mes-enteric lymph nodes measuring up to 11 mm in short-axis diameter, mesenteric fat stranding, and trace ascites. Dr. Logeman: Abdominal discomfort persisted; piperacillintazobactam was discontinued and ceftriaxone was prescribed. Two days later, CT of the abdomen, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed new pulmonary edema, new small bilateral pleural effusions, and an increased volume of ascites. The patient was transferred to a second hospital for further evaluation. Physical examination was notable for mild abdominal tenderness and distention, as well as leg edema. Blood levels of alanine aminotrans-ferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and bilirubin and a urinalysis were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. 18F-fluorodeoxy-glucose FDGpositron-emission tomography PET Fig. 1D revealed indeterminate low-level FDG uptake in the anterior mediastinal soft tissue, as well as in pleural effusions and medias-tinal lymph nodes. During the next week, dyspnea and abdominal pain persisted. Edema increased, specifically in the abdomen, legs, and face; the weight increased to 93.0 kg. Intravenous ceftriaxone and metoclopramide and oral hydromorphone, ondan-setron, and lactulose were administered. Additional laboratory tests were performed Table 2. On the eighth day at the second hospital, video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed. The mediastinum reportedly appeared inflamed. The patient underwent an evacuation of pleural fluid and a biopsy of mediastinal soft tissue and lymph nodes primarily in the subcarinal window level VII. On pathological examination of the biopsy specimens, the mediastinal soft tissue showed fibroconnective and adipose tissue with fibrosis, mild inflammation and fat necrosis, prominent capillary proliferation, and congestion; the lymph nodes were reportedly mildly abnormal. Microbiologic evaluation of the biopsy specimens revealed occasional leukocytes but no acid-fast bacilli or fungal elements. On flow cytom-etry of the biopsy specimens, the mediastinal soft tissue did not show any abnormal cell populations; the lymph nodes contained polyclonal B-cell and heterogeneous T-cell populations, without immunophenotypic evidence of lymphoma. Bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures of the biopsy specimens were negative. Cytologic examination of the pleural fluid revealed reactive mesothelial cells, lymphocytes, and histiocytes but no malignant cells. After the procedure, the creatinine level increased to 2.93 mg per deciliter reference range, 0.50 to 1.30. Examination of urinary sediment revealed hyaline and granular casts. Intravenous furosemide was administered. On the 15th day at the second hospital, the patient was transferred to this hospital. On arrival, the patient reported persistent fatigue, mild dyspnea, abdominal distention, edema, and anorexia. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and the chest rash had resolved. Fevers and night sweats had occurred in a waxing and waning pattern during the previous weeks. He reported intermittent photophobia and headache, without neck stiffness or phonophobia, and had no other neurologic symptoms. The patient had no history of illness and had not received routine medical care as an adult. He took ibuprofen and acetaminophen as needed and had no known allergies to medications. He had been exposed to dust through his job in construction work. He lived with his wife, child, and pet dog and cat in a coastal wooded community in New England. He frequently spent time outdoors, either working or playing golf, and had received multiple tick bites. He had traveled to the Mediterranean and Oceania regions in previous years and, more recently, to the southwestern United States. The patient had never used tobacco or illicit drugs and drank beer rarely. His father had had prostate cancer and colon cancer. On examination, the temperature was 36.8C, the blood pressure 148/82 mm Hg, the heart rate 78 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 91.7 kg. Neurologic examination was normal, and there was no nuchal rigidity. There were inspiratory crackles in the left lung. The abdomen was mildly distended and diffusely tender. Mild fluctuance was noted on the right side of the chest, at the site of the surgical incision. There was no palpable cervical, supracla-vicular, submandibular, submental, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. There was 2 pitting edema in the legs. Blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspar-tate aminotransferase, bilirubin, ceruloplasmin, fibrinogen, folate, globulin, haptoglobin, and vitamin B12 were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed cloudy yellow urine with 2 protein and 3 to 5 red cells per high-power field reference range, 0 to 2. An electrocardiogram was normal. Dr. Goiffon: CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis Fig. 1E, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed an anterior mediastinal mass, measuring 6.1 cm by 1.9 cm, which was slightly smaller than it had been on the previous chest CT. There were enlarged perivascular, paratracheal, subcarinal, and aortopulmonary mediastinal lymph nodes measuring up to 12 mm in short-axis diameter with heterogeneous enhancement. Increased pulmonary edema, moderate bilateral pleural effusions, moderate-volume ascites, mild splenomegaly, and multiple subcentimeter mesenteric lymph nodes were detected. Dr. Logeman: On the third hospital day, magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head revealed no abnormalities. On the fourth day, a transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. Intravenous furosemide and oral acetaminophen were administered. Lumbar puncture was performed, and 26 ml of colorless fluid was removed; opening pressure was not measured. Results of cere-brospinal fluid analysis are shown in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. On the fifth day, renal ultrasonography revealed kidneys of normal size with normal parenchyma and no hydronephrosis. Diagnostic paracentesis was performed; results of ascitic fluid analysis are shown in Table S1. Dr. Goiffon: On the 13th day, MRI of the chest was started but could not be completed because the patient had respiratory distress when placed in the prone position. Sequences that were obtained before termination of the study Fig. 1F showed an anterior mediastinal soft-tissue mass with hypointensity on steady-state gradient echo imaging; the mass was smaller than it had been on chest CT performed before transfer to this hospital. In addition, there were enlarged medi-astinal lymph nodes, large bilateral pleural effusions, ascites, and a hematoma at the site of the surgical incision. Dr. Logeman: Additional laboratory tests were performed Table 2. A diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ",

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: CME at NEJM.org Dr. Molly Wolf Medicine and Pediatrics: A 17-year-old boy was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit ICU of this hospital, before the coronavirus disease 2019 Covid-19 pandemic, because of chest pain, syncope, electrocardiographic ECG abnormalities, and elevated blood levels of creatine kinase and troponin T. The patient had been well until 5 days before this admission, when fever, nausea, diarrhea, muscle aches, and chest pain developed. The chest pain radiated to the left shoulder and was worse when he took deep breaths or was lying flat. One episode of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis occurred. On the second day of illness, the patient presented to his primary care clinic at another hospital, where a viral illness was diagnosed. An intramuscular glucocorticoid injection was administered, nebulized albuterol was prescribed, and the patient was advised to take ibuprofen and acetaminophen. During the next 3 days, fever and diarrhea resolved, but chest pain, muscle aches, and nausea persisted and were accompanied by decreased appetite and cold, pale fingers. On the morning of admission, lightheadedness developed. When the patient stood to get a drink of water, he felt unsteady, his vision faded, and syncope occurred. He regained consciousness within 1 minute. Emergency medical services were called, and on arrival they found that the patient was alert and the vital signs were normal. The peripheral blood glucose level, obtained by fingerstick testing, was 24 mg per deciliter 1.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter 3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter. Thiamine and 50 ml of a 50 dextrose solution were administered intravenously, and the patient was transported by ambulance to the emergency department of the other hospital. On arrival at the other hospital, the patient reported pleuritic left parasternal chest pain, which he rated at 4 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The temperature was 36.9C, the pulse 106 beats per minute, the blood pressure 126/72 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 23 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93 while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a flow rate of 2 liters per minute. The pulse oximeter plethysmographic waveform was noted to be of low amplitude, and the oxygen saturation was difficult to obtain. The weight was 95.3 kg and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 32. The fingers were cool, with a capillary refill time of 3 to 4 seconds. Blood levels of alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and lactic acid were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Serum toxicologic screening was negative. Chest radiography revealed a borderline enlarged cardiac silhouette. ECG and echocardiography were performed. Dr. Oscar J. Benavidez: An ECG showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 100 beats per minute Fig. 1. ST-segment elevation and PR-segment depression were present in leads I and II and the lateral precordial leads. There was no atrial or ventricular ectopy. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and normal left ventricular volume and systolic function, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 63; there were no wall-motion abnormalities. The right ventricular volume and systolic function were normal. There was no mitral valve prolapse, but mild mitral regurgitation was present. The aortic dimensions were within normal limits, and there was no pericardial effusion. Doppler imaging revealed normal systolic and diastolic velocities. Dr. Wolf: Three hours after arrival, the patient was transferred by ambulance to the pediatric ICU of this hospital. On admission, he reported that he had intentionally lost 45 kg of weight during the previous year. He took no medications, herbal remedies, or nutritional supplements and had no known allergies. His immunizations were reportedly current. The patient lived with his mother and younger brother. He played sports; he had no known exposure to sick persons and was not sexually active. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His mother had hypertension, unspecified heart disease, and a history of recurrent miscarriages. A brother had died at 56 days of age from sudden infant death syndrome. His maternal grandmother had hypertension and diabetes, and a maternal aunt had systemic lupus erythematosus SLE with nephritis. On examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 37.6C, the pulse 111 beats per minute, the blood pressure 148/72 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 23 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal can-nula at a flow rate of 2 liters per minute. The fingers were cold and pale. Examination of the skin revealed striae on the abdomen. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Tests for influenza virus, respiratory syncy-tial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and human immunodeficiency virus HIV were negative. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.031, a pH of 6.0, and 1 protein. Intravenous fluids, ibuprofen, and famotidine were administered, and supplemental oxygen was discontinued. During the next 24 hours, the chest pain and ECG abnormalities abated and the blood levels of creatine kinase, troponin T, alanine amino-transferase, and aspartate aminotransferase decreased. The patient was discharged home; he was advised to take acetaminophen and ibuprofen as needed for pain, and a follow-up appointment with a pediatric cardiologist was scheduled. Ten days later, in the cardiology clinic, the patient reported that the chest pain had resolved. He appeared well. The pulse was 86 beats per minute and the blood pressure 151/77 mm Hg. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Results of laboratory tests performed in the patients primary care clinic 3 days earlier are shown in Table 1. ECG was performed. Dr. Benavidez: An ECG showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 82 beats per minute Fig. 1. There were nonspecific ST-segment changes in leads III and aVF; ST-segment elevation and PR-segment depression were no longer present. Dr. Wolf: Ultrasonographic examination of the kidneys was normal. Amlodipine was prescribed, and follow-up appointments with a pediatric ne-phrologist and a medical geneticist were scheduled but not kept by the patient. Results of laboratory tests performed in the primary care clinic 6 weeks after discharge are shown in Table 1. Approximately 9.5 months after admission to the pediatric ICU, the patient presented to the emergency department of the other hospital with a 15-hour history of fever, malaise, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, midsternal chest pain, and light-headedness. He rated the chest pain at 6 out of 10. The temperature was 39.3C, the pulse 119 beats per minute, the blood pressure 134/61 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while he was breathing ambient air. On examination, the capillary refill time in the fingers was 3 to 4 seconds. ECG and imaging studies were performed. Dr. Benavidez: An ECG showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 126 beats per minute Fig. 1. There were frequent premature atrial and ventricular contractions, along with diffuse flattening of T waves. Dr. Sjirk J. Westra: Frontal and lateral chest radiography revealed cardiomegaly, as characterized by an increased cardiothoracic ratio, with predominant enlargement of the left atrium Fig. 2. Pulmonary vascular congestion with mild interstitial pulmonary edema and a small left pleural effusion were detected; these findings are suggestive of congestive heart failure. Dr. Wolf: The patient was again transferred by ambulance to the pediatric ICU of this hospital. On admission, he reported that the chest pain had abated. He appeared to be in no distress. The temperature was 38.8C, the pulse 134 beats per minute, the blood pressure 129/49 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 27 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 83.9 kg. On auscultation of the heart, the rhythm was irregular; the remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.027, a pH of 5.0, and 1 protein. Intravenous fluids, magnesium sulfate, sodium phosphate, amlodipine, famotidine, ondansetron, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen were administered. During the next 2 days, fever and intermittent chest pain persisted and hypertension developed, with blood-pressure measurements as high as 187/97 mm Hg. Hydralazine and labetalol were administered, and the dose of amlodipine was increased. On examination, strength in the proximal muscles of the arms and legs was graded as 4 out of 5, with 5 indicating normal muscular contraction against full resistance. There were episodes during which the fingers were cold and pale; no nailfold capillary abnormalities were seen. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. The blood level of troponin T decreased to 0.57 ng per milliliter and the blood level of cre-atine kinase MB isoenzyme decreased to 50.2 ng per milliliter, whereas the blood level of creatine kinase increased to 8336 U per liter; the urine level of myoglobin was 283 g per liter reference value, 21. The results of thyroid-function tests were normal. Some peripheral blood glucose measurements, obtained by fingerstick testing, were as low as 22 mg per deciliter 1.2 mmol per liter, despite a regular diet and the administration of dextrose-containing intravenous fluids. These values were not verified by concurrent central venous blood glucose measurements. Additional test results were received, and a diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ",

Stone: A 59-year-old man was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital because of headache and progressive neurologic dysfunction. Ten months before this evaluation, daily fever with a temperature of up to 38.9C, chills, myalgias, drenching night sweats, and pressure and pain in both cheeks and ears developed. The patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. He reported rhinorrhea and fatigue but no headache, pharyngitis, or dyspnea, and he had no sick contacts. On examination, the temperature was 37.8C, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the blood pressure 112/64 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98 while he was breathing ambient air. He was ill-appearing, and the maxillary sinuses were tender on palpation; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. The platelet count was 463,000 per microliter reference range, 140,000 to 400,000; the remainder of the complete blood count and the differential count were normal. Amoxicillinclavulanate was prescribed. During the next 2 weeks, fever, night sweats, and sinus and facial pain continued. Diffuse headache developed, along with jaw soreness, scalp tenderness, and hip and shoulder stiffness. The patient was evaluated again by his primary care physician. He reported weight loss of 2 kg, episodic double vision, and hip pain that caused difficulty in standing and climbing stairs. The physical examination was unchanged. Urinalysis was normal. A test for heterophile antibody and an interferon- release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were negative, as were screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus and Lyme disease. Chest radiography and computed tomography of the sinuses were normal. The patient was referred to a rheumatologist at another hospital. On evaluation, the patient reported persistent fever and frontal, temporal, and maxillary headache. There were palpable temporal artery pulses without tender-ness; the remainder of the examination was normal, including the absence of bruits on auscultation of large vessels. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 108 mm per hour reference range, 0 to 20, the blood level of C-reactive protein greater than 100 mg per liter reference value, 8.0, the blood level of rheumatoid factor 24 IU per milliliter reference value, 14, and the blood level of aldolase 8.4 IU per milliliter reference value, 8.1. Biopsy of the right temporal artery was performed. Histologic examination of the biopsy specimen reportedly showed no granulomas, but evidence of chronic inflammation of the temporal artery and fibrinoid necrosis of an adjacent small vessel were noted. A diagnosis of giant-cell arteritis was made, and treatment with prednisone was started. Within a few days after initiation of treatment, headache, fever, jaw pain, and joint stiffness abated. The next month, an attempt to lower the predni-sone dose resulted in recurrent severe headache with scalp tenderness, jaw pain, and hip stiffness. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 55 mm per hour and the C-reactive protein level 84 mg per liter. Treatment with weekly subcutaneous administration of tocilizumab was initiated. During the next 6 weeks, another attempt was made to taper the prednisone dose. After 1 week of treatment at a lower prednisone dose, and 5 months after the development of initial symptoms 5 months before the current evaluation, the patient reported headache that he described as the worst headache of my life, with associated jaw pain and diplopia. The pain was worst at the right frontal and maxillary areas, but the entire right side of the face, including the scalp and neck, was affected. The patient returned to the other hospital for evaluation. He was found to have palsies of the third and sixth cranial nerves on the right side. The patient was admitted to the neurology service at the other hospital. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ANCA testing revealed a slightly elevated myeloperoxi-dase antibody level, at 1.9 U reference value, 1.0, but antibodies to proteinase 3 were not detected. Blood levels of IgG subclasses were normal. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Otto Rapalino: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head Fig. 1A and 1B, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed abnormal expansion and en-hancement of the right cavernous sinus that extended into the right superior orbital fissure and right pterygopalatine fossa, as well as abnormal pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement of the adjacent right middle cranial fossa. MRI of the cervical spine Fig. 1C and 1D showed mass-like pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement in the upper cervical spinal canal at C2C4 with an anterior predominance as well as more circumferentially at the cervicothoracic junction C6T3 with a posterior predominance, with resultant canal narrowing and mild cord compression at C7T2. There was no spinal cord edema. Dr. John Stone: A lumbar puncture was performed; an opening pressure was not recorded. The cerebrospinal fluid CSF glucose level was 65 mg per deciliter 3.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 80 mg per deciliter 2.8 to 4.4 mmol per liter, and the protein level was 126 mg per deciliter reference range, 15 to 45, with 2 red cells per microliter and 8 white cells per micro-liter of which 79 were lymphocytes. Grams staining and cultures of the CSF were negative. Tests for CSF myelin basic protein, angiotensin-converting enzyme, cryptococcal antigen, cysti-cercosis IgG, mycobacterial DNA, EpsteinBarr virus DNA, and borrelia DNA were negative, as was a Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test. Cytologic analysis of the CSF showed a mixed population of mononuclear cells with rare plasma cells. The CSF immunoglobulin level was 19 mg per deciliter reference range, 0 to 6, with 5 oligo-clonal bands. On the eighth hospital day, a meningeal biopsy was performed. Treatment with high-dose prednisone was started, and the patient was discharged home. During the next 2 weeks, the patient continued taking the prednisone, but the facial and head pain worsened. He was readmitted to the other hospital to receive 3 days of treatment with parenteral pulse-dose methyl-prednisolone. Pathological examination of the meningeal biopsy specimen revealed a densely fibrotic, chronically inflamed dura mater with large numbers of CD68 macrophages and CD3 T lymphocytes and with focal collections of CD20 B lymphocytes. There was a large number of poly-clonal plasma cells with more than 100 IgG4 plasma cells per high-power field. Storiform fi-brosis was present, and elastin staining revealed obliterative venulitis. Some of the inflammatory foci were angiocentric, but no vasculitis was present. There were rare foci of fibrinoid necrosis and some neutrophils, with rare giant cells but no granulomas. A diagnosis of IgG4-related disease was made, and rituximab was administered. Two days after the first rituximab dose, a pulmonary embolism was diagnosed, and treat-ment with apixaban was initiated. Two weeks later, repeat imaging was obtained to evaluate the treatment response. Dr. Rapalino: Repeat MRI of the head Fig. 2A and 2B, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed increased abnormal enhancement in the right cavernous sinus and right middle cranial fossa and new abnormal enhancement in the left cavernous sinus and adjacent left middle cranial fossa. MRI of the cervical spine Fig. 2C and 2D also showed progression in the extent and thickness of the ventral and dorsal pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement. There was also progression of the canal stenosis, which had become severe, and cord compression at the C7 level. There was no cord signal abnormality. fusion of rituximab, as well as treatment with oral dexamethasone. Three weeks later, and 7 months after the development of initial symptoms 3 months before the current evaluation, the patient was admitted to the other hospital because of worsening headache, nausea, and vomiting. Examination was notable for new sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear and deviation of the tongue to the left. A ventriculoperitoneal shuntDr. John Stone: The patient received a second in-was placed. Treatment with dexamethasone was continued, and the patient was discharged home. Three weeks after placement of the ventriculo-peritoneal shunt, the patient was admitted again to the other hospital because of streptococcal infection. Two months after discharge, and 10 months after the development of initial symptoms, he was seen in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital for additional evaluation. The patient had a history of migraines, hypertension, and a heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation. Medications included apixaban, ba-clofen, dexamethasone, furosemide, gabapentin, lisinopril, and metoprolol. He was a retired businessman and lived with his wife. He drank one glass of wine weekly and had quit smoking more than 40 years before the current evaluation. His maternal grandfather had died from a ruptured aortic aneurysm. The temperature was 36.5C, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, the blood pressure 118/79 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 25.8. The scalp hair was thin. He had cushingoid facies; acne on the face, back, and chest; striae on the flanks; and proximal muscle weakness of the arms and legs. There was no scalp or temporal tenderness. He had no tongue lesions or oral ulcers, and the nasal examination showed no crusting. Extra-ocular movements were intact. There was no arthritis. The chest, abdominal, and neurologic examinations were normal. The complete blood count and the differential count were normal, as was a urinalysis. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 52 mm per hour and the C-reactive protein level 5 mg per liter. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed an IgM level of 22 mg per deciliter reference range, 53 to 334 and normal levels of IgG and IgA. ANCA testing was negative. A diagnosis and management decisions were made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ",

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: CME Dr. Carolina Geadas Medicine: A 70-year-old man with a history of kidney transplantation was evaluated at this hospital because of multiple erythematous rashes that had developed during an admission for respiratory failure, pneumococcal bactere-mia, and kidney failure. Approximately 4.5 years before the current admission, the patient received a diagnosis of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ANCAassociated vasculitis after he presented with progressive glomerulonephritis with kidney failure and new hemoptysis. The anti-myeloperoxidase antibody titer was 221.0 U reference value, 2.8. The patient underwent plasmapheresis, and cyclophosphamide and prednisone were administered. Hemodialysis was initiated. Two weeks later, ritux-imab was administered, and cyclophosphamide and prednisone were discontinued. During the next 4 years, his renal function did not improve, and treatment with rituximab and hemodialysis was continued. Four months before the current admission, the patient underwent transplantation of a kidney from a deceased donor with hepatitis C virus antibodypositive status. After the kidney transplantation, immunosuppressive therapy included a dose of basiliximab, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and tapering doses of prednisone. The patient had delayed graft function; the blood creatinine level decreased from approximately 4.00 mg per deciliter 354 mmol per liter immediately after transplantation to 1.50 mg per deciliter 133 mmol per liter 6 weeks later. Six days before the current admission, at a routine follow-up visit, the cre-atinine level was 1.33 mg per deciliter 118 mmol per liter. Four days before the current admission, the patient began to have central abdominal discomfort, nausea, anorexia, chills, and diarrhea with loose stools three times per day. During the next several days, he noticed decreased urine output and malaise, and he began to have rhinorrhea, cough, sinus congestion, and dyspnea. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital. A review of systems was notable for palpitations and dizziness and was negative for fever, emesis, and hematuria. The patients brother had recently received a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 Covid-19. The patients medical history was notable for vasculitis with end-stage kidney disease culminating in kidney transplantation, coronary artery disease with placement of a stent in the right coronary artery, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cholelithiasis with cholecystectomy, colonic polyps and diverticulosis, gout, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, hypothyroidism, sleep apnea, hernia with hernia repair, and spinal stenosis. Medications taken at home included mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, prednisone, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, valganciclovir, warfarin, aspirin, atorvastatin, levothyroxine, and cholecalciferol, as well as lorazepam as needed. Penicillin had caused anaphylaxis. The patient was a retired business owner and lived with family in Boston. He had a remote history of tobacco smoking that totaled 10 pack-years; he had quit smoking approximately 40 years earlier. He did not drink alcohol or use other substances. His family history was notable for diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease in his father and siblings. There was no known family history of kidney or autoimmune disease. The temperature was 36.4C, the heart rate 130 beats per minute, the blood pressure 109/56 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 84 while the patient was breathing ambient air, 92 while he was receiving oxygen through a nasal can-nula at a rate of 6 liters per minute, and 100 while he was receiving oxygen through a high-flow nasal cannula at a rate of 60 liters per minute. On examination, he appeared acutely ill and weak. He had bitemporal cachexia, dry oral mucosa, and increased work of breathing. Auscultation of the chest revealed tachypnea, diminished breath sounds and crackles in the lungs, and tachycardia. There was tenderness in the periumbilical area and the right lower quadrant, at the site of the kidney transplantation; the incision was well healed. Blood levels of lipase, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood and urine specimens were obtained for culture. An electrocardiogram showed possible sinus tachycardia with right bundle-branch block. Vanco-mycin and cefepime were administered intravenously. Three hours after presentation, a test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 RNA was positive, and remdesivir and dexamethasone were administered intravenously. Dr. Joseph D. King: Radiography of the chest Fig. 1A revealed confluent basilar consolidation in the left lung and scattered patchy opacities in the right lung. Ultrasonography that targeted the renal allograft revealed normal renal parenchyma and a trace amount of adjacent free fluid. Doppler ultrasonography Fig. 1B through 1E showed patent vasculature with normal flow velocities but showed elevated renal arterial resistive indexes, which are suggestive of allograft dysfunction. Computed tomography CT of the chest Fig. 1F and 1G, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed confluent consolidation in the lower lobes of both lungs, with more extensive findings in the left lung than in the right lung, as well as patchy multifocal consolidative and ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes of both lungs and the middle lobe of the right lung. Concurrent CT of the abdomen and pelvis Fig. 1H, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was remarkable for only a trace amount of free fluid in the right lower quadrant, along the renal allograft. Dr. Geadas: The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit ICU of this hospital. Phenylephrine was administered intravenously. He could not be weaned from the high-flow nasal cannula; because he had increased work of breathing and tachypnea, tracheal intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation initiated. Bronchoscopy revealed dark secretions in the lower lobe and lingula of the left lung. Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae in four of four bottles. A blood test for cyto-megalovirus CMV DNA and a urine test for legionella antigen were negative, and serum levels of 1,3--d-glucan and galactomannan were undetectable. Azithromycin, cefepime, linezolid, amiodarone, furosemide, and vitamin K were administered intravenously, and valganciclovir and atovaquone were administered orally. A trans-thoracic echocardiogram showed low-normal ventricular function, atrial enlargement, and no valvular vegetations. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration was initiated. ANCA titers were undetectable. On hospital day 3, excoriation and erythema of the buttock and a purpuric plaque on the sacrum were noted Fig. 2A. Repeat CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed no changes. Punch biopsy of skin on the right buttock was performed. The antibiotic regimen was transitioned to intravenous ceftriaxone. The following day, histologic examination of the skin-biopsy specimen revealed epidermal necrosis, with scattered apoptotic and necrotic keratinocytes and extravasated erythrocytes. No microorganisms were identified, and microbio-logic culture of the biopsy specimen was negative. Laboratory test results obtained on hospital day 4 are shown in Table 1. During the next 6 days, treatment with continuous venovenous hemofiltration and intravenous ceftriaxone was continued. The level of mechanical ventilation was reduced from mandatory provided breaths to spontaneous ventilation, and the mode was switched to pressure-support ventilation. Repeat blood cultures were negative. On hospital day 11, the patients respi-ratory status worsened; the fraction of inspired oxygen was increased, and a mandatory respiratory rate was reinstituted. Two days later, a new well-circumscribed pur-puric patch was noted on the abdomen Fig. 2B. The patch measured 5 cm in greatest dimension and had a hyperpigmented halo but had no fluctu-ance or crepitus. The next day, a similar-appearing lesion was noted on the right thigh. Laboratory test results obtained on hospital day 14 are shown in Table 1. Dr. King: Repeat CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed increased consolidative and ground-glass opacities in both lungs. Dr. Geadas: Ceftriaxone was discontinued, and vancomycin, cefepime, and liposomal ampho-tericin B were administered intravenously. A diagnosis and management decisions were made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ",
