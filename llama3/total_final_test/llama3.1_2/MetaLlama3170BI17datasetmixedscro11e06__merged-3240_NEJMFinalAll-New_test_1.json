She had been prescribed antibiotics for a possible infection, but had stopped taking them due to lack of improvement. On examination, she had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 10, and her pupils were round, equal, and sluggishly reactive to light. She had a hematoma on her forehead and facial abrasions. Her white-cell count was elevated, and her blood levels of potassium and phosphorus were low. CT scans of her head and cervical spine were performed, and an MRI of her head was also done. The MRI showed restricted diffusion involving the cortex of the right temporal lobe, right occipital lobe, right superior and inferior parietal lobule, and right cingulate gyrus, as well as the right insula and right thalamus. The patient was intubated for airway protection and was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. She was given levetiracetam and underwent EEG monitoring. Lumbar puncture was performed, and analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed clear, colorless fluid with a glucose level of 92 mg per deciliter and a total protein level of 33 mg per deciliter. Grams staining revealed very few neutrophils and mononuclear cells and no organisms. Cultures of the blood, urine, and CSF were obtained."

        "The patient had a history of muscle weakness that began 15 years earlier, with increasing weakness of his hands, difficulty walking, and episodes of lightheadedness. He was diagnosed with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and began taking warfarin. He also had a history of obstructive sleep apnea, sudden sensorineural hearing loss, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, morbid obesity, cholelithiasis, problems with ejaculation, noninsulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus, gastroesophageal reflux disease, depression, vitamin B12 and vitamin D deficiencies, and episodes of pneumonia thought to be related to aspiration. He was taking several medications, including warfarin, pravastatin, pioglitazone, metformin, ketoconazole, atenolol, citalopram, furosemide, pantoprazole, and bupropion. He had a family history of an undefined neuromuscular problem and lung and uterine cancer. On examination, the patient was sedated and paralyzed, with coarse breath sounds in the lungs and active bowel sounds. He had trace edema of both legs and a soft, nondistended abdomen. The pupils were sluggishly reactive, and oculocephalic and corneal reflexes were absent. The arms and legs had minimal withdrawal and possible posturing. The patient's condition deteriorated, and he died on the fifth hospital day. An autopsy was performed. The final diagnosis was not provided in the case report. However, based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, it is likely that he had a neuromuscular disorder, such as myotonic dystrophy, which is a genetic disorder that affects muscle tone and can cause a range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, difficulty walking, and heart problems. The patient's family history of an undefined neuromuscular problem and his own symptoms and medical history are consistent with this diagnosis."

        "1. Three days later and 3.5 weeks before this evaluation, the patient underwent surgical exploration and cytoreduction for a presumptive diagnosis of mullerian adenocarcinoma. Clindamycin and gentamicin were administered preoperatively; phenylephrine, insulin, calcium chloride, fentanyl, hydromorphone, lactated Ringers solution, albumin, and 3 units of packed red cells were administered during the procedure. Operative findings included approximately 2 liters of straw-colored ascitic fluid, tumor nodules in the splenic hilum and parenchyma and studding the right hemi-diaphragm, replacement of the gastrocolic omentum by tumor, and obliteration of the cul-de-sac by a large pelvic mass invading and partially obstructing the rectosigmoid colon. Gastrocolic omentectomy, splenectomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, resections of the pelvic mass and rectosigmoid colon with primary reanastomosis, and plasma energy vaporization of tumor nodules on the right hemidiaphragm were performed. Resection specimens were submitted for histopathological examination. Dr. Kristen M. Basnet: The primary resection specimen consisted of a 15.2-cm aggregate of large bowel, uterus, and adnexal structures that were firmly adherent one to another and contained a 15.0-cm irregular, firm, tan-white mass Fig. 2A. The cervix, the spleen, and portions of the omentum were submitted separately for examination. Microscopic examination revealed high-grade carcinoma in the ovaries, invading the muscularis propria of the large bowel Fig. 2B, and adjacent to the fallopian tubes Fig. 2C. The tumor was also seen adjacent to the uterine serosa and in the omentum, spleen, and mesentory of the transverse colon. The tumor was composed of nests and cords of pleomorphic cells with high mitotic activity Fig. 2D and had slit-like spaces and psammomatous calcifications Fig. 2E. On immunohistochemical staining, the tumor cells were positive for PAX8 Fig. 2F and negative for p53. The findings were consistent with high-grade carcinoma of mullerian origin. Mullerian carcinoma may most recognizably originate in a pelvic organ, such as the ovary, fallopian tube, or uterus, but it may also be found multifocally in the peritoneum without clear evidence of a particular site of origin, as was the case with this patient. Dr. Panelli: The patient had persistent hypotension after surgery and was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit, where phenylephrine and mechanical ventilatory support were continued. A right pneumothorax was managed with chest-tube placement. On the first day after surgery, the trachea was extubated. The next day, phenylephrine was discontinued, 2 units of packed red cells were transfused, and the patient was transferred to the inpatient unit, where the chest tube was removed 1 day later. Quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine serogroups A, C, Y, and W, 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, and Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine were administered. On the seventh day after surgery, the patient was discharged home. Three days after discharge and 16 days before this evaluation, the patient was seen in the gynecologic oncology surgery clinic at this hospital for follow-up. She was thought to be recovering well, and the staples were removed from her surgical incision. A plan was made to schedule chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin at the other hospital. Eighteen days after discharge and 1 day before this evaluation, the patient returned to the gynecologic oncology surgery clinic because of fatigue, anorexia, abdominal pain, bloating, and alternating constipation and diarrhea. She had not yet begun chemotherapy. She reported that abdominal pain and irregular bowel movements had been present since surgery and that the night before this presentation, she had tried medical marijuana, which she had obtained from a friend, as a treatment for pain before going to sleep. When she awoke 14 hours later, she felt drowsy and the abdominal pain persisted. Abdominal imaging was performed. Dr. Lowry: CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed postsurgical changes that had occurred since she had undergone the peritoneal cytoreduction, total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, splenectomy, and rectosigmoid colon resection. Ascites had decreased, and only trace residual perihepatic fluid was present Fig. 3A. No abscesses were identified. There was no evidence of obstruction or inflammatory changes of the bowel Fig. 3B, and the rectosigmoid anastomosis was unremarkable in appearance Fig. 3C. Dr. Panelli: The patient was admitted to the hospital. On admission, she reported feeling very tired. The temperature was 36.8C, the pulse 97 beats per minute, the blood pressure 154/85 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 29 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while she was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft and mildly distended, without tenderness. The anion gap and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of magnesium, globulin, and total bilirubin; other laboratory test results are shown in Table "

        "The patient's symptoms and test results suggest a diagnosis of interstitial lung disease (ILD) with autoimmune features. The patient's history of eczema, hypothyroidism, and positive ANA titer support an autoimmune etiology. The chest CT scans show diffuse bilateral mosaic attenuation and multiple bilateral lung nodules, which are consistent with ILD. The patient's symptoms of dyspnea on exertion and cough are also consistent with ILD. The patient's response to oral prednisone, with improvement in the eczematous rash but persistence of dyspnea on exertion, suggests that the ILD may be steroid-responsive. The patient's negative myositis antibody panel and negative tests for ANCA, anticyclic citrullinated peptide, rheumatoid factor, and antidouble-stranded DNA, anti-Ro, anti-La, anti-Smith, antiribonucleoprotein, antitopoisomerase I antiScl-70, antimitochondrial, antithyroperoxidase, and anti histidyltransfer RNA synthase antiJo-1 antibodies make it less likely that the patient has a specific autoimmune disorder such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or scleroderma. The patient's weakly positive titer in response to anti-Ku antibodies is nonspecific and does not support a specific diagnosis. Overall, the patient's symptoms and test results are most consistent with a diagnosis of interstitial lung disease with autoimmune features, and the patient should be treated with immunosuppressive therapy."

        "1. Cultures of blood, urine, and sputum were obtained. During the first 3 days of this admission, the patient became lethargic; when he was awakened, his speech was incoherent and dysarthric. MRI of the head revealed a stable right subdural hygroma with a midline shift of 10 mm, as well as a stable right cerebellar cavernous malformation. There were punctate and patchy foci characterized by hyperintensity on FLAIR imaging and restricted diffusion in the midbrain, pons, medulla, left cerebellum, right occipital lobe, and left thalamus; the foci had increased in size and extent from the previous study. Positron-emission tomography CT revealed multiple foci of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in periaortic soft tissue and paraaortic lymph nodes, in the axial skeleton, and in the left testis. Blood tests for alpha-fetoprotein, 1,3--d-glucan, coxiella antibodies, cytomegalovirus IgM and IgG, cryptococcal antigen, human chorionic gonadotropin, and Treponema pallidum antibodies were negative, as was a urine test for histoplasma antigen. Electroencephalographic monitoring showed frequent sharp, irregular delta and theta discharges; treatment with levetiracetam was started. On the fourth hospital day, the temperature was 38.3C. Ultrasound images showed testes of normal size and echotexture without focal lesions, but the epididymides were enlarged and heterogeneous. The kidneys were normal in size, with diffusely echogenic parenchyma, and a 19-mm bladder stone was present. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal ventricular function, no evidence of clinically significant valvular disease, and a mildly dilated aorta. Flow cytometry showed a markedly reduced CD4 T-cell count. Antibody tests for bartonella and brucella were negative. Somnolence progressed, and on the fifth hospital day, the right pupil was noted to be slightly larger than the left and the patient had increased tremor. Fosphenytoin therapy was initiated, and he was transferred to the neurologic intensive care unit. The oxygen saturation declined to 90 while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute, and a Cheyne-Stokes pattern of respiration was observed. The trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was initiated. A diagnosis was made. The patient had a history of non-muscle-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma, which was treated with transurethral resection and intravesical BCG. He also had a history of hypothyroidism, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, progressive kidney disease, degenerative joint disease of the lumbar spine, scoliosis, tubular adenoma, and leukopenia. He was taking prednisone, methotrexate, folic acid, aspirin, levothyroxine, simvastatin, tamsulosin, cholecalciferol, sodium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate, omeprazole, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fluticasone-salmeterol, and as-needed inhaled albuterol. He had a remote history of smoking and drank alcohol infrequently. He had no recent travel, environmental, animal, or toxic exposures. There was no family history of autoimmune, neurologic, infectious, or pulmonary disorders. The patient was cachectic and appeared chronically ill. He had a subtle facial droop on the left side, tremors in the arms and legs at rest and with motion, right foot drop, and diffusely increased tone. Bibasilar crackles were heard on lung auscultation, and hepatosplenomegaly was present. There were diffuse ecchymoses on the trunk, arms, and legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. The international normalized ratio and blood levels of ammonia, bilirubin, creatine kinase, folic acid, globulin, haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, lactic acid, and magnesium were normal. The ACE level was 36 U per liter. Serum protein electrophoresis showed no bands, but a mild, diffuse decrease in globulin was noted. The urine free kappa light-chain level was 134.2 mg per deciliter, and the urine free lambda light-chain level was 35.6 mg per deciliter, with a normal ratio. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table "

        "1. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, rightward axis deviation, and nonspecific STT-wave changes. A chest radiograph showed diffuse confluent opacities in both lungs. Computed tomography CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material as part of a pulmonary-embolism protocol, ruled out pulmonary embolism but revealed diffuse mixed ground-glass and consolidative opacities involving all lobes of the lungs, with relative sparing of the subpleural lung. CT of the abdomen revealed postoperative changes. CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed mild effacement of the cerebral sulci and cisterns on both sides, a finding suggestive of mild diffuse cerebral edema. There was also a small hypodensity in the left globus pallidus, a finding suggestive of infarction. Noninvasive bilevel positive airway pressure was initiated, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit ICU at the other hospital. Intravenous vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, levofloxacin, and oseltamivir were administered empirically, and a triple-lumen central venous catheter was inserted. The next morning, the findings on a repeat chest radiograph appeared to be unchanged, but the patient had progressive lethargy, so intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation was initiated. Pink frothy secretions were noted. Intravenous methylprednisolone, propofol, and norepinephrine were administered. A nucleic acid test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 was negative. The troponin I level increased to 4.31 ng per milliliter. The thyrotropin, carboxyhemoglobin, and lipase levels were normal, and tests for Legionella pneumophila and Streptococcus pneumoniae urinary antigens were negative. Later that afternoon, the patient was transferred to the ICU at this hospital. A review of systems was unavailable because intubation was performed on arrival. Medical history that was obtained from family members included iron-deficiency anemia, anxiety disorder, insomnia, and two normal spontaneous vaginal deliveries. Regular medications included lorazepam as needed for sleep; postoperative medications included tramadol, gabapentin, and oxycodone as needed for pain. There were no known adverse reactions to medication. The patient had attended college and worked in an office. She lived with her husband and children. She drank alcohol intermittently and did not use tobacco or other substances. There was no family history of cardiopulmonary or neurologic disorders. The temperature was 36.6C, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 118/78 mm Hg while the patient was receiving norepinephrine at a rate of 8 g per minute. The height was 168 cm and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 27.8. The oxygen saturation was 99 while the patient was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator in volume-control mode tidal volume, 320 ml; positive end-expiratory pressure, 12 cm of water; respiratory rate, 18 breaths per minute; fraction of inspired oxygen, 1.0. The pupils were 2 mm and symmetrically reactive. The lung sounds were coarse. The abdominal incision was well approximated and without drainage; abdominal drains were in place on both sides. A neurologic examination with interruption of sedation showed spontaneous eye-opening but an inability to visually track and to follow commands. Brain-stem reflexes were intact. The legs withdrew equally and briskly in response to pain. The remainder of the examination was normal. A chest radiograph showed diffuse opacities in both lungs. Levels of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, creatine kinase, lipase, and ammonia were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table "

        "1. The patient's chest radiograph shows progression of the diffuse bilateral reticulonodular opacities, with additional patchy opacities in the right lung and left lower lobe, as compared with the image obtained 1 week earlier. The patient's CT of the chest reveals extensive centrilobular pulmonary nodules, opacities in a tree-in-bud pattern, and patchy ground-glass opacities. There is bronchial wall thickening with mucus plugging, predominantly affecting the lower lobes. There are additional areas of nodular consolidation that are more prominent in the right lung than in the left lung. These findings indicate a progression of disease as compared with the chest CT performed 1 week before the current admission. There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism. The patient's BAL-fluid culture obtained during the previous admission grew enterococcus species, C. albicans, and C. glabrata; no mycobacteria grew in any of three induced sputum samples obtained during the previous admission. The patient's cytologic analysis of the BAL fluid and the transbronchial-biopsy specimen obtained during the previous admission revealed evidence of acute inflammation, bronchial columnar cells, and pulmonary macrophages. There were no malignant cells. Evaluation of the bronchial mucosa revealed no abnormalities. The patient's additional induced sputum samples were obtained for culture; Gram’s staining revealed abundant neutrophils and abundant mixed gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. The patient's diagnostic tests were performed. The patient's diagnosis is likely to be a pulmonary infection, possibly caused by a fungal or bacterial pathogen. The patient's symptoms, laboratory test results, and imaging studies are consistent with this diagnosis.
