She experienced fulminant hepatic failure 3 months ago and underwent a liver transplant 2 weeks later. Postoperative pathological results showed hepatolenticular degeneration. Routine prophylactic antiherpes virus therapy had been applied for 2 weeks. Immunosuppressants, including tacrolimus and mycophenolate sodium, were applied for subsequent maintenance therapy. She noticed the onset of decreased vision in both eyes about 2 months after the liver transplant. Diagnosed with ocular herpes virus infection, she was given systemic valaciclovir and ocular laser retinopexy around areas of necrosis. Her vision was not improved and twice intravitreous injection of ganciclovir was added. However, vision was decreasing continuously. At her presentation to our clinic, the best-corrected visual acuity was finger count in the right eye and 20/125 in the left eye.

She experienced fulminant hepatic failure 3 months ago and underwent a liver transplant 2 weeks later. Postoperative pathological results showed hepatolenticular degeneration. Routine prophylactic antiherpes virus therapy had been applied for 2 weeks. Immunosuppressants, including tacrolimus and mycophenolate sodium, were applied for subsequent maintenance therapy. She noticed the onset of decreased vision in both eyes about 2 months after the liver transplant. Diagnosed with ocular herpes virus infection, she was given systemic valaciclovir and ocular laser retinopexy around areas of necrosis. Her vision was not improved and twice intravitreous injection of ganciclovir was added. However, vision was decreasing continuously. At her presentation to our clinic, the best-corrected visual acuity was finger count in the right eye and 20/125 in the left eye. On slitlamp examination of both eyes, 1+ aqueous cells and 1+ flare were presented in the anterior chamber, while the dilated fundus examination showed mild inflammation in the vitreous.

Computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed a 2-cm radio-opaque osseous foreign body at the level of the cricopharyngeus muscle with signs of esophageal perforation, including air leak tracking toward the left lobe of the thyroid gland (Figure, A and B). The patient was brought to the operating room, and the esophageal foreign body was successfully removed. Postoperatively, the patient continued to become febrile despite intravenous antibiotic therapy.

Physical examination results revealed multiple firm skin-colored papules and nodules coalescing to form a large plaque on the anterior aspect of the left lower leg, whereas the right lower leg had diffuse induration and hyperpigmentation (Figure 1). There was no palpable lymphadenopathy. Laboratory analysis revealed normal complete blood cell count, thyroid function, serum protein electrophoresis, and serum immunofixation. A biopsy of a left leg nodule was performed. \n### OUTPUT:\n    <|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>agent", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "min_tokens": 1, "temperature": 0.0, "until": ["Question", "</s>"]}}}, "resps": [["\nStep 1: Elephantiasis nostras verrucosa  \nStep 2: Lymphedema  \nStep 3: Lymphangiosarcoma  \nStep 4: Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma  \nStep 5: Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma  \nStep 6: Sarcoidosis  \nStep 7: Nodular amyloidosis  \nStep 8: Cutaneous metastasis  \nStep 9: Cutaneous tuberculosis  \nStep 10: Cutaneous leishmaniasis  \n\n**Reranked Differential Diagnoses:**\n\n1.

Laboratory study results revealed a white blood cell count of 150/μL (reference range, 3500/μL to 10 500/μL), an absolute neutrophil count of 130/μL (reference range, 1500/μL to 7400/μL), and a platelet count of 19 ×103/μL (reference range, 150 ×103/μL to 400 ×103/μL). (To convert the white blood cell and neutrophil counts to cells ×109/L, multiply by 0.001; conversion of the platelet count to cells ×109/L is 1:1.) Blood culture results were negative. The results of a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage, territorial infarction, or mass effect. The results of a CT scan of the chest demonstrated multifocal bilateral ground-glass patchy opacities, scattered solid bilateral pulmonary nodules, and a moderately sized pericardial effusion. A biopsy specimen from a skin nodule on the left lateral thigh was obtained for histopathologic examination and tissue culture, and wet mount preparation of a tissue culture colony was performed (Figure, B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    <|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>agent", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "min_tokens": 1, "temperature": 0.0, "until": ["Question", "</s>"]}}}, "resps": [["\nStep 1: Disseminated candidiasis  \nStep 2: Disseminated aspergillosis  \nStep 3: Disseminated fusariosis  \nStep 4: Disseminated mucormycosis  \nStep 5: Disseminated herpes simplex virus infection  \nStep 6: Disseminated varicella-zoster virus infection  \nStep 7: Sweet's syndrome  \nStep 8: Leukemia cutis  \nStep 9: Ecthyma gangrenosum  \nStep 10: Pyoderma gangrenosum  \n\n**Reranked Differential Diagnoses:**\n\n1.

An intraoperative rupture of the thin capsule caused some spillage of cystic contents that were milky white in some areas and mucinous in others. \n### OUTPUT:\n    <|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>agent", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "min_tokens": 1, "temperature": 0.0, "until": ["Question", "</s>"]}}}, "resps": [["\nStep 1: Branchial cleft cyst  \nStep 2: Lymphangioma  \nStep 3: Thyroglossal duct cyst  \nStep 4: Epidermoid cyst  \nStep 5: Dermoid cyst  \nStep 6: Hemangioma  \nStep 7: Lymphatic malformation  \nStep 8: Teratoma  \nStep 9: Cystic hygroma  \nStep 10: Ranula  \n\n**Reranked Differential Diagnoses:**\n\n1.

His histology results showed a 5-cm Warthin tumor, with a focus of nodular oncocytic hyperplasia in the adjacent parenchyma and reactive intraparotid lymph nodes. He presented to the ear, nose, and throat clinic and complained of pain in the operative site of 6 months duration. This occurred intermittently once a week and lasted for a few minutes each time. It was associated with a small lump over the left neck, and the pain was worse on touch and head turning.

Suspicious retinal detachment and intraocular mass were identified, which raised concerns for choroidal melanoma. No symptoms or signs were reported in the right eye. Her ocular history included bilateral cataract surgery 5 years prior. Review of systems yielded negative results, including for ocular trauma, jaundice, and cutaneous melanoma. She had no history of tobacco use. On examination of the left eye, visual acuity was hand motion, and intraocular pressure was 8 mm Hg. The anterior segment showed diffuse conjunctival chemosis of yellow hue, low-grade aqueous reaction, and pseudophakia (Figure 1A). On the fundus evaluation, large pockets of subretinal fluid suggested choroidal effusion based on marked fluid shifting with head position.

Suspicious retinal detachment and intraocular mass were identified, which raised concerns for choroidal melanoma. No symptoms or signs were reported in the right eye. Her ocular history included bilateral cataract surgery 5 years prior. Review of systems yielded negative results, including for ocular trauma, jaundice, and cutaneous melanoma. She had no history of tobacco use. On examination of the left eye, visual acuity was hand motion, and intraocular pressure was 8 mm Hg. The anterior segment showed diffuse conjunctival chemosis of yellow hue, low-grade aqueous reaction, and pseudophakia (Figure 1A). On the fundus evaluation, large pockets of subretinal fluid suggested choroidal effusion based on marked fluid shifting with head position. B-scan ultrasonography confirmed 4-quadrant choroidal hemorrhage and partially mobile serous retinal detachment.

She denied a history of fever, otorrhea, prior ear infections, vertigo, or otologic surgery. The patient first saw her primary care physician, who visualized a mass in the right ear canal and attempted needle aspiration, which led to self-resolved bleeding. She was given ciprofloxacin ear drops and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, which did not improve her symptoms. On examination, her right external auditory canal (EAC) was completely obstructed by a fleshy, pulsatile mass with a red hue (Figure 1A). Results of Weber tuning fork examination lateralized to the right ear and a Rinne examination suggested a conductive hearing loss.

She denied a history of fever, otorrhea, prior ear infections, vertigo, or otologic surgery. The patient first saw her primary care physician, who visualized a mass in the right ear canal and attempted needle aspiration, which led to self-resolved bleeding. She was given ciprofloxacin ear drops and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, which did not improve her symptoms. On examination, her right external auditory canal (EAC) was completely obstructed by a fleshy, pulsatile mass with a red hue (Figure 1A). Results of Weber tuning fork examination lateralized to the right ear and a Rinne examination suggested a conductive hearing loss. Formal audiogram results confirmed conductive hearing loss in the right ear and type B tympanometry, which was indicative of poor eardrum mobility. Computed tomography (CT) of the temporal bone without contrast showed a well-circumscribed 9-mm lesion in the EAC with bony erosion along the junction of the anterior wall and floor (Figure 1, B and C).

A computed tomographic image of the chest was notable for diffuse, ground-glass opacities. An infectious disease workup was unrevealing, and the patient was diagnosed with acute-on-chronic respiratory failure resulting from dermatomyositis-associated interstitial lung disease. Progressive hypoxia refractory to mechanical ventilation necessitated venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) using the ProtekDuo dual-lumen cannula (LivaNova). In its standard configuration, deoxygenated blood is drained from the right atrium while oxygenated blood is ejected into the main pulmonary artery, and the device serves as both a right ventricular support and an ECMO (RVS-ECMO) cannula. End-stage lung disease was established and, as part of a lung transplant evaluation, the patient underwent catheterization of the left side of the heart and coronary angiography. The left coronary artery angiogram revealed mild luminal irregularities. The right coronary artery (RCA) angiogram is shown in Figure 1 and Video 1. \n### OUTPUT:\n    <|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>agent", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "min_tokens": 1, "temperature": 0.0, "until": ["Question", "</s>"]}}}, "resps": [["\nStep 1: Pulmonary embolism  \nStep 2: Acute respiratory distress syndrome  \nStep 3: Pneumonia  \nStep 4: Dermatomyositis-associated interstitial lung disease  \nStep 5: Pulmonary hypertension  \nStep 6: Coronary artery disease  \nStep 7: Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease  \nStep 8: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis  \nStep 9: Sarcoidosis  \nStep 10: Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis  \n\n**Reranked Differential Diagnoses:**\n\n1.

The mass had been slowly enlarging and he had been experiencing mild intermittent pain, but no additional symptoms were reported. His medical history was significant for several episodes of upper respiratory infection during the previous winter season, and he previously had an adenotonsillectomy several years prior and bilateral ear tubes placed 1 year before presentation.

There was no lymphadenopathy or other lesions noted in the neck area, and cranial nerve VII was fully intact. Ultrasonography results of the neck showed a left 1.5-cm preauricular nodular mass with internal and marginal vascularity. A neck magnetic resonance imaging study without contrast performed at an outside institution revealed the 1.5-cm heterogeneous intraparotid nodule that was predominantly isotense to glandular tissue on T1 images with vague hypointensity of a small irregular central region, as well as vague hyperintensity on T2 images. He subsequently underwent fine needle aspiration biopsy to assess the lesion, which demonstrated benign-appearing salivary gland tissue and clusters of myoepithelial cells. The mass was continuing to enlarge, and the patient’s pain was increasing in that area, so the decision was made to perform left superficial parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve. Intraoperatively, the left parotid mass was noted to be just below the lower branches of the facial nerve. The excised parotid mass was sent to the pathology department for analysis. Gross examination of the specimen demonstrated a 1.6 × 1.5 × 1.1–cm tan-white, well-circumscribed lesion that was partially surrounded by salivary gland parenchyma (Figure, A).

Two years prior, he was diagnosed with a right lower lobe segmental pulmonary embolism on a computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram after evaluation of shortness of breath. Warfarin was initiated but discontinued after 2 months due to recurrent epistaxis. On presentation to the pulmonary clinic, the patient reported dyspnea with minimal activity, fatigue, lightheadedness, and leg swelling. His temperature was 96.8 °F (36 °C); blood pressure, 120/71 mm Hg; heart rate, 73/min; and oxygen saturation, 98% on room air. He appeared frail and had multiple telangiectasias on his lips, tongue, and hands. He had jugular venous distension, a cardiac systolic murmur, right ventricular heave, and bilateral lower extremity edema to the knees. Laboratory testing revealed brain-type natriuretic peptide level of 1333 pg/mL (reference, <100 pg/mL) and hemoglobin level of 12.9 g/dL (reference, 13.9-16.3 g/dL). During a 6-minute walk test on room air, his oxygen saturation decreased to 87%. With oxygen delivered by nasal cannula at 4 L/min, his oxygen saturation was 98%, and he walked 90 m (15% of predicted). An echocardiogram showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, moderate-severe right ventricular dilatation, and right ventricular systolic pressure of 60 to 70 mm Hg (reference, 35-40 mm Hg). Findings on an echocardiogram performed 10 years prior were normal. \n### OUTPUT:\n    <|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>agent", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "min_tokens": 1, "temperature": 0.0, "until": ["Question", "</s>"]}}}, "resps": [["\nStep 1: Pulmonary hypertension secondary to chronic thromboembolic disease  \nStep 2: Pulmonary hypertension secondary to left-sided heart disease  \nStep 3: Pulmonary hypertension secondary to lung disease  \nStep 4: Pulmonary hypertension secondary to hypoxia  \nStep 5: Pulmonary hypertension secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  \nStep 6: Pulmonary hypertension secondary to sleep apnea  \nStep 7: Pulmonary hypertension secondary to chronic liver disease  \nStep 8: Pulmonary hypertension secondary to collagen vascular disease  \nStep 9: Pulmonary hypertension secondary to human immunodeficiency virus infection  \nStep 10: Pulmonary hypertension secondary to portopulmonary hypertension  \n\n**Reranked Differential Diagnoses:**\n\n1.

Cultures from the surgical specimen grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus hemolyticus. However, the lesions continued to worsen despite vancomycin and additional debridement. Thus, he was transferred to our facility.

Emergency medical services found him to be in a wide complex tachycardia. He was administered a 150-mg bolus of intravenous amiodarone, which failed to terminate his arrhythmia. He ultimately required synchronized cardioversion with a biphasic direct current shock of 100 J. On arrival to the emergency department, his vital signs were stable. Serum electrolyte levels were within normal range and C-reactive protein was less than 6 mg/dL (to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10). High-sensitivity troponin peaked at 1078 pg/mL. His initial 12-lead ECG is shown in Figure 1A. He continued in sinus rhythm with episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia observed on telemetry, as shown in Figure 1B. Cardiac catheterization revealed patent coronary arteries.

Computed tomography (CT) of the neck with contrast at his initial hospital admission was concerning for suppurative lymphadenitis. Despite incision and drainage, and intravenous ampicillin and sulbactam, his cervical lymphadenopathy persisted. Results of subsequent workup—including Haemophilus, tetanus, and pneumococcal antibody titers; QuantiFERON-TB Gold test; serum IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE levels; absolute lymphocyte count; neutrophil phenotype and function; angiotensin-converting enzyme level; HLA-B27 test; and antinuclear antibody level—were within normal limits. Magnetic resonance imaging of the neck with gadolinium contrast demonstrated bilateral, bulky, enlarged cervical lymph nodes, as well as enhancing nodules in the left laryngeal ventricle (2.3 × 1.6 × 1.2 cm), right false vocal cord, and right tracheal wall (0.6 × 0.4 cm). Findings from nasal endoscopy, awake flexible laryngoscopy, and operative microlaryngoscopy revealed yellow submucosal masses in the left nasal cavity, left laryngeal ventricle, and right trachea, as well as left vocal cord paresis (Figure, A). Biopsies were taken of the tracheal, laryngeal, and nasal cavity masses, and an excisional biopsy was taken of a left cervical lymph node (Figure, B). Histopathologic examination revealed a prominent infiltrate of benign-appearing histiocytes with numerous forms showing emperipolesis and some nuclei showing distinct central nucleoli. Immunohistochemical staining in these cells was positive for S100 and negative for CD1a. \n### OUTPUT:\n    <|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>agent", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "min_tokens": 1, "temperature": 0.0, "until": ["Question", "</s>"]}}}, "resps": [["\nStep 1: Suppurative lymphadenitis  \nStep 2: Lymphoma  \nStep 3: Tuberculosis  \nStep 4: Sarcoidosis  \nStep 5: Langerhans cell histiocytosis  \nStep 6: Rosai-Dorfman disease  \nStep 7: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma  \nStep 8: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis  \nStep 9: IgG4-related disease  \nStep 10: Metastatic carcinoma  \n\n**Reranked Differential Diagnoses:**\n\n1.

She denied recent unintentional weight loss, cough, fever, night sweats, chills, stridor, dyspnea, dysphonia, or rash. On examination, her vital signs were within normal limits, and physical examination revealed a small right tonsillolith, mild tonsillar erythema that was worse on the right side, and a mobile 2-cm, right level 2 lymph node that was slightly tender to palpation. Laboratory evaluation was notable for an elevated eosinophil count and positive Epstein-Barr immunoglobulin G. Her white blood cell count and mononucleosis spot test result were within normal parameters. Her symptoms persisted despite treatment with penicillin, azithromycin, and steroids from her primary physician and amoxicillin-clavulanate, sinus rinses, fluticasone propionate, and azelastine spray from an otolaryngologist to treat any contributing postnasal drainage and tonsillitis.

On examination, her vital signs were within normal limits, and physical examination revealed a small right tonsillolith, mild tonsillar erythema that was worse on the right side, and a mobile 2-cm, right level 2 lymph node that was slightly tender to palpation. Laboratory evaluation was notable for an elevated eosinophil count and positive Epstein-Barr immunoglobulin G. Her white blood cell count and mononucleosis spot test result were within normal parameters. Her symptoms persisted despite treatment with penicillin, azithromycin, and steroids from her primary physician and amoxicillin-clavulanate, sinus rinses, fluticasone propionate, and azelastine spray from an otolaryngologist to treat any contributing postnasal drainage and tonsillitis. Flexible transnasal videolaryngoscopy revealed a lesion on the laryngeal surface of the right epiglottis passing midline extending to the right aryepiglottic fold, but not involving the true vocal cords (Figure 1A). Given inconclusive office biopsy results, direct laryngoscopy with biopsy was performed, showing extensively inflamed squamous mucosa with ulceration, granulation tissue, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and atypia (Figure 1B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    <|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>agent", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "min_tokens": 1, "temperature": 0.0, "until": ["Question", "</s>"]}}}, "resps": [["\nStep 1: Acute tonsillitis  \nStep 2: Infectious mononucleosis  \nStep 3: Laryngeal carcinoma  \nStep 4: Laryngeal tuberculosis  \nStep 5: Laryngeal leishmaniasis  \nStep 6: Laryngeal syphilis  \nStep 7: Laryngeal histoplasmosis  \nStep 8: Laryngeal candidiasis  \nStep 9: Laryngeal sarcoidosis  \nStep 10: Laryngeal granulomatosis with polyangiitis  \n\n**Reranked Differential Diagnoses:**\n\n1.

Blood testing showed alanine aminotransferase level 51 U/L (0.85 μkat/L; reference range, 7-23 U/L [0.12-0.38 μkat/L]), aspartate aminotransaminase 68 U/L (1.14 μkat/L; reference range, 13-30 U/L [0.22-0.50 μkat/L]), total bilirubin 3.2 mg/dL (54.73 μmol/L; reference range, 0.4-1.5 mg/dL [6.84-25.66 μmol/L]) and direct bilirubin 0.9 mg/dL (15.39 μmol/L; reference range, 0.0-0.4 mg/dL [0.0-6.84 μmol/L]). Hemoglobin level was 8.7 g/dL with a normal mean corpuscular volume, and ferritin level was 637.9 ng/mL (reference range, 39.9-465 ng/mL). Blood testing revealed normal lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin, iron, vitamin B12, folate, zinc, and copper levels, and results of urinalysis were normal. A peripheral blood smear demonstrated small, bluish-purple punctate inclusions in erythrocytes (Figure, panel B). Results of upper and lower endoscopy and abdominal-pelvic computed tomography performed within the past 3 months were unremarkable. \n### OUTPUT:\n    <|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>agent", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "min_tokens": 1, "temperature": 0.0, "until": ["Question", "</s>"]}}}, "resps": [["\nStep 1: Acute viral hepatitis  \nStep 2: Acute cholecystitis  \nStep 3: Acute pancreatitis  \nStep 4: Peptic ulcer disease  \nStep 5: Gastroesophageal reflux disease  \nStep 6: Irritable bowel syndrome  \nStep 7: Porphyria  \nStep 8: Wilson disease  \nStep 9: Hemochromatosis  \nStep 10: Lead poisoning  \n\n**Reranked Differential Diagnoses:**\n\n1.

Laboratory results revealed a hemoglobin level of 13.1 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10), a white blood cell count of 6.4 × 103/μL, and a platelet count of 404 × 103/μL  (to convert to × 109/L, multiply by 1) in addition to negative results for HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C assays. Additional workup results were notable for elevated levels of interleukin (IL) 10 (1091 pg/mL), IL-6 (3.1 pg/mL), C-reactive protein (4.9 mg/dL [to convert to mg/L, multiply by 10]), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (79 mm/h). A computed tomography scan of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis further revealed extensive cervical, supraclavicular, retroperitoneal, pelvic, and inguinal lymphadenopathy, with extensive inflammation and fat stranding adjacent to these enlarged nodes. Positron emission tomography–computed tomography further demonstrated fluorodeoxyglucose-avid lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm. The patient then underwent excisional biopsy of an enlarged right cervical lymph node (Figure). \n### OUTPUT:\n    <|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>agent", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "min_tokens": 1, "temperature": 0.0, "until": ["Question", "</s>"]}}}, "resps": [["\nStep 1: Lymphoma  \nStep 2: Metastatic carcinoma  \nStep 3: Tuberculosis  \nStep 4: Sarcoidosis  \nStep 5: Castleman disease  \nStep 6: Lymphomatoid granulomatosis  \nStep 7: Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease  \nStep 8: Kimura disease  \nStep 9: IgG4-related disease  \nStep 10: Rosai-Dorfman disease  \n\n**Reranked Differential Diagnoses:**\n\n1.

The patient denied any manipulation or trauma at those sites. There was no personal or family history of keloid formation. The girl was otherwise healthy and met normal developmental milestones. On examination of the patient, there were many short, skin-colored, parallel cords on the patient’s anterior neck areas (Figure, A and B). These cords were indurated, slightly raised, and well defined with a shiny surface. The cords had a uniform width of approximately 2 mm, and the lengths varied from 3 mm to 2 cm. During the course of the examination, an ill-defined sclerotic plaque surrounding the underside of the clavicle was found. It had a shiny surface, irregular shape, and measured 10 × 4 cm. No similar lesions were found on any other part of the patient’s body. Inspection of the patient’s skin revealed no abnormal nail fold capillary dilation or hemorrhage; no sclerodactyly, distal digital pitting, or Raynaud disease; and no extracutaneous involvement. A punch biopsy specimen from the affected area was obtained (Figure, C and D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    <|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>agent", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "min_tokens": 1, "temperature": 0.0, "until": ["Question", "</s>"]}}}, "resps": [["\nStep 1: Keloid  \nStep 2: Hypertrophic scar  \nStep 3: Morphea  \nStep 4: Lichen sclerosus  \nStep 5: Scleroderma  \nStep 6: Linear scleroderma  \nStep 7: Porphyria cutanea tarda  \nStep 8: Pseudoxanthoma elasticum  \nStep 9: Scleredema  \nStep 10: Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis  \n\n**Reranked Differential Diagnoses:**\n\n1.

Over 2 years, he was prescribed various therapies including prednisone, methotrexate, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, abatacept, and anakinra; he experienced intermittent improvement in his joint pain but had persistently elevated levels of inflammatory markers. He continued to experience asymmetric small- and large-joint polyarthralgias and later developed intermittent fevers (temperatures up to 38.3°C [101°F]) along with a 50-lb (22.7-kg) unintentional weight loss over the course of a few months. On examination, there was subtle synovitis in bilateral metacarpophalangeal joints. Findings on cardiac, pulmonary, and neurologic examinations were unremarkable. Laboratory evaluation was notable for a normocytic anemia and elevated C-reactive protein level (7.7 mg/dL [73.3 nmol/L]). Results of esophagogastroduodenoscopy with gastric biopsies and bone marrow biopsy were unremarkable. Findings on further workup including transthoracic echocardiography to assess for endocarditis, carotid magnetic resonance angiography to assess for vasculitis, and abdominal fat pad biopsy for amyloidosis were also unremarkable.

Over 2 years, he was prescribed various therapies including prednisone, methotrexate, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, abatacept, and anakinra; he experienced intermittent improvement in his joint pain but had persistently elevated levels of inflammatory markers. He continued to experience asymmetric small- and large-joint polyarthralgias and later developed intermittent fevers (temperatures up to 38.3°C [101°F]) along with a 50-lb (22.7-kg) unintentional weight loss over the course of a few months. On examination, there was subtle synovitis in bilateral metacarpophalangeal joints. Findings on cardiac, pulmonary, and neurologic examinations were unremarkable. Laboratory evaluation was notable for a normocytic anemia and elevated C-reactive protein level (7.7 mg/dL [73.3 nmol/L]). Results of esophagogastroduodenoscopy with gastric biopsies and bone marrow biopsy were unremarkable. Findings on further workup including transthoracic echocardiography to assess for endocarditis, carotid magnetic resonance angiography to assess for vasculitis, and abdominal fat pad biopsy for amyloidosis were also unremarkable.

Her mental state had deteriorated progressively over the previous 12 months, following the death of her father. After a period living alone, she had returned to the family home 4 months prior to her presentation and had been noted to be socially withdrawn, preoccupied, and distractible. Her family physician, suspecting a depressive episode, had prescribed citalopram up to a dosage of 40 mg once daily, to no effect. Her family subsequently sought advice from the family physician when the patient was noted to be speaking to herself, expressing concerns about people meaning her harm, and professing the belief that she could hear other peoples’ thoughts. The patient had been born in Sierra Leone after a complicated delivery and had traveled to the United Kingdom as a child with her family, who were fleeing from a civil war. On arrival in the United Kingdom, her family claimed asylum and moved into a small apartment in a high-rise building in central London. Although there was no reported developmental delay, she had struggled academically at school and was bullied for having overweight. She left school without qualifications at age 16 years and worked as a shop assistant. She left this job about a year prior to her referral to psychiatry after a period of sick leave following the death of her father. She was a nonsmoker, did not drink alcohol, and denied illicit drug use. A paternal relative was reported to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia. There was no comorbid physical illness. On review, the patient was kempt and had overweight. Eye contact was fleeting, and she presented as anxious, with a degree of psychomotor agitation. Her speech was normal in rate, volume, and tone, although tangential. There was no other evidence of thought disorder. She denied feeling low in mood or suicidal and was objectively euthymic. There was some sleep disturbance, with the patient reporting being fearful to go to sleep owing to persecutory beliefs regarding her neighbors. She reflected that over the preceding few months, she had experienced a sensation of detachment from her immediate environment, as though it was not real, making her world similar to that of a video game. She reported that in the apartment where she had previously been living, she had realized that something was amiss and had become convinced that the door number of her neighbor’s flat, number 6, signified that they meant her harm. She explained this was because 6 was associated with the number of the devil. She reported hearing her neighbors commenting negatively about her appearance. These distressing experiences prompted her to return to her family home, but she continued to hear her neighbors’ voices making derogatory comments about her appearance and began to hear them commenting on her actions and thoughts in the third person as well. On returning home, her paranoia regarding her previous neighbors worsened, resulting in her rarely leaving the house. The volume and frequency of derogatory auditory hallucinations also worsened, and she reported hearing the thoughts of others as well. There was a degree of insight, and although the patient was convinced of the reality of her experiences, she also saw the stress of losing her father as associated with her experiences and was accepting of input from mental health services. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Schizophrenia", "topic": "['Psychiatry and Behavioral Health', 'Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders']"}, "target": "Schizophrenia", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "<|im_start|>human\nDevelop a 10-Step differential diagnosis, for each step, give only one differential diagnosis with only the disease name at current step, do not provide repeated hypotheses or diagnoses that appear in previous steps.

Serum antigen testing for blastomyces, histoplasmosis, syphilis, HIV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human herpesvirus 6, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, varicella zoster virus, human polyomavirus 2, and West Nile virus were performed, and all results were found to be negative. A biopsy of the skin lesion was obtained from the edge of the lesion found on the patient’s back (Figure, B). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay serological testing was subsequently performed, and results demonstrated elevated levels of antidesmoglein 1 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and antidesmoglein 3 IgG. \n### OUTPUT:\n    <|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>agent", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "min_tokens": 1, "temperature": 0.0, "until": ["Question", "</s>"]}}}, "resps": [["\nStep 1: Pemphigus vulgaris  \nStep 2: Bullous pemphigoid  \nStep 3: Mucous membrane pemphigoid  \nStep 4: Paraneoplastic pemphigus  \nStep 5: Dermatitis herpetiformis  \nStep 6: Cutaneous tuberculosis  \nStep 7: Cutaneous leishmaniasis  \nStep 8: Cutaneous sarcoidosis  \nStep 9: Cutaneous lupus erythematosus  \nStep 10: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma  \n\n**Reranked Differential Diagnoses:**\n\n1.

The patient was febrile (38.3°C), with a white blood cell count of 0.5/μL (absolute neutrophil count 0.00; to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001), hemoglobin levels of 7.6g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0), hematocrit 21%, and platelet count 9/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 1.0). He was not receiving active cancer treatment. He appeared cachectic and pale. Intraoral examination revealed poor oral hygiene. The left hard palate exhibited a large swelling with a 5×3-cm indurated area of ulceration, central necrosis, and desquamation (Figure, A). The patient was treated palliatively with dexamethasone solution and nystatin rinse. A biopsy was not recommended owing to medical instability. However, the patient retained a sloughed fragment of the affected tissue, which was submitted for histologic evaluation. A maxillofacial computed tomography (CT) scan completed the etiological investigation. \n### OUTPUT:\n    <|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>agent", "arg_1": {"do_sample": false, "min_tokens": 1, "temperature": 0.0, "until": ["Question", "</s>"]}}}, "resps": [["\nStep 1: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) infiltration  \nStep 2: Oral mucormycosis  \nStep 3: Oral aspergillosis  \nStep 4: Oral candidiasis  \nStep 5: Oral herpes simplex virus infection  \nStep 6: Oral squamous cell carcinoma  \nStep 7: Pyogenic granuloma  \nStep 8: Oral lymphoma  \nStep 9: Oral tuberculosis  \nStep 10: Necrotizing sialometaplasia  \n\n**Reranked Differential Diagnoses:**\n\n1.

He also reported a history of painful paresthesias at his feet beginning about 1 year prior. On examination, his visual acuity was initially 20/80 OD and 20/200 OS; it deteriorated over the next 2 months to finger counting bilaterally. The Weber test gave a nonlateralizing result, and bone conduction hearing was absent bilaterally. There was length-dependent loss of vibratory sensation and absent reflexes at both lower extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated abnormal enhancement of bilateral optic nerves (Figure, A). Optical coherence tomography and fluorescein angiogram were normal. Nerve conduction studies showed mild sensory axonal polyneuropathy. Laboratory tests were notable for elevated thyrotropin (63 mlU/ml), low levels of free thyroxine (T4) (0.2 ng/dL), and elevated levels of cerebrospinal fluid protein (94 mg/dL). Cerebrospinal fluid IgG index, oligoclonal bands, aquaporin 4 antibody, paraneoplastic panel, and protein electrophoresis test results were all normal.
