Five months after surgery, she presented to the otolaryngology clinic with 3 weeks of mild odynophagia and dysphagia. It was noted that the patient had a prominent posterior pharyngeal wall, subtle asymmetry of vocal fold motion, and pooling of secretions in the left pyriform (Video 1). During the next 6 months, she gradually developed shortness of breath and stridor, and eventually presented to the emergency department in respiratory distress requiring intubation for 2 days. Shortly after extubation, laryngeal examination showed fullness of the posterior pharyngeal wall and severely limited vocal fold abduction bilaterally (Figure 1A; Video 1). A modified barium swallow study showed intermittent laryngeal penetration without aspiration (Video 2). Although the patient was unable to tolerate magnetic resonance imaging, a soft tissue computed tomography scan of the neck with contrast revealed a well-positioned plate with no evidence of fluid collection in the setting of a normal leukocyte count. One month later, a neuromuscular specialist investigated potential underlying neurological causes; however, results of nerve conduction, antiacetylcholine receptor, antimuscle-specific kinase, methylmalonic acid, HIV, rapid plasma reagin, vitamin B-12, thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroxine, copper, creatine kinase, and immunofixation studies were all unremarkable.\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Delayed iatrogenic bilateral vocal fold paralysis (BVFP)", "predict": "1. **Bilateral Vocal Cord Paralysis** - Considering the limited vocal fold abduction and history of neck surgery, vocal cord paralysis could explain the stridor and respiratory distress.\n   \n2. **Granulomatous Disease** - Conditions such as tuberculosis or sarcoidosis could cause posterior pharyngeal wall fullness and vocal cord motion asymmetry, although typically other systemic symptoms would be present.\n\n3. **Laryngeal Edema** - Post-surgical laryngeal edema might account for the stridor, odynophagia, and vocal fold changes, especially since imaging shows no fluid collection or infection.\n\n4. **Cervical Hardware Complications** - Though the CT shows a well-positioned plate, there could still be subtle mechanical effects causing these symptoms.\n\n5. **Vocal Cord Tumor** - A tumor could lead to vocal fold motion asymmetry and fullness in the posterior pharyngeal wall.\n\n6. **Pseudobulbar Palsy** - This neurological condition can cause dysphagia and vocal issues but doesn't usually account for the specific respiratory problems unless very advanced.\n\n7. **Achalasia or Cricopharyngeal Spasm** - These motility disorders might explain dysphagia but are less likely to cause the severe respiratory symptoms.\n\n8. **Laryngopharyngeal Reflux** - Chronic irritation from reflux could contribute to vocal fold issues and odynophagia.\n\n9. **Anterior Cervical Osteophyte** - Abnormal bony growths following surgery might not have been overtly visible on CT but could impinge on the pharyngeal space.\n\n10. **Cervical Spine Deformity** - Post-surgical changes like kyphosis could subtly alter the mechanics of the airway and pharyngeal structures.\n\n### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:\n\n1. **Bilateral Vocal Cord Paralysis** - The bilateral limitation in vocal fold abduction aligns well with the respiratory distress.\n   \n2. **Cervical Hardware Complications** - Despite CT imaging, mechanical issues from hardware are plausible given the surgical history.\n\n3. **Laryngeal Edema** - Post-surgical edema is a common complication after neck surgeries.\n\n4. **Anterior Cervical Osteophyte** - Potential osseous growth affecting pharyngeal and airway mechanics should be considered.\n\n5. **Granulomatous Disease** - Although unlikely given normal systemic investigation results, it remains a possibility.\n\n6. **Pseudobulbar Palsy** - Requires more neurological symptoms but aligns with dysphagia.\n\n7. **Laryngopharyngeal Reflux** - Chronic airway irritation from reflux is common.\n\n8. **Vocal Cord Tumor** - Less likely due to lack of mass on imaging but remains a possibility.\n\n9. **Achalasia or Cricopharyngeal Spasm** - Primarily considered for dysphagia without explaining respiratory issues.\n\n10. **Cervical Spine Deformity** - Secondary changes post-surgery could impact pharyngeal volume/function.", "topic": "['Laryngology', 'Neurosurgery', 'Otolaryngology', 'Health Care Safety', 'Surgery']"}

On temporal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an oval cystic mass was revealed at the same location, with high signal intensity on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images and low signal intensity on enhanced T1-weighted fat suppression and T2-weighted short T1 inversion recovery images (Figure, A-D). In surgery, the well-demarcated cystic mass was completely excised. Yellowish fluid leaked out of the cyst during excision.

Three years prior, he was diagnosed with a solitary HCC and underwent surgical resection with curative intent. Pathology revealed poorly differentiated HCC, 16 cm in largest dimension, with large vein involvement (T3bNXM0, R0 resection). The patient underwent expectant observation. One and a half years prior to the current presentation, laboratory results revealed an elevated α-fetoprotein (AFP), and cross-sectional imaging revealed multiple lung nodules consistent with metastases.

In the current presentation, the patient reported nonradiating epigastric pain of moderate intensity for 1 month. Associated symptoms included nausea, anorexia, and water brash without emesis. Review of systems was positive for unchanged chronic abdominal bloating and negative for other constitutional or gastrointestinal symptoms. Laboratory results, including liver function tests, amylase, lipase, and AFP, were within normal limits, and hepatitis B virus polymerase chain reaction was undetectable. Computed tomography with multiphasic liver protocol showed new enlarged mesenteric nodes and diffuse thickening of the gastric body (Figure, A).

On physical examination, the patient showed a rhythmic tachycardia with a rate of 178 beats/min and blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg. The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a regular tachycardia with a rate of 178 beats/min; no obvious P waves were recognizable (Figure 1A).

This trigeminal variation in intraventricular conduction occurred without any change in cycle length and was maintained.

A normal funduscopic examination was documented prior to cataract surgery. At the time of initial presentation to his local retina specialist 1 week following his cataract surgery, the patient had severe pain and redness. His visual acuity was light perception. An examination revealed a 2-mm hypopyon and dense vitreous haze with no view of the retina. He was treated for presumed endophthalmitis with a vitreous tap and intravitreal injections of vancomycin (1 mg/0.1 mL), ceftazidime (2.2 mg/0.1 mL), and dexamethasone (0.4 mg/0.1 mL). The vitreous sample obtained at the time of treatment grew Staphylococcus caprae susceptible to vancomycin. At time of examination in our clinic 4 weeks following treatment, the patient was receiving topical steroid and cycloplegic drops. His best-corrected visual acuity had improved to 20/70. Examination showed a deep and quiet anterior chamber with a well-positioned intraocular lens without any plaques or deposits on the lens capsule. Dilated ophthalmoscopic examination demonstrated improvement in the vitreous debris with 1+ vitritis and numerous superficial, round, white lesions spread throughout the fundus in all 4 quadrants and in the macula (Figure 1A).

Ultrasonography results showed an avascular cystic structure with internal debris and a single thin septation. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the neck soft tissue revealed a 3-cm low attenuation, nonenhancing, cystic-appearing mass that elevated the submandibular gland to the level of the parapharyngeal fat space with medial extension of the lesion into the tongue musculature. The walls were thin except for mildly thickened capsule along the posterior aspect of the lesion (Figure, A and B).

Local antiglaucoma therapy with a fixed-combination prostaglandin and β-blocker was used regularly in both eyes owing to long-standing primary open-angle glaucoma. Uneventful cataract surgery with phacoemulsification and in-the-bag insertion of an intraocular lens was performed 10 years earlier in both eyes. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 1.0 and 0.5 (Snellen equivalent, 20/20 and 20/40) OD and OS, respectively. Her manifest refraction revealed a difference of −0.75 D sphere compared with her own preexisting glasses in the right eye. IOP was 24 mm Hg in the right eye and 18 mm Hg in the left eye. Slitlamp examination revealed a milky substance in the retrolental space, more pronounced in the right eye (Figure) but evident in both. The rest of the slitlamp examination was unremarkable with moderate superficial punctate keratitis owing to ocular surface disease, an anterior chamber depth of Van Herick grade 4 (peripheral anterior chamber depth >1 corneal thickness), an absence of anterior chamber inflammation, and a moderate amount of Elschnig pearls in both eyes.\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Late-onset postoperative capsular bag distension syndrome", "predict": "1. **Postoperative Capsular Bag Distension Syndrome**  \n   - Considering the patient's history of cataract surgery and the presence of a milky substance in the retrolental space, capsular bag distension following intraocular lens implantation is a potential differential.\n\n2. **Intraocular Lens Decentration or Dislocation**  \n   - This can affect visual acuity and could be related to the patient's history of cataract surgery, which might explain the milky substance visual disturbance.\n\n3. **Posterior Capsule Opacification**  \n   - Common after cataract surgery, this condition can contribute to decreased visual acuity and could initially mimic the findings.\n\n4. **Ocular Hypertension**  \n   - The increased intraocular pressure could contribute to visual disturbances, although it needs to be differentiated as an underlying or concurrent issue.\n\n5. **Chronic Uveitis**  \n   - Chronic or subclinical uveitis could present with similar changes within the eye post-surgery, though it typically involves inflammation.\n\n6. **Cystoid Macular Edema**  \n   - Following cataract surgery, this can lead to decreased vision and may coexist without obvious anterior segment findings.\n\n7. **Pseudophakic Bullous Keratopathy**  \n   - Though less likely given the clear cornea, it remains a consideration due to the surgical history.\n\n8. **Secondary Glaucoma**  \n   - Caused by pigment dispersion, pseudoexfoliation syndrome, or other mechanisms, this remains a possibility considering the IOP issues.\n\n9. **Vitreous Hemorrhage or Inflammation**  \n   - Can cause visual disturbances and the appearance of opacification in the retrolental space.\n\n10. **Retained Lens Fragments**  \n    - These could cause chronic issues post-surgery leading to symptoms like decreased vision and increased intraocular pressure.\n\n### Reranked Differential Diagnosis\n\n1. **Postoperative Capsular Bag Distension Syndrome**  \n   - Best fits the patient's history and clinical presentation with the presence of a milky substance and the previous cataract surgery.\n\n2. **Posterior Capsule Opacification**  \n   - A common issue post-cataract surgery that can cause visual problems.\n\n3. **Intraocular Lens Decentration or Dislocation**  \n   - Possible given the surgical history although less likely with minimal visible changes during slitlamp examination.\n\n4. **Ocular Hypertension**  \n   - Associated with symptoms moderately but less likely given the absence of glaucomatous damage findings.\n\n5. **Cystoid Macular Edema**  \n   - Should be considered though typically evaluated with additional fundoscopic results.\n\n6. **Vitreous Hemorrhage or Inflammation**  \n   - Slight possibility due to lack of posterior segment examination findings.\n\n7. **Secondary Glaucoma**  \n   - Possible interaction with existing glaucoma treatment rather than a primary cause.\n\n8. **Chronic Uveitis**  \n   - Less likely without concurrent signs of inflammation or anterior chamber involvement.\n\n9. **Pseudophakic Bullous Keratopathy**  \n   - Unlikely due to the clear corneal finding during examination.\n\n10. **Retained Lens Fragments**  \n    - Unlikely after this many years post-operatively without prior similar episodes.", "topic": "['Cataract and Other Lens Disorders', 'Glaucoma', 'Ophthalmology']"}

Her histology results showed a 5-cm Warthin tumor, with a focus of nodular oncocytic hyperplasia in the adjacent parenchyma and reactive intraparotid lymph nodes. She presented to the ear, nose, and throat clinic and complained of pain in the operative site of 6 months duration. This occurred intermittently once a week and lasted for a few minutes each time. It was associated with a small lump over the left neck, and the pain was worse on touch and head turning. On examination, there was a 3-mm nodularity palpated deep to the neck wound along the mid sternocleidomastoid muscle. It was associated with focal tenderness. Her facial nerve function was otherwise normal, and sensation in the ear lobe was intact. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was performed, and the results showed no focal lesion in either parotid glands or at the area of interest over the left sternocleidomastoid muscle.

The papules and nodules appeared to grow as the girl grew, and some pedunculated lesions tended to fall off spontaneously. She had not received any prior treatment. The patient had no other significant medical history and denied having a family history of similar lesions.

On postbiopsy physical examination, the patient had a palpable 2.5-cm right breast mass at the 3-o’clock position without palpable axillary lymphadenopathy. Surgical treatment with lumpectomy was recommended, and breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed prior to surgery to evaluate the extent of disease (Figure).

Three weeks prior, she had developed acute urinary retention. Neurological examination revealed weakness in bilateral lower limbs (Medical Research Council grade 4 on the right and grade 3 on the left), extensor plantar responses, and a sensory level at T6. Magnetic resonance imaging of her thoracic spine was performed 10 days after the onset of weakness and did not show any signal abnormalities or restricted diffusion. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis findings were remarkable for elevated protein (0.14 g/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10]) but white cell count (5 cells/mm3) and glucose levels (54.05 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555]) were normal. Cytology and flow cytometry were negative for malignancy. Antibodies to aquaporin 4 and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein were not detected. The patient developed a sudden worsening of weakness in her legs 2 weeks after initial presentation. Repeated thoracic spine imaging showed an area of T2 hyperintensity in the left posterolateral cord at T7, which did not enhance with contrast or show restricted diffusion (Figure 1A).

However, hearing loss is not typically part of the presentation.\n\n5. **Age-related Macular Degeneration**  \n   - Despite his relatively young age, bilateral macular atrophy and visual acuity changes could suggest ARMD as a differential.\n\n6. **Central Areolar Choroidal Dystrophy**  \n   - This can cause macular atrophy similar to what is described but is less common and typically does not involve hearing loss.\n\n7. **Batten Disease (Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis)**  \n   - Though usually presenting in childhood, it can lead to vision loss and sometimes hearing loss due to neurodegenerative factors affecting the retina and cochlea.\n\n8. **Spinocerebellar Ataxia with Macular Degeneration**  \n   - Some forms of this hereditary condition can cause both hearing and vision loss, including retinal degeneration.\n\n9. **Alport Syndrome**  \n   - The key features include hearing loss and ocular problems; however, often associated with anterior lenticonus rather than macular atrophy, but still worth considering.\n\n10. **Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS)**  \n    - This mitochondrial disorder can cause multiple systemic symptoms, including vision and hearing deficits albeit typically with other symptoms present.\n\n### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:\n   \n1. **Pattern Dystrophies of the Retinal Pigment Epithelium**  \n   - Given the presence of speckled autofluorescence and macular atrophy, pattern dystrophies are strongly indicated.\n\n2. **Usher Syndrome**  \n   - Considering the combination of hearing loss and visual symptoms, this remains highly plausible, despite the typical fundus pattern being different.\n\n3. **Cone-Rod Dystrophy**  \n   - Aligns with macular disease presentation with outer retinal atrophy, though hearing loss is unusual.\n\n4. **Batten Disease (Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis)**  \n   - Neurodegenerative conditions that can cause both hearing and vision loss deserve consideration given the age and symptoms.\n\n5. **Alport Syndrome**  \n   - Given the combination of sensorineural hearing loss and ocular manifestations, despite the absence of kidney symptoms typically associated.\n\n6. **Spinocerebellar Ataxia with Macular Degeneration**  \n   - Neurodegenerative diseases with ocular manifestations should be considered, although less common.\n\n7. **Stargardt Disease**  \n   - Age at symptom onset and lesion patterns are somewhat atypical but can be considered with atypical presentation.\n\n8. **Central Areolar Choroidal Dystrophy**  \n   - Accounts for macular atrophy but does not address hearing loss, making it less likely.\n\n9. **Age-related Macular Degeneration**  \n   - Typically older age-range but macular changes can sometimes present atypically early.\n\n10. **Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS)**  \n    - Although a systemic review does not strongly support this based on pain symptomology and presentation, mitochondrial disorders should always be in the differential for unexplained multi-symptom disorders.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Pediatrics', 'Otolaryngology', 'Audiology and Hearing', 'Retinal Disorders']"}

Imaging results showed mild disease progression (new ascites and periportal metabolic lymph node). Splenic infarct and portal/splenic vein thrombi were identified as etiologies of her acute pain and were presumed to be secondary to hypercoagulable state of malignancy. Over the next 3 days, she had rising serum creatinine (sCr) levels (baseline, approximately 1 mg/dL [to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4]). The initial workup included ultrasonography and urinalysis. Ultrasonography results showed abnormal intraparenchymal flow to both kidneys without evidence of kidney artery stenosis. Urine studies were consistent with prerenal etiology, while the presence of casts suggested acute tubular necrosis. Nephrotoxic medications (omeprazole/pantoprazole) were discontinued.

Hence, to assess the dynamic structural changes during swallowing, we performed swallowing dynamic computed tomography (SD-CT), which can reveal moving structures by creating a dynamic-volume data set during swallowing.1,2 Comparison of the reconstructed SD-CT images at rest (Figure 1A) and on swallowing (Figure 1B) revealed that the superior thyroid notch and the right superior border of the thyroid cartilage contacted the hyoid bone internally during maximum laryngeal elevation on swallowing.\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Clicking larynx", "predict": "**10-Step Differential Diagnosis:**\n\n1. **Thyrohyoid syndrome** - A condition characterized by painful swallowing due to hyoid bone or thyroid cartilage abnormalities.\n2. **Eagle's syndrome** - Elongation of the styloid process or calcification of the stylohyoid ligament causing throat pain and clicking.\n3. **Submandibular gland disorder** - Conditions like sialolithiasis that might cause referred pain during swallowing.\n4. **Cricopharyngeal spasm** - A spasm of the upper esophageal sphincter causing dysphagia and throat discomfort.\n5. **Glossopharyngeal neuralgia** - Severe pain in the throat, ear, and tonsillar regions triggered by swallowing.\n6. **Laryngeal cartilage injury** - Trauma or microtrauma to the laryngeal cartilage that might not be visible on standard imaging.\n7. **External Mass Effect** - A neoplastic or non-neoplastic mass exerting pressure on the laryngeal region.\n8. **Thyroiditis** - Inflammation of the thyroid gland resulting in localized pain exacerbated by swallowing.\n9. **Cervical spine misalignment** - Abnormalities or misalignments in cervical vertebrae affecting swallowing mechanics.\n10. **Achalasia or Esophageal Motility Disorder** - Disorders affecting esophageal muscle activity, causing varied swallowing symptoms and weight loss.\n\n**Reranked Differential Diagnosis:**\n\n1. **Thyrohyoid syndrome** - Most likely given the specific clicking sensation identified around the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage during swallowing.\n2. **Laryngeal cartilage injury** - Given the specific friction and pain reproduced during examination, despite normal imaging.\n3. **Eagle's syndrome** - Considered due to the nature of the clicking and painful sensations, although imaging did not reveal styloid process issues.\n4. **Glossopharyngeal neuralgia** - Falls lower since direct structural changes were observed which are not typical for this neuralgia.\n5. **Cricopharyngeal spasm** - Possible contender though higher suspicion for mechanical contact from SD-CT results.\n6. **Submandibular gland disorder** - Reduced likelihood, as typical imaging did not indicate such issues and pain pattern is more consistent with thyroid or laryngeal involvement.\n7. **Thyroiditis** - Less likely without accompanying systemic symptoms or imaging confirmation.\n8. **External Mass Effect** - Unlikely due to absence of visible external or internal masses on imaging.\n9. **Cervical spine misalignment** - Considered lower due to specific findings around thyroid and hyoid movements.\n10. **Achalasia or Esophageal Motility Disorder** - Least likely based on specific clicking movement localized to hyoid and thyroid during swallowing. \n\nIn conclusion, given the swallowing dynamics revealed by SD-CT showing internal contact between laryngeal elements, thyrohyoid syndrome is the most compelling diagnosis in this case.", "topic": "['Otolaryngology', 'Swallowing and Dysphagia']"}

The pain was present at rest, 7 of 10 in severity, and worse with inspiration. She experienced concomitant exertional shortness of breath, dry cough, and lightheadedness. Her cardiac history was otherwise unremarkable. Family history was notable for breast cancer in her mother and her sister, but no known inherited hypercoagulable disorders. In the emergency department, her vital signs were as follows: temperature 37.0 °C, blood pressure 130/76 mm Hg, heart rate 97/min, respiratory rate 16/min, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. Physical examination results were unremarkable, with no cardiac murmurs, rubs, pulmonary crackles, jugular venous distention, or lower extremity edema. Laboratory test results were remarkable for an elevated D-dimer level, an elevated C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a mildly elevated pro-BNP level, but normal levels of troponin and procalcitonin. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with evidence of right heart strain, and a computed tomography angiogram of the chest demonstrated an occlusive pulmonary embolism of the left main pulmonary artery and several peripheral consolidations in the left lower lung field consistent with infarction. The patient started anticoagulation therapy with intravenous heparin. A subsequent echocardiogram revealed bowing of the interventricular septum into the left ventricle and a very large (6.6 × 4.1-cm), mobile, nonhomogeneous, pedunculated mass straddling the tricuspid valve and moving between the right atrium and right ventricle (Figure 1 and Video).\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Right atrial myxoma with partial myxomatous embolism to the pulmonary artery", "predict": "1. **Pulmonary Embolism (PE):** Given the patient's history of pulmonary embolism, presence of chest pain worsened by inspiration, elevated D-dimer, and CTA findings, recurrent PE is the primary consideration.\n\n2. **Atrial Myxoma:** The echocardiogram shows a large, mobile, pedunculated mass straddling the tricuspid valve, consistent with a cardiac tumor such as an atrial myxoma.\n\n3. **Lung Infarction:** The CTA showing peripheral consolidations in the left lower lung field indicates possible lung infarction secondary to the embolism.\n\n4. **Right Heart Strain:** The echocardiogram findings indicate right heart strain, possibly due to acute pulmonary hypertension secondary to the massive pulmonary embolism.\n\n5. **Pulmonary Infarct:** The presence of peripheral consolidations in the CTA of the chest may represent areas of infarction due to PE rather than infection (pneumonia is not suspected as procalcitonin is normal).\n\n6. **Tricuspid Valve Mass:** The mass present in the echocardiogram raises suspicion for an intracardiac mass, which could be a primary cardiac tumor or thrombus.\n\n7. **Pulmonary Hypertension:** Secondary pulmonary hypertension due to underlying PE can present with exertional dyspnea and right heart strain, suggested by the echocardiogram findings.\n\n8. **Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH):** Considered due to history of pulmonary embolism and current findings suggesting right heart strain, although acute presentation leans towards PE.\n\n9. **Paradoxical Embolism:** Considering the presence of a right atrial mass, the risk of paradoxical embolism exists if there is an atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale.\n\n10. **Pericardial Disease:** Although no friction rubs are heard, sharp chest pain exacerbated by inspiration warrants consideration for pericarditis, but findings are not strongly suggestive.\n\n### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:\n1. **Pulmonary Embolism (PE):** Strong evidence from CTA and D-dimer supports PE as the primary diagnosis. \n2. **Atrial Myxoma:** Echo findings of a large mass suggest atrial myxoma, especially given its size and mobility.\n3. **Pulmonary Infarct:** Supported by CTA findings of peripheral consolidations.\n4. **Right Heart Strain:** Echo and EKG findings indicative of right ventricular pressure overload.\n5. **Lung Infarction:** Secondary consideration related to PE.\n6. **Tricuspid Valve Mass:** Could be associated with atrial myxoma or represent a separate entity.\n7. **Pulmonary Hypertension:** Supported by echo findings but likely secondary to acute PE.\n8. **Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH):** Less likely but considered due to history.\n9. **Paradoxical Embolism:** Less evidence supporting it, considered due to presence of a mass.\n10. **Pericardial Disease:** Least likely given the current findings.", "topic": "['Cardiology']"}

The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 103 mm/h and a magnetic resonance angiographic examination of the brain was negative for mass, infarction, and hemorrhage. Examination results of a right, superficial, temporal artery biopsy specimen showed chronic, nongranulomatous inflammation surrounding adventitial vessels and extensive subintimal fibrosis, without giant cells or segmental loss of the internal elastic lamina, which was interpreted as compatible with temporal arteritis. High-dose corticosteroid therapy was initiated (1 g methylprednisolone intravenously for 3 days followed by 60 mg/d of oral prednisone). A neuro-ophthalmologic examination performed 1 week later showed an unreactive left pupil with an obvious relative afferent pupillary defect. Optic nerve pallor concomitant with edema and a single flame-shaped hemorrhage at the 4-o’clock position on the disc margin was also observed. Two weeks later, persistent elevation of the ESR and C-reactive protein levels, despite continued oral prednisone therapy, prompted a review of the temporal artery biopsy findings.

The mass had been slowly enlarging and she had been experiencing mild intermittent pain, but no additional symptoms were reported. Her medical history was significant for several episodes of upper respiratory infection during the previous winter season, and she previously had an adenotonsillectomy several years prior and bilateral ear tubes placed 1 year before presentation. Physical examination showed a mildly tender, nonmobile, left parotid mass near the angle of the mandible with no overlying skin changes or drainage around the mass. There was no lymphadenopathy or other lesions noted in the neck area, and cranial nerve VII was fully intact. Ultrasonography results of the neck showed a left 1.5-cm preauricular nodular mass with internal and marginal vascularity. A neck magnetic resonance imaging study without contrast performed at an outside institution revealed the 1.5-cm heterogeneous intraparotid nodule that was predominantly isotense to glandular tissue on T1 images with vague hypointensity of a small irregular central region, as well as vague hyperintensity on T2 images. She subsequently underwent fine needle aspiration biopsy to assess the lesion, which demonstrated benign-appearing salivary gland tissue and clusters of myoepithelial cells. The mass was continuing to enlarge, and the patient’s pain was increasing in that area, so the decision was made to perform left superficial parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve. Intraoperatively, the left parotid mass was noted to be just below the lower branches of the facial nerve. The excised parotid mass was sent to the pathology department for analysis. Gross examination of the specimen demonstrated a 1.6 × 1.5 × 1.1–cm tan-white, well-circumscribed lesion that was partially surrounded by salivary gland parenchyma (Figure, A).

In the ED, she denied headaches, fever, otalgia, otorrhea, or hearing loss. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with contrast showed diffuse enhancement and possible coalescence in the left mastoid process with adjacent dural enhancement and sigmoid sinus occlusion. She received intravenous vancomycin and cefepime and was started on a heparin drip before being transferred to our facility. On presentation at our facility, the patient appeared well with normal vital signs. There was no periauricular swelling or erythema. Otoscopic examination showed no inflammation of the external auditory canals, and the tympanic membranes were translucent without evidence of retraction or effusion. Computed tomographic venogram confirmed occlusion of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses, and computed tomography of the temporal bone showed coalescence of mastoid air cells with erosion into the sigmoid sinus.

Four years earlier, she started taking lenalidomide, 10 mg/d (28-day cycle), to treat worsening anemia; after 2 cycles of treatment, she became transfusion independent. Since then, she has remained stable with the same dose and schedule of lenalidomide without significant adverse effects. The presenting skin lesions developed 1 month before presentation and began as small pustules that rapidly transformed into painful ulcers. She was treated with valacyclovir for a presumed diagnosis of shingles, but the lesions did not improve. Because of suspected necrotizing fasciitis, she underwent incision and drainage of the lesions. Cultures from the surgical specimen grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus hemolyticus. However, the lesions continued to worsen despite vancomycin and additional debridement. Thus, she was transferred to our facility. Physical examination showed multiple cutaneous ulcers with gray undermined borders and red papules of varying depths involving the chest, back, and upper extremity; lesions were as large as 9 × 15 cm. A complete blood cell count showed a white blood cell count of 16.2 × 103/μL (to convert to 109/L, multiply by 1.0) with an absolute neutrophil count of 12.7 × 103/μL, hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0), and platelet count of 262 × 103/μL with no circulating blasts. Results of additional laboratory studies, including blood culture and tests for herpes zoster virus (via polymerase chain reaction), antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were all negative. Additionally, the patient also had hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for which she was taking lisinopril and simvastatin, respectively. Pathologic sampling from skin lesions demonstrated a dense dermal infiltrate with predominantly neutrophils along with reactive histiocytes, fibroblasts, and angioplasia (Figure, A). Immunohistochemical staining showed myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils (Figure, B), histiocytic markers (CD43, CD63, CD168), and CD117-positive mast cells, but no immature myeloid precursors.

More recently, the patient’s parents noted that he developed stridor while sleeping and while at rest, prompting the family to present for medical attention. Previous workup, including pulmonary function testing, was concerning for an upper airway obstructive process, for which he was referred to otolaryngology. In-office flexible videostroboscopy revealed a mass in the distal cervical trachea that appeared nearly obstructive. Chest radiography confirmed the presence of an approximately 1.5-cm, well-circumscribed soft tissue mass within the cervical trachea. Direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy were performed in the operating room under general anesthesia. This demonstrated an exophytic, pedunculated mass that emanated from the anterior wall of the cervical trachea (Figure 1A and B). The patient was intubated via Seldinger technique to bypass the mass, with a 4.0-mm cuffed endotracheal tube loaded over a 0-degree Hopkins endoscope (Figure 1C). With the airway secured, attention was turned to excision of the mass. Lidocaine, 1%, with epinephrine 1:100 000 was injected in a submucosal plane, and laryngeal scissors were used to excise the attachment of the mass from the tracheal wall.

He denied having any symptoms, tenderness, numbness, or facial nerve weakness. Physical examination revealed a mass in the buccinator space that was smooth, was nontender to palpation, and had no overlying cutaneous changes. A contrast-enhanced maxillofacial computed tomography scan demonstrated a 1.8 × 1.8 × 1.9-cm rounded, well-circumscribed lesion at the anterior aspect of the left masticator space (Figure 1). The mass was abutting the parotid duct, which did not appear dilated, and appeared to have a peripheral rim of hyperenhancing soft tissue with a central cystic/necrotic component. Results of ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration revealed rare epithelial cells with degenerative changes and inflammatory cells present. Findings from a core biopsy demonstrated a spindle cell neoplasm of uncertain origin. On immunostaining, spindle cells were CK8/18, S100, and SOX10 negative; myosin and smooth muscle actin (SMA) negative; and CD31 negative.

On examination, the mass moved with swallowing. The patient had normal thyroid stimulating hormone and calcium levels and a parathyroid hormone (PTH) level of 63 pg/mL. Neck ultrasonography revealed a well-circumscribed anechoic lesion with a diameter of 5.9 cm in the right thyroid lobe without any internal solid nodularity or septation. A neck computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an intrathyroidal lesion extending inferiorly to 3 cm above the angle of Louis causing tracheal compression and displacement (Figure, A). The patient underwent right hemithyroidectomy to relieve tracheal compression. A near-infrared autofluorescence (NIRAF) camera yielded a homogenously dim lesion (Figure, B). Pathologic examination confirmed a normal right thyroid lobe, a normal right parathyroid gland, and a cystic lesion at the inferior pole with no evidence of malignant disease in the specimen. The tissue inside the lesion stained positive for PTH.\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Parathyroid cyst", "predict": "Step 1: Thyroglossal Duct Cyst  \nStep 2: Branchial Cleft Cyst  \nStep 3: Parathyroid Cyst  \nStep 4: Thyroid Adenoma  \nStep 5: Lymphatic Malformation  \nStep 6: Dermoid Cyst  \nStep 7: Cystic Hygroma  \nStep 8: Ectopic Parathyroid Tissue  \nStep 9: Sistrunk's Procedure Residual Cyst  \nStep 10: Intrathyroidal Parathyroid Gland  \n\n### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:\n1.

The lesions appeared without an identifiable cause and spread around the neck. The cords eventually covered the entire anterior neck and upper and lower clavicle areas. The skin lesions formed a corrugated pattern at the time of presentation. The patient had previously been treated with moisturizers at a local clinic for 2 months without any signs of improvement. The patient denied any manipulation or trauma at those sites. There was no personal or family history of keloid formation. The boy was otherwise healthy and met normal developmental milestones. On examination of the patient, there were many short, skin-colored, parallel cords on the patient’s anterior neck areas (Figure, A and B). These cords were indurated, slightly raised, and well defined with a shiny surface. The cords had a uniform width of approximately 2 mm, and the lengths varied from 3 mm to 2 cm. During the course of the examination, an ill-defined sclerotic plaque surrounding the underside of the clavicle was found. It had a shiny surface, irregular shape, and measured 10 × 4 cm. No similar lesions were found on any other part of the patient’s body. Inspection of the patient’s skin revealed no abnormal nail fold capillary dilation or hemorrhage; no sclerodactyly, distal digital pitting, or Raynaud disease; and no extracutaneous involvement.

He experienced a progressive developmental delay such as reduction of head growth, loss of acquired communication, and loss of motor functions between ages 9 and 12 years. The severity of scoliosis increased with age, and he became a wheelchair user at age 18 years. He was referred to us at age 40 years with the characteristic features of growth deceleration (height, 142 cm; weight, 22 kg; body mass index, 11 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]), apraxia, left-sided hemiplegia, spasticity, sleep apnea, constipation, osteoporosis, hypoalgesia, and repetitive hand tapping (Video). Blood reports showed anemia (hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL; to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10) and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (47 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259). There was no history of autistic behavior, vision or hearing impairments, or epilepsy. The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with T wave inversion (V3-V6), and echocardiography showed mild cardiomegaly. The brain magnetic resonance imaging studies showed a diffuse reduction in the corpus callosum involving splenium and enlarged right ventricle, resulting in cerebral lateral ventricular asymmetry (Figure, C).\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Rett syndrome", "predict": "Step 1: Rett Syndrome  \nStep 2: Angelman Syndrome  \nStep 3: Cerebral Palsy  \nStep 4: Fragile X Syndrome  \nStep 5: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy  \nStep 6: Smith-Magenis Syndrome  \nStep 7: Neurofibromatosis Type 1  \nStep 8: Prader-Willi Syndrome  \nStep 9: Mitochondrial Encephalopathy  \nStep 10: Autism Spectrum Disorder  \n\nReranked Differential Diagnosis:\n\n1.

Multiple prior office visits with referring ophthalmologists during which eyes were dilated showed normal results. Clinical examination revealed 180° of left interior subconjunctival hemorrhage with overlying conjunctival elevation and mild fullness of the left lower eyelid (Figure 1A). Fixation was central, steady, and maintained bilaterally, with full ocular motility and absence of appreciable proptosis. Penlight anterior segment examination demonstrated normally formed anterior segment structures without inflammation or hyphema in either eye, although the left eye exhibited a small intraocular lightly pigmented lesion at the 5-o'clock limbus. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) was deemed appropriate and further demonstrated normal intraocular pressures bilaterally. Handheld slitlamp examination localized the left eye 2-mm limbal lesion on the posterior corneal surface. The surrounding corneal and iris structures were normal appearing without evidence of vascularization. Ultrasound biomicroscopy was used to further evaluate both the intraocular lesion and better characterize the left lower eyelid fullness. This demonstrated no iris, angle, or ciliary body involvement by the intraocular lesion.

Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a large right upper lobe cavitary mass. He was treated empirically with intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsy was performed. Lung tissue was sent for bacterial, fungal, mycobacterial, and Nocardia cultures and for histopathology. BAL cultures grew 100 colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL of group B streptococci and 1 CFU/mL of Aspergillus niger. Results of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and GeneXpert MTB/RIF testing were negative. Voriconazole was added to his treatment. Transbronchial biopsy histopathology showed acute and chronic inflammation, granulation tissue and necrosis, and negative fungal and AFB stains. Two weeks later, the patient reported worsening right-sided chest pain provoked by palpation, right arm movement, and deep inspiration. Repeat chest CT demonstrated cavitary mass enlargement with possible pleural invasion (Figure 1, left). He developed hypoxemia and required intubation.

No lymph node abnormality was observed. Fine-needle aspiration was performed, and the smear was extremely cellular and showed sheets and clusters of bland polygonal epithelial cells admixed with bright pink filamentous matrix. Because of the size and location, extracapsular dissection II was carried out.1 The final pathology of the lesion showed histologic findings compatible with salivary gland carcinoma, with microcystic and papillary architecture (Figure, A and B). Abundant bubbly secretion was present within these microcystic spaces, and this material was positive for periodic acid–Schiff (Figure, C). Immunohistochemically, there was positivity for epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin (CK) 7 and CK19, S100 protein, and gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP-15).

The patient had a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome with insulin resistance and a migraine disorder and reported experiencing 1 to 2 migraine episodes per week since early high school. He believed that the neck mass made these episodes worse than normal. The patient was otherwise previously healthy until he developed an upper respiratory infection. His physician noted visible swelling in the right neck and clinically interpreted the finding as enlarged lymph nodes associated with the infection. After 2 weeks, the neck swelling persisted despite the resolution of other symptoms. He was subsequently treated with a course of antibiotics, which did not result in any improvement. The mass slowly enlarged over the next 6 months. The patient reported new symptoms, including waxing and waning pain that radiated to the back of his neck, headaches, and intermittent dysphagia. He also noted periods during which the mass would fluctuate in size. Otolaryngologic examination findings were within normal limits except for a single, nontender, compressible right neck mass deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and extending into level V.

Prior to presentation, he had been prescribed fluticasone and loratadine for allergic rhinitis without resolution of symptoms. He denied difficulty breathing, epistaxis, rhinorrhea, fever, chills, weight loss, or night sweats. He was a nonsmoker and nondrinker.

A rhinoscopy revealed normal mucosa with a submucosal, round, firm, tender lesion, measuring approximately 1 cm and located on the right anterior nasal septum. No drainage was visualized. His turbinates appeared normal. The patient underwent surgical excision of the septal lesion under general anesthesia for definitive diagnosis. The specimen measured 1.1 × 0.7 × 0.2 cm and was erythematous, soft, vascular, and adherent, with a broad base to the anterior superior nasal septal mucosa just inferior to the upper lateral cartilage (Figure 1A and B).

His mental state had deteriorated progressively over the previous 12 months, following the death of his father. After a period living alone, he had returned to the family home 4 months prior to his presentation and had been noted to be socially withdrawn, preoccupied, and distractible. His family physician, suspecting a depressive episode, had prescribed citalopram up to a dosage of 40 mg once daily, to no effect. His family subsequently sought advice from the family physician when the patient was noted to be speaking to himself, expressing concerns about people meaning him harm, and professing the belief that he could hear other peoples’ thoughts. The patient had been born in Sierra Leone after a complicated delivery and had traveled to the United Kingdom as a child with his family, who were fleeing from a civil war. On arrival in the United Kingdom, his family claimed asylum and moved into a small apartment in a high-rise building in central London. Although there was no reported developmental delay, he had struggled academically at school and was bullied for having overweight. He left school without qualifications at age 16 years and worked as a shop assistant. He left this job about a year prior to his referral to psychiatry after a period of sick leave following the death of his father. He was a nonsmoker, did not drink alcohol, and denied illicit drug use. A paternal relative was reported to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia. There was no comorbid physical illness. On review, the patient was kempt and had overweight. Eye contact was fleeting, and he presented as anxious, with a degree of psychomotor agitation. His speech was normal in rate, volume, and tone, although tangential. There was no other evidence of thought disorder. He denied feeling low in mood or suicidal and was objectively euthymic. There was some sleep disturbance, with the patient reporting being fearful to go to sleep owing to persecutory beliefs regarding his neighbors. He reflected that over the preceding few months, he had experienced a sensation of detachment from his immediate environment, as though it was not real, making his world similar to that of a video game. He reported that in the apartment where he had previously been living, he had realized that something was amiss and had become convinced that the door number of his neighbor’s flat, number 6, signified that they meant him harm. He explained this was because 6 was associated with the number of the devil. He reported hearing his neighbors commenting negatively about his appearance. These distressing experiences prompted him to return to his family home, but he continued to hear his neighbors’ voices making derogatory comments about his appearance and began to hear them commenting on his actions and thoughts in the third person as well. On returning home, his paranoia regarding his previous neighbors worsened, resulting in him rarely leaving the house. The volume and frequency of derogatory auditory hallucinations also worsened, and he reported hearing the thoughts of others as well.

Pulmonary Embolism\n   - Although classic signs like ST elevation are not typical for PE, its abrupt onset and severe presentation warrant consideration, particularly with associated ECG changes.\n\n4. Unstable Angina\n   - This is less likely given the presence of elevated troponin and clear ECG changes pointing towards STEMI, but is considered given the high-risk coronary background.\n\n5. Pericarditis\n   - Typically, global ST-segment elevation is noted rather than localized; coupled with elevated troponin, pericarditis remains lower on the list.\n\n6.

The patient reported a history of a local burn from hot food but denied any history of trauma, foreign body, or piercing. She was evaluated, given a presumptive diagnosis of sialadenitis, and discharged home with ibuprofen and clindamycin. She returned several days later with worsening tongue swelling, voice change, and subjective fever. Postcontrast axial computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a midline lesion within the oral tongue that was predominantly hypodense and demonstrated rim enhancement. No calcifications were seen within the lesion (Figure, A). The lesion was predominantly isointense to muscle on axial T1-weighted images without intravenous (IV) contrast (Figure, B). Axial T2-weighted images with fat saturation showed predominantly hyperintense signal relative to muscle as well as punctate internal foci of T2 hypointensity (not shown). The lesion was hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging (Figure, C) and hypointense on the apparent diffusion coefficient map (not shown).

Four months ago, she was treated for presumed pneumonia with azithromycin without improvement. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use intravenous drugs. She was born in the United States and had not traveled outside of the country. She took no medications. On examination, her temperature was 37°C, heart rate 110/min, blood pressure 123/72 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 20/min. She had a palpable 2×2-cm firm, nontender, right supraclavicular lymph node and decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion in the right lower lung field. No hepatosplenomegaly or leg edema was noted. Routine laboratory tests, including complete blood cell counts, renal function, electrolytes, and hepatic function, were within normal limits. A chest x-ray demonstrated diffuse homogeneous opacification of the right lung field. Computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a 15 × 11-cm centrally necrotic mass in the right anterior mediastinum displacing the trachea to the left, a large right pleural effusion, and compression of the superior vena cava (Figure 1).\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Hodgkin lymphoma", "predict": "1. **Hodgkin's Lymphoma**  \n   Given the patient's age, symptoms of fatigue, unintentional weight loss, mediastinal mass, and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, Hodgkin's lymphoma is a potential differential diagnosis.\n\n2. **Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma**  \n   Similar to Hodgkin's, this is another type of lymphoma that could explain the large anterior mediastinal mass and systemic symptoms.\n\n3. **Thymoma**  \n   The presence of a large anterior mediastinal mass could also suggest thymoma, which is a tumor originating from the thymus.\n\n4. **Germ Cell Tumor**  \n   A mediastinal mass in a young adult is also suspicious for a germ cell tumor, particularly a seminoma or other non-seminomatous germ cell tumors.\n\n5. **Primary Mediastinal (Thymic) Large B-Cell Lymphoma**  \n   This is a subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, often presenting with large masses in the mediastinum in young adults.\n\n6. **Lung Cancer**  \n   Though less common in her demographic, particularly without smoking history, it's still a possibility, especially given the pleural effusion and mediastinal involvement.\n\n7. **Sarcoidosis**  \n   This granulomatous disease can cause mediastinal lymphadenopathy and pulmonary symptoms, although typically it presents with bilateral hilar adenopathy more commonly than unilateral masses.\n\n8. **Tuberculosis**  \n   TB can present with significant weight loss, fatigue, and pulmonary involvement, although more systemic symptoms or history might be expected. \n\n9. **Infectious Mononucleosis**  \n   Associated lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms could suggest this, though the presence of a large mediastinal mass is unusual.\n\n10. **Castleman Disease**  \n   This rare lymphoproliferative disorder could potentially present with mediastinal mass and systemic symptoms, though it is less common.\n\n### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:\n1. **Hodgkin's Lymphoma**  \n2. **Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma**  \n3. **Primary Mediastinal (Thymic) Large B-Cell Lymphoma**  \n4. **Germ Cell Tumor**  \n5. **Thymoma**  \n6. **Lung Cancer**  \n7. **Sarcoidosis**  \n8. **Castleman Disease**  \n9. **Tuberculosis**  \n10. **Infectious Mononucleosis**\n\n(Note: The diagnosis is refocused primarily on lymphoproliferative disorders due to the combination of the mediastinal mass, lymphadenopathy, and systemic symptoms.
