Vascular risk factors like hypertension and hyperlipidemia increase the likelihood of recurrent NAION.\n\n2. **Glaucoma**\n   - The optic disc excavation and visual field defects are consistent with glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Although intraocular pressure readings are not provided, normal-tension glaucoma cannot be ruled out.\n\n3. **Optic Nerve Drusen**\n   - Anomalous optic discs with excavation suggest optic nerve drusen, which can cause visual field defects and mimic other optic neuropathies.\n\n4. **Optic Disc Pit**\n   - The central excavation of the optic disc is characteristic of an optic disc pit, which can lead to visual field defects due to nerve fiber layer abnormalities.\n\n5. **Compressive Optic Neuropathy**\n   - A mass lesion compressing the optic nerve could explain unilateral optic nerve dysfunction and visual field loss, warranting neuroimaging for evaluation.\n\n6. **Ethambutol-Induced Optic Neuropathy**\n   - While ethambutol toxicity typically presents bilaterally and affects color vision (which is normal here), the possibility remains, especially with prolonged use.\n\n7. **Optic Nerve Coloboma**\n   - A congenital defect that can cause optic disc anomalies and visual field defects, though less likely without prior symptoms.\n\n8. **Optic Neuritis**\n   - Inflammation of the optic nerve usually presents with pain and affects younger individuals; however, atypical presentations can occur.\n\n9. **Fabry Disease**\n   - Early-onset proteinuria suggests a systemic condition like Fabry disease. Ocular manifestations include corneal and lenticular changes, but optic nerve involvement is rare.\n\n10. **Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy**\n    - Typically affects younger males with bilateral, painless vision loss and a strong family history, making it less likely in this case.", "topic": "['Chronic Kidney Disease', 'Surgery', 'Transplantation', 'Renal Replacement', 'Nephrology']"}

No other anomalies were observed. Ultrasonography revealed a 1.2 × 1.0 × 0.9 cm, hypoechoic, avascular, bulging nodule with an anechoic tubular structure extending to the subcutaneous fat and reaching the surface of the muscular layer. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a protuberant nodule with diffuse, slight hyperintensity on T1WI; and 2 mild hyperintense foci surrounded by hypointense tissue on fat-suppressed T2WI (Figure, B). The neck mass was completely excised under general anesthesia in the department of pediatric surgery. Intraoperatively, the mass extended into the anteromedial fascia of the left SCM and did not involve the deeper neck structures. Postoperative histopathologic analysis showed normal-appearing epidermis, multiple pilosebaceous follicles, abundant adipose tissue, and 2 centrally circumscribed segments of cartilage in the subcutis (Figure, C).

Five months after surgery, she presented to the otolaryngology clinic with 3 weeks of mild odynophagia and dysphagia. It was noted that the patient had a prominent posterior pharyngeal wall, subtle asymmetry of vocal fold motion, and pooling of secretions in the left pyriform (Video 1). During the next 6 months, she gradually developed shortness of breath and stridor, and eventually presented to the emergency department in respiratory distress requiring intubation for 2 days. Shortly after extubation, laryngeal examination showed fullness of the posterior pharyngeal wall and severely limited vocal fold abduction bilaterally (Figure 1A; Video 1). A modified barium swallow study showed intermittent laryngeal penetration without aspiration (Video 2).

During the following months, the papules grew in number and size, involving the head and neck, trunk, extremities, right palm, mons pubis, and buttocks. At the height of severity, the patient had 39 lesions, some of which were associated with ulceration and bleeding. The patient was born at full term via spontaneous vaginal delivery; the birth mother had not received prenatal care. Neither the birth mother nor the infant had any known history of environmental or occupational exposure to hazardous substances. The paternal family medical history was unremarkable; maternal family medical history was unknown. Physical examination revealed numerous bright red macules, papules, and plaques ranging in size from 1.0 × 1.0 mm to 2.2 × 2.3 cm, many of which had hemorrhagic crust and dark scale (Figure, A and B). Additional examination findings included retrognathia, thickened maxillary frenulum, and anterior ankyloglossia.\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Congenital disseminated pyogenic granuloma", "predict": "**Step 1: Infantile Hemangiomas**\n\nInfantile hemangiomas are common benign vascular tumors in infants, presenting as bright red papules, macules, or plaques. They typically appear shortly after birth, proliferate for several months, and then gradually involute. The presence of multiple lesions aligns with this diagnosis.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: PHACE Syndrome**\n\nPHACE syndrome encompasses Posterior fossa brain malformations, Hemangiomas, Arterial anomalies, Cardiac defects, and Eye abnormalities. Large segmental hemangiomas of the head and neck, along with craniofacial anomalies like retrognathia and ankyloglossia, suggest this syndrome.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Diffuse Neonatal Hemangiomatosis**\n\nDiffuse neonatal hemangiomatosis involves multiple cutaneous hemangiomas present at or shortly after birth. It can affect internal organs, leading to serious complications. The extensive number of skin lesions raises this possibility.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis**\n\nLangerhans cell histiocytosis can present in infants with multiple skin lesions ranging from papules to ulcerative nodules. Systemic involvement is possible, and skin lesions may crust or scale, matching some clinical features described.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Kaposiform Hemangioendothelioma**\n\nThis rare vascular tumor presents in infancy with deep-seated, lesion(s) that can ulcerate and bleed. It is often associated with Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon, leading to coagulopathy. The ulceration and bleeding of lesions make this a consideration.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus Syndrome**\n\nCharacterized by multiple venous malformations in the skin and gastrointestinal tract, lesions are bluish, compressible, and may bleed. The cutaneous findings partly align, though the color and systemic involvement differ.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7: Congenital Hemangiomas**\n\nCongenital hemangiomas are fully formed at birth and can be either rapidly involuting (RICH) or non-involuting (NICH). They present as solitary lesions but multiple lesions are rare, making this a less likely but possible diagnosis.\n\n---\n\n**Step 8: Maffucci Syndrome**\n\nThis syndrome involves multiple enchondromas and hemangiomas. While the vascular lesions can ulcerate and bleed, the skeletal anomalies (enchondromas) are a key feature, which if absent, make this diagnosis less probable.\n\n---\n\n**Step 9: Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia**\n\nAn inherited disorder causing abnormal blood vessel formation, leading to telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations. Presentation in infancy is uncommon, and lesions are usually not papular, making this less likely.\n\n---\n\n**Step 10: Pyogenic Granuloma**\n\nA benign vascular lesion that appears as a red papule prone to ulceration and bleeding. It often arises after trauma and is typically solitary, which makes it less consistent with multiple congenital lesions.\n\n---\n\n**Reranked Differential Diagnoses:**\n\n1. **PHACE Syndrome**\n2. **Diffuse Neonatal Hemangiomatosis**\n3. **Infantile Hemangiomas**\n4. **Kaposiform Hemangioendothelioma**\n5. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis**\n6. **Congenital Hemangiomas**\n7. **Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus Syndrome**\n8. **Maffucci Syndrome**\n9. **Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia**\n10. **Pyogenic Granuloma**\n\n---\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\nBased on the patient's presentation of multiple cutaneous hemangiomas present at birth, proliferating in size and number, combined with craniofacial anomalies (retrognathia, thickened maxillary frenulum, and ankyloglossia), **PHACE Syndrome** emerges as the most likely diagnosis. The extensive number of lesions and their characteristics also strongly suggest **Diffuse Neonatal Hemangiomatosis** as a critical consideration. **Infantile Hemangiomas** remain a possibility due to their prevalence but are typically less extensive.

On temporal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an oval cystic mass was revealed at the same location, with high signal intensity on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images and low signal intensity on enhanced T1-weighted fat suppression and T2-weighted short T1 inversion recovery images (Figure, A-D). In surgery, the well-demarcated cystic mass was completely excised. Yellowish fluid leaked out of the cyst during excision. On histopathologic examination, the cyst was lined by keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium with hair follicles and sebaceous glands. The cyst contained keratinous debris (Figure, E).

His ocular history was notable for recent cataract surgery 5 weeks prior to presentation that was complicated by endophthalmitis. A normal funduscopic examination was documented prior to cataract surgery. At the time of initial presentation to his local retina specialist 1 week following his cataract surgery, the patient had severe pain and redness. His visual acuity was light perception. An examination revealed a 2-mm hypopyon and dense vitreous haze with no view of the retina. He was treated for presumed endophthalmitis with a vitreous tap and intravitreal injections of vancomycin (1 mg/0.1 mL), ceftazidime (2.2 mg/0.1 mL), and dexamethasone (0.4 mg/0.1 mL). The vitreous sample obtained at the time of treatment grew Staphylococcus caprae susceptible to vancomycin. At time of examination in our clinic 4 weeks following treatment, the patient was receiving topical steroid and cycloplegic drops. His best-corrected visual acuity had improved to 20/70. Examination showed a deep and quiet anterior chamber with a well-positioned intraocular lens without any plaques or deposits on the lens capsule. Dilated ophthalmoscopic examination demonstrated improvement in the vitreous debris with 1+ vitritis and numerous superficial, round, white lesions spread throughout the fundus in all 4 quadrants and in the macula (Figure 1A).

A differential blood cell count revealed 10% eosinophils (normal, <6%) and an absolute eosinophil count 500/µL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). Titers for antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, anti-Ro (SS-A), and anti-La (SS-B) were negative. Sialendoscopy of his right parotid and left submandibular glands found no obstructing stones or strictures. Concurrent steroid irrigation did not provide any substantial benefit. An open biopsy of the right parotid tail revealed nonspecific inflammatory changes and otherwise normal parenchyma. Given the frequency and severity of his symptoms along with multiple treatment failures, he opted to undergo a right superficial parotidectomy, which proceeded without complications.

Orbital metastases can cause acute proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and periorbital swelling.\n\n2. **Carcinoid syndrome**\n   - Flushing and palpitations are classic symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. Although ophthalmic involvement is rare, serotonin-induced vasomotor changes could contribute to periorbital edema and chemosis.\n\n3. **Cavernous sinus thrombosis**\n   - Presents with bilateral ophthalmoplegia, proptosis, chemosis, and periorbital edema due to impaired venous drainage. Acute onset fits the clinical picture.\n\n4. **Superior vena cava syndrome**\n   - Obstruction of the superior vena cava can lead to facial and periorbital edema. However, ophthalmoplegia is less common.\n\n5. **Idiopathic orbital inflammatory disease (orbital pseudotumor)**\n   - Causes acute orbital signs like pain, proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and swelling. Usually unilateral but can be bilateral.\n\n6. **Thyroid eye disease (Graves' ophthalmopathy)**\n   - Common cause of bilateral proptosis and ophthalmoplegia. However, there's no mention of thyroid dysfunction.\n\n7. **Orbital lymphoma**\n   - Can present with painless proptosis and motility disturbances. Less likely acute in onset.\n\n8. **Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's granulomatosis)**\n   - Can involve the orbit causing proptosis and ophthalmoplegia but usually associated with systemic symptoms like sinusitis.\n\n9. **Allergic reaction (angioedema)**\n   - Can cause periorbital swelling and chemosis but unlikely to cause ophthalmoplegia or proptosis.\n\n10. **Orbital cellulitis**\n    - Typically unilateral and associated with signs of infection like fever and pain.\n\n---\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\nBased on the patient's history of metastatic NET with possible recurrence, acute orbital symptoms, and systemic signs (flushing and palpitations), the most likely diagnosis is **metastatic orbital disease from NET**. Carcinoid syndrome is also a strong consideration due to the flushing and palpitations. Cavernous sinus thrombosis remains a critical differential due to the acute bilateral ophthalmic signs and requires prompt evaluation.", "topic": "['Ophthalmology', 'Oncology', 'Surgery', 'Surgical Oncology', 'External Eye Disease']"}

Over the next 3 days, she had rising serum creatinine (sCr) levels (baseline, approximately 1 mg/dL [to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4]). The initial workup included ultrasonography and urinalysis. Ultrasonography results showed abnormal intraparenchymal flow to both kidneys without evidence of kidney artery stenosis. Urine studies were consistent with prerenal etiology, while the presence of casts suggested acute tubular necrosis. Nephrotoxic medications (omeprazole/pantoprazole) were discontinued. The top differential diagnoses at this juncture included contrast-induced nephropathy or immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)–induced acute interstitial nephritis, and empirical high dose steroids were prescribed. Despite observation and steroid treatment, her sCr levels continued to increase over the next 5 days, peaking at 5.8 mg/dL, and the patient progressed into anuric kidney failure, requiring hemodialysis. This prompted a kidney biopsy for definitive diagnosis (Figure). One week later, she received encorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor. Two weeks later, the patient’s kidney function began to improve, and hemodialysis was discontinued. She continued to show gradual improvement, with a return to near baseline kidney function (sCr level, 1.3 mg/dL) approximately 6 weeks after treatment initiation.\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Acute tubular necrosis secondary to kidney melanoma metastasis", "predict": "### Differential Diagnoses:\n\n1. **Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced acute interstitial nephritis**\n2. **Contrast-induced nephropathy**\n3. **Acute tubular necrosis**\n4. **Thrombotic microangiopathy**\n5. **Renal vein thrombosis**\n6. **Tumor lysis syndrome**\n7. **Malignant infiltration of the kidneys by melanoma**\n8. **Bilateral renal artery thrombosis**\n9. **Cholesterol emboli**\n10. **Acute urate nephropathy**\n\n### Re-ranked Differential Diagnoses:\n\n1. **Malignant infiltration of the kidneys by melanoma**\n2. **Bilateral renal artery thrombosis**\n3. **Thrombotic microangiopathy**\n4. **Renal vein thrombosis**\n5. **Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced acute interstitial nephritis**\n6. **Acute tubular necrosis**\n7. **Cholesterol emboli**\n8. **Contrast-induced nephropathy**\n9. **Tumor lysis syndrome**\n10. **Acute urate nephropathy**", "topic": "['Nephrology', 'Melanoma', 'Oncology']"}

Her medical history was notable for HIV, with a last known CD4 lymphocyte count of 112 cells/mm3 and variable adherence to antiretroviral therapy. At an outside hospital, cultures were obtained, and treatment was initiated with ofloxacin eye drops, 0.3%, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride ointment, 0.3%, and oral moxifloxacin hydrochloride, 400 mg daily. Her symptoms worsened, and she was referred 3 days later for further evaluation. On examination, visual acuity in the right eye was hand motions. The left eye examination results were unremarkable. Slitlamp examination was limited by patient discomfort but revealed purulent discharge, a markedly inflamed conjunctiva, diffuse cornea opacification and thinning, and a flat anterior chamber. Given the history of tree branch trauma, the patient was brought to the operating room. Intraoperatively, a 0.5-mm corneal perforation was identified within an area of thinning (Figure, A). Microbial cultures were repeated, and corneal glue was applied. Gram stain of the purulent discharge demonstrated numerous polymorphonuclear leukocytes only. All subsequent microbiology cultures were negative. Despite treatment with topical fortified vancomycin, 25 mg/mL, tobramycin, 13.3 mg/mL, intravenous levofloxacin, 750 mg daily, and doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily, the purulent conjunctivitis and corneal stromal necrosis did not improve (Figure, B).\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Gonococcal keratoconjunctivitis", "predict": "Sure, here's the 10-step differential diagnosis:\n\n**Step 1:** Bacterial keratitis  \n**Step 2:** Fungal keratitis  \n**Step 3:** Acanthamoeba keratitis  \n**Step 4:** Herpes simplex virus keratitis  \n**Step 5:** Nocardia keratitis  \n**Step 6:** Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection  \n**Step 7:** Cytomegalovirus keratitis  \n**Step 8:** Microsporidial keratitis  \n**Step 9:** Necrotizing scleritis  \n**Step 10:** Autoimmune keratitis\n\nNow, reranking all 10 differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:\n\n1. **Fungal keratitis**\n2. **Acanthamoeba keratitis**\n3. **Nocardia keratitis**\n4. **Microsporidial keratitis**\n5. **Cytomegalovirus keratitis**\n6. **Herpes simplex virus keratitis**\n7. **Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection**\n8. **Bacterial keratitis**\n9. **Necrotizing scleritis**\n10. **Autoimmune keratitis**", "topic": "['Cornea', 'Sexually Transmitted Infections', 'External Eye Disease', 'Ophthalmology', 'HIV']"}

He denied ocular disease, trauma, or surgery. He had no medical problems aside from chronic back pain due to a herniated disc. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/25 OS. Intraocular pressure, extraocular motility, and pupillary examination results were normal. The right eye was unremarkable. Examination of the left eye showed 2 temporal scleral nodules with surrounding hyperemia and no scleromalacia. He experienced substantial pain with palpation. Posterior examination results were unremarkable. The results of the following laboratory tests were all unremarkable: tuberculosis interferon-γ release assay, rapid plasma reagin, fluorescent treponemal antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and angiotensin-converting enzyme. The rheumatoid factor level (18 IU/mL [normal range, <14 IU/mL]) and C-reactive protein level (26 mg/L [normal range, 0-5 mg/L]) were elevated. In addition, Lyme IgG, IgM, and reflex Western blot assays were positive for antibodies. The patient denied travel to Lyme-endemic regions, tick bites, or rashes. The patient started oral prednisone therapy for possible rheumatoid arthritis (RA)–associated nodular scleritis, doxycycline therapy for positive Lyme studies, and was referred to a rheumatologist for further RA evaluation. Two weeks after presentation and initiation of oral prednisone therapy, the patient noted improvement in pain, but the scleral nodules and hyperemia persisted. Therefore, subconjunctival triamcinolone acetonide (0.5 mL of 40 mg/mL) was administered to the left eye. Further confirmatory RA workup by rheumatology did not reveal other systemic findings thought to be associated with RA on review of symptoms or clinical examination. The patient's back pain was associated with his herniated disc. Subsequently, the patient’s examination results showed new scleral thinning of the left eye with persistence of the scleral nodules (Figure 1).\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Mycobacterium infectious scleritis", "predict": "1.

The mass had been slowly enlarging and she had been experiencing mild intermittent pain, but no additional symptoms were reported. Her medical history was significant for several episodes of upper respiratory infection during the previous winter season, and she previously had an adenotonsillectomy several years prior and bilateral ear tubes placed 1 year before presentation. Physical examination showed a mildly tender, nonmobile, left parotid mass near the angle of the mandible with no overlying skin changes or drainage around the mass. There was no lymphadenopathy or other lesions noted in the neck area, and cranial nerve VII was fully intact. Ultrasonography results of the neck showed a left 1.5-cm preauricular nodular mass with internal and marginal vascularity. A neck magnetic resonance imaging study without contrast performed at an outside institution revealed the 1.5-cm heterogeneous intraparotid nodule that was predominantly isotense to glandular tissue on T1 images with vague hypointensity of a small irregular central region, as well as vague hyperintensity on T2 images. She subsequently underwent fine needle aspiration biopsy to assess the lesion, which demonstrated benign-appearing salivary gland tissue and clusters of myoepithelial cells. The mass was continuing to enlarge, and the patient’s pain was increasing in that area, so the decision was made to perform left superficial parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve. Intraoperatively, the left parotid mass was noted to be just below the lower branches of the facial nerve. The excised parotid mass was sent to the pathology department for analysis. Gross examination of the specimen demonstrated a 1.6 × 1.5 × 1.1–cm tan-white, well-circumscribed lesion that was partially surrounded by salivary gland parenchyma (Figure, A).

He described a burning sensation inside his mouth that worsened with using mouthwash and eating spicy foods. He had no history of cigarette smoking or use of chewing tobacco but had chewed areca nuts for many years while living in India. Currently, he reported chewing areca nuts daily to weekly.

Clinical features such as progressive reduction in oral aperture (interincisal distance of 25 mm), burning sensation exacerbated by spicy foods, and thickened buccal mucosa with white-tan plaques support this diagnosis. Biopsy findings of subepithelial fibrosis with stromal hyalinization further confirm oral submucous fibrosis.\n\n2. **Oral Lichen Planus**\n\n   Oral lichen planus can present with white plaques and mucosal changes. However, it is often associated with a reticular pattern and may involve erosive lesions, which are not described. Biopsy typically shows a band-like lymphocytic infiltrate, which is absent here.\n\n3. **Leukoplakia**\n\n   Leukoplakia presents as white plaques that cannot be scraped off and is a premalignant condition. The absence of dysplasia on biopsy makes this less likely, but it remains a consideration due to the mucosal changes.\n\n4. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Oral Cavity**\n\n   While the patient has risk factors (areca nut chewing), the biopsy did not show epithelial dysplasia or malignancy. However, squamous cell carcinoma can develop on a background of oral submucous fibrosis, warranting ongoing surveillance.\n\n5. **Systemic Sclerosis (Scleroderma)**\n\n   Scleroderma can cause oral manifestations like reduced oral aperture due to skin tightening. However, it usually presents with skin changes and systemic symptoms, which the patient does not have.\n\n6. **Burning Mouth Syndrome**\n\n   This condition causes a burning sensation in the mouth without observable clinical signs. The presence of mucosal lesions and fibrosis makes this less likely.\n\n7. **Oral Candidiasis**\n\n   Oral candidiasis can cause white plaques, but these are typically removable and associated with immunosuppression or antibiotic use, which are not indicated here.\n\n8. **Iron Deficiency Anemia (Plummer-Vinson Syndrome)**\n\n   Plummer-Vinson syndrome can cause mucosal changes and burning sensation. However, other features like esophageal webs and anemia symptoms are not reported.\n\n9. **Pemphigus Vulgaris**\n\n   Pemphigus vulgaris involves painful erosions and bullae, with acantholysis seen on biopsy, which is absent in this case.\n\n10. **Amyloidosis**\n\n    Oral amyloidosis can cause macroglossia and mucosal changes but is rare and often associated with systemic disease, which is not suggested here.\n\n---\n\n**Final Diagnosis:** The most probable diagnosis for this patient is **Oral Submucous Fibrosis**, given the clinical presentation, risk factors, and biopsy results.", "topic": "['Tobacco and e-Cigarettes', 'Dental Medicine', 'Pain Medicine', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine', 'Lifestyle Behaviors']"}

Prior to presentation, an outside ophthalmologist treated him with 1 week of oral prednisone, 20 mg/d, for presumed orbital inflammation with no improvement. He denied additional symptoms. Notably, he described headache and sudden vision loss in the right eye after coronary artery bypass grafting 1 year ago for several days before spontaneous improvement with incomplete resolution. Personal and family histories were negative for malignant neoplasm and autoimmune disease. Examination revealed right-sided uncorrected Snellen visual acuity of 20/60 associated with restricted supraduction, abduction, and infraduction. Pupils were equal in size without a relative afferent pupillary defect, and intraocular pressures were 10 mm Hg OD and 11 mm Hg OS. Visual fields had temporal restriction to confrontation of the right eye. Vision, motility, and visual fields were normal on the left. Pertinent findings included right-sided proptosis of 2 mm, cranial nerve V1 and V2 hypoesthesia, eyelid ptosis with a margin to reflex distance 1 of 0 mm, optic disc pallor, and vessel attenuation. Outside magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated an infiltrative mass involving right greater than left orbital apices, the right optic nerve, and right extraocular muscles. There was enhancement of the cavernous sinuses, right pterygopalatine fossa, right sphenoid wing, and right middle cranial fossa dura (Figure 1).\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Neurosarcoidosis", "predict": "### OUTPUT:\n\n**Step 1:** Thyroid eye disease\n\n**Step 2:** Orbital lymphoma\n\n**Step 3:** Giant cell arteritis\n\n**Step 4:** Optic nerve sheath meningioma\n\n**Step 5:** Sarcoidosis\n\n**Step 6:** Nasopharyngeal carcinoma\n\n**Step 7:** IgG4-related disease\n\n**Step 8:** Tolosa-Hunt syndrome\n\n**Step 9:** Metastatic colon cancer\n\n**Step 10:** Orbital pseudotumor\n\n**Reranked Differential Diagnoses:**\n\n1. **Orbital lymphoma**\n2. **Metastatic colon cancer**\n3. **Nasopharyngeal carcinoma**\n4. **IgG4-related disease**\n5. **Sarcoidosis**\n6. **Optic nerve sheath meningioma**\n7. **Tolosa-Hunt syndrome**\n8. **Thyroid eye disease**\n9. **Giant cell arteritis**\n10. **Orbital pseudotumor**", "topic": "['External Eye Disease', 'Ophthalmology', 'Orbit']"}

His medical history was positive for relapsing urinary tract infections since early infancy without adequate follow-up. Findings of an ophthalmological examination 1 year prior were reported as normal. At initial examination, he was conscious but somewhat lethargic. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/80 OS. Pupillary light responses, extrinsic ocular motility, anterior segment biomicroscopy, and intraocular pressure were normal in both eyes. Dilated fundus examination revealed a bilateral sectorial macular star that was more extended in the left eye, with retinal veins slightly dilated and tortuous, attenuated arterioles, some juxta and peripapillary nerve fiber layer infarcts, and optic disc edema with marked papillary telangiectasia; in addition, some faint, small, tan-yellow dots were observed at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium in the posterior pole, some of them already grayish and with a hypopigmented halo (Figure 1).

Four years earlier, she started taking lenalidomide, 10 mg/d (28-day cycle), to treat worsening anemia; after 2 cycles of treatment, she became transfusion independent. Since then, she has remained stable with the same dose and schedule of lenalidomide without significant adverse effects. The presenting skin lesions developed 1 month before presentation and began as small pustules that rapidly transformed into painful ulcers. She was treated with valacyclovir for a presumed diagnosis of shingles, but the lesions did not improve. Because of suspected necrotizing fasciitis, she underwent incision and drainage of the lesions. Cultures from the surgical specimen grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus hemolyticus. However, the lesions continued to worsen despite vancomycin and additional debridement. Thus, she was transferred to our facility.

His symptoms were initially most prominent while playing sports and were suspected to be due to asthma or seasonal allergies. However, medical management with albuterol, intranasal fluticasone, and cetirizine failed to provide relief. More recently, the patient’s parents noted that he developed stridor while sleeping and while at rest, prompting the family to present for medical attention. Previous workup, including pulmonary function testing, was concerning for an upper airway obstructive process, for which he was referred to otolaryngology. In-office flexible videostroboscopy revealed a mass in the distal cervical trachea that appeared nearly obstructive. Chest radiography confirmed the presence of an approximately 1.5-cm, well-circumscribed soft tissue mass within the cervical trachea. Direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy were performed in the operating room under general anesthesia. This demonstrated an exophytic, pedunculated mass that emanated from the anterior wall of the cervical trachea (Figure 1A and B). The patient was intubated via Seldinger technique to bypass the mass, with a 4.0-mm cuffed endotracheal tube loaded over a 0-degree Hopkins endoscope (Figure 1C). With the airway secured, attention was turned to excision of the mass. Lidocaine, 1%, with epinephrine 1:100 000 was injected in a submucosal plane, and laryngeal scissors were used to excise the attachment of the mass from the tracheal wall. The mass was then resected en bloc and removed with laryngeal cupped forceps.

The absence of systemic findings makes isolated foveal hypoplasia the most likely diagnosis.\n\n2. **Ocular Albinism**  \n   - Ocular albinism can present with foveal hypoplasia and reduced visual acuity. However, the lack of nystagmus and normal pigmentation of the skin and hair make this less likely.\n\n3. **Aniridia**  \n   - Aniridia is associated with foveal hypoplasia and visual impairment. The normal anterior segment examination and absence of iris abnormalities make this diagnosis less probable.\n\n4. **X-linked Juvenile Retinoschisis**  \n   - Intraretinal cystoid spaces within the inner nuclear layer are characteristic. However, this condition primarily affects males, making it less likely in a female patient.\n\n5. **Familial Exudative Vitreoretinopathy**  \n   - Abnormal peripheral vasculature could suggest this condition. However, the lack of significant familial history and exudation reduces its likelihood.\n\n6. **Achromatopsia**  \n   - Presents with reduced visual acuity and foveal hypoplasia.

She was diagnosed with a capillary hemangioma, and propranolol was started at age 1 month with progression despite dosage increases. Topical timolol was tried without improvement; oral prednisolone decreased the size of the lesion, but was poorly tolerated and discontinued. An ophthalmic evaluation at an outside hospital was concerning for amblyopia because of anisohypermetropia, greater on the left, and a left esotropia and hypertropia.

At that time, his best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/70 OU. The patient did not receive any ophthalmological care until 2 years later, when he was seen for marked vision loss and was noted to have a BCVA of light perception in both eyes. When he presented to the pediatric retina service, he demonstrated poor mentation and was unable to recall simple things such as the name of his siblings. His BCVA was light perception. His pupils were round and reactive. The anterior segment examination and intraocular pressures were within normal limits. Fundus autofluorescence disclosed attenuated, narrow vasculature and diffuse peripheral patchy hypoautofluorescence (Figure 1A). Color fundus photography showed optic disc pallor, attenuated retinal vasculature, prominent choroidal markings, and central retinal atrophy with diffusely mottled pigmentation (Figure 1B).

Her medical history comprised unexplained sensory hearing loss, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis. At age 23 years, she had bilateral cataract surgery, and over the last 2 years, she developed worsening stiffness and walking difficulties with frequent falls. She reported features of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome (RLS), visual daytime hallucinations, and rapid cognitive decline. She was given levodopa/benserazide (up to 200 mg/50 mg 4 times daily) without improvement on her Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale scores. Therefore, her dopaminergic medication was ceased. Family history was negative for movement or developmental disorders. Her neurologic examination showed hypomimia, symmetrical bradykinesia, and rigidity of the extremities without tremors (Video). There was full range of eye movements with large-amplitude saccadic intrusions on smooth pursuit in all directions. Neuropsychological assessment revealed significant abnormalities in cognitive functioning, affecting verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills (ie, speed of information processing, visuospatial skills, verbal and visual memory loss, executive skills). Mini-Mental Status Examination score was 26 of 30 points. Systemic examination was unremarkable. Laboratory and cerebral spinal fluid testing (ie, paraneoplastic antibodies Hu, Yo, Ri, CV2, Ma2, amphiphysin, glutamic acid decarboxylase, N-methyl-d-aspartic acid, LGI1, and Caspr2, 14-3-3 protein) were normal.

An expanding pituitary macroadenoma can compress adjacent cranial nerves, including the trochlear nerve, leading to diplopia and ophthalmoplegia. Headache and nausea are consistent with a mass effect causing increased intracranial pressure.\n\n2. **Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri)**\n\n   - **Justification:** Although more common in young women, it can occur in men. Increased intracranial pressure can cause headache, nausea, and cranial nerve VI palsy, but cranial nerve IV can also be affected.\n\n3. **Left trochlear nerve palsy secondary to demyelinating disease (multiple sclerosis)**\n\n   - **Justification:** Demyelinating lesions can affect cranial nerves, leading to isolated nerve palsies in young adults. Although less common, multiple sclerosis should be considered.\n\n4. **Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (idiopathic orbital inflammation)**\n\n   - **Justification:** This syndrome causes painful ophthalmoplegia due to inflammation in the cavernous sinus or orbital apex, affecting cranial nerves III, IV, and VI.\n\n5. **Myasthenia gravis affecting ocular muscles**\n\n   - **Justification:** Myasthenia gravis can present with diplopia and ophthalmoplegia. However, it usually affects multiple extraocular muscles and presents with fatigability, which is not described here.\n\n6. **Brainstem lesion affecting the trochlear nerve (e.g., midbrain tumor)**\n\n   - **Justification:** A lesion in the dorsal midbrain could affect the trochlear nerve nucleus, leading to isolated cranial nerve IV palsy.\n\n7. **Orbital apex syndrome due to mass lesion**\n\n   - **Justification:** A mass at the orbital apex can compress cranial nerves II, III, IV, V1, and VI, but visual acuity and fields are normal, making this less likely.\n\n8. **Congenital superior oblique palsy**\n\n   - **Justification:** Congenital palsy typically presents in childhood, but decompensation can occur later.

She had no medical history or family history of cancer and was not a smoker. In the absence of other suggestive symptoms, as well as a normal physical examination that did not reveal any enlarged cervical lymph nodes or oropharyngeal or neck mass and an unremarkable nasoendoscopic examination, a diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux was made. The patient was advised to try conservative management with dietary advice and proton pump inhibitors, and a clinical review was scheduled in 6 weeks. The patient only returned 3 months later when her hoarseness became worse. Repeat nasoendoscopy now showed left vocal cord palsy in the paramedian position. In the absence of a history of trauma and associated neurological or systemic symptoms, the main concern was an underlying tumor that impinged on the vagus nerve at various points or its recurrent branch. Results of a computed tomographic (CT) scan showed an ill-defined soft tissue mass, which was likely nodal disease, at the left supraclavicular (Figure 1), as well as the prevertebral and paravertebral region, which partially encased the left common carotid, left subclavian, and left vertebral arteries. This was along the expected course of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve and likely accounted for the left vocal cord palsy. However, the primary site of disease remained unclear.

Results of a previous intestinal biopsy had shown unspecific findings and absence of apoptosis. She reported a 5-kg weight loss that she attributed to impaired intake owing to the oral lesions. She was also being evaluated for a mediastinal mass detected in radiography of the chest performed for pneumonia. Physical examination revealed whitish edematous lacy patches with erosions on the dorsal and lateral aspects of the tongue and buccal mucosa (Figure, A); skin and nails were not involved. A lingual biopsy specimen was obtained for pathologic evaluation and direct immunofluorescence (DIF; Figure, B and C). The result of indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) testing, using monkey esophagus, salt-skin split, and rat bladder as substrates, was negative. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblot analysis did not detect any desmoglein-1 or -3, bullous pemphigoid-180 or -230, collagen VII, desmocollin-1 to -3, laminin-332, envoplakin, or periplakin antibodies. Results were normal for liver function; negative for hepatitis B and C; indicative of hypogammaglobulinemia, with a decreased immunoglobulin (Ig) G serum level of 465 mg/dL (normal, 750-1600 g/L; for g/L, multiply by 0.01); and normal for IgA and IgM levels.

She was found to only have a complete limitation of elevation of her right eye and a limitation of abduction in her left eye (Figure). She was orthophoric in primary position, and there were no eyelid twitches. Orbicularis oculi strength was reduced on both sides. A dilated fundus examination had normal results bilaterally. An initial neurological examination, including assessments of motor strength in the upper and lower extremities and reflexes and a sensory examination, had normal results.\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Ocular myasthenia gravis", "predict": "### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:\n\n1. **Myasthenia Gravis**\n2. **Cranial Nerve III Palsy**\n3. **Cranial Nerve VI Palsy**\n4. **Thyroid Eye Disease**\n5. **Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia**\n6. **Brainstem Stroke**\n7. **Mitochondrial Myopathy (Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia)**\n8. **Miller Fisher Syndrome**\n9. **Botulism**\n10. **Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome**\n\n### Reranked Differential Diagnoses Using All Patient Information:\n\n1. **Myasthenia Gravis**\n\n   *The presentation of fluctuating diplopia worse at the end of the day, right ptosis, bilateral extraocular muscle weakness (limitation of elevation in the right eye and abduction in the left eye), and reduced orbicularis oculi strength on both sides strongly suggests myasthenia gravis. The absence of pupil involvement and normal neurological examination elsewhere supports this diagnosis.*\n\n2. **Mitochondrial Myopathy (Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia)**\n\n   *This condition can cause bilateral ptosis and ophthalmoplegia. However, it usually presents at a younger age and progresses slowly, making it less likely but still a consideration.*\n\n3. **Thyroid Eye Disease**\n\n   *Thyroid eye disease can cause extraocular muscle dysfunction and ptosis. The lack of other signs such as proptosis and a euthyroid status makes it less likely but it remains in the differential.*\n\n4. **Botulism**\n\n   *Botulism can present with ophthalmoplegia and ptosis due to cranial nerve involvement. However, it typically also includes autonomic symptoms and generalized weakness, which are not present here.*\n\n5. **Miller Fisher Syndrome**\n\n   *A variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome characterized by ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia. The patient does not exhibit ataxia or areflexia, making this diagnosis less probable.*\n\n6. **Cranial Nerve III Palsy**\n\n   *A third nerve palsy could explain the ptosis and limitation of elevation in the right eye. However, the pupils are normal, and there is also involvement of the left eye, which is unusual for an isolated nerve palsy.*\n\n7. **Cranial Nerve VI Palsy**\n\n   *A sixth nerve palsy could explain the limitation of abduction in the left eye. Bilateral involvement and additional signs make an isolated nerve palsy less likely.*\n\n8. **Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia**\n\n   *Caused by a lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus, leading to impaired horizontal eye movements. It is more common in multiple sclerosis, typically affecting younger individuals.*\n\n9. **Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome**\n\n   *This syndrome causes muscle weakness but usually affects the proximal muscles and is associated with autonomic symptoms and diminished reflexes, which are not observed in this patient.*\n\n10. **Brainstem Stroke**\n\n    *A stroke could cause cranial nerve deficits, but the absence of other neurological signs and the normal motor and sensory examinations make this diagnosis less likely.*\n\n---\n\n**Final Notes:**\n\nBased on the patient's symptoms and examination findings—specifically the fluctuating nature of the symptoms, involvement of multiple cranial nerves, fatigability, and lack of pupil involvement—**myasthenia gravis** is the most probable diagnosis. Further investigations such as antibody testing (acetylcholine receptor antibodies), electromyography, and a Tensilon test would be helpful in confirming the diagnosis.", "topic": "['Myasthenia Gravis', 'Neuro-ophthalmology', 'Neurology', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Ophthalmology']"}

The lesions appeared without an identifiable cause and spread around the neck. The cords eventually covered the entire anterior neck and upper and lower clavicle areas. The skin lesions formed a corrugated pattern at the time of presentation. The patient had previously been treated with moisturizers at a local clinic for 2 months without any signs of improvement. The patient denied any manipulation or trauma at those sites. There was no personal or family history of keloid formation. The boy was otherwise healthy and met normal developmental milestones. On examination of the patient, there were many short, skin-colored, parallel cords on the patient’s anterior neck areas (Figure, A and B). These cords were indurated, slightly raised, and well defined with a shiny surface. The cords had a uniform width of approximately 2 mm, and the lengths varied from 3 mm to 2 cm. During the course of the examination, an ill-defined sclerotic plaque surrounding the underside of the clavicle was found. It had a shiny surface, irregular shape, and measured 10 × 4 cm.

The patient’s medications included ondansetron, aprepitant, prednisolone, and oxycodone (supportive care initiated with chemotherapy), and long-term posaconazole and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole treatment. Lesions were noted on day 2 of the fourth cycle of a chemotherapy regimen comprising fludarabine, cytarabine, and filgrastim (G-CSF). Initially present over the distal limbs, palms, and soles, the lesions progressed to the proximal limbs and lower trunk during 24 hours (Figure, A and B). The patient developed a fever, which we extensively investigated. Intravenous cefotaxime was commenced, but because no infectious source was identified, the fever was thought to be secondary to cytarabine.\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis", "predict": "### Step 1:\nSweet's syndrome\n\n### Step 2:\nDrug-induced hypersensitivity reaction\n\n### Step 3:\nLeukemia cutis\n\n### Step 4:\nAcute generalized exanthematous pustulosis\n\n### Step 5:\nSerum sickness-like reaction\n\n### Step 6:\nHand-foot syndrome\n\n### Step 7:\nVasculitis\n\n### Step 8:\nPyoderma gangrenosum\n\n### Step 9:\nErythema nodosum\n\n### Step 10:\nErythema multiforme\n\n### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:\n1.

He was born in 1973 at 38th week of gestation followed by a normal delivery (weight, 3.15 kg and head circumference, 42 cm) to nonconsanguineous parents. The head size was normal at birth, and no other abnormalities were seen during his infancy. At age 2 years, his parents noticed that he had delayed motor and language milestones. He experienced a progressive developmental delay such as reduction of head growth, loss of acquired communication, and loss of motor functions between ages 9 and 12 years. The severity of scoliosis increased with age, and he became a wheelchair user at age 18 years. He was referred to us at age 40 years with the characteristic features of growth deceleration (height, 142 cm; weight, 22 kg; body mass index, 11 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]), apraxia, left-sided hemiplegia, spasticity, sleep apnea, constipation, osteoporosis, hypoalgesia, and repetitive hand tapping (Video). Blood reports showed anemia (hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL; to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10) and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (47 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259). There was no history of autistic behavior, vision or hearing impairments, or epilepsy. The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with T wave inversion (V3-V6), and echocardiography showed mild cardiomegaly. The brain magnetic resonance imaging studies showed a diffuse reduction in the corpus callosum involving splenium and enlarged right ventricle, resulting in cerebral lateral ventricular asymmetry (Figure, C).\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Rett syndrome", "predict": "### Step 1: Cerebral palsy  \n### Step 2: Fragile X syndrome  \n### Step 3: Rett syndrome  \n### Step 4: Duchenne muscular dystrophy  \n### Step 5: Mitochondrial encephalopathy  \n### Step 6: Adrenoleukodystrophy  \n### Step 7: Hereditary spastic paraplegia  \n### Step 8: Spinocerebellar ataxia  \n### Step 9: Angelman syndrome  \n### Step 10: Huntington's disease  \n\n**Reranked Differential Diagnoses:**\n\n1.

Multiple prior office visits with referring ophthalmologists during which eyes were dilated showed normal results. Clinical examination revealed 180° of left interior subconjunctival hemorrhage with overlying conjunctival elevation and mild fullness of the left lower eyelid (Figure 1A). Fixation was central, steady, and maintained bilaterally, with full ocular motility and absence of appreciable proptosis. Penlight anterior segment examination demonstrated normally formed anterior segment structures without inflammation or hyphema in either eye, although the left eye exhibited a small intraocular lightly pigmented lesion at the 5-o'clock limbus. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) was deemed appropriate and further demonstrated normal intraocular pressures bilaterally. Handheld slitlamp examination localized the left eye 2-mm limbal lesion on the posterior corneal surface. The surrounding corneal and iris structures were normal appearing without evidence of vascularization. Ultrasound biomicroscopy was used to further evaluate both the intraocular lesion and better characterize the left lower eyelid fullness. This demonstrated no iris, angle, or ciliary body involvement by the intraocular lesion. A 10-MHz contact B-scan examination showed a large inferior orbital lesion measuring more than 17 mm in the anterior-to-posterior dimension (Figure 1B).

He had no prior medical or surgical history and took no medications. Ultrasonography demonstrated a solid and hypoechoic mass, 1.5 × 1.0 × 0.9 cm, in the inferior right parotid gland with minimal vascularity and without extraparotid extension. No lymph node abnormality was observed. Fine-needle aspiration was performed, and the smear was extremely cellular and showed sheets and clusters of bland polygonal epithelial cells admixed with bright pink filamentous matrix. Because of the size and location, extracapsular dissection II was carried out.1 The final pathology of the lesion showed histologic findings compatible with salivary gland carcinoma, with microcystic and papillary architecture (Figure, A and B). Abundant bubbly secretion was present within these microcystic spaces, and this material was positive for periodic acid–Schiff (Figure, C). Immunohistochemically, there was positivity for epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin (CK) 7 and CK19, S100 protein, and gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP-15). Stains for gastrointestinal stromal tumors 1 (DOG1) and p63 were negative. The tumor appeared to be contained within the surgical excision margins.

Her primary care physician initially obtained an ultrasonographic image, which demonstrated a left, level 2 lymph node measuring 4.0 × 1.5 × 2.8 cm. The patient then underwent several courses of antibiotic treatment, but the mass persisted. After a period of conservative management, she developed a sore throat and fever. She subsequently underwent a computed tomographic scan of the neck and chest with contrast, which demonstrated an isolated, enlarged, homogenously enhancing left-neck level 2B lymph node measuring 3.4 × 2.8 × 2.1 cm (Figure 1A). When she presented to our facility, she was found to have an asymptomatically enlarged left level 2/5A neck mass that was nontender and fixed. The patient had an unremarkable medical, surgical, and social history and no known infectious exposures. A white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level were both elevated, at 11 310 cells/μL (to convert to cells × 109 per liter, multiply by 0.001) and 56.2 mg/L (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 9.524), respectively.

The patient had a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome with insulin resistance and a migraine disorder and reported experiencing 1 to 2 migraine episodes per week since early high school. He believed that the neck mass made these episodes worse than normal. The patient was otherwise previously healthy until he developed an upper respiratory infection. His physician noted visible swelling in the right neck and clinically interpreted the finding as enlarged lymph nodes associated with the infection. After 2 weeks, the neck swelling persisted despite the resolution of other symptoms. He was subsequently treated with a course of antibiotics, which did not result in any improvement. The mass slowly enlarged over the next 6 months. The patient reported new symptoms, including waxing and waning pain that radiated to the back of his neck, headaches, and intermittent dysphagia.

Let’s think step by step.\n### INPUT:\nA 20-year-old man was referred by his family physician to a community mental health team in London, United Kingdom. His mental state had deteriorated progressively over the previous 12 months, following the death of his father. After a period living alone, he had returned to the family home 4 months prior to his presentation and had been noted to be socially withdrawn, preoccupied, and distractible. His family physician, suspecting a depressive episode, had prescribed citalopram up to a dosage of 40 mg once daily, to no effect. His family subsequently sought advice from the family physician when the patient was noted to be speaking to himself, expressing concerns about people meaning him harm, and professing the belief that he could hear other peoples’ thoughts. The patient had been born in Sierra Leone after a complicated delivery and had traveled to the United Kingdom as a child with his family, who were fleeing from a civil war. On arrival in the United Kingdom, his family claimed asylum and moved into a small apartment in a high-rise building in central London. Although there was no reported developmental delay, he had struggled academically at school and was bullied for having overweight. He left school without qualifications at age 16 years and worked as a shop assistant. He left this job about a year prior to his referral to psychiatry after a period of sick leave following the death of his father. He was a nonsmoker, did not drink alcohol, and denied illicit drug use. A paternal relative was reported to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia. There was no comorbid physical illness. On review, the patient was kempt and had overweight. Eye contact was fleeting, and he presented as anxious, with a degree of psychomotor agitation. His speech was normal in rate, volume, and tone, although tangential. There was no other evidence of thought disorder. He denied feeling low in mood or suicidal and was objectively euthymic. There was some sleep disturbance, with the patient reporting being fearful to go to sleep owing to persecutory beliefs regarding his neighbors. He reflected that over the preceding few months, he had experienced a sensation of detachment from his immediate environment, as though it was not real, making his world similar to that of a video game. He reported that in the apartment where he had previously been living, he had realized that something was amiss and had become convinced that the door number of his neighbor’s flat, number 6, signified that they meant him harm. He explained this was because 6 was associated with the number of the devil. He reported hearing his neighbors commenting negatively about his appearance. These distressing experiences prompted him to return to his family home, but he continued to hear his neighbors’ voices making derogatory comments about his appearance and began to hear them commenting on his actions and thoughts in the third person as well. On returning home, his paranoia regarding his previous neighbors worsened, resulting in him rarely leaving the house. The volume and frequency of derogatory auditory hallucinations also worsened, and he reported hearing the thoughts of others as well. There was a degree of insight, and although the patient was convinced of the reality of his experiences, he also saw the stress of losing his father as associated with his experiences and was accepting of input from mental health services.\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Schizophrenia", "predict": "### OUTPUT:\n1.

Approximately 2½ years after the transplant, the patient developed gastric outlet obstruction secondary to an infiltrative gastric wall mass. The gastric wall mass was found to be associated with plasmablastic posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (pPTLD). She was subsequently instructed to stop use of mycophenolate and decrease use of tacrolimus to 0.25 mg daily, then treated with 1 cycle of CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone) and lenalidomide, resulting in symptomatic and radiologic improvement. Five weeks after treatment with CHOP chemotherapy, the patient presented with an acute-onset abdominal skin eruption without fever or pain. A computed tomographic scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed possible abdominal wall cellulitis, so treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin was empirically started.

Her comorbidities included congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and a 50-pack-year history of tobacco abuse. Physical examination revealed a firm, nonmobile, nontender, bulging mass situated over the right frontal sinus, which expanded to the upper right eyelid. The mass covered the globe completely, resulting in total vision obstruction (Figure, A). However, the patient’s vision remained intact when the mass was elevated off the eye with great effort. Her right pupil was round and reactive to light without afferent pupillary defect. No palpable lymphadenopathy was noted. A non–contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a large, right supraorbital mass with bony destruction of the anterior table of the right frontal sinus (Figure, B). It extended into the superior aspect of the orbit, displacing the right globe inferiorly. Air was seen within the mass (Figure, C). A fine-needle aspiration biopsy yielded inconclusive results. After medical clearance, the patient was taken to the operating room for a wedge excisional biopsy with decompression of the right supraorbital mass under monitored anesthesia care.

The lack of traditional atherosclerotic risk factors and acute coronary findings support this diagnosis.\n\n2. **Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome**\n   - *Reasoning:* A history of spontaneous abortion raises suspicion for antiphospholipid syndrome, which can cause arterial thrombosis leading to myocardial infarction in the absence of atherosclerosis.\n\n3. **Acute myocardial infarction due to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease**\n   - *Reasoning:* Despite the absence of traditional risk factors, coronary artery disease remains a common cause of MI. The patient's age and ethnicity may contribute to non-traditional risk factors.\n\n4. **Coronary vasospasm (Prinzmetal angina)**\n   - *Reasoning:* Coronary vasospasm can cause myocardial ischemia and infarction with ST-segment elevations. It tends to occur at rest and may explain the acute presentation.\n\n5. **Takayasu arteritis**\n   - *Reasoning:* This large-vessel vasculitis can involve the coronary arteries, leading to ischemia. It is more common in younger individuals and can present with myocardial infarction.\n\n6. **Cocaine-induced myocardial infarction**\n   - *Reasoning:* Cocaine use causes vasospasm and thrombosis. While there is no mention of substance use, it remains a differential in acute MI in younger patients.\n\n7. **Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (stress-induced cardiomyopathy)**\n   - *Reasoning:* Often presents with chest pain and ST-segment changes but typically does not show significant coronary artery obstruction on angiography.\n\n8. **Aortic dissection**\n   - *Reasoning:* Presents with chest pain radiating to the back. However, normal chest radiography and absence of mediastinal widening make this less likely.\n\n9. **Coronary embolism from infective endocarditis**\n   - *Reasoning:* Could cause acute coronary occlusion, but there's no evidence of infection or embolic phenomena.\n\n10. **Sickle cell disease-related myocardial ischemia**\n    - *Reasoning:* Sickle cell disease can cause vaso-occlusion leading to MI.

The patient reported a history of a local burn from hot food but denied any history of trauma, foreign body, or piercing. She was evaluated, given a presumptive diagnosis of sialadenitis, and discharged home with ibuprofen and clindamycin. She returned several days later with worsening tongue swelling, voice change, and subjective fever. Postcontrast axial computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a midline lesion within the oral tongue that was predominantly hypodense and demonstrated rim enhancement. No calcifications were seen within the lesion (Figure, A). The lesion was predominantly isointense to muscle on axial T1-weighted images without intravenous (IV) contrast (Figure, B). Axial T2-weighted images with fat saturation showed predominantly hyperintense signal relative to muscle as well as punctate internal foci of T2 hypointensity (not shown). The lesion was hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging (Figure, C) and hypointense on the apparent diffusion coefficient map (not shown). Sagittal T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with IV contrast and fat suppression demonstrated signal hypointense to muscle centrally with peripheral enhancement (Figure, D).\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Abscess", "predict": "1.

Four months ago, she was treated for presumed pneumonia with azithromycin without improvement. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use intravenous drugs. She was born in the United States and had not traveled outside of the country. She took no medications. On examination, her temperature was 37°C, heart rate 110/min, blood pressure 123/72 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 20/min. She had a palpable 2×2-cm firm, nontender, right supraclavicular lymph node and decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion in the right lower lung field. No hepatosplenomegaly or leg edema was noted. Routine laboratory tests, including complete blood cell counts, renal function, electrolytes, and hepatic function, were within normal limits. A chest x-ray demonstrated diffuse homogeneous opacification of the right lung field. Computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a 15 × 11-cm centrally necrotic mass in the right anterior mediastinum displacing the trachea to the left, a large right pleural effusion, and compression of the superior vena cava (Figure 1).\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Hodgkin lymphoma", "predict": "### Differential Diagnosis:\n\n**Step 1:** Hodgkin lymphoma  \n**Step 2:** Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma)  \n**Step 3:** Mediastinal germ cell tumor  \n**Step 4:** Thymoma  \n**Step 5:** Teratoma  \n**Step 6:** Sarcoidosis  \n**Step 7:** Tuberculosis  \n**Step 8:** Bronchogenic carcinoma  \n**Step 9:** Metastatic carcinoma  \n**Step 10:** Lymphangioma  \n\n### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:\n\n1.
