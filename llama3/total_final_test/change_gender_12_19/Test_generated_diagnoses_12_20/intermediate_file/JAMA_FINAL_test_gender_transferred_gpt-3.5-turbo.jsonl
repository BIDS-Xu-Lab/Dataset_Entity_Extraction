The patient reported experiencing tightness and discomfort in the left side of the neck but denied experiencing any pain. She denied any recent incidents of neck trauma or impact. Furthermore, her medical history did not reveal any previous hematological disorders. The ultrasonography examination detected the presence of a well-defined, solid mass located in the left lobe of the thyroid gland. The mass exhibited regular shape, distinct boundaries, heterogeneous echogenicity, and observable blood flow signals. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck detected heterogeneous density mass shadows within the soft tissue region near the left lobe of the thyroid, exhibiting distinct boundaries measuring 53 × 41 × 88 mm. Subsequent enhanced CT did not reveal notable enhancement of the cystic components of the mass (Figure 1). Due to persistent symptoms, the patient expressed a desire for surgical resection.

The remainder of her medical history was noncontributory. Inspection of the right lower eyelid revealed a cystic-appearing nodule that transilluminated and had a few overlying telangiectasias. The cystic portion was continuous with a deeper, smooth subcutaneous component that was well defined, firm, and nonmobile, with a total lesion length of 1 cm (Figure 1A). There was no madarosis, eyelid margin effacement or preauricular lymphadenopathy. Although no overt features of malignancy were present, the deeper component was atypical for a hidrocystoma and an excisional biopsy was performed. Histopathologic evaluation showed a neoplasm composed of low-grade round nuclei growing in a micropapillary pattern within pools of extracellular mucin (Figure 1B). There was tumor present at the margin. Immunostains were positive for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor. Variable staining for INSM1, a sensitive nuclear stain for neuroendocrine differentiation, and focal staining for synaptophysin, another neuroendocrine marker, were also seen.

The initial best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 4/20 (approximately 20/100), and an irregular superficial corneal ulcer with an epithelial defect size of 3 mm × 5 mm was found in the center of edematous cornea. He received penetrating keratoplasty 4 months later, as the ulcer did not heal with intensive medication. Then, topical tobramycin dexamethasone, topical tacrolimus, and daily oral prednisone, 40 mg, were prescribed, with a gradual taper of prednisone to a maintenance dose of 10 mg. At 5-month postoperative follow-up, some thin snowflakelike matter was found deposited on the iris and in the angle, with rare cell and mild flare in the anterior chamber. He was then diagnosed with uveitis and subsequently prescribed topical prednisone, subconjunctival triamcinolone acetonide, oral prednisone, 40 mg, and daily intravenous ganciclovir, 5 mg/kg. An aqueous sample was obtained for diagnostic polymerase chain reaction, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was detected with a DNA load of 3.12 × 107 cells. Nine months after the keratoplasty, when he presented to the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, his BCVA was 2/100 OD (approximately 20/1000 OD), and his intraocular pressure was 19 mm Hg. Diffuse tiny nodules were observed all over the iris, along with more snowflake and severe cataract (Figure 1A). The fundus could not be seen. B-ultrasonography showed a dense opacity in the anterior vitreous body (Figure 1B).\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Ocular polymorphic posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders in the left eye", "predict": "1.

His vital signs, including temperature, respiration, and heart rate, were within normal ranges. One month later, he returned due to skin eruptions that continued to wax and wane. Physical examination revealed multiple round or irregularly shaped erythematous macules and slightly scaly plaques of various sizes on the face, trunk, and extremities. Bullous and vesicular lesions were observed on the thighs, with scattered facial erosions. Mucous membranes were not found to be affected. He was born to healthy, nonconsanguineous parents. Growth and development were normal for his age and sex. The patient’s family medical history was unremarkable. A skin-punch biopsy and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) assays taken from 1 of the erythematous scaly plaques were performed for further analysis. At the 3-year follow-up, it was found that the vesicles and bullae began to decrease in number when he was 6 months old but intermittently returned after 1 year of age. The number of annular hyperkeratotic plaques had increased (Figure 1A).

Born by cesarean delivery to nonconsanguineous parents, he developed difficulties with head control, standing, and feeding at age 10 months. Subsequently, he faced progressive motor challenges (walking, speech, and swallow); contractures in his fingers, toes, wrists, and knees; and scoliosis. In adolescence, he experienced progressive stiffness, episodes of painful spasms and oculomotor crisis, and galactorrhea unrelated to childbirth in adulthood. His symptoms worsened with age and progressed to his using a wheelchair, having difficulty in speech, and not having access to education. He had a younger brother with similar symptoms who passed away at age 20 years of unknown causes. Upon presentation at age 31 years, he was admitted to our center for further evaluation. He had thin limbs and was of standard height. The neurological and psychological examinations revealed scoliosis, contractures in his fingers and toes, carpal inversion, dysarthria, dysphagia, hypertonia, decreased tendon reflexes, absence of Babinski sign (Figure, A and B), and no psychiatric problems. Blood test results indicated hyperprolactinemia (prolactin level of 47.40 ng/mL; to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1). An electroencephalogram revealed atypical spike-slow wave synchronization in specific brain regions during sleep. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed significant global atrophy particularly in his anterior temporal, lateral, and frontal regions (Figure, C).

The patient reported no anorexia, fever, melena, hematemesis, hematuria, cough, orthopnea, or peripheral edema. Her vital signs were normal except for a heart rate of 103/min. Her white blood cell count was 22 × 103/μL (reference, 4-11 × 103/μL), increased from 4.8 × 103/μL 8 days prior. Her manual differential, which was previously normal, showed 18% bands (0%-10%), 2% metamyelocytes, 7% myelocytes, 7% promyelocytes, and 6% blasts. Her hemoglobin level was 5.2 g/dL (reference, 13-17 g/dL), decreased from 7.4 g/dL, and platelets were 25 × 103/μL (reference, 150-420 × 103/μL), decreased from 268 × 103/μL 8 days prior. Ferritin was 1423 ng/mL (reference, 300-400 ng/mL). Mean corpuscular volume, prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, haptoglobin, vitamin B12, and methylmalonic acid values were normal, and results of a direct antiglobulin test were negative. A computed tomography (CT) scan of her abdomen and pelvis was normal. She received 2 units of packed red blood cells and was admitted to the hospital.

Ophthalmology was consulted to evaluate for a conjunctival foreign body of the left eye. At the time of the examination, her symptoms had resolved; however, she had a photograph from a cellular phone taken during the episode (Figure 1). The photograph shows an irregular, serpiginous extension from beneath the plica semilunaris toward the corneal limbus with localized conjunctival hyperemia. She reported a similar sensation of movement in her left eye that occurred for 1 night about 5 years ago for which she visited an urgent care center where she was diagnosed with allergic conjunctivitis. She also reported recent swelling of the left side of her face with associated numbness and occasional swelling of her left hand, all of which resolved after a few days. She had immigrated from Nigeria 10 years prior, had not returned since, and was working as a traveling nurse.

Five months after surgery, she presented to the otolaryngology clinic with 3 weeks of mild odynophagia and dysphagia. It was noted that the patient had a prominent posterior pharyngeal wall, subtle asymmetry of vocal fold motion, and pooling of secretions in the left pyriform (Video 1). During the next 6 months, she gradually developed shortness of breath and stridor, and eventually presented to the emergency department in respiratory distress requiring intubation for 2 days. Shortly after extubation, laryngeal examination showed fullness of the posterior pharyngeal wall and severely limited vocal fold abduction bilaterally (Figure 1A; Video 1). A modified barium swallow study showed intermittent laryngeal penetration without aspiration (Video 2). Although the patient was unable to tolerate magnetic resonance imaging, a soft tissue computed tomography scan of the neck with contrast revealed a well-positioned plate with no evidence of fluid collection in the setting of a normal leukocyte count. One month later, a neuromuscular specialist investigated potential underlying neurological causes; however, results of nerve conduction, antiacetylcholine receptor, antimuscle-specific kinase, methylmalonic acid, HIV, rapid plasma reagin, vitamin B-12, thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroxine, copper, creatine kinase, and immunofixation studies were all unremarkable.\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Delayed iatrogenic bilateral vocal fold paralysis (BVFP)", "predict": "1.

He had a history of cutaneous nodular melanoma in the right arm. Tumor staging was classified as T3N0M0 in August 2017, at the time of diagnosis and excision. In April 2018, axillary lymphadenectomy was performed for local recurrence and the patient started treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) pembrolizumab, without further local or metastatic evidence of the tumor. Ocular history was positive for cataract surgery bilaterally. After cataract surgery in the right eye, an asymptomatic vision loss was noted and the cause was attributed to the presence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), for which the patient underwent intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections. Examination showed a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/60 OD and 20/20 OS, unremarkable anterior segment findings, and intraocular pressures of 12 mm Hg OU. A fundus examination in the right eye revealed scarce pigmented cells in the anterior vitreous, a dark-pigmented epiretinal membrane, and an area of retinal hyperpigmentation in the inferior temporal arcade corresponding to the CNV (Figure 1). Optical coherence tomography imaging revealed a hyperreflective structure on the surface of the inner retina with increased macular thickness, compatible with the described epiretinal membrane (Figure 1).\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cutaneous melanoma metastatic to the vitreous cavity and deposition of melanoma cells over the epiretinal membrane", "predict": "1.

His symptoms began after relocation to California and occurred more frequently at his home. However, he could not discern any environmental or dietary triggers. He reported pruritus and swelling, which were usually moderate but occasionally severe, prompting several emergency department visits. During an emergency department visit, he was diagnosed with acute parotitis based on clinical and radiographic findings of diffuse gland edema, without salivary stones or masses. His symptoms responded to oral prednisone bursts and diphenhydramine, but not to second-generation antihistamines or montelukast. His workup included immune serology and total immunoglobulin (Ig) E measurements, all of which were within normal limits. A differential blood cell count revealed 10% eosinophils (normal, <6%) and an absolute eosinophil count 500/µL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). Titers for antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, anti-Ro (SS-A), and anti-La (SS-B) were negative. Sialendoscopy of his right parotid and left submandibular glands found no obstructing stones or strictures. Concurrent steroid irrigation did not provide any substantial benefit. An open biopsy of the right parotid tail revealed nonspecific inflammatory changes and otherwise normal parenchyma. Given the frequency and severity of his symptoms along with multiple treatment failures, he opted to undergo a right superficial parotidectomy, which proceeded without complications.

No poliosis or skin changes were noted. A review of systems was unremarkable, most notably a lack of any pulmonary symptoms. A focused laboratory evaluation identified a significantly elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level and antinuclear antibody titer, but serum lysozyme, syphilis, and tuberculosis testing had negative results. To better differentiate between Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome, a lymphoproliferative disorder, or sarcoidosis as the underlying cause of the vitreous inflammation and multilobulated, serous RD in both eyes, a computed tomographic scan was performed.

Three weeks prior, she had developed acute urinary retention. Neurological examination revealed weakness in bilateral lower limbs (Medical Research Council grade 4 on the right and grade 3 on the left), extensor plantar responses, and a sensory level at T6. Magnetic resonance imaging of her thoracic spine was performed 10 days after the onset of weakness and did not show any signal abnormalities or restricted diffusion. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis findings were remarkable for elevated protein (0.14 g/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10]) but white cell count (5 cells/mm3) and glucose levels (54.05 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555]) were normal. Cytology and flow cytometry were negative for malignancy. Antibodies to aquaporin 4 and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein were not detected. The patient developed a sudden worsening of weakness in her legs 2 weeks after initial presentation. Repeated thoracic spine imaging showed an area of T2 hyperintensity in the left posterolateral cord at T7, which did not enhance with contrast or show restricted diffusion (Figure 1A). Notably, she had a 4-year history of an asymptomatic papular skin eruption with more lesions developing in the last 4 months.

Four weeks following receipt of immunotherapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab, she developed acute abdominal pain in the setting of a rapidly rising lactic acid dehydrogenase levels, prompting hospital admission. Imaging results showed mild disease progression (new ascites and periportal metabolic lymph node). Splenic infarct and portal/splenic vein thrombi were identified as etiologies of her acute pain and were presumed to be secondary to hypercoagulable state of malignancy. Over the next 3 days, she had rising serum creatinine (sCr) levels (baseline, approximately 1 mg/dL [to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4]). The initial workup included ultrasonography and urinalysis. Ultrasonography results showed abnormal intraparenchymal flow to both kidneys without evidence of kidney artery stenosis. Urine studies were consistent with prerenal etiology, while the presence of casts suggested acute tubular necrosis. Nephrotoxic medications (omeprazole/pantoprazole) were discontinued. The top differential diagnoses at this juncture included contrast-induced nephropathy or immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)–induced acute interstitial nephritis, and empirical high dose steroids were prescribed. Despite observation and steroid treatment, her sCr levels continued to increase over the next 5 days, peaking at 5.8 mg/dL, and the patient progressed into anuric kidney failure, requiring hemodialysis. This prompted a kidney biopsy for definitive diagnosis (Figure). One week later, she received encorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor. Two weeks later, the patient’s kidney function began to improve, and hemodialysis was discontinued.

He had consulted other physicians, but the cause could not be identified. The symptoms gradually exacerbated, seriously deteriorating his quality of life and causing a 5-kg weight loss. He also experienced insomnia and depression. Antidepressants and psychotherapy, prescribed under the suspicion of a psychogenic cause, did not alleviate his symptoms. He had no relevant medical history and no smoking or drinking history. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological findings were unremarkable. A careful physical examination, with palpation of the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage region on swallowing, revealed a clear clicking movement and right-sided friction with accompanying pain. However, results of laryngoscopy and other common imaging studies showed no pathology. Hence, to assess the dynamic structural changes during swallowing, we performed swallowing dynamic computed tomography (SD-CT), which can reveal moving structures by creating a dynamic-volume data set during swallowing.1,2 Comparison of the reconstructed SD-CT images at rest (Figure 1A) and on swallowing (Figure 1B) revealed that the superior thyroid notch and the right superior border of the thyroid cartilage contacted the hyoid bone internally during maximum laryngeal elevation on swallowing.\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Clicking larynx", "predict": "1.

He denied ocular disease, trauma, or surgery. He had no medical problems aside from chronic back pain due to a herniated disc. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/25 OS. Intraocular pressure, extraocular motility, and pupillary examination results were normal. The right eye was unremarkable. Examination of the left eye showed 2 temporal scleral nodules with surrounding hyperemia and no scleromalacia. He experienced substantial pain with palpation. Posterior examination results were unremarkable. The results of the following laboratory tests were all unremarkable: tuberculosis interferon-γ release assay, rapid plasma reagin, fluorescent treponemal antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and angiotensin-converting enzyme. The rheumatoid factor level (18 IU/mL [normal range, <14 IU/mL]) and C-reactive protein level (26 mg/L [normal range, 0-5 mg/L]) were elevated. In addition, Lyme IgG, IgM, and reflex Western blot assays were positive for antibodies. The patient denied travel to Lyme-endemic regions, tick bites, or rashes. The patient started oral prednisone therapy for possible rheumatoid arthritis (RA)–associated nodular scleritis, doxycycline therapy for positive Lyme studies, and was referred to a rheumatologist for further RA evaluation. Two weeks after presentation and initiation of oral prednisone therapy, the patient noted improvement in pain, but the scleral nodules and hyperemia persisted. Therefore, subconjunctival triamcinolone acetonide (0.5 mL of 40 mg/mL) was administered to the left eye. Further confirmatory RA workup by rheumatology did not reveal other systemic findings thought to be associated with RA on review of symptoms or clinical examination. The patient's back pain was associated with his herniated disc. Subsequently, the patient’s examination results showed new scleral thinning of the left eye with persistence of the scleral nodules (Figure 1).\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Mycobacterium infectious scleritis", "predict": "1.

The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 103 mm/h and a magnetic resonance angiographic examination of the brain was negative for mass, infarction, and hemorrhage. Examination results of a right, superficial, temporal artery biopsy specimen showed chronic, nongranulomatous inflammation surrounding adventitial vessels and extensive subintimal fibrosis, without giant cells or segmental loss of the internal elastic lamina, which was interpreted as compatible with temporal arteritis. High-dose corticosteroid therapy was initiated (1 g methylprednisolone intravenously for 3 days followed by 60 mg/d of oral prednisone). A neuro-ophthalmologic examination performed 1 week later showed an unreactive left pupil with an obvious relative afferent pupillary defect. Optic nerve pallor concomitant with edema and a single flame-shaped hemorrhage at the 4-o’clock position on the disc margin was also observed. Two weeks later, persistent elevation of the ESR and C-reactive protein levels, despite continued oral prednisone therapy, prompted a review of the temporal artery biopsy findings.

The mass had been slowly enlarging and she had been experiencing mild intermittent pain, but no additional symptoms were reported. Her medical history was significant for several episodes of upper respiratory infection during the previous winter season, and she previously had an adenotonsillectomy several years prior and bilateral ear tubes placed 1 year before presentation. Physical examination showed a mildly tender, nonmobile, left parotid mass near the angle of the mandible with no overlying skin changes or drainage around the mass. There was no lymphadenopathy or other lesions noted in the neck area, and cranial nerve VII was fully intact. Ultrasonography results of the neck showed a left 1.5-cm preauricular nodular mass with internal and marginal vascularity. A neck magnetic resonance imaging study without contrast performed at an outside institution revealed the 1.5-cm heterogeneous intraparotid nodule that was predominantly isotense to glandular tissue on T1 images with vague hypointensity of a small irregular central region, as well as vague hyperintensity on T2 images. She subsequently underwent fine needle aspiration biopsy to assess the lesion, which demonstrated benign-appearing salivary gland tissue and clusters of myoepithelial cells. The mass was continuing to enlarge, and the patient’s pain was increasing in that area, so the decision was made to perform left superficial parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve. Intraoperatively, the left parotid mass was noted to be just below the lower branches of the facial nerve. The excised parotid mass was sent to the pathology department for analysis. Gross examination of the specimen demonstrated a 1.6 × 1.5 × 1.1–cm tan-white, well-circumscribed lesion that was partially surrounded by salivary gland parenchyma (Figure, A).

Four years earlier, she started taking lenalidomide, 10 mg/d (28-day cycle), to treat worsening anemia; after 2 cycles of treatment, she became transfusion independent. Since then, she has remained stable with the same dose and schedule of lenalidomide without significant adverse effects. The presenting skin lesions developed 1 month before presentation and began as small pustules that rapidly transformed into painful ulcers. She was treated with valacyclovir for a presumed diagnosis of shingles, but the lesions did not improve. Because of suspected necrotizing fasciitis, she underwent incision and drainage of the lesions. Cultures from the surgical specimen grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus hemolyticus. However, the lesions continued to worsen despite vancomycin and additional debridement. Thus, she was transferred to our facility. Physical examination showed multiple cutaneous ulcers with gray undermined borders and red papules of varying depths involving the chest, back, and upper extremity; lesions were as large as 9 × 15 cm. A complete blood cell count showed a white blood cell count of 16.2 × 103/μL (to convert to 109/L, multiply by 1.0) with an absolute neutrophil count of 12.7 × 103/μL, hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0), and platelet count of 262 × 103/μL with no circulating blasts. Results of additional laboratory studies, including blood culture and tests for herpes zoster virus (via polymerase chain reaction), antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were all negative. Additionally, the patient also had hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for which she was taking lisinopril and simvastatin, respectively. Pathologic sampling from skin lesions demonstrated a dense dermal infiltrate with predominantly neutrophils along with reactive histiocytes, fibroblasts, and angioplasia (Figure, A). Immunohistochemical staining showed myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils (Figure, B), histiocytic markers (CD43, CD63, CD168), and CD117-positive mast cells, but no immature myeloid precursors.

His symptoms were initially most prominent while playing sports and were suspected to be due to asthma or seasonal allergies. However, medical management with albuterol, intranasal fluticasone, and cetirizine failed to provide relief. More recently, the patient’s parents noted that he developed stridor while sleeping and while at rest, prompting the family to present for medical attention. Previous workup, including pulmonary function testing, was concerning for an upper airway obstructive process, for which he was referred to otolaryngology. In-office flexible videostroboscopy revealed a mass in the distal cervical trachea that appeared nearly obstructive. Chest radiography confirmed the presence of an approximately 1.5-cm, well-circumscribed soft tissue mass within the cervical trachea. Direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy were performed in the operating room under general anesthesia. This demonstrated an exophytic, pedunculated mass that emanated from the anterior wall of the cervical trachea (Figure 1A and B). The patient was intubated via Seldinger technique to bypass the mass, with a 4.0-mm cuffed endotracheal tube loaded over a 0-degree Hopkins endoscope (Figure 1C). With the airway secured, attention was turned to excision of the mass. Lidocaine, 1%, with epinephrine 1:100 000 was injected in a submucosal plane, and laryngeal scissors were used to excise the attachment of the mass from the tracheal wall. The mass was then resected en bloc and removed with laryngeal cupped forceps.

She previously received failed systemic and radiation therapy for tumor stage mycosis fungoides (MF). She had received 11 courses of extended beam radiation therapy, including 3 courses of total skin irradiation of 24 to 30 Gy, and focal irradiation to the left posterior thigh and hip/buttock with 2.5/3 Gy to 12.5/24 Gy, respectively, and the right posterior thigh and hip with 2 Gy to 20 and 26 Gy, respectively. Seven years before this visit, she underwent a reduced-intensity, matched, unrelated donor, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Her post-transplant course was complicated by severe chronic graft vs host disease of the skin, eyes, and gut, for which she received systemic corticosteroid therapy, tacrolimus, methotrexate, and long-term extracorporeal photopheresis. Three years after the HSCT, she developed chronic ulcerations on the hips, back, and arms at the site of previously irradiated tumors, as well as multiple friable, hemorrhagic, and bleeding nodules on bilateral hips and her forearms while receiving treatment with corticosteroids and extracorporeal photopheresis. She underwent several debulking procedures and excision biopsies of the nodules, which revealed granulation tissue on histology. In this latest visit, physical examination revealed recurrent hemorrhagic and friable nodules on her left lateral hip and left lateral buttock (Figure 1). Similar nodules were noted on her right hip and forearm. The patient underwent repeated debulking and biopsy. She was also treated with micafungin, amphotericin B, levofloxacin, dapsone, acyclovir, pentamidine, penicillin VK, and posaconazole.

She had a pink macule on her left cheek at birth, which became raised and discolored around age 3 to 4 weeks. She was diagnosed with a capillary hemangioma, and propranolol was started at age 1 month with progression despite dosage increases. Topical timolol was tried without improvement; oral prednisolone decreased the size of the lesion, but was poorly tolerated and discontinued. An ophthalmic evaluation at an outside hospital was concerning for amblyopia because of anisohypermetropia, greater on the left, and a left esotropia and hypertropia. A magnetic resonance image revealed an orbital mass surrounding the left lateral rectus muscle with mass effect on the globe and extension into the eyelid, pterygopalatine fossa, and cheek. Given the risk of amblyopia, the patient underwent 2 embolization and debulking procedures of the orbital and cheek components of the lesion, which were positive for glucose transporter 1 on pathology. However, the esotropia abruptly worsened after the second debulking. At age 3 years, she presented to the clinic with a persistent cheek and orbit lesion, dense amblyopia, large-angle monocular esotropia and hypertropia, and proptosis of the left eye. The left extraocular muscle showed inability to abduct past midline (Figure 1A). A repeated magnetic resonance image showed persistent orbital involvement causing medial displacement of the lateral rectus muscle and mass effect on the globe (Figure 1B).\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Infantile hemangioma", "predict": "1.

At age 23 years, she had bilateral cataract surgery, and over the last 2 years, she developed worsening stiffness and walking difficulties with frequent falls. She reported features of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome (RLS), visual daytime hallucinations, and rapid cognitive decline. She was given levodopa/benserazide (up to 200 mg/50 mg 4 times daily) without improvement on her Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale scores. Therefore, her dopaminergic medication was ceased. Family history was negative for movement or developmental disorders. Her neurologic examination showed hypomimia, symmetrical bradykinesia, and rigidity of the extremities without tremors (Video). There was full range of eye movements with large-amplitude saccadic intrusions on smooth pursuit in all directions. Neuropsychological assessment revealed significant abnormalities in cognitive functioning, affecting verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills (ie, speed of information processing, visuospatial skills, verbal and visual memory loss, executive skills).

Inflammatory markers were elevated with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 130 mm/h and a C-reactive protein level of 1.48 mg/dL (to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10). The patient noted floaters in his right eye, which prompted an ophthalmology consultation. On bedside examination, his near visual acuity was J1+ (Snellen equivalent, 20/20 OU), and color vision was full in both eyes; the patient’s intraocular pressure, pupils, extraocular movements, and confrontational visual fields were all unremarkable. Dilated examination revealed grade I and II optic disc edema in the right and left eyes, respectively, and peripapillary hemorrhage in the right eye. Optical coherence tomography was obtained 3 days after initial consultation, which confirmed bilateral disc edema, more pronounced in the left eye than the right eye (Figure 1), and 24-2 Humphrey visual field examination in both eyes was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits with and without contrast and lumbar puncture were obtained, and results showed diffuse signal abnormality in the bone marrow compartment and findings suggestive of papilledema. Magnetic resonance venography did not reveal thrombosis.

She had no medical history or family history of cancer and was not a smoker. In the absence of other suggestive symptoms, as well as a normal physical examination that did not reveal any enlarged cervical lymph nodes or oropharyngeal or neck mass and an unremarkable nasoendoscopic examination, a diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux was made. The patient was advised to try conservative management with dietary advice and proton pump inhibitors, and a clinical review was scheduled in 6 weeks. The patient only returned 3 months later when her hoarseness became worse. Repeat nasoendoscopy now showed left vocal cord palsy in the paramedian position. In the absence of a history of trauma and associated neurological or systemic symptoms, the main concern was an underlying tumor that impinged on the vagus nerve at various points or its recurrent branch. Results of a computed tomographic (CT) scan showed an ill-defined soft tissue mass, which was likely nodal disease, at the left supraclavicular (Figure 1), as well as the prevertebral and paravertebral region, which partially encased the left common carotid, left subclavian, and left vertebral arteries. This was along the expected course of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve and likely accounted for the left vocal cord palsy. However, the primary site of disease remained unclear.

Following an upper respiratory tract infection 1 month prior, she developed disseminated red, scaly patches and a progressive eruption of hyperpigmented and hypopigmented patches of skin. She had occasional nonbloody loose stools but no fevers or vomiting. Although she was otherwise well, her growth had fallen from the 75th to the 25th percentile for height and weight over the preceding 9 months, and she could speak only 2 words. Her medical history was notable for atopic dermatitis and diarrhea in infancy that prompted allergy testing at age 6 months; she was subsequently diagnosed with milk, egg, and peanut allergies. Her parents avoided feeding her these foods, providing her only soy-based milk and formula, with improvement of dermatitis, until age 1 year. Since then her diet had consisted of multiple rice milk feeds daily, supplemented only with pureed fruits and vegetables, pasta, snack puffs, and sunflower butter. The patient had no history of meconium ileus or family history of cystic fibrosis. There was no recent travel and no changes to the home environment. On presentation, the patient was irritable, with normal vital signs. She displayed prominent labial swelling and pitting edema of the legs bilaterally. Skin examination was notable for erythematous, denuded patches with peeling scale and reticulate hyperpigmentation, accentuated on the abdomen, back, diaper area, and extensor extremities (Figure; left panel).

He was born in 1973 at 38th week of gestation followed by a normal delivery (weight, 3.15 kg and head circumference, 42 cm) to nonconsanguineous parents. The head size was normal at birth, and no other abnormalities were seen during his infancy. At age 2 years, his parents noticed that he had delayed motor and language milestones. He experienced a progressive developmental delay such as reduction of head growth, loss of acquired communication, and loss of motor functions between ages 9 and 12 years. The severity of scoliosis increased with age, and he became a wheelchair user at age 18 years. He was referred to us at age 40 years with the characteristic features of growth deceleration (height, 142 cm; weight, 22 kg; body mass index, 11 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]), apraxia, left-sided hemiplegia, spasticity, sleep apnea, constipation, osteoporosis, hypoalgesia, and repetitive hand tapping (Video). Blood reports showed anemia (hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL; to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10) and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (47 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259). There was no history of autistic behavior, vision or hearing impairments, or epilepsy. The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with T wave inversion (V3-V6), and echocardiography showed mild cardiomegaly. The brain magnetic resonance imaging studies showed a diffuse reduction in the corpus callosum involving splenium and enlarged right ventricle, resulting in cerebral lateral ventricular asymmetry (Figure, C).\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Rett syndrome", "predict": "1.

Multiple prior office visits with referring ophthalmologists during which eyes were dilated showed normal results. Clinical examination revealed 180° of left interior subconjunctival hemorrhage with overlying conjunctival elevation and mild fullness of the left lower eyelid (Figure 1A). Fixation was central, steady, and maintained bilaterally, with full ocular motility and absence of appreciable proptosis. Penlight anterior segment examination demonstrated normally formed anterior segment structures without inflammation or hyphema in either eye, although the left eye exhibited a small intraocular lightly pigmented lesion at the 5-o'clock limbus. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) was deemed appropriate and further demonstrated normal intraocular pressures bilaterally. Handheld slitlamp examination localized the left eye 2-mm limbal lesion on the posterior corneal surface. The surrounding corneal and iris structures were normal appearing without evidence of vascularization. Ultrasound biomicroscopy was used to further evaluate both the intraocular lesion and better characterize the left lower eyelid fullness.

Ultrasonography revealed multiple enlarged hyperemic lymph nodes within the right side of the neck, the largest measuring 3.4 × 2.4 × 2.1 cm in the submandibular space. He was treated with oral antibiotics without improvement. Ultrasonography at 1-month follow-up revealed interval enlargement of the lymph nodes, which appeared rounded in shape, without preservation of internal architecture. The mother reported that the patient lost 3.2 kg in 2 months, without any chills or night sweats, difficulty swallowing or breathing, change in voice, abdominal pain, recent travel, or exposure to animals or pets. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated extensive unilateral right-sided neck adenopathy, the largest nodes measuring approximately 4 cm at level IB; an approximately 2-cm destructive mass involving the left maxillary malar eminence; and additional lesions involving the T4 vertebra and upper sternum (Figure, A and B). Fluorodeoxyglucose 18F-labeled positron emission tomography with computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) demonstrated extensive FDG-avid right-sided cervical lymphadenopathy and innumerable FDG-avid lytic foci involving the axial and appendicular skeleton (Figure, C).\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Rosai-Dorfman disease", "predict": "1.

The patient’s medical history was notable for severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) diagnosed in the fall of 2017, when she presented with snoring, progressive daytime fatigue, and several years of migraines. Since her diagnosis, she had been adherent to use of nightly continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). However, she had persistent daytime fatigue and morning headaches. Several months before presentation, the patient noticed that her bite changed from an overbite to an underbite (Figure, A), which had been attributed to dental malocclusion from her CPAP machine.

The patient had a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome with insulin resistance and a migraine disorder and reported experiencing 1 to 2 migraine episodes per week since early high school. He believed that the neck mass made these episodes worse than normal. The patient was otherwise previously healthy until he developed an upper respiratory infection. His physician noted visible swelling in the right neck and clinically interpreted the finding as enlarged lymph nodes associated with the infection. After 2 weeks, the neck swelling persisted despite the resolution of other symptoms. He was subsequently treated with a course of antibiotics, which did not result in any improvement. The mass slowly enlarged over the next 6 months. The patient reported new symptoms, including waxing and waning pain that radiated to the back of his neck, headaches, and intermittent dysphagia. He also noted periods during which the mass would fluctuate in size. Otolaryngologic examination findings were within normal limits except for a single, nontender, compressible right neck mass deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and extending into level V. The patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan prior to presentation at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center’s otolaryngology clinic. The scan showed a fatty-appearing tumor within the right carotid space. The patient underwent surgical excision, and a mass measuring 8.0 × 6.5 × 4.7–cm was removed from the carotid space (Figure, A). Additional material from the mass was excised at the level of the base of the skull. Gross pathologic examination demonstrated yellowish-brown, homogenous, lobular adipose tissue covered by a thin, tan, transparent membrane (Figure, A). Histopathologic examination showed relatively uniform univacuolar and multivacuolated, granular eosinophilic cells with centrally placed nucleoli (Figure, B and C).

His mental state had deteriorated progressively over the previous 12 months, following the death of his father. After a period living alone, he had returned to the family home 4 months prior to his presentation and had been noted to be socially withdrawn, preoccupied, and distractible. His family physician, suspecting a depressive episode, had prescribed citalopram up to a dosage of 40 mg once daily, to no effect. His family subsequently sought advice from the family physician when the patient was noted to be speaking to himself, expressing concerns about people meaning him harm, and professing the belief that he could hear other peoples’ thoughts. The patient had been born in Sierra Leone after a complicated delivery and had traveled to the United Kingdom as a child with his family, who were fleeing from a civil war. On arrival in the United Kingdom, his family claimed asylum and moved into a small apartment in a high-rise building in central London. Although there was no reported developmental delay, he had struggled academically at school and was bullied for having overweight. He left school without qualifications at age 16 years and worked as a shop assistant. He left this job about a year prior to his referral to psychiatry after a period of sick leave following the death of his father. He was a nonsmoker, did not drink alcohol, and denied illicit drug use. A paternal relative was reported to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia. There was no comorbid physical illness. On review, the patient was kempt and had overweight. Eye contact was fleeting, and he presented as anxious, with a degree of psychomotor agitation. His speech was normal in rate, volume, and tone, although tangential. There was no other evidence of thought disorder. He denied feeling low in mood or suicidal and was objectively euthymic. There was some sleep disturbance, with the patient reporting being fearful to go to sleep owing to persecutory beliefs regarding his neighbors. He reflected that over the preceding few months, he had experienced a sensation of detachment from his immediate environment, as though it was not real, making his world similar to that of a video game. He reported that in the apartment where he had previously been living, he had realized that something was amiss and had become convinced that the door number of his neighbor’s flat, number 6, signified that they meant him harm. He explained this was because 6 was associated with the number of the devil. He reported hearing his neighbors commenting negatively about his appearance. These distressing experiences prompted him to return to his family home, but he continued to hear his neighbors’ voices making derogatory comments about his appearance and began to hear them commenting on his actions and thoughts in the third person as well. On returning home, his paranoia regarding his previous neighbors worsened, resulting in him rarely leaving the house. The volume and frequency of derogatory auditory hallucinations also worsened, and he reported hearing the thoughts of others as well. There was a degree of insight, and although the patient was convinced of the reality of his experiences, he also saw the stress of losing his father as associated with his experiences and was accepting of input from mental health services.\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Schizophrenia", "predict": "1.

The lesions started to appear on the left pretibial region as small papules, which gradually increased in size and coalesced to form bigger plaques. No history of local trauma, prolonged standing, and occupational exposure to mineral dust or recent drug intake was recollected. She was not diabetic. On examination, large, ill-defined, erythematous plaques were present on the pretibial areas extending onto the lateral aspect of both legs. The plaques were surmounted by multiple, discrete atrophic scars. The periphery of the plaques showed increased vascularity in the form of telangiectasias and venous prominences, along with atrophy of the overlying skin (Figure, A). There were no lesions elsewhere on the body. A skin biopsy sample was obtained from the plaque and sent for histopathological examination (Figure, B and C).\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cutaneous sarcoidosis", "predict": "1.

He had emmetropia, and his ocular and medical history were unremarkable. Over the preceding few days, he noticed worsening blurry vision with redness in both eyes associated with headaches, nausea, and severe tinnitus. On presentation, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/200 OD and 20/400 OS. Intraocular pressure was 45 mm Hg OU. Pupils were 4 mm and minimally reactive. There was 1+ conjunctival injection, diffuse corneal edema with Descemet folds, and the anterior chamber was shallow in both eyes. After the administration of multiple rounds of topical and oral medications, his intraocular pressure improved to 18 mm Hg OD and 19 mm Hg OS. A dilated fundus examination revealed tilted discs, serous retinal detachments, and multiple yellow, depigmented chorioretinal spots throughout the posterior pole in both eyes. B-scan ultrasonography showed shallow retinal detachments, choroidal thickening, and extensive, shallow choroidal detachments extending anteriorly in both eyes (Figure 1A). A-scan ultrasonography showed normal axial length of 22 mm OU. Optical coherence tomography indicated subretinal fluid and enhanced depth imaging demonstrated significant choroidal thickening in both eyes (Figure 1B).

His medical history was negative for any skin cancers. After 2 months of treatment, the patient presented with diffuse hyperpigmented macules. This was thought to be related to his chronic atopic dermatitis and he was prescribed topical steroids and moisturizing. Four months later the patient presented with diffuse macular cutaneous eruption and pruritus. A skin punch biopsy of the back revealed mild epidermal acanthosis, focal parakeratosis, and interface dermatitis with numerous dyskeratotic cells and underlying lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate with scattered dermal melanophages. Oral steroids were prescribed and 3 weeks later the rash had resolved; however, the patient developed numerous hypopigmented macules and patches, covering more than 30% of his body surface area (Figure, A) compared with the prior skin examination (Figure, B).
