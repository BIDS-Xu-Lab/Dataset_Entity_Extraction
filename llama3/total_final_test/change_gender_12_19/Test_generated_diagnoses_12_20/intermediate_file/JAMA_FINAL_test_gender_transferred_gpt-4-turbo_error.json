She reported a 5-week history of a skin lesion on the right anterior thigh with intermittent itching and mild tenderness to palpation. There was no preceding trauma to the area. The lesion was stable in size. She denied systemic symptoms of fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, and dyspnea on exertion. She was unhoused and sleeping on the streets with her dog prior to hospitalization. Physical examination was remarkable for a 5-cm erythematous plaque studded with papules and pustules (Figure 1A). No pus or granules could be expressed with pressure. The patient had no similar skin lesions elsewhere on the body. A 6-mm punch biopsy was obtained from the lesion. One half was sent for routine histopathology with special stains, and the other half was submitted for bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial culture (Figure 1B).\n### OUTPUT:\n    ",

One day later, his mental status improved, and he reported central blurry vision in his right eye. On examination, his visual acuity was 20/40 in this eye, he had normal intraocular pressure, and there was no evidence of anterior chamber or vitreous cells. Dilated fundus examination revealed segmental areas of venous sheathing (Figure 1A) in the right eye and was not possible in the left eye owing to phthisis. An optical coherence tomography scan of the right eye revealed hyperreflective changes along the outer plexiform and outer nuclear layers, small intraretinal cysts, and disruption of the ellipsoid and especially the interdigitation zone (Figure 1B).\n### OUTPUT:\n    ",

His symptoms began after relocation to California and occurred more frequently at his home. However, he could not discern any environmental or dietary triggers. He reported pruritus and swelling, which were usually moderate but occasionally severe, prompting several emergency department visits. During an emergency department visit, he was diagnosed with acute parotitis based on clinical and radiographic findings of diffuse gland edema, without salivary stones or masses. His symptoms responded to oral prednisone bursts and diphenhydramine, but not to second-generation antihistamines or montelukast. His workup included immune serology and total immunoglobulin (Ig) E measurements, all of which were within normal limits. A differential blood cell count revealed 10% eosinophils (normal, <6%) and an absolute eosinophil count 500/µL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). Titers for antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, anti-Ro (SS-A), and anti-La (SS-B) were negative. Sialendoscopy of his right parotid and left submandibular glands found no obstructing stones or strictures. Concurrent steroid irrigation did not provide any substantial benefit. An open biopsy of the right parotid tail revealed nonspecific inflammatory changes and otherwise normal parenchyma. Given the frequency and severity of his symptoms along with multiple treatment failures, he opted to undergo a right superficial parotidectomy, which proceeded without complications. Further histologic examination of the surgical specimen revealed substantial periductal inflammatory infiltrate with eosinophils, as seen in the Figure.\n### OUTPUT:\n    ",

Medical history was positive for bilateral sensorineural hearing loss with cochlear origin as determined by an otolaryngologist and headache since age 35 years. He had no history of longer-term use of medications. There was no family history of hearing and vision loss in all immediate family members. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/63 OS. His pupils were round and reactive. The anterior segment was unremarkable. Fundus examination confirmed the presence of bilateral macular atrophy. Fundus autofluorescence revealed a fairly symmetric loss of autofluorescence in the macula and in the regions surrounding the optic disc (Figure). In proximity of these areas of reduced autofluorescence, a speckled fundus autofluorescence pattern of alternating spots of increased and decreased autofluorescence was also noted. Optical coherence tomography displayed the presence of a bilateral atrophy of the outer retina and retinal pigment epithelium (Figure). The patient’s family underwent a complete ophthalmologic evaluation, which did not display any alteration.\n### OUTPUT:\n    ",

Her medical history was notable for HIV, with a last known CD4 lymphocyte count of 112 cells/mm3 and variable adherence to antiretroviral therapy. At an outside hospital, cultures were obtained, and treatment was initiated with ofloxacin eye drops, 0.3%, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride ointment, 0.3%, and oral moxifloxacin hydrochloride, 400 mg daily. Her symptoms worsened, and she was referred 3 days later for further evaluation. On examination, visual acuity in the right eye was hand motions. The left eye examination results were unremarkable. Slitlamp examination was limited by patient discomfort but revealed purulent discharge, a markedly inflamed conjunctiva, diffuse cornea opacification and thinning, and a flat anterior chamber. Given the history of tree branch trauma, the patient was brought to the operating room. Intraoperatively, a 0.5-mm corneal perforation was identified within an area of thinning (Figure, A). Microbial cultures were repeated, and corneal glue was applied. Gram stain of the purulent discharge demonstrated numerous polymorphonuclear leukocytes only. All subsequent microbiology cultures were negative. Despite treatment with topical fortified vancomycin, 25 mg/mL, tobramycin, 13.3 mg/mL, intravenous levofloxacin, 750 mg daily, and doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily, the purulent conjunctivitis and corneal stromal necrosis did not improve (Figure, B).\n### OUTPUT:\n    ",

There was involvement of the upper respiratory tract, causing palatal perforation and stridor, necessitating a tracheostomy a year ago. In addition, there was history of wheezing and breathlessness. There was no history of preceding trauma, fever, malaise, joint pain, cough, epistaxis, hemoptysis, or hematuria. Examination revealed multiple well-defined brown erythematous scaly plaques with central scarring measuring 2 × 1 to 8 × 7 cm on the face, arm, and thighs. The patient also had saddle nose deformity, perforation of the hard palate, and necrotic plaques on the ear, causing destruction of ear cartilage (Figure, A and B). There was cervical lymphadenopathy: multiple, nontender, discrete nodes, ranging from 1.5 to 2 cm without any surface changes. The results of sensory examination and peripheral nerve examination were within normal limits. Respiratory examination and chest radiography results were normal. Hemogram showed anemia (hemoglobin, 10.1 g/dL [to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0]); the results of a kidney function test, a liver function test, a fasting blood glucose test, and routine urinalysis were within normal limits. Serologic analysis results for HIV-1/2, antinuclear antibody, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative.

Prior to presentation, she had a several-month history of slow feeding and intermittent noisy breathing. Physical examination revealed inspiratory stridor that was worse when supine. Bedside flexible endoscopy findings revealed a fleshy supraglottic mass obscuring a view of the glottis. The patient’s airway was secured in the operating room with an endotracheal tube over a 0° Hopkins rod. The mass was pedunculated on the lingual surface of the epiglottis and had areas of high vascularity and other areas of thrombosis (Figure, A). The vallecula, aryepiglottic folds, arytenoids, glottis, and subglottis were otherwise uninvolved. A biopsy was obtained, and pathology results revealed relatively high proliferation of small, irregular vessels with plump endothelial cells staining positive for glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) (Figure, B and C).\n### OUTPUT:\n    ",

The patient required spectacles for best-corrected visual acuity but otherwise had no other significant ocular complaints. He was not taking medications known to cause corneal depositions, nor was there a known family history of corneal dystrophy. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Slitlamp examination of the cornea of the right eye revealed multiple, discrete nodular opacities in the superior and inferior quadrants without neovascularization or surface elevation. Similar findings were seen in the left eye, but the superior lesions were notable for possessing well-circumscribed, plaquelike features located in the posterior stroma without involvement of the anterior surface (Figure, A). No crystalline changes were noted with these deposits.\n### OUTPUT:\n    ",

Previously, she had been well, with morphological remission found on a recent bone marrow biopsy. The patient had no significant dermatological history, except an allergy to cashew nuts and a prior episode (6 mo) of urticaria during a platelet transfusion that had resolved with 1 dose of oral antihistamine. The patient’s medications included ondansetron, aprepitant, prednisolone, and oxycodone (supportive care initiated with chemotherapy), and long-term posaconazole and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole treatment. Lesions were noted on day 2 of the fourth cycle of a chemotherapy regimen comprising fludarabine, cytarabine, and filgrastim (G-CSF). Initially present over the distal limbs, palms, and soles, the lesions progressed to the proximal limbs and lower trunk during 24 hours (Figure, A and B). The patient developed a fever, which we extensively investigated. Intravenous cefotaxime was commenced, but because no infectious source was identified, the fever was thought to be secondary to cytarabine.\n### OUTPUT:\n    ",

His history also included chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and a 14-pack-year smoking history. He initially presented 3 months prior with upper respiratory symptoms, which continued to worsen despite oral antibiotic therapy. His cough became productive with white, frothy phlegm that was accompanied by fever, wheezing, hoarseness, and fatigue. His dyspnea worsened in the supine position. Flexible laryngotracheoscopy results revealed diffuse, white-to-yellow pseudomembranous changes involving the glottis and supraglottis (Figure, A), posterior tracheal wall, and left mainstem bronchus with skip lesions in the subglottis and distal 1 cm of the trachea (Figure, B). Glottic mobility was limited in both abduction and adduction with substantial airway obstruction. Computed tomographic findings revealed posterior tracheal wall thickening with the loss of the fat plane between the trachea and esophagus, and a moderate to severe obstruction within the distal left mainstem bronchus.

Follow-up ultrasonography at 32 weeks’ gestation identified fetal hydrops. The fetal ultrasonogram showed a large left-sided hydrothorax, mediastinal shift, and ascites. After ruling out infectious causes, an ultrasonography-guided thoracoamniotic shunt was placed successfully at 32 weeks’ gestation. Results of follow-up ultrasonography on postoperative day 3 showed improvement in the fetal hydrothorax and resolution of hydrops and identified a feeding vessel originating from the descending aorta supplying a lung mass (Figure 1A).\n### OUTPUT:\n    ",

He had 3 previous children (2 live births and 1 spontaneous abortion); his last child was born more than 5 years ago. His chest pain began spontaneously 1 hour prior to presentation and was described as retrosternal with radiation to his upper and middle back. On physical examination, his blood pressure was 128/88 mm Hg, his pulse was regular at 96 beats per minute, his respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute, and his temperature was 36.9° C. Pulse oximetry was 100% in room air. The chest was nontender. Pertinent physical findings included normal central venous pressures, clear lung fields, normal first and second heart sounds, an audible fourth heart sound, and no murmurs. The electrocardiogram (Figure 1A) demonstrated anterior ST-segment elevations consistent with an anterior acute current of injury. Results from the chest radiography were normal. Initial troponin I concentration was 0.02 ng/mL but rose to 177.76 ng/mL over the ensuing 4 hours (the patient’s chest pain had resolved by this time). Urgent coronary angiography was performed (Figure 1B). Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow grade 2 was observed in the left anterior descending artery and second diagonal branch.\n### OUTPUT:\n    ",

Physical examination revealed a single erythematous scaling plaque involving the left lower eyelid, including its border. Eyelashes were totally absent (Figure 1A). No other lesions were found after complete physical examination. Dermoscopy showed an erythematous background, telangiectatic vessels, whitish structureless areas, and whitish scales (Figure 1B). A 4-mm punch biopsy specimen was obtained (Figure 1C).\n### OUTPUT:\n    ",

She had difficulty rising from a seated position. Additional symptoms included progressive numbness and tingling of the hands and feet. Her family also reported progressive memory impairment during this period. An extensive review of systems was otherwise unremarkable, except for a few months of intermittent nausea, increased abdominal bloating, and anorexia. Physical examination revealed normal vital signs, normal cardiopulmonary findings, atrophy in the calf muscles bilaterally, 4 of 5 symmetric strength in the upper and lower extremity extensor muscles, and an unsteady shuffling gait. She had decreased vibration and proprioception in both lower extremities, with hyperreflexia and a positive Babinski reflex on the left side. Mental status examination revealed delayed recall of 1 of 4 words. Complete blood cell count revealed a white blood cell count of 4.7 × 103/μL; hemoglobin level, 10.9 g/dL; hematocrit, 31.8%; and platelet count, 202 × 103/μL. Mean corpuscular volume was 119 fL. Results of renal function and liver function tests were normal. Because of the asymmetric hyperreflexia and concern for a spinal cord lesion, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine was performed (Figure 1).\n### OUTPUT:\n    ",
