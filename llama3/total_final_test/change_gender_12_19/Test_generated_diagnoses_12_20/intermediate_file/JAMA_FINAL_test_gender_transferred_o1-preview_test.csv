### INPUT:
A 77-year-old female with history of hypertension and asthma presented with 3 months of progressive decline in vision in the left eye. She had no known ocular history. At presentation, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/100 OD and 20/50 OS. Intraocular pressures were normal bilaterally and pupils were equally reactive. Examination of the right eye was unremarkable except for moderate cataract. The left-eye slitlamp examination was remarkable for a shallow but quiet anterior chamber and moderate cataract. Dilated fundus examination of the left eye revealed shallow peripheral serous choroidal detachments, bullous inferior macula-involving retinal detachment with shifting fluid, and diffuse hyperpigmented lesions involving the macula and superior fundus that corresponded to areas of nodular retinal pigment epithelium thickening on optical coherence tomography (Figure 1). These hyperpigmented lesions were associated with hyperautofluorescence and blockage on fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography. No retinal breaks were seen on scleral depressed examination. Ultrasound biomicroscopy demonstrated 360° ciliochoroidal effusion. Axial length was 24.30 mm OD and 24.32 mm OS. The patient denied a history of known refractive error.

### INPUT:
A 23-year-old female patient sought evaluation at the vascular thyroid surgery clinic for a large neck tumor that appeared abruptly 10 days prior. The patient reported experiencing tightness and discomfort in the left side of the neck but denied experiencing any pain. She denied any recent incidents of neck trauma or impact. Furthermore, her medical history did not reveal any previous hematological disorders. The ultrasonography examination detected the presence of a well-defined, solid mass located in the left lobe of the thyroid gland. The mass exhibited regular shape, distinct boundaries, heterogeneous echogenicity, and observable blood flow signals. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck detected heterogeneous density mass shadows within the soft tissue region near the left lobe of the thyroid, exhibiting distinct boundaries measuring 53 × 41 × 88 mm. Subsequent enhanced CT did not reveal notable enhancement of the cystic components of the mass (Figure 1). Due to persistent symptoms, the patient expressed a desire for surgical resection. Consequently, the patient underwent open surgery to remove the mass, aiming to establish a definitive diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment.

### INPUT:
A female patient was evaluated by the dermatology inpatient consult service. She reported a 5-week history of a skin lesion on the right anterior thigh with intermittent itching and mild tenderness to palpation. There was no preceding trauma to the area. The lesion was stable in size. She denied systemic symptoms of fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, and dyspnea on exertion. She was unhoused and sleeping on the streets with her dog prior to hospitalization. Physical examination was remarkable for a 5-cm erythematous plaque studded with papules and pustules (Figure 1A). No pus or granules could be expressed with pressure. The patient had no similar skin lesions elsewhere on the body. A 6-mm punch biopsy was obtained from the lesion. One half was sent for routine histopathology with special stains, and the other half was submitted for bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial culture (Figure 1B).

### INPUT:
A 74-year-old man with a history of breast cancer, now in remission, presented for evaluation of a conjunctival lesion of the right eye. Per his history, the lesion was noted over 18 years in the past by his optometrist. He reported no noticeable growth or changes to the lesion but was sent for evaluation with ocular oncology. Visual acuity with correction was 20/40 in the right eye and 20/30 in the left eye. Intraocular pressure was 14 mm Hg in the right eye and 16 mm Hg in the left eye. Anterior segment examination results were within normal limits for the left eye, and dilated fundus examination results for both eyes did not reveal concerning pathology. The conjunctiva of the right eye was notable for a small elevated pigmented lesion measuring approximately 2 × 2 mm with sentinel vessels (Figure 1A). Fundus photographs and autofluorescence (Figure 1B) as well as optical coherence tomography (OCT) were normal bilaterally. An anterior-segment OCT was performed and revealed a small elevated subepithelial lesion with shadowing vs possible scleral extension (Figure 1B).

### INPUT:
A 52-year-old man presented with decreased vision in both eyes. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 3 months before presentation, with a hemoglobin A1c of 13%. At that time, he was given metformin and semaglutide for glucose control. His visual acuity was 20/50 OD and 20/200 OS. Fundus examination revealed retinal hemorrhages, hard exudates, and microaneurysms bilaterally (Figure, A and B). Fluorescein angiography revealed microaneurysms with noncentral leakage in the posterior pole with absence of significant ischemia and capillary dropout. Optical coherence tomography scans from the same day showed retinal edema with intraretinal fluid accumulation in both eyes (central subfield thickness: 320 nm OD, 764 nm OS) with foveal detachment in the left eye. He was diagnosed with severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy with macular edema in both eyes. He received 2 and 3 injections of bevacizumab in the right and left eyes, respectively, followed by 2 injections of aflibercept in both eyes with minimal effect on the edema. Blood analysis showed the following values: hemoglobin, 10.4 g/dL; red blood cell count, 3.30 × 106/μL; white blood cell count, 10 470/μL; platelets, 197 × 103/μL; fasting blood glucose, 150 mg/dL (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0555); normal lipid profile; and creatinine, 1.2 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4). Hemoglobin A1c decreased to 6.8% at 7 months after presentation.

---

**Reranked Differential Diagnoses:**

1. **Diabetic macular edema**  
   The patient has a history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes with significant diabetic retinopathy findings (retinal hemorrhages, hard exudates, microaneurysms) and macular edema confirmed by OCT. This is the most likely diagnosis.

2. **Anemia-induced retinopathy**  
   The patient is anemic (hemoglobin 10.4 g/dL), which can cause retinal hemorrhages and exacerbate macular edema. Anemia may contribute to retinal hypoxia, worsening diabetic retinopathy.

3. **Vitreomacular traction syndrome**  
   Refractory macular edema despite anti-VEGF therapy suggests a mechanical component. OCT should be evaluated for vitreomacular traction or epiretinal membranes.

4. **Hypertensive retinopathy**  
   Although hypertension is not mentioned, it is common in diabetic patients and can cause similar retinal findings.

5. **Central retinal vein occlusion**  
   Presents with retinal hemorrhages and edema but is less likely due to absence of significant ischemia or capillary dropout on angiography.

6. **Inflammatory retinal vasculitis**  
   Could cause retinal edema and hemorrhages; however, there are no signs of systemic inflammation.

7. **Sickle cell retinopathy**  
   Causes retinal ischemia and neovascularization; less likely without a history of sickle cell disease.

8. **Age-related macular degeneration**  
   Unlikely due to patient's age and lack of drusen or neovascular changes typical of AMD.

9. **Ocular ischemic syndrome**  
   Caused by carotid artery stenosis leading to retinal ischemia; less likely without other ischemic symptoms.

10. **Radiation retinopathy**  
    Unlikely without a history of ocular or head radiation exposure.","['Hematology', 'Myeloma', 'Oncology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Macular Diseases']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,52.0,F

### INPUT:
A 31-year-old man presented for evaluation of bilateral blurry vision over the past month. He experienced fulminant hepatic failure 3 months ago and underwent a liver transplant 2 weeks later. Postoperative pathological results showed hepatolenticular degeneration. Routine prophylactic antiherpes virus therapy had been applied for 2 weeks. Immunosuppressants, including tacrolimus and mycophenolate sodium, were applied for subsequent maintenance therapy. He noticed the onset of decreased vision in both eyes about 2 months after the liver transplant. Diagnosed with ocular herpes virus infection, he was given systemic valaciclovir and ocular laser retinopexy around areas of necrosis. His vision was not improved and twice intravitreous injection of ganciclovir was added. However, vision was decreasing continuously. At his presentation to our clinic, the best-corrected visual acuity was finger count in the right eye and 20/125 in the left eye. On slitlamp examination of both eyes, 1+ aqueous cells and 1+ flare were presented in the anterior chamber, while the dilated fundus examination showed mild inflammation in the vitreous. Extensive patches of yellowish necrotic lesions were seen at the peripheral retina of the right eye and 1 triangular necrotic lesion in the posterior pole (Figure 1A). A large annular necrosis was found in the peripheral retina of the left eye (Figure 1B).

### INPUT:
A 69-year-old woman presented to the rheumatology clinic 3 weeks after being hospitalized for fever, fatigue, rash, right periorbital swelling, and shortness of breath. This was her fifth inpatient stay in the past 3 years for similar symptoms. During a recent hospitalization, she had purpuric macules and plaques on her lower extremities bilaterally (Figure, left panel). Laboratory testing revealed a white blood cell count of 2.9 × 103/μL (reference, 4.2-10.8 ×103/μL); mean corpuscular volume, 96.1 fL (reference, 80-96 fL); hemoglobin level, 12.4 mg/dL (reference, 14.0-18.0 mg/dL); and a normal platelet count. C-reactive protein level was 270 mg/L (reference, 0-5 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 98 mm/h (reference, 0-20 mm/h). Results of testing for antinuclear antibody and antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies were negative. Computed tomography of the chest revealed numerous small, bilateral pulmonary nodules (Figure, right panel). Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed bilateral inferior rectus muscle enlargement with mild inflammatory changes along the extraocular muscles and optic nerves. A skin biopsy showed a perivascular neutrophilic infiltrate consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis. During her most recent hospitalization, she was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone (40 mg twice daily) for 5 days and discharged taking oral prednisone (40 mg daily) for 4 weeks. Previously, she had pericardial and pleural effusions and pulmonary infiltrates. Pericardial biopsy showed organizing pericarditis and lung biopsy revealed cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, with negative IgG4 stains. Results of bone marrow biopsy, including flow cytometry and cytogenetic testing, performed 18 months prior to the current presentation were normal.

### INPUT:
A 62-year-old female was referred for evaluation of a painless right lower-eyelid lesion noted during routine glaucoma follow-up. The lesion had been present for 3 years with slow, gradual enlargement. The patient denied any associated symptoms. She was a former smoker and had no history of skin cancer or immunosuppression. The remainder of her medical history was noncontributory. Inspection of the right lower eyelid revealed a cystic-appearing nodule that transilluminated and had a few overlying telangiectasias. The cystic portion was continuous with a deeper, smooth subcutaneous component that was well defined, firm, and nonmobile, with a total lesion length of 1 cm (Figure 1A). There was no madarosis, eyelid margin effacement or preauricular lymphadenopathy. Although no overt features of malignancy were present, the deeper component was atypical for a hidrocystoma and an excisional biopsy was performed. Histopathologic evaluation showed a neoplasm composed of low-grade round nuclei growing in a micropapillary pattern within pools of extracellular mucin (Figure 1B). There was tumor present at the margin. Immunostains were positive for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor. Variable staining for INSM1, a sensitive nuclear stain for neuroendocrine differentiation, and focal staining for synaptophysin, another neuroendocrine marker, were also seen. This immunophenotype is consistent with a primary tumor derived from endocrine mucin-producing sweat gland carcinoma or a metastatic mucinous carcinoma of breast origin.

### INPUT:
An 11-year-old girl presented to our department with progressive unilateral skin hardening on her right thigh and buttock for 7 years. Recently, the motion of her right limb joint was slightly limited. She was born to healthy parents and did not have any medical disease. On physical examination, there was an ill-defined, stony-hard plaque involving her right thigh above the patella extending to her right buttocks with loss of skin elasticity. The affected skin was associated with mild hypertrichosis and hyperpigmentation (Figure 1A). Laboratory tests revealed normal results for routine blood tests, autoantibodies, immunoglobulins, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Magnetic resonance imaging of the right thigh demonstrated slight thickening of subcutaneous tissue and T2 signal abnormality (Figure 1B). A skin biopsy was taken from the affected thigh for histopathological examination and alcian blue staining.

### INPUT:
A 62-year-old man presented with painless vision reduction and eye redness in the right eye for a week. The initial best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 4/20 (approximately 20/100), and an irregular superficial corneal ulcer with an epithelial defect size of 3 mm × 5 mm was found in the center of edematous cornea. He received penetrating keratoplasty 4 months later, as the ulcer did not heal with intensive medication. Then, topical tobramycin dexamethasone, topical tacrolimus, and daily oral prednisone, 40 mg, were prescribed, with a gradual taper of prednisone to a maintenance dose of 10 mg. At 5-month postoperative follow-up, some thin snowflakelike matter was found deposited on the iris and in the angle, with rare cell and mild flare in the anterior chamber. He was then diagnosed with uveitis and subsequently prescribed topical prednisone, subconjunctival triamcinolone acetonide, oral prednisone, 40 mg, and daily intravenous ganciclovir, 5 mg/kg. An aqueous sample was obtained for diagnostic polymerase chain reaction, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was detected with a DNA load of 3.12 × 107 cells. Nine months after the keratoplasty, when he presented to the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, his BCVA was 2/100 OD (approximately 20/1000 OD), and his intraocular pressure was 19 mm Hg. Diffuse tiny nodules were observed all over the iris, along with more snowflake and severe cataract (Figure 1A). The fundus could not be seen. B-ultrasonography showed a dense opacity in the anterior vitreous body (Figure 1B).

### INPUT:
A full-term boy was born with multiple areas of erythema, vesicles, and bullae on the face, trunk, and extremities. His vital signs, including temperature, respiration, and heart rate, were within normal ranges. One month later, he returned due to skin eruptions that continued to wax and wane. Physical examination revealed multiple round or irregularly shaped erythematous macules and slightly scaly plaques of various sizes on the face, trunk, and extremities. Bullous and vesicular lesions were observed on the thighs, with scattered facial erosions. Mucous membranes were not found to be affected. He was born to healthy, nonconsanguineous parents. Growth and development were normal for his age and sex. The patient’s family medical history was unremarkable. A skin-punch biopsy and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) assays taken from 1 of the erythematous scaly plaques were performed for further analysis. At the 3-year follow-up, it was found that the vesicles and bullae began to decrease in number when he was 6 months old but intermittently returned after 1 year of age. The number of annular hyperkeratotic plaques had increased (Figure 1A). Thickened, brown, corrugated plaques developed over the neck, armpits, wrists, and ankles, along with palmoplantar hyperkeratosis.

### INPUT:
A 65-year-old woman presented to an outpatient department with a 2-year history of left nasal obstruction. She had a history of hypertension and was taking oral medication (amlodipine [5 mg]/valsartan [80 mg] and indapamide [1.5 mg] once daily) but had poorly controlled systolic blood pressure ranging from 130 to 160 mm Hg. No associated trauma or surgical history was reported. Physical examination revealed a large tumor originating from the olfactory groove in the left nasal cavity, with feeding vessels pushing the middle turbinate outward. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a well-defined and strongly enhancing mass in the left nasal cavity, with obstructive rhinosinusitis in the frontal and ethmoid sinuses (Figure 1A). During surgical exploration, the tumor abutted the superior end of the nasal septum near the cribriform plate. Tumor excision was completed with a surgical margin of at least 5 mm, with the perichondrium of the nasal septum as the deep margin. The feeding vessels of the tumors were cauterized during the resection. Gross examination revealed a 4.8 × 3.0 × 1.8-cm whitish to pink-tan mass lesion (Figure 1B). Histopathological examination revealed sheetlike proliferation of monomorphic ovoid to spindle tumor cells containing ectatic vascular spaces. In addition, immunohistochemical staining showed positive staining for smooth-muscle actin, cyclin D1, and nuclear expression of β-catenin and negative staining for epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin, and CD34.

### INPUT:
A patient in her mid-60s with a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis underwent bilateral orthotopic lung transplant (BOLT) 6 months earlier. She was hospitalized for sepsis from pneumonia complicated by acute transplant rejection, without any cardiac symptoms. Coronary angiography prior to BOLT showed no evidence of coronary artery disease. Her only cardiac history was tricuspid valve repair at the time of BOLT. Her baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) is shown in Figure 1A. She progressed to having severe acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring intubation. As she continued to worsen, the decision was made to paralyze her a few hours later. Changes on telemetry were noted. Shortly thereafter, 12-lead ECG showed the changes in Figure 1B.

### INPUT:
A 31-year-old man was evaluated for generalized dystonia, dysarthria, dysphagia, severe scoliosis, and motor development disorder that began in his childhood. Born by cesarean delivery to nonconsanguineous parents, he developed difficulties with head control, standing, and feeding at age 10 months. Subsequently, he faced progressive motor challenges (walking, speech, and swallow); contractures in his fingers, toes, wrists, and knees; and scoliosis. In adolescence, he experienced progressive stiffness, episodes of painful spasms and oculomotor crisis, and galactorrhea unrelated to childbirth in adulthood. His symptoms worsened with age and progressed to his using a wheelchair, having difficulty in speech, and not having access to education. He had a younger brother with similar symptoms who passed away at age 20 years of unknown causes. Upon presentation at age 31 years, he was admitted to our center for further evaluation. He had thin limbs and was of standard height. The neurological and psychological examinations revealed scoliosis, contractures in his fingers and toes, carpal inversion, dysarthria, dysphagia, hypertonia, decreased tendon reflexes, absence of Babinski sign (Figure, A and B), and no psychiatric problems. Blood test results indicated hyperprolactinemia (prolactin level of 47.40 ng/mL; to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1). An electroencephalogram revealed atypical spike-slow wave synchronization in specific brain regions during sleep. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed significant global atrophy particularly in his anterior temporal, lateral, and frontal regions (Figure, C). Levodopa treatment was initiated but quickly resulted in drug-induced hyperkinesia (Video).

A woman in her 50s underwent clinical assessment for a 4-month history of recurrent palpitations, fatigue, and progressive exertion dyspnea. She had no history of cardiac disease, and there was no family history of heart disease or sudden death. Physical examination revealed an irregular pulse and a systolic murmur at the heart apex. Holter monitoring and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings documented irregular narrow-QRS tachycardia in an incessant, repetitive fashion with heart rates up to 180 beats per minute and occasional short runs of wide-QRS tachycardia. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a dilated and diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle (ejection fraction, 30%) associated with moderate to severe functional mitral regurgitation. Blood test results were within normal limits, including thyroid function, C-reactive protein, and myocardial enzymes. The patient was hospitalized, and medical therapy was initiated, including ACE inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, β-blockers, and diuretics. Coronary angiography revealed no significant coronary stenoses. A representative 12-lead ECG of the arrhythmia is shown in Figure 1.

### INPUT:
A 50-year-old woman with end-stage kidney disease receiving hemodialysis was admitted to the hospital for treatment of calciphylaxis and foot cellulitis. Her home medications included sevelamer and hydrocodone-acetaminophen (10 mg/325 mg) every 8 hours as needed, which was increased to every 4 hours as needed in the hospital. Hydromorphone (0.5 mg intravenously as needed) was added for breakthrough pain. She was prescribed chewable lanthanum tablets (500 mg 3 times daily) for treatment of a blood phosphate level of 8.1 mg/dL (reference, 2.5-4.5 mg/dL). On hospital day 7, the patient developed intermittent apneic episodes, during which her oxygen saturation was 80% on room air; heart rate, 86/min; and blood pressure, 106/45 mm Hg. Physical examination revealed bilateral rhonchi and responsiveness to verbal commands only with deep painful stimulus. A chest radiograph showed 4 radio-opaque coin-shaped opacities in the stomach (Figure). After administration of oxygen at 2 L/min by nasal cannula and a naloxone infusion, her oxygen saturation increased to 98% and her mental status improved. The patient reported no foreign body ingestion.

### INPUT:
A 68-year-old woman presented with progressive right-sided facial numbness and weakness, vision changes, and headaches. Her symptoms began 5 years earlier with right temple numbness, which expanded to include the entire right face and mouth. She then developed progressive right facial weakness with a droop, slurred speech, and eyelid ptosis. Finally, binocular vertical and horizontal diplopia and periorbital headaches began. Trials of gabapentin and steroids provided no relief. Her history was significant for a left cheek melanoma completely excised years prior, numerous cutaneous squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the bilateral head and neck removed without issue, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Her medications included metformin and simvastatin; she had no history of smoking or drinking. On examination, she had right-sided ptosis and severe right facial weakness in a lower motor neuron pattern with temporal wasting. The right pupil was fixed and dilated. There was no afferent pupillary defect. The left pupil was appropriately sized and reactive. Her right-sided vision was impaired (20/250) with blurriness. Vertical and horizontal binocular diplopia was present. Right extraocular movements were significantly limited in all directions and painful, and right-sided facial sensation was diminished to pinprick in all cranial nerve (CN) V distributions. Her speech was slightly slurred. Left-sided extraocular movements were intact. Her left facial sensation was intact to pinprick, and her strength was without deficit. There were no other neurological abnormalities. Initial magnetic resonance images (MRIs) were unremarkable. A biopsy of CN VII was nondiagnostic. Hemoglobin A1c was 6.8%. Tests for infection and autoimmune disease had negative results. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies showed mildly elevated protein values. Figure 1 shows the MRI at presentation.

### INPUT:
A 31-year-old woman presented with left cervical and left inguinal masses. She reported intermittent itching and night sweats for 2 years. She denied fever, weight loss, shortness of breath, rashes, diarrhea, and neurological symptoms. On a preemployment evaluation, the patient was told she had a high white blood cell count 2 years ago. On examination, there was left cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy and no other organomegaly. Complete blood cell count and peripheral blood smear showed marked leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 22 340/μL, an absolute neutrophil count of 5360/μL, and 55% eosinophils with an absolute eosinophil count of 12 290/μL (to convert all to cells ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). Vitamin B12 was markedly elevated at more than 4000 pg/mL (to convert to pmol/L, multiply by 0.7378). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 5 mm/h. Lactate dehydrogenase was 180 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase was 81 U/L (to convert both to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167). Evaluations for HIV and hepatitis B and C were all negative. Serum creatinine was 0.76 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4); alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were 11 U/L and 9.9 U/L, respectively (to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167); and total bilirubin was 0.35 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 17.104). Bone marrow biopsy showed hypercellular marrow (cellularity of 100%), myeloid hyperplasia, increased eosinophils with some dysplasia, and a blast count of 2%. Positron emission tomographic–computed tomographic scan showed a left upper cervical lymph node of 2.6 cm and a left inguinal lymph node of 3.1 × 2.3 cm with an standardized uptake value max of 5.7 (Figure, A). Left inguinal lymph node biopsy showed partial involvement by atypical cells with high proliferation index (Ki-67 >95%) that were positive for CD3, CD4, CD8, BCL2, and TDT, suggestive of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (Figure, B).

### INPUT:
An 80-year-old woman with stage II bladder carcinoma (T2NXM0) and atrial fibrillation treated with apixaban presented to the emergency department with 1 week of fatigue and 2 days of dyspnea on exertion. One week prior to presentation, she received a fourth cycle of carboplatin/gemcitabine for bladder carcinoma with 6 mg of pegylated granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). The patient reported no anorexia, fever, melena, hematemesis, hematuria, cough, orthopnea, or peripheral edema. Her vital signs were normal except for a heart rate of 103/min. Her white blood cell count was 22 × 103/μL (reference, 4-11 × 103/μL), increased from 4.8 × 103/μL 8 days prior. Her manual differential, which was previously normal, showed 18% bands (0%-10%), 2% metamyelocytes, 7% myelocytes, 7% promyelocytes, and 6% blasts. Her hemoglobin level was 5.2 g/dL (reference, 13-17 g/dL), decreased from 7.4 g/dL, and platelets were 25 × 103/μL (reference, 150-420 × 103/μL), decreased from 268 × 103/μL 8 days prior. Ferritin was 1423 ng/mL (reference, 300-400 ng/mL). Mean corpuscular volume, prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, haptoglobin, vitamin B12, and methylmalonic acid values were normal, and results of a direct antiglobulin test were negative. A computed tomography (CT) scan of her abdomen and pelvis was normal. She received 2 units of packed red blood cells and was admitted to the hospital. Flow cytometry identified a small population of CD34+/CD117+ cells (Figure).

### INPUT:
An 81-year-old White man noted decreased vision in his left eye for 6 months. He was referred to the Ocular Oncology Service, Wills Eye Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for suspected choroidal melanoma. He disclosed a history of macular degeneration in both eyes and retinal detachment in the left eye that was treated 35 years previously. Medical history revealed cutaneous basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, both treated surgically. On examination, visual acuity was 20/50 OD and 20/400 OS. External examination showed posterior-chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes and conjunctival scarring in the left eye from circumferential scleral buckle surgery with no visible extraocular tumor. Fundus evaluation showed macular drusen in the right eye and a pale optic disc with geographic macular atrophy in the left eye, explaining his visual acuity of 20/400 OS. In addition, a shallow circumferential buckle effect and an inferotemporal mass measuring 15.0 × 10.0 mm in basal dimension and 9.1 mm in thickness (Figure, A) were seen in the left eye. The mass appeared elevated, amelanotic with overlying retinal vasculature, and with chorioretinal atrophy. No retinal detachment or breaks were seen. By ultrasonography the mass was echolucent (Figure, A inset). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a T1, T2-hypointense shallow circumferential band in the left eye. In addition, there was an inferotemporal nodular mass in the left eye showing T1 (gadolinium) hypointense, T2-hyperintense features, underlying the encircling buckle, and with adjacent subtle delineation. There was no enhancement with gadolinium (Figure, B).

A male patient in his early 50s presented with multiple (approximately 10) bluish, partially keratotic papules and nodules on the lower legs (Figure, A). Since the age of 24 years, the lesions had been growing very slowly in number and size and had been bleeding occasionally after a trauma. The patient used a wheelchair due to a right-sided hemiparesis and hemianopsia caused by an intracranial hemorrhage. At the age of 4 years, recurrent seizures had led to the diagnosis of cerebral venous malformations. Clinical examination also demonstrated a lipolymphedema of the lower legs that had been attributed to a functional venous insufficiency with insufficient venous pump activity. The patient had been wearing compression stockings for years. The family history was positive for cerebral venous malformations involving the patient’s father and uncle, the father having died of an intracranial hemorrhage in his early 70s.

### INPUT:
A 33-year-old woman with no prior ocular problems presented to the emergency department in central Florida with a chief complaint of a “pulling and popping” sensation in her left eye that had occurred the previous night. Ophthalmology was consulted to evaluate for a conjunctival foreign body of the left eye. At the time of the examination, her symptoms had resolved; however, she had a photograph from a cellular phone taken during the episode (Figure 1). The photograph shows an irregular, serpiginous extension from beneath the plica semilunaris toward the corneal limbus with localized conjunctival hyperemia. She reported a similar sensation of movement in her left eye that occurred for 1 night about 5 years ago for which she visited an urgent care center where she was diagnosed with allergic conjunctivitis. She also reported recent swelling of the left side of her face with associated numbness and occasional swelling of her left hand, all of which resolved after a few days. She had immigrated from Nigeria 10 years prior, had not returned since, and was working as a traveling nurse. A slitlamp examination did not reveal any conjunctival hyperemia, foreign bodies, or other abnormalities like those shown in the photograph. Her uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20, extraocular movements were full and without pain or abnormal sensation, and intraocular pressure was normal. Her dilated fundus examination was unremarkable. A comprehensive blood cell count revealed mild elevation in the relative (but not absolute) eosinophil count (6.9% reference; 6.0% of white blood cells).

### INPUT:
A previously healthy 16-year-old boy presented to our department with a red tumor on his right upper arm that enlarged over 6 months. The lesion initially started as a small cutaneous nodule without obvious triggers that gradually developed and enlarged to form a red-colored tumor with a hard nodule inside. There was no history of local trauma or insect bite. His personal, past, and family histories were unremarkable. On physical examination, there was a 6 × 6-cm protuberant, thick-walled, and well-defined red bullalike tumor on the right upper arm, which extended 1 to 3 cm from the epidermal surface (Figure, A). Inside the tumor, a nontender, firm-to-hard nodule was palpated. There was no regional lymphadenopathy, and results of the rest of the physical and systemic examinations were normal. Laboratory examinations of hematologic, biochemical, and urinalysis tests were normal. The tumor was excised completely under local anesthesia, and part of the tissue was sent for pathological examination.

### INPUT:
A 15-year-old boy presented with a 2-month history of decreased vision and a dark spot in the central vision in his right eye. He had a history of optometric examinations with no known ocular disease. Visual acuity with correction was 20/40 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. Anterior segment examination of both eyes was unremarkable, and the retina in the left eye appeared normal. In the right eye, there was an area of superior macular whitening with associated intraretinal hemorrhages and exudates. Fluorescein angiography showed abnormally dilated and tortuous retinal vessels, irregular capillary branching patterns, and bulblike telangiectasis with late leakage in the superior macula. Optical coherence tomography showed disorganized and hyperreflective inner retinal thickening (Figure, A) and intraretinal and subretinal fluid in the central macula. On review of systems, the patient noted a long-standing growth on his cheek, which on examination was a 4 × 3-mm exophytic, brownish-red vascular papule (Figure, B), as well as a history of lightly pigmented patches of skin and multiple subungual fibromas on his toes. Systemic blood pressure was normal.

### INPUT:
A 56-year-old man with a history of multiple myeloma complicated by therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia was admitted for myeloablative conditioning in preparation for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant. His course was complicated by severe mucositis, acute kidney injury, and neutropenic fever. During his admission, the patient also developed painful necrotic skin lesions, a nonproductive cough, and altered mental status. Physical examination findings demonstrated dusky, purpuric, and pink papulonodules, some with overlying eschar, scattered on the scalp, neck, trunk, and extremities (Figure, A). Laboratory study results revealed a white blood cell count of 150/μL (reference range, 3500/μL to 10 500/μL), an absolute neutrophil count of 130/μL (reference range, 1500/μL to 7400/μL), and a platelet count of 19 ×103/μL (reference range, 150 ×103/μL to 400 ×103/μL). (To convert the white blood cell and neutrophil counts to cells ×109/L, multiply by 0.001; conversion of the platelet count to cells ×109/L is 1:1.) Blood culture results were negative. The results of a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage, territorial infarction, or mass effect. The results of a CT scan of the chest demonstrated multifocal bilateral ground-glass patchy opacities, scattered solid bilateral pulmonary nodules, and a moderately sized pericardial effusion. A biopsy specimen from a skin nodule on the left lateral thigh was obtained for histopathologic examination and tissue culture, and wet mount preparation of a tissue culture colony was performed (Figure, B).

A 67-year-old woman with thoracolumbar scoliosis, poor mobility, and history of frequent falls presented to the emergency department with 2 months of left shoulder pain, stiffness and reduced range of motion, and numbness and paresthesias in her left upper extremity. Ten years prior to presentation, she underwent surgical decompression for syringomyelia. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of her cervical and thoracic spine performed 2 years prior to presentation revealed a recurrent syrinx extending from C1 to T11, which was not resected because it did not cause symptoms at that time. On physical examination, she had mild tenderness to palpation and reduced range of motion of the left shoulder with abduction and flexion limited to 120° (normal range of motion, 180°). The left scapular muscles were atrophic, and pain and temperature sensation were reduced in her proximal left arm, and dorsal aspect of her left shoulder. Her complete blood cell count, serum glucose levels, C-reactive protein levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal. Results of tests for rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody were negative. Left shoulder radiograph showed complete absence of the left humeral head and a well-demarcated smooth osseous margin of the proximal humerus with associated soft tissue swelling and periarticular calcification (Figure 1). A chest radiograph taken 2 years prior revealed a normal left shoulder joint. The patient was hospitalized for further evaluation and treatment.

### INPUT:
A Chinese man in his late 20s presented with a 20-year history of progressive skin laxity. In early childhood, he had developed asymptomatic yellowish coalesced papules confined to flexural areas. Subsequently, severe skin sagging occurred on his abdomen with loss of elasticity, then spread extensively with developmental growth. The results of a physical examination showed thick and leathery skinfolds on the neck, axillae, inguinal regions, abdomen, and limbs (Figure, A), with yellowish papules scattered on the dorsal neck. The patient had no extracutaneous involvement and was born to healthy nonconsanguineous parents. However, his younger sister had developed the same skin symptoms. Coagulation-related tests indicated a low clotting activity of factor X (52.2%; reference range, 77%-131%) and a prolonged prothrombin time (12.8 seconds; reference range, 10.4-12.6 seconds). The results of other laboratory investigations were unremarkable. Echocardiographic and fundoscopic examination results were normal.

A man in his early 40s, with a history of migraines and recurrent health issues, presented with acute pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, and nausea that started several hours after a flight from Florida to New York City. He was noted to have tachycardia (110 beats/min) and hypoxemia (90% receiving room air) with a blood pressure of 106/81 mm Hg. Cardiac, respiratory, and pulse examination results were unremarkable. He denied any clear physical or emotional triggers preceding presentation. Before presentation, the patient reported good health with satisfactory employment-mandated routine physical examinations. He denied a history of smoking, alcohol, or illicit drug use. He was not taking hormonal birth control or hormone therapy. Laboratory values demonstrated a normal complete blood cell count and metabolic panel. Chest radiograph results were unremarkable. A computed tomographic chest scan excluded pulmonary embolism but suggested pulmonary and interstitial edema. Results of an electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with premature ventricular contractions, subcentimeter ST-segment elevation in leads I and aVL and 1-mm ST-segment depression in leads II, III, aVF, and V5 through V6. Initial high-sensitivity troponin was 110 000 ng/mL (to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1). Results of cardiac point-of-care ultrasonography demonstrated a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 40%, with hypokinesis of the anterolateral and posterior walls. Emergent cardiac catheterization revealed spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) of the left main coronary artery (Figure 1 and Video).

Laboratory testing revealed a high-sensitivity troponin level of 52 ng/L (reference, <34 ng/L); brain-type natriuretic peptide, 112 pmol/L (reference, <30 pmol/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 51 U/L (0.85 μkat/L) (reference, 0-35 U/L [0-0.58 μkat/L]); and alanine aminotransferase, 76 U/L (1.27 μkat/L) (reference, 0-45 U/L [0-0.75 μkat/L]). A chest radiograph showed cardiomegaly without pulmonary vascular redistribution or pulmonary edema. An electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm, left anterior fascicular block, and down-sloping anterolateral ST segments. The patient was admitted to the hospital, where electromyography results included reduced amplitude of peroneal nerve action potentials, consistent with axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy of the bilateral lower extremities. Coronary angiography showed no coronary atherosclerosis, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Results of serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and serum free light chain testing were normal. A bone scintigraphy scan using technetium Tc 99m–labeled hydroxymethylene diphosphonate demonstrated increased cardiac uptake (Figure).

A 70-year-old woman presented to the dermatology clinic for evaluation of a pruritic exanthem that began on her scalp and face and spread across most of her body over a 2-month period. The patient had no fever, night sweats, fatigue, recent unintentional weight loss, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. She reported no new prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or herbal supplements prior to the onset of the exanthem. She had no history of psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, or other skin disorder, and no recent viral or bacterial infection. On presentation, her temperature was 37.1 °C (98.7 °F); blood pressure, 128/86 mm Hg; heart rate, 110/min; and respiratory rate, 30/min. Physical examination revealed confluent salmon-colored plaques composed of folliculocentric scaly papules across her body with several patches of unaffected skin on her trunk. The patient had waxy, exfoliative scale on the volar aspect of her hands and feet and thickened, onycholytic nails. Severe ectropion prevented complete eyelid closure (Figure). She was referred to the emergency department, where laboratory testing revealed a normal complete blood cell count and normal lactate dehydrogenase level. The patient was admitted to the hospital and was treated with intravenous fluids and daily wet-wrap therapy with topical triamcinolone ointment (0.1%) applied to her trunk, arms, and legs, followed by a layer of warm, damp gauze and dry, cotton pajamas.

A 46-year-old woman presented for an evaluation of a lesion on the dorsal tongue. The patient was asymptomatic and unaware of the lesion prior to it being discovered by her dentist. She underwent incisional biopsy at another institution and presented for a second opinion on the diagnosis. Overall, she was in good health with no underlying systemic diseases. Results of the most recent serologic analysis and urinalysis were also reportedly within normal limits. The extraoral examination was unremarkable, with no skin lesions, asymmetry, redness, swelling, or lymphadenopathy observed. The intraoral examination revealed an erythematous denuded area of the midline posterior dorsal tongue, with a central nodular component (Figure 1A). The nodule was firm to palpation and nontender. The remaining oral soft tissue was unremarkable. Because a biopsy specimen was already obtained, blank slides were requested from the aforementioned institution, and staining was performed in house.

### INPUT:
A woman in her late 60s was referred to the dermatologic clinic with a 10-day history of fever up to 38.5 °C and tender lesions on the neck and trunk. In the previous month, she had received the first cycle of a chemotherapeutic regimen of ixazomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone to treat a recurrence of IgG-κ multiple myeloma with a 10-year history. Physical examination showed annular erythematous plaques of up to 2 cm in diameter, with violaceous and crusted centers on the neck and trunk. On the right chest, an annular erythematous lesion with 2 zones of color—a central area of purpura and an outer erythematous and edematous ring—was present (Figure, A). Laboratory investigations found pancytopenia: a white blood cell count of 2.3 × 103/μL (reference range, 3.5-9.8 × 103/μL), hemoglobin levels of 12.1 g/dL (reference range, 13.5-17.6 g/dL), platelet count of 29 × 103/μL (reference range, 130-400 × 103μL), and elevated serum C-reactive protein levels of 3.31 mg/dL (reference range, <0.30 mg/dL). Blood culture results were negative. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor analogs had not been prescribed to the patient. Skin biopsy from a lesion on the left chest was performed for histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses (Figure, B-D).

### INPUT:
A 63-year-old woman with no ocular history and a history of stage 3 cutaneous melanoma of the scalp and chronic lymphocytic leukemia was referred for kaleidoscope vision. She received nivolumab (anti–programmed cell death 1 checkpoint inhibitor) 9 months prior, obinutuzumab (B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibitor) 3 months later, and 5-mg oral prednisone daily. On presentation, nivolumab and obinutuzumab treatment was complete. Her visual acuity was 20/125 OD and 20/50 OS. Ophthalmoscopy revealed bilateral panuveitis with diffuse pigmentary abnormalities. Fluorescein angiography showed diffuse retinal pigment epithelium loss and late staining of the retinal lesions. She received 60 mg of oral prednisone daily for 2 weeks with a planned 10-week taper. However, prednisone was discontinued due to positive Lyme disease exposure 6 weeks later. At this time, the active anterior and vitreous cells had resolved. However, 2 weeks later, visual acuity decreased to count fingers in her right eye and hand motions in the left eye. The anterior and vitreous chambers had grade +0.5 pigmented cells. The ophthalmoscopic examination showed a leopard-spot pattern (Figure 1), and optical coherence tomography showed substantial retinal pigment epithelium and outer retinal layer loss. Repeat testing for Treponema pallidum, Lyme disease, and HIV was negative. Results of magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbit were negative for leukemic infiltration.

Final diagnosis: Iris retraction syndrome.
Case report: A 53-year-old man presenting with a unilateral mild cortical and nuclear cataract associated with 20/32 visual acuity in his left eye was planning to undergo phacoemulsification. A few days before surgery, he noticed a sudden decrease in his left visual acuity measured at 20/80. His eye specialist then observed a reverse pupillary block in his left eye and referred the patient to our department. At presentation, no other remarkable medical history was recorded and no precipitating factors identified. Slitlamp examination showed a unilateral deepening of the anterior chamber associated with signs of anterior uveitis (ie, keratic precipitates and severe aqueous flare, 3+) and posterior synechiae between the iris and the lens. In addition, fundus examination revealed an inferior retinal detachment without any associated visible tear. Intraocular pressure was 15 mm Hg in the right eye and 9 mm Hg in the left eye. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography images and fundus photographs of both eyes are shown in Figure 1.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 80s presented to the emergency department with a 4-week history of progressive weakness and fatigue, with associated development of purple bruiselike lesions on her head. She denied any history of trauma, falls, or occlusive headgear use. Her medical history was significant for atrial fibrillation, receiving anticoagulation medication, and heart failure. On physical examination, numerous nontender violaceous plaques were seen on the forehead and scalp of the patient (Figure, A). On full skin examination, nonspecific skin-colored plaques were noted on the chest, and a 1.8 × 2.5-cm erythematous plaque was noted on the left lower back. There was no appreciable lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Peripheral blood test results revealed a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, a platelet count of 68 × 103/μL, a white blood cell count of 2800/μL, and an absolute neutrophil count of 1.0/μL. Lactate dehydrogenase level was 202 U/L. (To convert hemoglobin to g/L, multiply by 10.0; platelets to ×109/L, by 1; white blood cell and neutrophil counts to ×109/L, by 0.001; and lactate dehydrogenase to μkat/L, by 0.0167.)

### INPUT:
A 47-year-old man was seen with left-sided facial weakness and swelling for 2 months. He was diagnosed as having recurrent high-grade serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary and developed these symptoms after cycle 4 of chemotherapy. He was receiving oral antidiabetic agents, and his blood glucose level was 110 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555). Physical examination findings were consistent with left lower-motor-neuron type of facial nerve palsy. He was conscious and well oriented, with no other relevant clinical signs or focal neurological deficits. There was no history of prior COVID-19 infection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was requested, with clinical suspicion of metastasis in view of mildly elevated CA125 levels. The results of MRI of the brain did not reveal any neuroparenchymal or meningeal lesions. However, both maxillary sinuses showed mucosal thickening, which was intermediate to hypointense on T2-weighted imaging and hypointense on T1-weighted imaging with postcontrast enhancement. Computed tomography sections confirmed bony destruction with foci of remodeling involving the walls of the maxillary sinuses (Figure 1).

Her temperature was 37.9 °C (100.2 °F); heart rate, 74/min; and blood pressure, 90/49 mm Hg. She had tenderness to palpation and decreased range of motion of her right shoulder. Laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 9.6 ×  109/L (reference, 4.0-9.0 × 109/L); C-reactive protein level, 35.6 mg/dL (reference, <0.3 mg/dL), and creatine kinase level, 1036 U/L (17.30 μkat/L) (reference, 60-270 U/L [1.00-4.51 μkat/L]). Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an effusion and synovial thickening with enhancement in the right shoulder joint and inflammation in the right subscapularis muscle. Gram stain of the synovial fluid revealed gram-positive cocci in clusters. Intravenous cefazolin therapy was initiated, and she underwent right shoulder joint arthroscopic irrigation, synovectomy, and surgical drainage for subscapularis pyomyositis. Blood and synovial fluid cultures grew methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and intravenous cefazolin was continued. One week after hospitalization, the patient developed asymptomatic black discoloration of the dorsal surface of her tongue (Figure). She reported no prior lingual discoloration and did not smoke cigarettes, use chewing tobacco or illicit drugs, or drink alcohol.

A 72-year-old man was referred for an eye examination because of visual changes in the left eye. His medical history was notable for end-stage kidney disease requiring a kidney transplant at age 50 years and a second transplant at age 65 years. He had received his medical care at outside facilities, the records of which were not available. He could not recall being given any precise diagnosis but reported having proteinuria since age 7 years. His other medical conditions included hyperlipidemia, arterial hypertension, and pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex infection. He was taking tacrolimus, amlodipine, atorvastatin, ethambutol, rifampin, and clarithromycin. His family history was unremarkable. He had 2 healthy adult children. One year after the first kidney transplant, he noted an inferior visual field defect in the left eye and was diagnosed with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Several years later, he underwent uncomplicated bilateral cataract procedures. Visual acuity with distance correction was 20/25 OD and 20/30 OS. Color vision was 14/14 plates for each eye. There was a left relative afferent pupillary defect. Confrontation visual field was full for the right eye and demonstrated an inferior defect for the left eye. External and slitlamp examinations were notable only for bilateral pseudophakia. Both optic discs were anomalous in appearance, with central excavation in the left eye greater than the right eye (Figure). The remainder of the posterior pole examination, including the retinal vessels, appeared normal in both eyes.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Nonarteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION)**
   - The patient has a prior history of NAION in the left eye and presents with similar symptoms, including an inferior visual field defect and a relative afferent pupillary defect. Vascular risk factors like hypertension and hyperlipidemia increase the likelihood of recurrent NAION.

2. **Glaucoma**
   - The optic disc excavation and visual field defects are consistent with glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Although intraocular pressure readings are not provided, normal-tension glaucoma cannot be ruled out.

3. **Optic Nerve Drusen**
   - Anomalous optic discs with excavation suggest optic nerve drusen, which can cause visual field defects and mimic other optic neuropathies.

4. **Optic Disc Pit**
   - The central excavation of the optic disc is characteristic of an optic disc pit, which can lead to visual field defects due to nerve fiber layer abnormalities.

5. **Compressive Optic Neuropathy**
   - A mass lesion compressing the optic nerve could explain unilateral optic nerve dysfunction and visual field loss, warranting neuroimaging for evaluation.

6. **Ethambutol-Induced Optic Neuropathy**
   - While ethambutol toxicity typically presents bilaterally and affects color vision (which is normal here), the possibility remains, especially with prolonged use.

7. **Optic Nerve Coloboma**
   - A congenital defect that can cause optic disc anomalies and visual field defects, though less likely without prior symptoms.

8. **Optic Neuritis**
   - Inflammation of the optic nerve usually presents with pain and affects younger individuals; however, atypical presentations can occur.

9. **Fabry Disease**
   - Early-onset proteinuria suggests a systemic condition like Fabry disease. Ocular manifestations include corneal and lenticular changes, but optic nerve involvement is rare.

10. **Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy**
    - Typically affects younger males with bilateral, painless vision loss and a strong family history, making it less likely in this case.","['Chronic Kidney Disease', 'Surgery', 'Transplantation', 'Renal Replacement', 'Nephrology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,72.0,F

### INPUT:
A 5-year-old boy was referred to ophthalmology care for evaluation of nystagmus. His medical history included esophageal atresia, small bowel obstruction, mild cognitive impairment, low tone, and increased reflexes. Prenatal history was complicated by insulin-controlled gestational diabetes and polyhydramnios. His ocular history was notable for eye movement abnormalities since birth. He had no family history of ocular disease. On examination, his visual acuity was 20/150 OU and did not improve with correction (right eye, −1.50 [2.00] × 180; left eye, −1.00 [1.50] × 180). Pupillary responses were normal. Alternating vertical and torsional nystagmus was noted (Figure 1). Specifically, 1 eye was noted to rise and intort while the other would fall and extort, followed by reversal of the vertical and torsional components in the opposite eye (Video). The optic nerve and foveal reflexes were normal in both eyes. Flash visual evoked potential (VEP) demonstrated strong ipsilateral activity of the occipital lobe. Results of a previously obtained brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan were reported as normal.

### INPUT:
A 28-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 5-day history of bilateral blurry vision, eye redness, discharge, photophobia, and pain. He also reported rhinorrhea and lethargy. His medical history included Leber congenital amaurosis treated with voretigene neparvovec (Luxturna; Spark Therapeutics) 8 years ago, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) diagnosed 6 months prior to presentation treated with cytarabine and idarubicin. His latest chemotherapy was 3 weeks before presentation, and a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) was removed 2 weeks ago. A complete blood cell count was ordered, revealing anemia, neutropenia, lymphocytopenia, and monocytopenia in the setting of recent chemotherapy. Blood cultures were drawn, and results were pending at the time of presentation. His ophthalmic examination showed visual acuity of 20/800 OD and 20/400 OS, decreased from his baseline of 20/200 OU. Intraocular pressures were 37 mm Hg OD and 31 mm Hg OS. Slitlamp examination revealed chemosis, conjunctival hyperemia, and microcystic corneal edema bilaterally. There were more than 20 cells per high-power field of 1 mm × 1 mm beam, with fibrin bilaterally and 2.5-mm hypopyon in the right eye and 2.7-mm hypopyon in the left eye (Figure 1). Posterior segment examination was limited because of corneal edema and anterior inflammation, but there were no vitreous opacities on B-scan ultrasonography.

### INPUT:
A 7-year-old boy was referred to the otolaryngology clinic by his pediatrician for a left pharyngeal lesion. His parents noted the lesion 18 months prior. It remained stable in size and was asymptomatic. He denied sore throat, dysphagia, and dyspnea. He was otherwise healthy with no history of recurrent pharyngitis. On examination, his vital signs were within normal limits. He was comfortable with no noted stridor and tolerated his oral secretions. His oropharyngeal examination was notable for size 2+ palatine tonsils without exudate and a white mass on the posterior tonsillar pillar. He did not tolerate palpation of the lesion. There was no palpable cervical adenopathy, and his lungs were clear to auscultation. No laboratory work or imaging were performed. The patient was taken to the operating room for an excisional biopsy. There, a more thorough gross examination of the lesion was notable for a pedunculated, white rubbery mass arising from the left posterior tonsillar pillar with a narrow mucosal stalk (Figure, A).

### INPUT:
A woman in her late 50s was released from a tertiary hospital with an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock with onset 6 days before admission. On admission, vital signs showed blood pressure as 98/66 mm Hg while receiving dobutamine and norepinephrine from the referral hospital, a regular heart rate of 90 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, peripheral oxygen saturation 96% nasal oxygen at 3 L per minute, and a temperature of 36.7° C. Echocardiography showed reduced left ventricle systolic function (estimated ejection fraction, 34%) and hypokinesia of the anteroseptal, anterior, anterolateral, and septal walls. Lung ultrasound demonstrated multiple B-lines in both lung fields. Diagnostic coronary angiography revealed a total occlusion in the left main coronary artery. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was successful in opening the osteal left main and drug-eluting stents were placed in the left main and left anterior descending arteries. Following PCI, the patient had episodes of supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Electrical cardioversion was performed and a loading dose of amiodarone was administered. Chest radiography during the loading dose of amiodarone showed infiltrates in both lung fields (Figure 1A). While in the intensive cardiovascular care unit, maintenance doses of amiodarone were continued because of episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, and torsades de pointes. On the third day of hospitalization, despite adequate diuresis, the chest radiography showed persistent pulmonary edema. Chest computed tomography showed a reticular pattern predominantly in the perihilar area with consolidation and diffuse ground-glass opacity in both lung fields (Figure 1B). In addition, hemodynamic evaluation and lung ultrasound showed no congestion and laboratory markers, including a procalcitonin level of 0.01 ng/mL, and ruled out an infectious etiology.

A patient in their mid-30s with a medical history of deceased donor kidney transplant, cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis, and CMV viremia with documented resistance to foscarnet and ganciclovir (UL97 and UL54 gene mutations) presented with new-onset floaters in both eyes. The patient was taking systemic immunosuppression but recently stopped taking maribavir because of concerns about resistance and was transitioned to cidofovir and CMV immune globulin. On clinical examination, the visual acuity measured 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. Motility, visual fields, and anterior segment examination were normal. Dilated fundus examination revealed tortuous vasculature, multiple cotton wool spots along the arcades and periphery, and granular, hypopigmented retinal lesions without hemorrhage in the macula and temporal periphery in both eyes (Figure 1A). Optical coherence tomography showed localized areas of full-thickness retinitis (Figure 1B). CMV titers indicated viremia at 2.24 million IU/mL. Despite the patient’s documented UL97 and UL54 mutations, a series of 5 biweekly intravitreal injections of foscarnet and ganciclovir were performed given their vision-threatening lesions. Retinal pathology failed to improve, and the patient eventually refused additional intravitreal therapy because of pain and transiently decreased vision after each injection.

A 61-year-old Black woman with hypertension and diabetes presented with decreased vision 3 months after uneventful cataract surgery in her left eye. She had undergone laser retinopexy for retinal tears in her right eye and a scleral buckle and vitrectomy for a retinal detachment in her left eye 1 year earlier. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/40 OD and counting fingers OS. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 14 mm Hg in the right eye and 44 mm Hg in the left eye. Anterior segment examination of the right eye was unremarkable, while ophthalmoscopic examination showed vascular attenuation and treated retinal breaks. In the left eye, microcystic corneal edema and Descemet membrane folds limited examination, but no residual lenticular fragments or neovascularization of the iris or angle were seen. The patient was discharged taking timolol, dorzolamide, brimonidine, and prednisolone. Twelve days later, the cornea had cleared and IOP in the left eye improved to 32 mm Hg. Gonioscopy revealed 360° of anterior synechiae and complete angle closure, which was documented on ultrasound biomicroscopy (Figure 1). The patient started treatment with 500 mg of acetazolamide daily and referred to the glaucoma service for surgical evaluation.

Computed tomography of the orbits with contrast demonstrated right preseptal edema and intraorbital fat stranding of the extraconal and intraconal fat without sinus disease. Nasal endoscopy performed by the otolaryngology service showed no evidence of invasive fungal sinusitis. The patient received a single dose of intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone, then was transitioned to ampicillin-sulbactam for presumed orbital cellulitis. After 48 hours, motility, proptosis, and chemosis worsened (Figure 1A).

A 7-year-old girl presented with a slowly growing, asymptomatic lump on her left lower neck since birth. Her parents denied any medical history of trauma, infection, or surgery. Physical examination showed a 1.3 × 0.7 × 0.6 cm, yellowish, hump-like mass with hairy surface and cartilage-like consistency on the anterior border of the lower third of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) (Figure, A). No other anomalies were observed. Ultrasonography revealed a 1.2 × 1.0 × 0.9 cm, hypoechoic, avascular, bulging nodule with an anechoic tubular structure extending to the subcutaneous fat and reaching the surface of the muscular layer. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a protuberant nodule with diffuse, slight hyperintensity on T1WI; and 2 mild hyperintense foci surrounded by hypointense tissue on fat-suppressed T2WI (Figure, B). The neck mass was completely excised under general anesthesia in the department of pediatric surgery. Intraoperatively, the mass extended into the anteromedial fascia of the left SCM and did not involve the deeper neck structures. Postoperative histopathologic analysis showed normal-appearing epidermis, multiple pilosebaceous follicles, abundant adipose tissue, and 2 centrally circumscribed segments of cartilage in the subcutis (Figure, C). Van Gieson stain highlighted elastic fibers surrounding individual chondrocytes.

A man in his mid-20s was evaluated for a history of dyspnea on exertion for 2 years. On physical examination, his pulse was 70 beats per minute, and blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg. The cardiovascular examination showed a loud S1, normal S2, and an opening snap along with a mid-diastolic, soft, rumbling murmur at the apex of the heart. The electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with left atrial enlargement. The echocardiogram showed severe mitral stenosis with a mitral valve area of 0.9 cm2 with a mean (SD) gradient of 20 (4) mm Hg. There was no evidence of any subvalvular thickening, leaflet calcification, or mitral regurgitation. The patient was taken for balloon mitral valvotomy (BMV). A 6F pigtail catheter was placed in the left ventricle via the right femoral artery. The interatrial septum was punctured using a Mullins sheath and Brockenbrough needle via the right femoral vein. Entry into the left atrium was made and confirmed with a dye injection. However, suddenly, the patient developed acute onset of dyspnea along with retrosternal chest pain. His blood pressure at the time of the event was 100/60 mm Hg, pulse was 70 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation was 96%. The catheter was pulled back into the right atrium, and chest fluoroscopy was performed (Figure; Video).

A 56-year-old man presented at the clinic for follow-up of metastatic hormone receptor–positive, ERBB2-negative breast cancer. He had locally advanced disease that was invading the skin overlying his right breast and metastatic disease to the thoracic and lumbar spine, liver, and mediastinal, axillary, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. His disease had progressed after receiving first-line therapy with palbociclib and anastrozole. Subsequent treatments with fulvestrant and paclitaxel were also followed by progressive disease. He received treatment with capecitabine; after 6 weeks of treatment, he developed some redness on his hands and feet that resolved on its own. He then presented to the clinic with pruritic, erythematous, scaly macules and papules on his forearms, face, chest, and upper back (Figure). The rash had been present for 3 weeks and had recently worsened. His palms and soles were spared. The rash did not respond to treatment with topical clindamycin, oral solumedrol, or doxycycline.

A 51-year-old previously healthy woman was admitted with severe neck pain for 6 days. In the past month, she felt neck stiffness, accompanied by swelling and persistent dull pain of the upper anterior chest wall, which could be transiently relieved by taking oral ibuprofen. Six days before admission, the patient’s neck stiffness transited to an endurable dull ache. When turning her head, there was severe burning pain in the posterior neck and occiput, followed immediately by an electric shocklike numbness on ipsilateral side tongue, which led to a forced head position. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine with gadolinium on admission revealed signal abnormality in C1/C2 vertebrae (Figure 1A). In the past 3 days, with the intensification of neck pain, the patient found pustules on both hands, which gradually increased. She had no history of tobacco, alcohol, or drug misuse. On examination, she was afebrile. There was tenderness in the right sternoclavicular articulation, upper neck, post aurem, and occiput. Multiple pustules were seen in the palm and back of both hands (Figure 1B). Complete blood cell count and liver and kidney function yielded normal results, except for elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 93 mm/h and C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 5.5 mg/dL (to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10). Results of workup for rheumatic and infectious disease, including antinuclear, antineutrophil cytoplasmic and anticardiolipin antibodies, human leukocyte antigen B27, repeated blood cultures, rapid plasma reagin test, Aspergillus galactomannan antigen, brucella, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and rickettsial antibodies, were all negative. Cell count, protein, and glucose in cerebrospinal fluid were normal. Cultures of cerebrospinal fluid revealed no organisms.

A 55-year-old female jazz musician with a medical history that was significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease, and obstructive sleep apnea presented with an enlarging right more than left-sided neck mass of more than 2 years’ duration. The patient was seen and evaluated by a local surgical oncologist with a working diagnosis of possible lymphoma. The growing neck mass was causing solid food dysphagia and difficulty breathing at night. She did not have any neurological deficits. On further questioning, she had a similar mass that was treated with liposuction 10 years prior. Her family history was negative for any head and neck benign or malignant disease. Her social history was negative for tobacco or alcohol use. This patient was not taking any steroid medications. Physical examination showed an enlarged right more than left-sided neck mass. It was tense but compressible to palpation. Flexible fiber-optic laryngoscopy showed a crowded oropharynx with lingual tonsil hypertrophy and narrow oropharynx and hypopharynx. An outside computed tomography scan showed diffuse symmetric fatty infiltration of the pharynx, larynx, trachea, and esophagus. A magnetic resonance imaging scan with and without contrast (Figure, A) showed extensive areas of fat deposition within the neck that bilaterally extended from the level of C1 in the retropharyngeal space to the level of the sternal notch. Given that the patient was symptomatic, surgical intervention was recommended.

### INPUT:
A 54-year-old White man with a history of lobular breast carcinoma in situ treated with lumpectomy as well as chromophobe kidney cell carcinoma treated with partial nephrectomy was referred for evaluation of an asymptomatic, amelanotic choroidal mass in his left eye, suspicious for metastatic disease. On examination, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU and intraocular pressures were normal in both eyes at 10 mm Hg. Slitlamp biomicroscopy of the anterior chamber was within normal limits in both eyes. Dilated fundus examination revealed normal findings in the right eye and clear vitreous with a subretinal mass in the left eye inferior to the optic disc and measuring 3 × 2 mm in base. Color fundus photography of the left eye (Figure, A) showed an amelanotic lesion under the retina inferior to the optic disc and 3 mm from the foveola surrounded by a subtle orange halo. Fundus autofluorescence (Figure, B) showed the lesion to be hyperautofluorescent. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of the lesion showed the mass was primarily in the sclera and pushed and thinned the overlying choroid (Figure, C).

### INPUT:
A 15-year-old adolescent boy who was taking an oral contraceptive presented to the emergency department with left lower quadrant abdominal pain that had developed gradually over a 3-day period. He had no associated nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hematochezia, bloating, or anorexia. He reported no precipitating factors for the pain and had no history of pregnancy, abdominal surgery, or abdominal trauma. Over the previous 2 years, the patient had experienced similar intermittent episodes of abdominal pain lasting approximately 1 week. Results from laboratory tests, upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, and an abdominal computed tomography scan performed 1 year prior to presentation were normal. In the emergency department, his vital signs were normal and his body mass index was 20.4 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters). Abdominal examination revealed no rigidity or guarding; however, a 1-cm point of maximal tenderness was identified in the left lower abdominal quadrant (Figure). During palpation of this 1-cm area, the pain increased when he lifted his head and tensed his abdominal muscles. He experienced cold hypoesthesia when an alcohol gauze pad was applied to this area and severe pain when the skin was pinched.

A South Asian female individual in her early 40s with a strong family history (FHx) of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) including premature cardiovascular events in multiple family members presented to establish care for cardiovascular risk stratification. She had no traditional risk factors for ASCVD and no cardiac symptoms or limitations. She had never smoked, was physically active, and did not take any medications. Her 10-year ASCVD risk was estimated at 1.6% (low risk) based on the pooled cohort equations (PCEs); however, she had 2 risk-enhancing factors: South Asian ancestry and a FHx of premature ASCVD. Her father had a myocardial infarction at age 39 years, and, importantly, her older brother had angioplasty with multiple stents at age 43 years. Additionally, multiple male cousins on her father’s side had coronary artery disease, the details of which were unspecified. Owing to her striking FHx of premature ASCVD, she underwent screening for elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and obtained a coronary calcium score. Her Lp(a) level was elevated at 136 nmol/L and her coronary calcium score of 137 Agatston units was notable and placed her in the 94th percentile for her age (Figure 1). She returned to the office for further counseling on what to do next about these findings.

### INPUT:
A patient in their mid-60s was referred for evaluation of a left iris pigmented lesion. The mass had been present for decades and multiple prior office visits with referring ophthalmologists, most recently 4 years prior, showed the mass remained stable in size. The patient’s ocular history included cataract extraction with intraocular lens placement and retinal tear of the right eye and cataract of the left eye. Review of systems was negative for any recent changes in health, weight loss, fever, or night sweats. Visual acuity without correction was 20/20 OD and 20/25+ OS. Intraocular pressures were normal. Slitlamp examination of the right eye was unremarkable, and the left eye had a raised pigmented iris lesion without prominent internal vasculature and with mammillations on the surface (multiple small smooth dome-shaped protuberances on the surface of the tumor). There were large pigment granules on the surface of the tumor and on the adjacent iris surrounding the mass (Figure 1A). There was no ectropion uvea or iris neovascularization. There were mild nuclear sclerotic changes across the lens in the left eye. Ultrasound biomicroscopy showed a homogeneous intrinsic iris solid tumor with a height of 1.4 mm and basal diameter of 4.1 mm, without angle or ciliary body involvement (Figure 1B).

### INPUT:
A 61-year-old woman presented to our clinic with a 3-month history of rapidly growing and itchy cutaneous nodules all over the body. She denied systemic complaints such as weakness, fever, night sweats, or weight loss. Oral glucocorticoids did not show any therapeutic effect. Her medical history was remarkable for mild anemia because of untreated hemorrhoids. Physical examination revealed numerous symmetrically distributed, well-defined, erythematous skin nodules on her back, buttocks, and limb extensors (Figure, A). Prominent lymphadenopathies on bilateral cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes were noted, with the largest lymph node measuring approximately 5 × 2 cm. Laboratory tests were significant for atypical lymphocytes in the peripheral blood (count up to 6%), an elevated CD4+/CD8+ lymphocyte ratio (9.21; normal range, 0.7-3.1), moderate anemia (hemoglobin level, 8.7 g/dL; normal range, 11.5-15.0 g/dL [to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0]), a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (35 mm/h; normal range, 0-25 mm/h), and cryoglobulins composed of mixed polyclonal immunoglobulins.

### INPUT:
A 68-year-old woman with a medical history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and obesity had undergone C5 anterior corpectomy and fusion (C4-6) with expandable cage, autograft, and anterior instrumentation and posterior spinal decompression and fusion (C4-7) for cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Five months after surgery, she presented to the otolaryngology clinic with 3 weeks of mild odynophagia and dysphagia. It was noted that the patient had a prominent posterior pharyngeal wall, subtle asymmetry of vocal fold motion, and pooling of secretions in the left pyriform (Video 1). During the next 6 months, she gradually developed shortness of breath and stridor, and eventually presented to the emergency department in respiratory distress requiring intubation for 2 days. Shortly after extubation, laryngeal examination showed fullness of the posterior pharyngeal wall and severely limited vocal fold abduction bilaterally (Figure 1A; Video 1). A modified barium swallow study showed intermittent laryngeal penetration without aspiration (Video 2). Although the patient was unable to tolerate magnetic resonance imaging, a soft tissue computed tomography scan of the neck with contrast revealed a well-positioned plate with no evidence of fluid collection in the setting of a normal leukocyte count. One month later, a neuromuscular specialist investigated potential underlying neurological causes; however, results of nerve conduction, antiacetylcholine receptor, antimuscle-specific kinase, methylmalonic acid, HIV, rapid plasma reagin, vitamin B-12, thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroxine, copper, creatine kinase, and immunofixation studies were all unremarkable.

### INPUT:
A 75-year-old man presenting with decreased visual acuity and metamorphopsia in the right eye was referred for further evaluation of a pigmented epiretinal membrane. He had a history of cutaneous nodular melanoma in the right arm. Tumor staging was classified as T3N0M0 in August 2017, at the time of diagnosis and excision. In April 2018, axillary lymphadenectomy was performed for local recurrence and the patient started treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) pembrolizumab, without further local or metastatic evidence of the tumor. Ocular history was positive for cataract surgery bilaterally. After cataract surgery in the right eye, an asymptomatic vision loss was noted and the cause was attributed to the presence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), for which the patient underwent intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections. Examination showed a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/60 OD and 20/20 OS, unremarkable anterior segment findings, and intraocular pressures of 12 mm Hg OU. A fundus examination in the right eye revealed scarce pigmented cells in the anterior vitreous, a dark-pigmented epiretinal membrane, and an area of retinal hyperpigmentation in the inferior temporal arcade corresponding to the CNV (Figure 1). Optical coherence tomography imaging revealed a hyperreflective structure on the surface of the inner retina with increased macular thickness, compatible with the described epiretinal membrane (Figure 1).

### INPUT:
A 3-month-old girl was referred for evaluation of multiple cutaneous red papules. The guardian reported first noticing the papules at birth. During the following months, the papules grew in number and size, involving the head and neck, trunk, extremities, right palm, mons pubis, and buttocks. At the height of severity, the patient had 39 lesions, some of which were associated with ulceration and bleeding. The patient was born at full term via spontaneous vaginal delivery; the birth mother had not received prenatal care. Neither the birth mother nor the infant had any known history of environmental or occupational exposure to hazardous substances. The paternal family medical history was unremarkable; maternal family medical history was unknown. Physical examination revealed numerous bright red macules, papules, and plaques ranging in size from 1.0 × 1.0 mm to 2.2 × 2.3 cm, many of which had hemorrhagic crust and dark scale (Figure, A and B). Additional examination findings included retrognathia, thickened maxillary frenulum, and anterior ankyloglossia.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Congenital disseminated pyogenic granuloma,"**Step 1: Infantile Hemangiomas**

Infantile hemangiomas are common benign vascular tumors in infants, presenting as bright red papules, macules, or plaques. They typically appear shortly after birth, proliferate for several months, and then gradually involute. The presence of multiple lesions aligns with this diagnosis.

---

**Step 2: PHACE Syndrome**

PHACE syndrome encompasses Posterior fossa brain malformations, Hemangiomas, Arterial anomalies, Cardiac defects, and Eye abnormalities. Large segmental hemangiomas of the head and neck, along with craniofacial anomalies like retrognathia and ankyloglossia, suggest this syndrome.

---

**Step 3: Diffuse Neonatal Hemangiomatosis**

Diffuse neonatal hemangiomatosis involves multiple cutaneous hemangiomas present at or shortly after birth. It can affect internal organs, leading to serious complications. The extensive number of skin lesions raises this possibility.

---

**Step 4: Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis**

Langerhans cell histiocytosis can present in infants with multiple skin lesions ranging from papules to ulcerative nodules. Systemic involvement is possible, and skin lesions may crust or scale, matching some clinical features described.

---

**Step 5: Kaposiform Hemangioendothelioma**

This rare vascular tumor presents in infancy with deep-seated, lesion(s) that can ulcerate and bleed. It is often associated with Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon, leading to coagulopathy. The ulceration and bleeding of lesions make this a consideration.

---

**Step 6: Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus Syndrome**

Characterized by multiple venous malformations in the skin and gastrointestinal tract, lesions are bluish, compressible, and may bleed. The cutaneous findings partly align, though the color and systemic involvement differ.

---

**Step 7: Congenital Hemangiomas**

Congenital hemangiomas are fully formed at birth and can be either rapidly involuting (RICH) or non-involuting (NICH). They present as solitary lesions but multiple lesions are rare, making this a less likely but possible diagnosis.

---

**Step 8: Maffucci Syndrome**

This syndrome involves multiple enchondromas and hemangiomas. While the vascular lesions can ulcerate and bleed, the skeletal anomalies (enchondromas) are a key feature, which if absent, make this diagnosis less probable.

---

**Step 9: Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia**

An inherited disorder causing abnormal blood vessel formation, leading to telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations. Presentation in infancy is uncommon, and lesions are usually not papular, making this less likely.

---

**Step 10: Pyogenic Granuloma**

A benign vascular lesion that appears as a red papule prone to ulceration and bleeding. It often arises after trauma and is typically solitary, which makes it less consistent with multiple congenital lesions.

---

**Reranked Differential Diagnoses:**

1. **PHACE Syndrome**
2. **Diffuse Neonatal Hemangiomatosis**
3. **Infantile Hemangiomas**
4. **Kaposiform Hemangioendothelioma**
5. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis**
6. **Congenital Hemangiomas**
7. **Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus Syndrome**
8. **Maffucci Syndrome**
9. **Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia**
10. **Pyogenic Granuloma**

---

**Final Assessment:**

Based on the patient's presentation of multiple cutaneous hemangiomas present at birth, proliferating in size and number, combined with craniofacial anomalies (retrognathia, thickened maxillary frenulum, and ankyloglossia), **PHACE Syndrome** emerges as the most likely diagnosis. The extensive number of lesions and their characteristics also strongly suggest **Diffuse Neonatal Hemangiomatosis** as a critical consideration. **Infantile Hemangiomas** remain a possibility due to their prevalence but are typically less extensive. The other conditions are considered less likely based on the available information but remain part of the differential until further testing confirms the diagnosis.","['Pediatrics', 'Dermatology', 'Neonatology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.25,M

A 28-year-old White man with no remarkable medical history presented with difficulty phonating and singing for the past 15 months. He also reported odynophonia, globus sensation, and mild dysphagia to solids. The patient had been treated previously with steroids and amoxicillin for the presumptive diagnosis of chronic laryngitis but reported no improvement in symptoms. Laboratory workup was positive for elevated antinuclear antibodies and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and was consequently referred to our institution. On presentation, the patient had only minimal dysphonia. He underwent a transnasal flexible laryngoscopy that demonstrated a severely edematous epiglottis, posterior pharyngeal wall, aryepiglottic folds, and arytenoids (Figure, A). The vocal folds were difficult to visualize but seemed normal in appearance and mobility. Stroboscopy could not be performed because of obstruction from the prolapsing arytenoids. Interestingly, the patient denied any shortness of breath. Results of laboratory testing revealed normal levels of all components of a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and angiotensin-converting enzyme. The patient’s erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated to 75 mm/h (reference range, 0-15 mm/h). Findings of chest radiography were normal. An esophagram showed no evidence of reflux esophagitis and a computed tomography of the neck showed edema of the supraglottis with some edema in the posterior hypopharyngeal wall.

A 72-year-old homeless woman was referred for management of a recurrent cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the right temple and brow. On review of history, maxillofacial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without contrast done 5 months prior to presentation showed a 5.9 × 5.3 × 3.7-cm mass centered at the right temple that tracked along the right lateral orbital wall as well as an enhancing right intraparotid lymph node. The patient was lost to follow-up and re-presented 5 months later with an enlarged crusting and ulcerating lesion of the right temple/brow (Figure 1A). On ocular examination, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/100 OD and 20/125 OS due to cataracts, pupils reacted normally without afferent pupillary defect, and ocular motility was full. She had mild proptosis in the right eye and right lower eyelid retraction. Orbicularis strength was intact and symmetric in both eyes. MRI of the orbits, face, and neck with and without contrast showed a 6.1 × 5.7 × 4.0-cm mass with erosion through the right sphenoid wing, involvement of the lacrimal gland, and abutment of the lateral rectus (Figure 1B). In discussing treatment strategies for the orbital component of the disease, the patient was strongly against an orbital exenteration.

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy woman in her 60s presented to our department with an 8-month history of widespread pruritic papulonodular skin lesions on her extremities and trunk. The patient had been initially diagnosed with nodular prurigo at a local hospital and treated with various topical steroids and oral antihistamines for 2 months, without significant improvement. The skin lesions continued to progress and worsened after scratching. Physical examinations revealed disseminated erythematous papules, hypertrophic plaques approximately 1 to 2 cm in diameter, and dome-shaped nodules with excoriated whitish or pink centers on the scalp, chest, abdomen, back, waist, and extremities (Figure, A and B). Subsequent examinations of the mucosal membranes appeared normal. Other physical examinations as well as her medical and family histories were unremarkable. Peripheral eosinophils, serum total immunoglobulin E level, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test for HIV, and results of other routine laboratory tests were within normal ranges or negative. A biopsy specimen was taken from one of the skin lesions on her right forearm for histopathological examination and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) testing (Figure, C and D).

### INPUT:
A 15-year-old boy presented to the otorhinolaryngologic department for a right-side postauricular mass. The mass had been present since birth but had slowly grown larger in the previous 2 years. On physical examination, a 2.5 × 1.5-cm, nontender, blue, soft, cystic mass was observed in the right postauricular area. There were no fistular openings around the auricle or in the external auditory canal (EAC), and there were no additional cysts, sinuses, or fistulas at the right neck from the hyoid bone and chin to the EAC. On temporal bone computed tomography, a 2.5 × 1.5-cm, hypodense, oval-shaped cystic mass was revealed at the subcutaneous fat layer superoposterior to the right auricle. On temporal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an oval cystic mass was revealed at the same location, with high signal intensity on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images and low signal intensity on enhanced T1-weighted fat suppression and T2-weighted short T1 inversion recovery images (Figure, A-D). In surgery, the well-demarcated cystic mass was completely excised. Yellowish fluid leaked out of the cyst during excision. On histopathologic examination, the cyst was lined by keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium with hair follicles and sebaceous glands. The cyst contained keratinous debris (Figure, E). There was no recurrence 6 months after surgery.

### INPUT:
A 6-month-old boy presented to the emergency department for evaluation of fever and was noted to have mild inspiratory stridor. His parents stated that his stridor began acutely at 4 months of age without any inciting illness or event. The stridor was worse with agitation but was without positional exacerbation. The family reported that the stridor had remained stable since onset. His parents noted mild dysphagia but denied shortness of breath, cyanosis, or apnea. Laboratory test results revealed acute COVID-19 infection. Physical examination was unremarkable other than mild inspiratory stridor. Findings from bedside flexible laryngoscopy revealed intact vocal fold motion bilaterally with glottic competence. No supraglottic or glottic masses were identified. Anterior-posterior neck and chest radiography demonstrated narrowing and tortuosity of the trachea with displacement to the right proximal to the thoracic inlet and diffuse patchy heterogenous airspace opacities (Figure, A). Subsequent neck ultrasonography and computed tomography scan demonstrated a 3.2 × 2.0-cm low-density lesion abutting the trachea and hypopharynx at the level of thoracic inlet, with rightward displacement of the trachea and larynx (Figure, B-D). Operative laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, and esophagoscopy revealed extrinsic compression of the trachea, right mainstem bronchus, and esophagus with rightward deviation of the trachea and esophagus. No mucosal tract was identified.

### INPUT:
A 66-year-old man with chronic hepatitis B infection and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) presented with subacute epigastric pain. Three years prior, he was diagnosed with a solitary HCC and underwent surgical resection with curative intent. Pathology revealed poorly differentiated HCC, 16 cm in largest dimension, with large vein involvement (T3bNXM0, R0 resection). The patient underwent expectant observation. One and a half years prior to the current presentation, laboratory results revealed an elevated α-fetoprotein (AFP), and cross-sectional imaging revealed multiple lung nodules consistent with metastases. He was treated with nivolumab every other week and attained a biochemical (baseline, 212.2 ng/dL; best response, 3.3 ng/dL) and radiographic complete response. In the current presentation, the patient reported nonradiating epigastric pain of moderate intensity for 1 month. Associated symptoms included nausea, anorexia, and water brash without emesis. Review of systems was positive for unchanged chronic abdominal bloating and negative for other constitutional or gastrointestinal symptoms. Laboratory results, including liver function tests, amylase, lipase, and AFP, were within normal limits, and hepatitis B virus polymerase chain reaction was undetectable. Computed tomography with multiphasic liver protocol showed new enlarged mesenteric nodes and diffuse thickening of the gastric body (Figure, A). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) identified diffuse inflammation and ulcerations in the gastric body and antrum (Figure, B). Biopsy specimens showed chronic and active mixed inflammatory infiltrate, including intraepithelial lymphocytosis (Figure, C). No overt viral cytopathic effects were observed, and immunostaining results for Helicobacter pylori, cytomegalovirus, and adenovirus were negative.

### INPUT:
A 59-year-old man with a 5-year history of intermittent bilateral uveitis and scleritis presented with painful left uveitis and an episcleral nodule (Figure 1). Ultrasound biomicroscopy revealed an elevated and tender uveal-episcleral lesion. Visual acuity was 20/30 in the left eye and 20/25 in the right eye. He had been taking 60 mg of oral prednisone; topical prednisolone acetate, 1%; and oral ibuprofen for 10 days without relief. He was suspected of being a steroid responder due to elevated intraocular pressure bilaterally. Three years prior, sinus pressure symptoms led to magnetic resonance imaging that revealed a nasal sinus mass. Biopsy demonstrated a histiocytic infiltrate with emperipolesis, consistent with Rosai-Dorfman-Destombes (RDD) disease. Timolol-dorzolamide topical drops were initiated.

A woman in her mid-50s with a history of mitral valve repair presented to the emergency department with complaints of recent-onset palpitation within the last hour. On physical examination, the patient showed a rhythmic tachycardia with a rate of 178 beats/min and blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg. The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a regular tachycardia with a rate of 178 beats/min; no obvious P waves were recognizable (Figure 1A). The QRS complexes displayed 2 different morphologies occurring with a definite allorhythmic distribution: pairs of beats exhibiting complete right bundle branch block (RBBB) and QRS duration of 140 milliseconds followed by a third beat with normal configuration and QRS duration of 70 milliseconds. This trigeminal variation in intraventricular conduction occurred without any change in cycle length and was maintained. Adenosine administration quickly slowed the ventricular rate allowing recognition of an atrial tachycardia with a rate of 178/min and a 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) ratio (Figure 1B).

A 27-year-old White woman presented with a recent onset of malaise, chills, night sweats, and sore throat with difficulty swallowing. She also reported redness of her right eye with watery discharge. She developed a skin rash affecting her trunk, limbs, and genitalia within the previous week. Her medical history was noncontributory, except for allergic rhinitis, for which she was prescribed fexofenadrine pro re nata. Her visual acuity was 6/6 in both eyes. Examination of her right eye revealed erythematous swollen eyelids. A slightly raised dome-shaped umbilicated nodule, of approximately 3 mm, was present on her medial one-third lower eyelid margin, with a similar lesion developing on the corresponding upper eyelid margin (Figure). A vesicular lesion was also present on the caruncle and there was global conjunctival hyperemia, mostly pronounced nasally and around the lesions (Figure, B). There were no signs of corneal involvement, and the anterior chamber was quiet. The left eye was normal. Results of fundus examination in both eyes were normal. No preauricular or submandibular lymph node involvement was noted, but cervical lymph nodes were enlarged. The pharynx was erythematous and swollen with white pus patches. The skin lesions were dome-shaped papules, round, pinkish-white in color, surrounded by an erythematous area. Full blood cell count and tests for HIV, AIDS, and syphilis were ordered. Conjunctival swabs and eyelid vesicle fluid were taken for polymerase chain reaction testing. Swabs of the upper respiratory tract were also taken.

A 31-year-old woman with insidious onset of limited mobility of joints visited our clinic for evaluation. Six months prior, she found her palms could not make full contact with each other (the “prayer sign”). She had not been able to fully clench her fists for 2 months or squat for the past 10 days. No erythema, edema, or sclerotic skin plaque had been found on her limbs or trunk. No Raynaud phenomenon had occurred. Her medical and family histories were unremarkable. On examination, she showed bilateral limited mobility of interphalangeal (hands), metacarpophalangeal, wrist, interphalangeal (feet), metatarsophalangeal, and ankle joints (Video). No muscular atrophy or sclerodactyly was found. The prayer sign (Figure 1A) and the “groove sign” (Figure 1B) were observed. Blood test results indicated eosinophilia (absolute eosinophil count, 1300 μL; reference, <500μL [to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001]), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, 31 mm/h; reference, <15 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (CRP, 3.01 mg/dL; reference, <0.8 mg/dL [to convert to mg/L, multiply by 10]). Liver and kidney function tests, creatine kinase level, electrolyte level, thyroid function, globulin concentration, and antinuclear antibody (ANA) level were unremarkable. Electrocardiogram, cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging, and plain radiographs of hands, wrists, feet, and ankles were normal. Nerve conduction studies performed in all 4 limbs were normal. Electromyography (EMG) showed spontaneous activities in muscles of limbs, including fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves (1+ or 2+). Myotonic discharges were seen in bilateral extensor digitorum.

A 21-year-old woman was referred to our tertiary care hospital with a congenital left hemifacial weakness and a chronic unilateral left-sided hearing loss that evolved since birth. On audiometry, normal hearing sensitivity in the right ear and a severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss with poor word recognition score in the left ear were noted. On physical examination, the patient presented a grade VI peripheral left facial paralysis. Findings from the rest of the clinical examination were within normal limits. Results of cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and temporal bone computed tomography (CT) revealed a left internal auditory canal mass, measuring 13×12 mm, developed at the expense of nerve VII, with a dilation of the various portions of the facial nerve with extension to its distal branches. It presented a hypointensity on T2, isointensity on T1, and was strongly enhanced after the injection of gadolinium. This mass was responsible for the enlargement of the internal auditory canal and was in close contact with the left middle cerebral fossa, without intraparenchymal extension (Figure 1A and B).

### INPUT:
An 18-year-old man presented to the dermatology clinic for evaluation of recurrent skin, nail, and oral mucosal abnormalities. At age 4 years, he developed white oral plaques that resolved with oral nystatin. Approximately 6 months later, the oral plaques recurred, his toenails became thickened and yellowed, and red plaques appeared on both feet and lower legs. After 3 months of daily oral itraconazole, his skin, nail, and oral mucosal abnormalities resolved for approximately 1 year. Over the following years, he received intermittent 3- to 6-month courses of daily itraconazole for recurrent skin, nail, and oral mucosal abnormalities, which typically recurred within 6 to 12 months of discontinuing itraconazole. His last dose of itraconazole was approximately 2 years prior to presentation. On physical examination, the patient had white, moist, nonadherent plaques in the oral mucosa and moist red fissures at bilateral oral commissures (Figure, left panel). He also had thickened, yellowed toenails and scaly erythematous plaques on his lower legs and feet bilaterally (Figure, right panel). Results of complete blood cell count with differential were normal, as were results of measurement of serum IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE levels and analysis of CD3, CD4, and CD8 T-cell subsets. Potassium hydroxide wet mount preparation of skin scrapings from the lower extremities demonstrated fungal elements. Fungal culture of the skin scrapings grew Candida albicans.

### INPUT:
A patient in their 70s presented to the emergency department (ED) with a unilateral painless right proptosis, first noticed 3 days prior. There was no contributory medical history, recent trauma, or surgery. Visual acuity (VA) was 20/32 OD and 20/20 OS. Anterior-segment and fundus examination results were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits revealed a right retro-orbital hemorrhage. No etiology could be identified on the image. Systemic corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone, 1 mg/kg per day) was prescribed for 48 hours. The proptosis decreased, and the patient was discharged. After 6 months, complete ophthalmologic examination was performed again; VA was 20/20 OU, and there was no remaining proptosis. Two weeks later, the patient presented to the ED for another episode of acute, painless, right proptosis, and the VA had decreased to 20/40 OD. MRI showed a right retrobulbar hemorrhage. Systemic corticosteroid therapy was again prescribed for 48 hours with rapid resolution of the visual impairment but incomplete resolution of the proptosis. One month later, the patient presented to our ophthalmology department. The VA was 20/20 OU, with a persistent, mild, nonreducible, nonpulsatile proptosis unrelated to Valsalva maneuver but associated with extraocular movement limitation in upgaze. A repeated MRI was performed, which showed the following images (Figure 1).

### INPUT:
A 74-year-old man was referred for evaluation of retinal lesions in his left eye. His ocular history was notable for recent cataract surgery 5 weeks prior to presentation that was complicated by endophthalmitis. A normal funduscopic examination was documented prior to cataract surgery. At the time of initial presentation to his local retina specialist 1 week following his cataract surgery, the patient had severe pain and redness. His visual acuity was light perception. An examination revealed a 2-mm hypopyon and dense vitreous haze with no view of the retina. He was treated for presumed endophthalmitis with a vitreous tap and intravitreal injections of vancomycin (1 mg/0.1 mL), ceftazidime (2.2 mg/0.1 mL), and dexamethasone (0.4 mg/0.1 mL). The vitreous sample obtained at the time of treatment grew Staphylococcus caprae susceptible to vancomycin. At time of examination in our clinic 4 weeks following treatment, the patient was receiving topical steroid and cycloplegic drops. His best-corrected visual acuity had improved to 20/70. Examination showed a deep and quiet anterior chamber with a well-positioned intraocular lens without any plaques or deposits on the lens capsule. Dilated ophthalmoscopic examination demonstrated improvement in the vitreous debris with 1+ vitritis and numerous superficial, round, white lesions spread throughout the fundus in all 4 quadrants and in the macula (Figure 1A). Optical coherence tomography verified the preretinal location of the lesions (Figure 1B).

A 2-month-old, full-term male presented with a left upper neck mass that was first noted at birth. His parents reported no fevers, constitutional symptoms, or enlargement of the mass. On physical examination, there was a nontender 4-cm mass in the left submandibular region with no overlying skin changes. Ultrasonography results showed an avascular cystic structure with internal debris and a single thin septation. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the neck soft tissue revealed a 3-cm low attenuation, nonenhancing, cystic-appearing mass that elevated the submandibular gland to the level of the parapharyngeal fat space with medial extension of the lesion into the tongue musculature. The walls were thin except for mildly thickened capsule along the posterior aspect of the lesion (Figure, A and B). Fluid that aspirated from the cyst was serous, and cytology showed mature and anucleate squamous cells with acute inflammation. The mass returned after 3 weeks. Further analysis 8 months after the initial CT via contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a large, multiseptated cystic structure (Figure, C); the capsule of the wall was mildly thickened and was contrast enhancing. At age 12 months, the mass was excised via neck dissection. A lateral component at the level of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was completely excised. An intraoperative rupture of the thin capsule caused some spillage of cystic contents that were milky white in some areas and mucinous in others.

A 32-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital for fever, flulike symptoms, and altered mental status developed sudden-onset blurry vision in his right eye. His history was notable for phthisis in his left eye due to a left orbit clear cell sarcoma with metastatic disease, after surgical excision and radiation, with recent enrollment in a palliative immunotherapy research protocol. After completing 2 days of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics and antivirals for presumed septic meningitis, his laboratory and imaging results returned negative and he was transitioned to intravenous methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg). One day later, his mental status improved, and he reported central blurry vision in his right eye. On examination, his visual acuity was 20/40 in this eye, he had normal intraocular pressure, and there was no evidence of anterior chamber or vitreous cells. Dilated fundus examination revealed segmental areas of venous sheathing (Figure 1A) in the right eye and was not possible in the left eye owing to phthisis. An optical coherence tomography scan of the right eye revealed hyperreflective changes along the outer plexiform and outer nuclear layers, small intraretinal cysts, and disruption of the ellipsoid and especially the interdigitation zone (Figure 1B).

### INPUT:
A 32-year-old Black man presented with a 1-year history of facial swelling, predominantly in the right preauricular and left submandibular regions. His symptoms began after relocation to California and occurred more frequently at his home. However, he could not discern any environmental or dietary triggers. He reported pruritus and swelling, which were usually moderate but occasionally severe, prompting several emergency department visits. During an emergency department visit, he was diagnosed with acute parotitis based on clinical and radiographic findings of diffuse gland edema, without salivary stones or masses. His symptoms responded to oral prednisone bursts and diphenhydramine, but not to second-generation antihistamines or montelukast. His workup included immune serology and total immunoglobulin (Ig) E measurements, all of which were within normal limits. A differential blood cell count revealed 10% eosinophils (normal, <6%) and an absolute eosinophil count 500/µL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). Titers for antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, anti-Ro (SS-A), and anti-La (SS-B) were negative. Sialendoscopy of his right parotid and left submandibular glands found no obstructing stones or strictures. Concurrent steroid irrigation did not provide any substantial benefit. An open biopsy of the right parotid tail revealed nonspecific inflammatory changes and otherwise normal parenchyma. Given the frequency and severity of his symptoms along with multiple treatment failures, he opted to undergo a right superficial parotidectomy, which proceeded without complications. Further histologic examination of the surgical specimen revealed substantial periductal inflammatory infiltrate with eosinophils, as seen in the Figure.

Final diagnosis: Late-onset postoperative capsular bag distension syndrome.  
Case report: A 78-year-old White woman was referred to our clinic for evaluation of an unexplained subjective decrease in vision for more than 6 months, more pronounced in the right eye, and insufficiently controlled intraocular pressure (IOP). Local antiglaucoma therapy with a fixed-combination prostaglandin and β-blocker was used regularly in both eyes owing to long-standing primary open-angle glaucoma. Uneventful cataract surgery with phacoemulsification and in-the-bag insertion of an intraocular lens was performed 10 years earlier in both eyes. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 1.0 and 0.5 (Snellen equivalent, 20/20 and 20/40) OD and OS, respectively. Her manifest refraction revealed a difference of −0.75 D sphere compared with her own preexisting glasses in the right eye. IOP was 24 mm Hg in the right eye and 18 mm Hg in the left eye. Slitlamp examination revealed a milky substance in the retrolental space, more pronounced in the right eye (Figure) but evident in both. The rest of the slitlamp examination was unremarkable with moderate superficial punctate keratitis owing to ocular surface disease, an anterior chamber depth of Van Herick grade 4 (peripheral anterior chamber depth >1 corneal thickness), an absence of anterior chamber inflammation, and a moderate amount of Elschnig pearls in both eyes.

### INPUT:
A 55-year-old US-born woman with a history of cataract surgery in both eyes 3 years ago presented with worsening blurriness, photopsia, floaters, and intermittent eye redness for the past year, worse in the left eye. She was otherwise well. The referring physician was treating her with prednisolone eye drops for cystoid macular edema after recent left Nd:YAG capsulotomy. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/30 OS with intraocular pressures of 20 mm Hg OD and 26 mm Hg OS. The anterior segments showed well-positioned posterior chamber intraocular lens implants with open posterior capsules. Dilated fundus examination revealed a small peripheral hypoautofluorescent chorioretinal scar in the right eye. In the left eye, there was trace vitreous haze and 2+ anterior vitreous cell. Multifocal chorioretinal scars extended from the left optic nerve into the macula in each quadrant (Figure 1). These lesions showed variable hypoautofluorescence and hyperautofluorescence. On indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), the confluent hypoautofluorescent lesions showed loss of the choriocapillaris and prominent large choroidal vessels, whereas the mottled hypoautofluorescence and hyperautofluorescent lesions appeared to block the underlying fluorescence. Routine laboratory testing was unremarkable except for a positive interferon-gamma release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A chest radiograph was normal.

**Reranked Differential Diagnoses Using All Patient Information and Test Results:**

1. **Metastatic orbital disease from neuroendocrine tumor (NET)**
   - Given the patient's history of metastatic NET and a new pancreatic mass suggesting recurrence, metastasis to the orbit is highly possible. Orbital metastases can cause acute proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and periorbital swelling.

2. **Carcinoid syndrome**
   - Flushing and palpitations are classic symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. Although ophthalmic involvement is rare, serotonin-induced vasomotor changes could contribute to periorbital edema and chemosis.

3. **Cavernous sinus thrombosis**
   - Presents with bilateral ophthalmoplegia, proptosis, chemosis, and periorbital edema due to impaired venous drainage. Acute onset fits the clinical picture.

4. **Superior vena cava syndrome**
   - Obstruction of the superior vena cava can lead to facial and periorbital edema. However, ophthalmoplegia is less common.

5. **Idiopathic orbital inflammatory disease (orbital pseudotumor)**
   - Causes acute orbital signs like pain, proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and swelling. Usually unilateral but can be bilateral.

6. **Thyroid eye disease (Graves' ophthalmopathy)**
   - Common cause of bilateral proptosis and ophthalmoplegia. However, there's no mention of thyroid dysfunction.

7. **Orbital lymphoma**
   - Can present with painless proptosis and motility disturbances. Less likely acute in onset.

8. **Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's granulomatosis)**
   - Can involve the orbit causing proptosis and ophthalmoplegia but usually associated with systemic symptoms like sinusitis.

9. **Allergic reaction (angioedema)**
   - Can cause periorbital swelling and chemosis but unlikely to cause ophthalmoplegia or proptosis.

10. **Orbital cellulitis**
    - Typically unilateral and associated with signs of infection like fever and pain.

---

**Final Assessment:**

Based on the patient's history of metastatic NET with possible recurrence, acute orbital symptoms, and systemic signs (flushing and palpitations), the most likely diagnosis is **metastatic orbital disease from NET**. Carcinoid syndrome is also a strong consideration due to the flushing and palpitations. Cavernous sinus thrombosis remains a critical differential due to the acute bilateral ophthalmic signs and requires prompt evaluation.","['Ophthalmology', 'Oncology', 'Surgery', 'Surgical Oncology', 'External Eye Disease']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,47.0,F

A 6-year-old girl with severe autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was brought to the hospital by her mother for whitening in the right eye. The patient was nonverbal at baseline and exhibited restrictive and repetitive behaviors. Her diet consisted exclusively of cookies, apples, potato chips, and Gatorade. Her mother noticed her frequently rubbing her eyes for several weeks, which she initially attributed to new-onset allergies. She did not describe any reduction in visual function or ability to perform low-luminance tasks. The patient was admitted and ophthalmology was consulted. She required an examination under sedation. Her visual acuity could not be determined. There was no relative afferent pupillary defect in either eye. The eyelids were mildly erythematous with bilateral eyelash hypertrichosis. The conjunctiva and cornea appeared dry and leathery bilaterally. The right cornea was diffusely hazy with a 3-mm paracentral epithelial defect with 60% stromal thinning and a 1-mm infiltrate. There was a small crescentic fibrin deposit nasally in the right anterior chamber. The left cornea was diffusely hazy with a 1-mm epithelial defect without stromal thinning (Figure). Dilated examination showed bilateral grade 3 optic nerve head edema and otherwise normal retinal findings. Fortified vancomycin eye drops, 25 mg/mL, and tobramycin eye drops, 15 mg/mL, were initiated. Results of magnetic resonance imaging of the brain were normal.

A healthy 27-year-old man received a COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccine (Moderna) on December 7, 2021. He had not experienced adverse effects after the first 2 vaccine doses on January 17 and February 5, 2021. Twelve days after the booster vaccination, he developed pruritic wheals on his face and bilateral, transient eyelid swelling. Over the next week, a pruritic rash spread over his neck, chest, trunk, and arms; each lesion faded without scarring within 24 hours. He did not experience lip, tongue, or neck swelling; shortness of breath; wheezing; chest pain; or palpitations. Application of pressure to his forearm in a circular motion using a pen cap elicited wheal and flare lesions (Figure, left panel). On physical examination, performed 17 days after the onset of rash, his vital signs were normal. He had no tongue, lip, or throat swelling, and his lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Wheal and flare lesions developed on his upper eyelids during the examination and resolved after approximately 30 minutes (Figure, right panel). Light pressure applied to his skin with a tongue depressor elicited wheal and flare lesions within 3 to 5 minutes.

Final diagnosis: Intraocular lens implant subluxation and extrascleral extension secondary to ciliochoroidal melanoma.
Case report: A middle-aged patient with a remote history of bilateral juvenile cataracts after posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL) placement presented with decreased vision in the right eye for several months. There was no recent ocular trauma or intraocular surgery. At the time of the initial examination, visual acuity was 20/50 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye, with a refraction of −1.50 diopters (D) sphere in both eyes. Examination was notable for a superonasal area of pigmentation with elevation of the conjunctiva and an inferotemporally subluxed PCIOL in the right eye. Results of the fundus examination were reported to be normal in both eyes and the anterior examination of the left eye was notable for only a well-positioned PCIOL. The patient was referred to a cornea specialist for further evaluation and treatment. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, specialty evaluation occurred 10 weeks later at which time the patient complained of progressive vision loss in the right eye. Visual acuity measured hand motion in the right eye with normal intraocular pressure. The PCIOL was subluxed inferotemporally with vitreous prolapse into the anterior chamber (Figure 1A). A 4 mm × 3.1-mm superonasal pigmented scleral lesion was also noted (Figure 1B). The examination of the left eye was remarkable only for a well-centered PCIOL and iris transillumination defects.

### INPUT:
A 63-year-old woman presented with a history of previous left superficial parotidectomy 10 years before for a Warthin tumor. Her histology results showed a 5-cm Warthin tumor, with a focus of nodular oncocytic hyperplasia in the adjacent parenchyma and reactive intraparotid lymph nodes. She presented to the ear, nose, and throat clinic and complained of pain in the operative site of 6 months duration. This occurred intermittently once a week and lasted for a few minutes each time. It was associated with a small lump over the left neck, and the pain was worse on touch and head turning. On examination, there was a 3-mm nodularity palpated deep to the neck wound along the mid sternocleidomastoid muscle. It was associated with focal tenderness. Her facial nerve function was otherwise normal, and sensation in the ear lobe was intact. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was performed, and the results showed no focal lesion in either parotid glands or at the area of interest over the left sternocleidomastoid muscle. The patient was counseled for an excisional biopsy of the left neck nodule. The intraoperative photograph of the neck and the excised specimen is shown in Figure 1.

### INPUT:
A man in his 60s with a history of hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and chronic migraines presented with 9 months of progressively worsening left-sided ptosis, which was more notable at night and with fatigue. He denied experiencing pain, diplopia, muscle weakness, dysarthria, dysphagia, difficulty breathing, or other neurologic deficits. On examination, corrected visual acuity was 20/20 bilaterally, with normal color vision, visual fields, intraocular pressure, extraocular movements, alignment, and pupils. External examination was notable for left upper eyelid ptosis (Figure 1), with a margin-to-reflex distance 1 of 3.5 mm on the right and 0.5 mm on the left, intact levator function, and no fatiguability on sustained upgaze. There was no evidence of eyelid edema, erythema, or tenderness to palpation. There were no palpable adnexal masses or orbital rim deformities, but there was mild fullness in the left superior sulcus and mildly increased left-sided resistance to retropulsion. However, Hertel exophthalmometry did not reveal any relative proptosis. No lacrimal gland abnormalities or conjunctival masses were seen with upper eyelid eversion. There was no palpable preauricular or cervical lymphadenopathy. Slitlamp and fundus examination findings were normal. Serological testing results for antiacetylcholine receptor antibody were negative.

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy woman in her 20s presented to the dermatology department with thickening and swelling of hands after immersion in water, accompanied by burning pruritus for 3 years. The lesions occurred as symmetrical white and transparent papules, white keratosis, excessive wrinkling on the dorsum of hands after water immersion and worsened in summer, and remitted in winter. She was treated with topical tretinoin ointment intermittently per a diagnosis of chronic eczema at the local clinic with little improvement. The lesions gradually aggravated, and the affected area dispersed to wrists and elbows during the past 1.5 years. She attributed these changes to the need for washing hands frequently in the period of the COVID-19 epidemic. She had no family history of similar skin problems and did not have a history of hyperhidrosis, cystic fibrosis, atopy, or trauma to the hands. Physical examination showed some changes emerged on both hands after water immersion contrasting with any other condition (Figure, A and B). We took a skin biopsy specimen from white papules on the right hand, and representative histopathologic features are shown in the Figure, C and D.

### INPUT:
On the day of giving birth via a normal vaginal delivery, a healthy man in his 20s developed painful swelling on his right thigh, at the site of a methergine injection administered 1 day prior. Despite 3 days of treatment with an oral antibiotic (cefalexin), his thigh pain and swelling did not improve, and he was readmitted to the hospital and intravenous clindamycin was started. Wound cultures and blood cultures obtained during incision and drainage performed on hospital day 1 were negative for bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal organisms. The following day, his temperature was 39.4 °C (102.9 °F), blood pressure was 86/42 mm Hg, and heart rate was 131/min. He was transferred to the intensive care unit for presumed septic shock, and his antibiotics were changed to vancomycin and meropenem. Surgical debridement of the right thigh was performed on hospital day 3. On hospital day 4, a new purple dusky border developed along the wound edge, and the patient underwent a second surgical debridement. After debridement on hospital day 5, his temperature was 39.8 °C (103.6 °F), and he required vasopressor infusion with norepinephrine for shock. His right thigh had a deep 9 × 8–cm ulcer with a dusky violaceous border extending 2 to 5 cm from the wound edge (Figure, left), with many 1- to 2-mm pustules (not visible in Figure). Laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 30 000/μL (88% neutrophils); lactate level, 77.5 mg/dL (8.6 mmol/L); and procalcitonin level, 16.1 ng/mL (reference, <0.1 ng/mL). Histologic examination of the tissue obtained during the second surgical debridement revealed ulceration with extensive neutrophilic inflammation (Figure, right). Stains for microorganisms, and tissue and blood cultures, remained negative.

### INPUT:
A 65-year-old man was referred with a 6-week history of blurry vision, ocular pain, and subconjunctival yellow discoloration in the left eye. Suspicious retinal detachment and intraocular mass were identified, which raised concerns for choroidal melanoma. No symptoms or signs were reported in the right eye. His ocular history included bilateral cataract surgery 5 years prior. Review of systems yielded negative results, including for ocular trauma, jaundice, and cutaneous melanoma. He had no history of tobacco use. On examination of the left eye, visual acuity was hand motion, and intraocular pressure was 8 mm Hg. The anterior segment showed diffuse conjunctival chemosis of yellow hue, low-grade aqueous reaction, and pseudophakia (Figure 1A). On the fundus evaluation, large pockets of subretinal fluid suggested choroidal effusion based on marked fluid shifting with head position. B-scan ultrasonography confirmed 4-quadrant choroidal hemorrhage and partially mobile serous retinal detachment. B-scans also exhibited a solid lesion from the 6- to 10-o’clock meridians with irregular shape and variable internal reflectivity, measuring 5.8 mm in height. Magnetic resonance imaging was requested to delineate the mass from the surrounding clot (Figure 1B). In the interim, he received oral steroids aiming to contain the abundant exudation and topical atropine for pain, evolving with minimal clinical improvement on these features.

A 20-year-old man presented with complaints of blurred vision in his left eye over several weeks and a growing, bulging left-eye mass. His history was notable for bilateral colobomas involving the iris, optic nerve, and retina; congenital cataracts after lensectomy of the left eye; retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy of the left eye requiring a scleral buckle and silicone oil; and intractable glaucoma in the left eye requiring a superior trabeculectomy, an inferotemporal Ahmed tube implant, and multiple diode cyclophotocoagulation treatments. Because of the high risk of retinal redetachment, the silicone oil was retained throughout the glaucoma procedures. The patient presented 9 months after the last cyclophotocoagulation procedure. At presentation, he was taking dorzolamide-timolol, brimonidine, netarsudil, and latanoprost for his left eye. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/80 OD and light perception OS. Intraocular pressures (IOPs) were 11 mm Hg OD and 20 mm Hg OS. Examination of the left eye revealed a large, firm, pink subconjunctival mass inferotemporally near the Ahmed valve (Figure 1). There was a left hypertropia of more than 45° by Hirschberg test. The anterior chamber was deep with fine silicone oil bubbles superiorly. The aphakic left eye revealed a well-positioned tube. Cup-disc ratios were 0.7 OD and 0.8 OS. The retina was centrally attached under silicone oil with a stable peripheral tractional retinal detachment.

A man in his mid-20s presented with cardiogenic shock. On presentation, he was afebrile with cool extremities; his blood pressure was 75/51 mm Hg, heart rate was 147 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 99% on mechanical ventilation. His chest examination revealed bilateral coarse breath sounds and distant heart sounds. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 10% with elevated filling pressures and no significant valvular abnormalities. Owing to hemodynamic instability, the patient was given venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) with the peripheral ventricular assist device (pVAD) Impella CP (Abiomed) and was administered high-dose intravenous corticosteroids. Endomyocardial biopsy showed lymphocytic viral myocarditis. There was significant hemodynamic improvement within 48 hours; transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained and showed impressive recovery of the left ventricular function to an ejection fraction of 45%. As a result, ECMO was decannulated after 72 hours. Left pVAD support was maintained alone for another 24 hours. In the interim, his vitals remained unchanged, but the patient developed hematuria and laboratory parameters suggestive of hemolysis. Chest radiography showed pulmonary edema, and low-flow alarms sounded on the device console. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed severe mitral regurgitation (MR), and a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed to evaluate pVAD positioning (Figure and Video).

### INPUT:
A white woman in her early 80s with history of autoimmune pancreatitis, recurrent colon polyps, and benign prostatic hyperplasia developed rapid, painless vision loss of both eyes over a 2-week period 6 months after cataract surgery. Vision was 20/250 OD and 20/60 OS. The anterior segment was unremarkable in either eye, while the posterior segment examination noted 1+ vitreous cell, asteroid hyalosis, and a multilobulated, serous retinal detachment (RD) in the right eye and trace vitreous cell and a multilobulated, serous RD in the left eye. Imaging included B-scan, optical coherence tomography, and fundus autofluorescence, which revealed diffuse choroidal and ciliary body thickening, multifocal pockets of subretinal fluid, and speckled hyperautofluorescence and hypoautofluorescence in both eyes (Figure 1). No poliosis or skin changes were noted. A review of systems was unremarkable, most notably a lack of any pulmonary symptoms. A focused laboratory evaluation identified a significantly elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level and antinuclear antibody titer, but serum lysozyme, syphilis, and tuberculosis testing had negative results. To better differentiate between Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome, a lymphoproliferative disorder, or sarcoidosis as the underlying cause of the vitreous inflammation and multilobulated, serous RD in both eyes, a computed tomographic scan was performed. It showed marked lymphadenopathy throughout the mediastinum and diffuse scleral thickening in both eyes. The institute’s radiologists believed these computed tomography findings were nonspecific and could be indicative of either sarcoidosis or intraocular lymphoma.

A patient in their 50s presented with asymptomatic keratotic papules, first noticed on the left middle and ring fingers and left toe web spaces more than 10 years earlier. The papules progressed proximally over the subsequent decade to involve the forearm, arm, scapular area, ankle, shin, and thigh, but only affected the left side of the body. The patient’s face, palms, soles, and entire right side of the body were spared. The patient has a history of rosacea being treated with topical metronidazole gel for flares but was otherwise asymptomatic. The patient did not have any alopecia, night blindness, or dry eyes or skin. There was no history of any exposure to radiation or arsenic, nutritional deficiency, inflammatory skin disease, or malignant neoplasm. There was no family history of a similar condition. Examination revealed multiple, submillimeter, skin-colored to yellowish keratotic spiny projections over the aforementioned areas, only on the left side of the body (Figure, A and B). Punch biopsy from a lesion showed orthokeratosis with parakeratotic columns emerging from an epidermal invagination. The epidermis was mildly acanthotic and with a normal granular layer. There was a sparse superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. Adjacent hair follicles were unaffected (Figure, C).

### INPUT:
A White man in his 40s was referred to an outside ophthalmologist after developing nausea and a headache following a dilated eye examination. He was found to have narrow angles in both eyes and a laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) was performed in his left eye. Two weeks later he developed flickering photopsias and a temporal scotoma progressing to a “brown tint” of his vision in his left eye. His vision had decreased in his left eye and macular and optic nerve edema were noted and he was subsequently referred to us. In our clinic, his visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/50 OS, and he had normal intraocular pressure, a shallow anterior chamber but open angle in both eyes, a patent LPI in the left eye, and clear crystalline lenses in both eyes. The rest of his anterior segment was unremarkable. The posterior examination was notable for shifting subretinal fluid with choroidal detachments without retinal breaks, inflammation, or optic nerve edema and leopard spotting, while his right eye was unremarkable (Figure, A). Fluorescein angiography was unrevealing, while optical coherence tomography showed shallow subretinal fluid and an irregular and thickened choroid (Figure, B). Ultrasonography showed an axial length of 20.0 mm, thickened sclera, anteriorly rotated ciliary body, and 360° of ciliochoroidal detachments in both eyes but worse in the left eye. Results of a systemic laboratory evaluation for infectious and noninfectious disorders were unremarkable. Systemic corticosteroids failed to resolve the subretinal fluid and his vision declined.

Final diagnosis: Medication-induced orbital myositis secondary to ustekinumab.
Case report: A woman aged 57 years presented to the emergency department after 3 weeks of bilateral periorbital pain and swelling with associated headaches. She reported diplopia and pain with extraocular movement. There were no constitutional, dermatologic, or neurologic symptoms. The patient endorsed a history of Crohn disease, and her medication had been changed from infliximab to ustekinumab 6 weeks prior owing to persistent intestinal inflammation. Clinical examination revealed bilateral periorbital edema, diplopia with decreased abduction in the right eye and decreased adduction in the left eye, chemosis, proptosis, and conjunctival hyperemia (Figure 1A). Visual acuity and neurologic and fundus examination findings were otherwise normal with no sign of optic neuropathy.

**Explanation:**

After evaluating all patient information and test results, the most probable diagnosis is **medication-induced orbital myositis secondary to ustekinumab**. The patient's recent switch to ustekinumab, a known immunomodulatory medication, aligns with the onset of her symptoms. Orbital myositis is an inflammatory condition affecting the extraocular muscles, which explains her pain with extraocular movements and diplopia. The absence of systemic symptoms and normal lab findings make infections and systemic inflammatory diseases less likely. Thyroid eye disease is less probable due to the lack of thyroid dysfunction history. Other conditions like cavernous sinus thrombosis and orbital cellulitis are less likely but remain in the differential due to overlapping symptoms.","['Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology', 'Gastroenterology', 'Inflammatory Bowel Disease', 'Adverse Drug Events', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,57.0,M

### INPUT:
A man in his 40s with a medical history of multiple sclerosis consulted for the sudden development of 2 adjacent nodules on the left arm. An excision with 1-cm margins of the left arm demonstrated desmoplastic melanoma with a Breslow thickness of 1 mm, and a left axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) had been performed 3 weeks before under general anesthesia. The patient was also being treated with subcutaneous interferon beta 1a for the multiple sclerosis. Physical examination revealed 2 indurated and mobile subcutaneous nodules on the anterior surface of the arm 5 cm distal to the surgical scar, the larger of them measuring 15 mm in diameter (Figure, A) and the smaller of them measuring 4 mm. When the arm was abducted to 90°, the patient denied pain but described a subtle tightness sensation on the arm. An excisional biopsy from the larger lesion was performed (Figure, B-D).

### INPUT:
A 55-year-old woman with advanced primary open-angle glaucoma presented with 1 day of decreased vision and eye pain. She had undergone trabeculectomy and 5-fluorouracil injection 1 month prior. On initial examination, her visual acuity was 20/25. She had diffuse conjunctival hyperemia without bleb purulence or leakage and more than 50 cells per high-power field of a 1 × 1-mm area of light on slitlamp biomicroscopy. She was treated for blebitis with topical fortified antibiotics but subsequently developed vitritis. She underwent vitreous tap and injection of vancomycin and amikacin followed by pars plana vitrectomy with bleb revision. Separate vitreous samples from each procedure were sent for Gram stain and bacterial and fungal culture on chocolate and Sabouraud agar with no growth. Her eye pain worsened significantly, and ultrasound biomicroscopy showed scleral thickening (Figure 1A). Lab workup for autoimmune scleritis including tests for rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies was negative. She was admitted to the hospital and started intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam treatment. Her vision continued to decline to counting fingers because of the development of a dense cataract with retrolenticular plaque (Figure 1B).

### INPUT:
A 57-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with 5 months of epigastric pain and a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss. She had no fevers or night sweats. Physical examination was notable for oral thrush and mild epigastric tenderness. Results of a fourth-generation HIV Ab/Ag combination assay were positive, and subsequent testing showed a CD4 cell count of 16/mm3 and an HIV viral load greater than 10 million copies/mL. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis showed thickening of the walls of the stomach, duodenum, and colon as well as multiple masses in the right hepatic lobe measuring up to 6.9 cm in diameter. A core biopsy of one of the liver masses demonstrated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. She started antiretroviral therapy with bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir/alafenamide and chemotherapy with rituximab, etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (R-EPOCH). Four weeks after initiation of chemotherapy, the patient developed sudden onset of bright red blood per rectum, tachycardia, and hypotension. Mesenteric computed tomography angiography demonstrated active extravasation in the jejunum from a branch of the superior mesenteric artery. After unsuccessful coil embolization, she underwent open resection of 40 cm of distal small intestine; pathological examination of a stained section showed acute inflammation of the lamina propria, with crypt epithelial apoptosis and numerous cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusions with an “owl eye” appearance (Figure 1, left panel). Five weeks later, she developed blurred vision, and visual acuity testing revealed 20/50 vision in the left eye and 20/70 in the right eye. A dilated retinal examination revealed extensive macular hemorrhage in the left eye, with peripapillary whitening and perivascular hemorrhage with whitening along the superior vascular arcade (Figure, right panel).

### INPUT:
A man in his 20s was referred for evaluation of a 4-year history of recurrent pustular eruptions on his face, which initially presented while he was vacationing in Florida. He noted mild associated pruritus but denied burning sensation. The eruptions occurred intermittently, appearing as erythematous papules with prominent pustules, and were exacerbated by sunlight. On average, his lesions would resolve in 3 to 4 days with only mild background erythema by 5 to 7 days. Even mild sun exposure would induce the eruption, leading to frequent recurrences in summer months but long periods of remission in the fall through spring. Trials with various broad-spectrum sunscreens in combination with topical and oral antibiotics and topical ivermectin did not prevent flares or mitigate severity of eruptions when they occurred. He denied joint pain, fever, fatigue, changes in urine color, use of other topical or systemic medications, or presence of rashes elsewhere. He was otherwise healthy without other medical history. On physical examination, he was well appearing with numerous 1- to 2-mm monomorphous pustules over background erythema on the medial cheeks, chin, and nose (Figure, A). No nail fold capillary changes or mucosal lesions were observed. Serum analysis results for antinuclear, anti-SSA/Ro, and anti-SSB/La antibodies were negative. A 4-mm punch biopsy was taken from a representative lesion along the right jawline (Figure, B-D).

Final diagnosis: Vaccination-associated reactive lymphadenopathy.  
Case report: A 39-year-old healthy man without family history of malignancy found a mass in his right breast at 38 weeks of his partner's pregnancy. Prior to delivery, he underwent diagnostic ultrasound of the right breast, which showed a possible mass in the location of the palpable lesion that was most consistent with a normal island of fibroglandular tissue. Follow-up mammogram and ultrasound of the right breast (without axillary evaluation) were performed 6 months later, which showed an irregular 17-mm mass with associated pleomorphic calcifications in the same area. Ultrasound-guided biopsy was performed. Pathology showed high-grade, estrogen receptor–positive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). On postbiopsy physical examination, the patient had a palpable 2.5-cm right breast mass at the 3-o’clock position without palpable axillary lymphadenopathy. Surgical treatment with lumpectomy was recommended, and breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed prior to surgery to evaluate the extent of disease (Figure). Axial T2-weighted MRI at the level of the axilla revealed edema surrounding 2 enlarged, morphologically abnormal right level-1 axillary lymph nodes; axial postcontrast T1 fat-saturated MRI of the right breast revealed an irregular mass with irregular margins at the site of biopsy-proven DCIS. The patient reported receiving his second dose of COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) in the right arm the day before the breast MRI.

### INPUT:
A 51-year-old man presented with a 1-month history of intense and worsening polyarthralgia and swelling of bilateral fingers and toes. There was no history of alopecia, oral ulcers, rashes, or Raynaud phenomenon. He did not report preceding fever, diarrhea, or dysuria. There was no history of weight loss or anorexia. Medical history included tertiary hyperparathyroidism related to end-stage kidney disease from chronic glomerulonephritis. The patient had successfully received an ABO-incompatible kidney transplant 1 year ago, but this was complicated by invasive fungal (Volvariella volvacea) infection of the central nervous system. Medications included tacrolimus (0.5 mg twice daily), prednisolone (10 mg daily), cinacalcet (12.5 mg daily), and voriconazole (500 mg daily). On examination, his fingers and toes were symmetrically and diffusely swollen and tender. There was no rash, enthesitis, psoriatic nail changes, clubbing, or lower limb edema. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Alkaline phosphatase level was elevated at 640 U/L (10.69 μkat/L) (reference range, 40-130 U/L [0.67-2.17 μkat/L]). Corrected calcium and parathyroid hormone levels were 10.88 mg/dL (2.71 mmol/L) (reference range, 8.6-10.2 mg/dL [2.15-2.55 mmol/L]) and 23.7 pmol/L (reference range, 1.3-9.3), respectively. Serum bilirubin, aspartate transferase, alanine transferase, creatinine, and phosphate levels were within reference ranges. Free thyroxine and thyrotropin levels were normal. Results of testing for rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibody were negative. His chest radiograph was unremarkable. Radiography of his hands was performed (Figure).

A 58-year-old woman was referred for evaluation of a retinal detachment in her left eye. Her visual acuity on presentation was 20/20 in the right eye and hand motion only in the left eye. Examination of the right eye was normal. Anterior segment examination of the left eye revealed around 30 cells per high-power field of a 1 mm × 1 mm light beam and diffuse stellate-appearing keratic precipitates. Posterior examination results showed a vitreous cell that precluded a clear view of the posterior pole and inferior snow banking. Most notable was a large, white, preretinal lesion in the inferior macula and a near-total retinal detachment with no identifiable retinal break and shifting subretinal fluid (Figure).

### INPUT:
A 17-year-old previously healthy boy presented with 3 months of decreased vision in the right eye associated with throbbing pain with eye movement. The patient had no history of weakness, incontinence, or severe headaches. Initial presentation was notable for hand motion visual acuity with a 2+ relative afferent pupillary defect on the right; fundus examination revealed grade IV disc edema with obscuration of all major vessels on the disc (Figure, A). A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain with and without gadolinium contrast was degraded by motion and orthodontic artifact but was suggestive of optic nerve enhancement consistent with optic neuritis. Results of serology tests and cerebral spinal fluid analysis were negative for infectious and inflammatory etiologies, including syphilis, sarcoidosis, Lyme disease, viral etiologies, multiple sclerosis, and lupus.

### INPUT:
A 46-year-old woman presented with acute-onset weakness of her bilateral lower limbs for 3 days, accompanied by ascending numbness to just below her nipples. Three weeks prior, she had developed acute urinary retention. Neurological examination revealed weakness in bilateral lower limbs (Medical Research Council grade 4 on the right and grade 3 on the left), extensor plantar responses, and a sensory level at T6. Magnetic resonance imaging of her thoracic spine was performed 10 days after the onset of weakness and did not show any signal abnormalities or restricted diffusion. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis findings were remarkable for elevated protein (0.14 g/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10]) but white cell count (5 cells/mm3) and glucose levels (54.05 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555]) were normal. Cytology and flow cytometry were negative for malignancy. Antibodies to aquaporin 4 and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein were not detected. The patient developed a sudden worsening of weakness in her legs 2 weeks after initial presentation. Repeated thoracic spine imaging showed an area of T2 hyperintensity in the left posterolateral cord at T7, which did not enhance with contrast or show restricted diffusion (Figure 1A). Notably, she had a 4-year history of an asymptomatic papular skin eruption with more lesions developing in the last 4 months. These were distributed on the neck, trunk, and limbs, sparing her face, scalp, and genitalia (Figure 1B). Findings of extensive workup for malignancy, including full-body computed tomography scan, paraneoplastic antibody panel, and systemic autoimmune diseases (antinuclear antibody, antidouble stranded DNA, and myositis antibody panel), were negative. The skin papules were biopsied.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 30s, employed as a painter, presented with multiple painless nodules on her right cheek of 4 years’ duration. She reported episodic breathlessness, cough, and wheezing with expectoration of brownish sputum, exacerbated with exposure to hay dust, in the past 5 years. She also reported recent-onset headache while reading. Physical examination revealed a depressed plaque measuring 6 × 4 cm in the right infraorbital region, surrounded by multiple nodules of sizes ranging from 1 × 1 cm to 5 × 1 cm (Figure, A). The nodules were firm, mobile, and nontender on palpation. Local temperature was normal. There was proptosis of the right eye with mild restriction of extraocular movements on lateral gaze. Examination of the oral cavity revealed dental caries, while gingivolabial sulcus was free on bidigital examination. Nasal mucosa was normal. Respiratory system examination revealed occasional polyphonic wheeze. Chest radiography imaging showed nodular opacities in right upper zone and bronchiectasis. Punch biopsy from 1 nodule was sent for histopathological and microbiological examination (Figure, B and C).

### INPUT:
A 69-year-old woman presented with a 1-month history of progressive skin discoloration. Her medical history included chronic kidney disease, chronic hepatitis C infection, cirrhosis, ischemic cardiomyopathy with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and atrial fibrillation with prophylactic apixaban. She had recurrent staphylococcus bacteremia due to infection of an ICD lead and had been treated for the past 6 months with minocycline, 100 mg twice daily. Her arms had been purple and bruise-like for several years but turned a near black color 1 month ago. She reported no discoloration of her sweat or urine. She had no history of malnutrition and reported infrequent alcohol use. Physical examination showed dense blue-black skin pigmentation of her forearms, dorsal hands, legs, and dorsal feet, as well as blue discoloration of her sclerae and teeth (Figure 1). She had normal-colored nails and oral mucosa. Laboratory studies showed white blood cell count of 15 800/μL (reference range, 4000-11 000/μL), hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL (reference, 13.5-17.5 g/dL), platelet count of 58 000/μL (reference, 150 000-400 000/μL), and INR of 1.8 (reference, 0.8-1.1). Complete metabolic panel showed increased creatinine (1.51 mg/dL; reference, 0.64-1.27 mg/dL) and elevated total bilirubin (1.7 mg/dL; reference range, 0.3-1.2 mg/dL).

### INPUT:
A 46-year-old woman presented with a 2-week history of a persistent blurred area in her right lower visual field of both eyes. She noticed colors surrounding the dark area that lasted 2 to 3 minutes at a time and occurred multiple times per day. Her medical history was significant for dyslipidemia for which she took rosuvastatin. She also reported feeling lethargic, with polydipsia and a dull mild holocephalic headache during this period. Ophthalmological examination revealed a visual acuity of 20/20 OU, pupils were equal and reactive to light with no relative afferent pupillary defect, and color vision was normal. Dilated fundus examination was normal. Humphrey 24-2 Swedish interactive threshold algorithm fast visual field testing revealed a right homonymous hemianopia denser inferiorly (Figure, A). An urgent noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head was obtained and was normal (Figure, B). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was initially reported as normal but revealed subtle abnormal T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity involving the left occipital cortex after further review (Figure, B).

A 63-year-old man was referred by optometry after waking up with cloudy vision in the left eye and an ache around the left brow. Visual acuity was 20/20 OD and light perception OS. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 15 mm Hg OD and 54 mm Hg OS. Anterior segment examination of the left eye was remarkable for a large cystic iris stromal lesion from the 2- to 7-o’clock position with iris-cornea touch. The anterior chamber was shallow in the area of the enlarged cystic lesion with a large amount of pigmented cells. The pupil was irregular with blood at the pupillary margin. His intraocular lens was not visible because of occlusion by a cystic lesion behind the iris (Figure 1). His ocular history was notable for indiscriminate trauma to his left eye, primary open-angle glaucoma in both eyes treated with dorzolamide hydrochloride and brimonidine tartrate, and pseudophakia in both eyes. Four years prior, an inferior cystic iris stromal lesion was discovered in the left eye that measured approximately 5 × 2 mm in basal dimensions at the slitlamp. Fine-needle aspiration was negative for malignancy, and the lesion was managed by close follow-up.

A 72-year-old man presented with new-onset decreased vision in the right eye. His ocular history included pseudoexfoliation syndrome and glaucomatous optic neuropathy in the right eye. Past ocular surgery included uncomplicated trabeculectomy in the right eye treated with mitomycin C (3 months prior) and no ocular surgery history in the left eye. His medical history included pulmonary Mycobacterium avium infection secondary to hypogammaglobulinemia. Computed tomography scan 2 months prior exhibited reactivation and he started treatment with clarithromycin (1000 mg/d), ethambutol (15 mg/kg/d), and rifabutin (300 mg/d). Best-corrected visual acuity was hand motions OD and 20/20 OS. Intraocular pressures were 4 mm Hg OD and 13 mm Hg OS. Anterior segment examination of the right eye showed substantial conjunctival hyperemia and substantial cellular response in the anterior chamber (2 to 3+) along with a 1-mm hypopyon. There was no leak at the trabeculectomy bleb (negative Seidel test). B-scan ultrasonography showed no retinal detachment or mass. Presumed diagnosis of bleb-related infectious endophthalmitis was made and he was referred for treatment. Pars plana vitrectomy was performed, including vitreous sampling, and showed very light growth of Staphylococcus aureus in 1 colony on 1 plate, which was highly suspicious for contaminant. Intravitreal amikacin and vancomycin were administered after vitreous sampling was performed. Postoperatively, the patient initiated treatment with topical antibiotics and corticosteroids. His visual acuity returned to 20/30. Two months later, he presented again with a similar acute vision loss in the left eye (counting fingers). Anterior segment examination showed conjunctival hyperemia, cellular reaction, and a small hypopyon (Figure).

### INPUT:
A 42-year-old man was referred for ophthalmologic evaluation after developing blurry vision in the right eye 30 days prior. He had a history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and migraine headaches. His medications included atorvastatin, carvedilol, and norethindrone. Dilated-fundus examination of the right eye showed a single cotton-wool spot (indicating local retinal ischemia), with intraretinal hemorrhage in the inferotemporal quadrant. Ultrawide-field imaging showed a cotton-wool spot on the left fundus (Figure 1A, right) and a peripheral arterial occlusion in the right eye (Figure 1A, left), and fluorescein angiographic study of the right eye demonstrated an area of blockage corresponding to intraretinal hemorrhage and venous hyperfluorescence (Figure 1B). The patient was afebrile, with pulse 110 beats/min and blood pressure of 188/99 mm Hg. Auscultation over the heart apex revealed a holosystolic ejection murmur (grade 2/6). Laboratory testing showed normal complete blood cell count and thyrotropin level and negative results for autoantibodies against Sm, SSA, SSB, Scl-70, Jo-1, centromere, chromatin, ribonucleoprotein, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was mildly elevated (30 mm/h). Results of testing for antinuclear antibodies were positive at low titer (1:40, homogenous pattern) with positive dsDNA (5.0 IU/mL; negative if <4.0 IU/mL). Blood cultures were negative for bacterial or fungal growth after 5 days. An echocardiogram revealed pedunculated and mobile aortic valve vegetations.

### INPUT:
A 68-year-old woman presented to the clinic with bilateral eye redness and pain for the past 6 months. She had a history of dry eye disease for which she was treated with preservative-free artificial tears. She also noted a medical history of well-controlled HIV with highly active antiretroviral therapy. Her last CD 4 lymphocyte count was 750 cells/mm3 with an undetectable viral load. A review of system produced negative results, including absence of weight loss, fevers, headache, joint pain, respiratory symptoms, or skin rash. The patient reported having unprotected sexual contact with multiple female partners in the past few years. On examination, her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Intraocular pressure was 12 mm Hg OD and 14 mm Hg OS. Slitlamp examination demonstrated diffuse scleral injection in both eyes without any scleral thinning. The redness did not blanch after administration of phenylephrine, 10% (Figure 1). Both eyes appeared to be moderately tender to touch. The rest of the anterior segment examination was within normal limits without any evidence of intraocular inflammation. Dilated fundus examination was also unremarkable in both eyes.

### INPUT:
A man in his 50s with a history of nasal-type natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma (diagnosed 2 years prior; treated with pembrolizumab and methotrexate, ifosfamide, etoposide, dexamethasone, and pegaspargase) and chronic pulmonary coccidiomycosis being treated with fluconazole was admitted for fever, hypotension, and rash. Three months prior, pembrolizumab treatment was stopped because of a widespread morbilliform reaction, which had resolved completely 6 to 8 weeks before admission. The new widespread, asymptomatic skin eruption had been ongoing for 1 to 2 weeks and appeared different from his pembrolizumab reaction. A complete blood cell count was notable for a normal white blood cell count of 4100/μL, normal absolute neutrophil count of 2940/μL, chronic normocytic anemia (hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL), and chronic thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 62 ×103/μL). Blood culture results showed no growth at 1 week. Serum β-D-glucan, galactomannan, Coccidioides antibody by complement fixation, and immunodiffusion results were negative. Respiratory viral panel and SARS-CoV-2 test results were negative. Total body skin examination findings were notable for widespread, nontender, erythematous patches and thin plaques, some with prominent overlying telangiectases and hyperpigmentation (Figure, A). A punch biopsy of a representative lesion was performed (Figure, B-D).

### INPUT:
A 59-year-old woman presented with progressive hoarseness and dyspnea over a 2-month period. Fifteen months previously, she had undergone allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) with a matched related donor for treatment of fms-like tyrosine kinase (FLT3) internal tandem duplication–mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The patient had been diagnosed with chronic gastrointestinal graft-vs-host disease after a workup for diarrhea. Results of a restaging bone marrow biopsy 2 weeks prior to presentation showed no evidence of leukemia. Physical examination findings revealed no neck masses or abnormalities, but the patient was noted to be severely dysphonic and stridulous. Flexible laryngoscopy findings demonstrated a right vocal fold neoplasm crossing the posterior commissure with associated bilateral vocal fold motion impairment and obstruction of the glottic airway (Figure, A). Awake tracheostomy was performed for airway protection, and biopsy of the neoplasm was obtained via operative microlaryngoscopy (Figure, B). Histologic findings demonstrated diffuse infiltrate of large cells with irregular nuclear contours, vesicular chromatin, and prominent nucleoli (Figure, C). Immunohistochemical stains showed CD33, CD43, and CD117 positivity, with a subset positive for CD7 and myeloperoxidase. Stains were negative for CD3, CD20, and cytokeratin expression.

### INPUT:
A man in his mid-60s, who was in remission following successful combination chemotherapy for Burkitt lymphoma 8 years previously, presented with dyspnea, fatigue, general malaise, and presyncope. On examination, he was normotensive, afebrile, and clinically euvolemic. Laboratory testing showed a hemoglobin level of 12.1 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10), white blood cell count of 9900/µL (to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001), erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 76 mm/h, lactate dehydrogenase level of 139 U/L (to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167), and normal coagulation profile. Serum immunoglobulin quantitation showed normal immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgA, and IgM levels of 1590 mg/L, 303 mg/L, and 94 mg/L, respectively (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 0.01). Blood culture findings were negative. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography (Figure 1 and Video) showed a large echogenic mass on the inferior aspect of the interatrial septum with infiltration of the coronary sinus, anterior mitral valve annulus, and aortic root. The mass protruded into the left ventricular outflow tract without causing valve obstruction. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a bilobed interatrial mass measuring 5.6 × 3.1 × 3.8 cm with patchy late gadolinium enhancement of the lesion. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a left hilar mass encasing the left upper lobe bronchus with extension into the left main pulmonary artery, a nodular soft tissue lesion along the anterior nasal septum, and no abdominal or pelvic disease. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a left paraclinoid mass lesion consistent with a meningioma and right Meckel cave lesions.

### INPUT:
A 47-year-old man, with dyslipidemia, presented to the emergency department with sudden vision loss in the right eye. Visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/20 OS. Anterior segment, tonometry, and pupillary light reflex were unremarkable. Ophthalmoscopy of the right eye showed discretely blurred optic disc margins, tortuous and dilated retinal veins, and intraretinal hemorrhages in all quadrants; the left eye was unremarkable. An optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan showed a cystoid macular edema (CME) in the right eye; the left was unremarkable. Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness was 133 μm OD and 82 μm OS (reference value, 95.4 ± 10.48 μm).1 A fluorescein angiography was scheduled. One week later, the patient returned to our department due to multiple episodes of amaurosis fugax in left eye. By that time, ophthalmoscopy disclosed a mild optic disc swelling, tortuous venous vessels, and retinal hemorrhages bilaterally (Figure 1). The OCT scan showed a CME spontaneous resolution in the right eye while the left eye was unremarkable. Fluorescein angiography revealed a slight delay in venous filling but no capillary nonperfusion areas. These features were compatible with bilateral nonischemic central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), with spontaneous reperfusion in the right eye.

### INPUT:
A 13-year-old female presented to the pediatric otolaryngology clinic with a 2-year history of a right neck mass that had slowly increased in size. She denied any associated symptoms of pain, fevers, chills, malaise, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, prior history of neck masses, recent upper respiratory tract infections, or skin lesions. She was the product of a full-term pregnancy with up-to-date immunizations. Physical examination revealed a 2.5-cm firm, ovoid, mobile, and nontender mass at the apex of the posterior triangle of the right neck without any associated overlying skin changes. The remainder of the head and neck examination was unremarkable. Doppler ultrasonography revealed a 1.9 × 1.8 × 0.9-cm hypoechoic mass, and subsequent fine-needle aspirates demonstrated cells with elongated nuclei and eccentric blue cytoplasm in a background of myxoid stroma. The mass was excised in entirety without issue. At the time of surgery, the deep surface of the mass was found to be adherent to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The lesion was resected with a cuff of muscle and sent for permanent histopathological examination. This revealed proliferation of bland spindle cells with plump nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged as loose fascicles in a background of myxoid stroma (Figure 1). These cells were positive for mucin 4 (MUC4), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and transducing-like enhancer of split 1 (TLE1) immunohistochemical stains. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed a positive FUS (16p11) gene rearrangement.

### INPUT:
A 45-year-old man was referred to the medical retina service for evaluation of bilateral macular atrophy noted by his general ophthalmologist. Medical history was positive for bilateral sensorineural hearing loss with cochlear origin as determined by an otolaryngologist and headache since age 35 years. He had no history of longer-term use of medications. There was no family history of hearing and vision loss in all immediate family members. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/63 OS. His pupils were round and reactive. The anterior segment was unremarkable. Fundus examination confirmed the presence of bilateral macular atrophy. Fundus autofluorescence revealed a fairly symmetric loss of autofluorescence in the macula and in the regions surrounding the optic disc (Figure). In proximity of these areas of reduced autofluorescence, a speckled fundus autofluorescence pattern of alternating spots of increased and decreased autofluorescence was also noted. Optical coherence tomography displayed the presence of a bilateral atrophy of the outer retina and retinal pigment epithelium (Figure). The patient’s family underwent a complete ophthalmologic evaluation, which did not display any alteration.

### INPUT:
A man in his 20s with a history of daily soft contact lens (CL) wear was referred by his local ophthalmologist for a recalcitrant central corneal ulcer in his left eye. He had no history of eye trauma, did not sleep in his CLs, and stopped using CLs at symptom onset. Of note, he had recently been swimming in a freshwater lake prior to the onset of the ulcer. He was initially treated with topical besifloxacin and followed up daily. He appeared to improve clinically with resolution of his epithelial defect after 3 days, and topical loteprednol was added. Results of initial corneal cultures were negative. One week later, he presented with worsening pain and vision, which prompted referral to our cornea clinic where, 2 weeks after his initial presentation, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/150 OS. Left-eye examination demonstrated diffuse microcystic corneal edema and stromal thickening with no Descemet membrane folds (Figure 1A). A 2 × 2-mm stromal opacity was noted paracentrally with no epithelial defects. The anterior chamber demonstrated 1+ cell. Intraocular pressure was 17 mm Hg OS. Corneal cultures for bacteria, fungi, and acanthamoeba were repeated, and in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) was performed on the stromal infiltrate (Figure 1B). After reviewing the IVCM images, what empirical treatment would you recommend while awaiting the results of the repeated corneal cultures?

### INPUT:
A 53-year-old woman received a diagnosis of stage IV melanoma with metastatic disease to the spine and brain 3 months before presentation. Four weeks following receipt of immunotherapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab, she developed acute abdominal pain in the setting of a rapidly rising lactic acid dehydrogenase levels, prompting hospital admission. Imaging results showed mild disease progression (new ascites and periportal metabolic lymph node). Splenic infarct and portal/splenic vein thrombi were identified as etiologies of her acute pain and were presumed to be secondary to hypercoagulable state of malignancy. Over the next 3 days, she had rising serum creatinine (sCr) levels (baseline, approximately 1 mg/dL [to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4]). The initial workup included ultrasonography and urinalysis. Ultrasonography results showed abnormal intraparenchymal flow to both kidneys without evidence of kidney artery stenosis. Urine studies were consistent with prerenal etiology, while the presence of casts suggested acute tubular necrosis. Nephrotoxic medications (omeprazole/pantoprazole) were discontinued. The top differential diagnoses at this juncture included contrast-induced nephropathy or immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)–induced acute interstitial nephritis, and empirical high dose steroids were prescribed. Despite observation and steroid treatment, her sCr levels continued to increase over the next 5 days, peaking at 5.8 mg/dL, and the patient progressed into anuric kidney failure, requiring hemodialysis. This prompted a kidney biopsy for definitive diagnosis (Figure). One week later, she received encorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor. Two weeks later, the patient’s kidney function began to improve, and hemodialysis was discontinued. She continued to show gradual improvement, with a return to near baseline kidney function (sCr level, 1.3 mg/dL) approximately 6 weeks after treatment initiation.

A 71-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis and type 2 diabetes presented to the otolaryngology team with 6 weeks’ history of pain and ulcers in the pharynx. She also complained of nasal regurgitation. She denied having any systemic symptoms. She took linagliptin, valsartan, and 15 mg of methotrexate weekly. She was a nonsmoker and consumed very little alcohol. Clinical examination including flexible nasendoscopy revealed multiple shallow ulcers on the posterior wall of the nasopharynx. There was a large defect involving the entire soft palate on the left. There was no obvious mass or any exophytic lesion. The edges of the soft palate defect were smooth and clean (Figure 1). There were no cranial nerve palsies. There was no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Findings of the remaining head and neck examinations were normal.

### INPUT:
A man in his 70s was referred to the dermatology department by the rheumatology department with concerns for vasculitis of the bilateral lower legs. He had been healthy until 6 years earlier when he had suddenly developed peripheral neuropathy, with subsequent workup revealing a diagnosis of immunoglobulin M (IgM) monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. His symptoms had rapidly progressed during the past few months. In addition to worsening neuropathy, he had developed fatigue, weight loss, and sudden altered mental status. An ischemic stroke was identified. The patient was hospitalized, and extensive diagnostic examinations and procedures were completed. A lymphoproliferative disorder with plasmocytic differentiation was detected in a bone marrow biopsy specimen, which together with the monoclonal IgM paraproteinemia was consistent with Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM). Weeks later, the patient developed an asymptomatic rash of his lower legs. A physical examination revealed several bright red, nonblanchable, pinpoint macules of the bilateral lower legs (Figure, A). An antinuclear antibody test result was positive (titer 1:320, diffuse pattern). Other laboratory testing procedures (ie, complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, anti-Sjogren syndrome [SS]-A and SS-B, anti–double-stranded DNA, complement [C]3 and C4, homocysteine, β-2-glycoprotein, anticardiolipin, lupus anticoagulant, and vitamin C) returned normal. A punch biopsy of the right lower leg was performed for further diagnostic evaluation (Figure, B-D).

Final diagnosis: Anodal capture.
Case report: A woman in her early 70s with a history of permanent atrial fibrillation treated with atrioventricular junction ablation and biventricular pacemaker implantation was hospitalized with decompensated heart failure and acute kidney injury. Her history was notable for nonischemic cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 40% and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, for which she underwent single-lung transplant 9 years prior. Following diuresis and medical optimization, repeated echocardiogram showed a newly depressed ejection fraction (30%). Her electrocardiogram (ECG) was notable for alternating QRS morphologies (Figure 1A). The left ventricular (LV) pacing vector was programmed from LV tip to right ventricular (RV) lead ring. During pacemaker threshold testing, a change in QRS morphology was observed as the output was reduced (Figure 1B). Chest radiography revealed severe right pulmonary fibrosis leading to ipsilateral mediastinal shift and pacemaker lead position unchanged from implantation.

A 47-year-old woman with melanoma and a history of papillary thyroid cancer treated with thyroidectomy presented with 1 week of low-grade fevers, myalgias, and proximal muscle weakness. Three months earlier, she underwent digital amputation of her right third finger and began adjuvant nivolumab treatment for stage IIIC acral-lentiginous melanoma. One week later, she developed fevers, myalgias, dark urine, weakness, and difficulty walking. She had no palpitations, chest pain, or shortness of breath. On examination, her blood pressure was 135/86 mm Hg, pulse 78/min, and she was afebrile. She had reduced strength in bilateral proximal shoulders (3/5), elbow flexors/extensors (3/5), and forearm flexors/extensors (4+/5). No rashes were noted. Laboratory studies demonstrated a creatine kinase (CK) level of 111 859 U/L (reference range, 30-220 U/L), CK-MB of 270 ng/mL (reference, <8 ng/mL), and aldolase above 500 U/L (reference, <7.7 U/L). Aspartate aminotransferase level was 1980 U/L (reference range, 15-41 U/L), alanine aminotransferase was 814 U/L (reference range, 14-54 U/L), creatinine was 4.9 mg/dL (reference range, 0.4-1.0 mg/dL) with a previously normal baseline, and potassium was 6.4 mmol/L (reference range, 3.5-5.0 mmol/L). Urinalysis showed 27 red blood cells (reference range, 0-5) and myoglobin above 5000 µg/L (reference, 0 µg/L). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 67 mm/h (reference, <20 mm/h) and C-reactive protein was 10.2 mg/dL (reference, ≤0.60 mg/dL).

### INPUT:
A 58-year-old woman with a history of hypertensive retinopathy presented with acute-onset, painless vision loss in her right eye accompanied by tinnitus and severe intermittent headaches. Her extraocular movements were full, and she had no other neurologic deficits. Her visual acuity was 20/400 OD and 20/30 OS, respectively, and her fundi were notable for bilateral optic nerve edema. Results of recent computed tomography and angiography of the head and neck and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits were reportedly normal, and lumbar puncture revealed an opening pressure of 26 cm H2O (normal range, 6 to 25 cm H2O) with elevated protein. The patient was given acetazolamide and referred to neuro-ophthalmology. On examination by neuro-ophthalmology 4 months later, her visual acuity was 20/50 OD and 20/20 OS. She had an afferent pupillary defect in the right eye, and Humphrey visual fields (24-2) showed binasal inferior defects with a superior defect in the right eye that was considered an artifact of testing. According to the Ishihara color plates test, color vision was full in both eyes. Fundus examination was remarkable for pallor of both optic nerves, more notably in the right eye, without edema (Figure 1). Findings of screening for antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, angiotensin-converting enzyme, Bartonella, HIV, tuberculosis (Quantiferon), Treponema pallidum, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and a complete blood cell count were normal.

Case report: A 64-year-old man with a history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, HIV infection, coronary artery disease, and squamous cell carcinoma of the left mandible treated with composite resection, left neck dissection, and fibula free flap (FFF) reconstruction followed by postoperative radiotherapy presented with sharp, shooting left neck pain. Beginning 5 months after his reconstruction, the patient reported point tenderness on the left jaw, facial swelling, and electric pain with severity of 7 out of 10 in the left neck that occurred with talking or eating. His postoperative course was complicated by osteoradionecrosis post-tracheostomy, plate removal, and left segmental mandibulectomy. He received regular physical therapy and lymphedema therapy and was seen by Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, who treated him with onabotulinum toxin A injections; neither provided significant resolution of his symptoms. Review of a computed tomography scan of the head and neck (Figure 1) performed on follow-up 5 years after initial reconstruction demonstrated a long, hyperdense structure in the left submental, submandibular region with accompanying soft-tissue thickening. On further review of prior imaging, this calcification appeared as a new finding in various scans dating back to 5 months after FFF reconstruction compared with preoperative imaging. There was no fluorodeoxyglucose avidity in the area of question on multiple positron emission tomography scans done during this follow-up window.

A 66-year-old woman presented with multiple progressive ulcers on the right side of her face that had developed over the past 3 months (Figure, A). She had also experienced a burning sensation on the right side of her face, but denied headache, shoulder, or jaw pain and visual disturbance. Neurological examination revealed hypoesthesia of the right side of the face, while cold-warm sensation and motor function were intact. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 82 mm per hour (normal value, less than 15 mm per hour) and the serum C–reactive protein concentration was 107 mg/L (normal value, less than 5 mg/L). Chest radiography showed bilateral perihilar infiltrates consistent with pneumonia. About 2 weeks before the ulcerations developed, the patient had been admitted to the hospital for unstable angina, and coronary angiography was performed. Immediately after the angiography, the patient developed left-sided hemiplegia and hemianopsia. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed an extensive ischemic posterior circulation stroke involving the right occipital lobe, lower cerebellar peduncle, and pontomedullary boundary (Figure, B).

### INPUT:
A 47-year-old woman presented with gradual onset of blurry vision in both eyes for several months. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/40 OS. Intraocular pressure was 23 mm Hg in both eyes and was more than 21 mm Hg in both eyes on multiple visits. Medical history included hypertension, obesity, left adrenalectomy, and pterygium excision surgery in the left eye. The patient denied previous episodes of blurry vision, history of corticosteroid use, sleep apnea, or type-A personality. Complete review of systems was otherwise negative. Amsler grid testing revealed paracentral metamorphopsia in both eyes. Extraocular motility, pupillary light reactions, and confrontational visual fields were normal. Slitlamp examination and gonioscopy results were normal in both eyes. An external photograph of the patient is shown in Figure 1A. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated multiple areas of late pinpoint leakage and patches of mottled hyperfluorescence in both eyes (Figure 1B).

Final diagnosis: Foveal retinoschisis with epiretinal membrane in the setting of pathologic myopia.
Case report: A man in his 50s with hypertension who was otherwise in good health presented for new ophthalmologic evaluation in the setting of mild, long-standing blurred vision with slight metamorphopsia in the right eye. He had a history of high myopia (approximately 9 diopters [D] OD; 8 D OS). Examination revealed an otherwise normal left eye with 20/20 best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). The right eye demonstrated a BCVA of 20/25 and normal anterior segment, including lenticular examination. Dilated fundus examination showed wrinkling of the neurosensory retina at the fovea (Figure 1A) without posterior vitreous detachment. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography revealed hyperreflective layering on the foveal surface consistent with epiretinal membrane, as well as splitting of the outer plexiform layer with hyporeflective cavities (Figure 1B).

A previously healthy man in his early 70s was referred to our emergency department with exertional dyspnea. He reported recent physical and emotional stress from work and dizziness 2 days prior to presentation. He denied fever or palpitations. His blood pressure was 84/59 mm Hg. A harmonic, musical systolic murmur was heard at the left third intercostal space. An electrocardiogram (ECG; Figure 1A) showed diffuse ST-segment elevation, most prominently in the anterior precordial leads. Laboratory evaluation revealed elevated levels of troponin (1.33 ng/mL; normal range: ≤0.016 ng/mL [to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1.0]), brain natriuretic peptide (376.5 pg/mL; normal range: ≤18.4 pg/mL [to convert to nanograms per liter, multiply by 1.0]), creatinine phosphokinase (96 U/L; normal range: 41-153 U/L), and D-dimer (0.68 μg/mL; normal range: ≤1.00 μg/mL [to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 5.476]). Echocardiography showed left ventricular (LV) wall-motion abnormalities involving the mid and apical segments and an LV apical mass with protruding features. Noncontrast computed tomography confirmed the high-density LV mass (Figure 1B). Coronary angiography revealed mild to moderate coronary atherosclerosis without obstructive coronary artery disease.

### INPUT:
A 13-year-old girl with an unsteady gait was referred for evaluation. She had been well until 1 month prior, when she developed lower limb weakness after eating a vegetarian diet for 15 days. Her medical and family histories were unremarkable. Her walking had become unsteady, and she was less talkative. On examination, she scored 24 on a Mini-Mental State Examination, with impairments in temporal and spatial orientation, calculation, and short-term memory. Horizontal nystagmus was observed. Her lower limb strength was 4 of 5 proximally and 5− of 5 distally, with increased muscle tone. Patellar reflexes were brisk. Ankle clonus and Babinski signs were present bilaterally. Her gait was spastic (Video). Blood test results indicated normocytic anemia (hemoglobin level, 126 g/L; reference, >130 g/L [to convert to grams per deciliter, multiply by 0.1]), borderline folate elevation (2.15 ng/mL; reference, >2 μg/L [to convert nanomoles per liter, multiply by 2.266]), and an increased homocysteine level (8.85 mg/L; reference, <2.03 mg/L [to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 7.397]). Results of stool analysis; liver and kidney function tests; myocardial enzyme, electrolyte, ammonia, trace element, and B12 levels; thyroid function, arterial blood gas, antinuclear antibodies, and intrinsic factor antibody tests; and an infection panel test were unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging showed mild cerebral atrophy and a hyperintense T2-weighted signal in the cervical spinal cord. Electromyography results were normal. Electroencephalography showed diffuse background slowing with scattered epileptiform discharges. Urine organic acid analysis indicated methylmalonic acidemia. A serum amino acid analysis was nondiagnostic (Figure 1). Cerebrospinal fluid was normal.

A 37-year-old woman with no history of vision problems presented with subacute loss of vision in her right eye for 1 week. The patient described a paracentral scotoma that progressed to involve central fixation over the course of 3 days. Two weeks earlier, the patient and her children had developed malaise, low-grade fever, and a rash. She worked in the armed services and denied foreign travel, tick bites, or recent immunization. The patient had been evaluated by her primary care clinician and was referred to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation. On examination, her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/70 OD and 20/20 OS. Test results of intraocular pressures, ocular motility, and pupillary reactions were normal. Confrontation visual fields showed inferonasal and central defects in the right eye. External examination revealed a macular rash of the scalp and all 4 extremities, including the soles and palms (Figure 1A). Anterior segment examination was normal. Posterior segment examination revealed irregular, gray-white pigmentation of the temporal macula of the right eye without vitritis, optic nerve edema, or vasculitis (Figure 1B). Ocular coherence tomography (OCT) revealed focal, heterogenous disruption of the inner segment ellipsoid zone without neurosensory detachment. Fluorescein angiography showed late staining at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) superotemporal to the fovea. Findings from a dilated fundus examination were normal in the left eye.

A White man in his late 50s with a medical history of osteoporosis, hyperlipidemia, and migraines presented with hematuria. Results of computed tomography (CT) imaging showed an 8×6×5-cm right kidney lesion (Figure 1, A). The patient underwent surgical resection with a right nephrectomy and an apparent diagnosis of angiomyolipoma (AML). One year later, the patient underwent excision of a right iliac wing lesion, and pathologic findings demonstrated xanthoma of bone with sclerosis. Three years after this second surgery, he presented with new abdominal pain. Results of CT imaging revealed a 4.3-cm retrocaval mass at the level of the renal right vein. He underwent surgical resection, and results of pathologic evaluation were consistent with the original tumor. Follow-up CT imaging revealed a 1.2-cm left upper lobe lung nodule and a 0.8-cm right upper lobe lung nodule, as well as a pulmonary embolism and a left 6th rib fracture. These lesions were fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography avid. The patient denied constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, fever, chills, and night sweats. He underwent bilateral video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery wedge resections of the lung lesions, which were also consistent with the primary tumor. Five years later, the patient (now in his late 60s) presented with multiple left pleural-based lung lesions (Figure 1, B). Results of all laboratory testing were within reference ranges. These pleural-based lesions were resected with left video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery partial pleurectomy, and results of pathologic evaluation were positive for HMB45 and Melan-A.

### INPUT:
A 42-year-old man (height, 160 cm; weight, 50 kg) presented with a 3-month history of a clicking sensation and painful swallowing, mainly on the right side, with a sudden onset. He had consulted other physicians, but the cause could not be identified. The symptoms gradually exacerbated, seriously deteriorating his quality of life and causing a 5-kg weight loss. He also experienced insomnia and depression. Antidepressants and psychotherapy, prescribed under the suspicion of a psychogenic cause, did not alleviate his symptoms. He had no relevant medical history and no smoking or drinking history. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological findings were unremarkable. A careful physical examination, with palpation of the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage region on swallowing, revealed a clear clicking movement and right-sided friction with accompanying pain. However, results of laryngoscopy and other common imaging studies showed no pathology. Hence, to assess the dynamic structural changes during swallowing, we performed swallowing dynamic computed tomography (SD-CT), which can reveal moving structures by creating a dynamic-volume data set during swallowing.1,2 Comparison of the reconstructed SD-CT images at rest (Figure 1A) and on swallowing (Figure 1B) revealed that the superior thyroid notch and the right superior border of the thyroid cartilage contacted the hyoid bone internally during maximum laryngeal elevation on swallowing.

A 26-year-old woman presented with reduced visual acuity in both eyes since early childhood. She had short stature (1.52 m [−3.6 SD]) and progeroid appearance. Her parents and brother had normal stature. Her medical history was significant for frequent upper respiratory tract infections since infancy. She had no intellectual disability, neurologic symptoms, or hearing impairment. There was no family history of visual impairment or neurologic disorders. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/80 OD and 20/50 OS. Intraocular pressure was normal. She could not identify any Ishihara color plate. Slitlamp examination was unremarkable. Dilated fundus examination results showed diffuse optic atrophy (OA) and fine pigmentary mottling changes at the fovea in both eyes (Figure 1A). Electroretinography (ERG) showed normal dark-adapted responses and severely reduced light-adapted responses. Optical coherence tomography showed thinning of retinal nerve fiber layers and disruption of outer nuclear layers and the ellipsoid zone at the center of the fovea (Figure 1B).

A 65-year-old woman presented with worsening right eye pain and purulent discharge. She reported being hit in the face by a tree branch several days prior. Her medical history was notable for HIV, with a last known CD4 lymphocyte count of 112 cells/mm3 and variable adherence to antiretroviral therapy. At an outside hospital, cultures were obtained, and treatment was initiated with ofloxacin eye drops, 0.3%, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride ointment, 0.3%, and oral moxifloxacin hydrochloride, 400 mg daily. Her symptoms worsened, and she was referred 3 days later for further evaluation. On examination, visual acuity in the right eye was hand motions. The left eye examination results were unremarkable. Slitlamp examination was limited by patient discomfort but revealed purulent discharge, a markedly inflamed conjunctiva, diffuse cornea opacification and thinning, and a flat anterior chamber. Given the history of tree branch trauma, the patient was brought to the operating room. Intraoperatively, a 0.5-mm corneal perforation was identified within an area of thinning (Figure, A). Microbial cultures were repeated, and corneal glue was applied. Gram stain of the purulent discharge demonstrated numerous polymorphonuclear leukocytes only. All subsequent microbiology cultures were negative. Despite treatment with topical fortified vancomycin, 25 mg/mL, tobramycin, 13.3 mg/mL, intravenous levofloxacin, 750 mg daily, and doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily, the purulent conjunctivitis and corneal stromal necrosis did not improve (Figure, B).

### INPUT:
A 67-year-old man with fibromyalgia presented with sequential bilateral vision loss. Vision decreased suddenly in the right eye 3 to 4 weeks prior and in the left eye 5 days prior. He reported left-sided scalp tenderness; jaw claudication; neck, shoulder, and low back pain; and a recent 6.8-kilogram weight loss. Visual acuity was 20/200 in the right eye (OD) and hand motion in the left eye (OS). He had a left relative afferent pupillary defect, moderate dry-eye syndrome, and mild cataracts. The right optic nerve had a cup-disc ratio of 0.55 with temporal pallor and mild optic disc edema, and the left nerve had a cup-disc ratio of 0.50 with mild edema without pallor. Bilateral arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy was suspected. Expedited evaluation and treatment of giant cell arteritis (GCA) was pursued. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated at 61 mm/h, whereas C-reactive protein (CRP), hemoglobin, and platelet levels were normal. He was hospitalized for empirical treatment with 1 g of intravenous methylprednisolone sodium succinate daily for 5 days. Results of a left temporal artery biopsy (TAB) were negative for GCA. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits showed abnormal signal and contrast enhancement within the intraorbital midportion of both optic nerves (Figure 1A and B) as well as incidental parotid gland cysts bilaterally (Figure 1C). He was discharged and was taking oral prednisone anhydrous, 60 mg daily. One month later the patient had improvement in visual acuity to 20/50 OD and 20/25 OS.

A 54-year-old man with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and migraines presented to a tertiary care otolaryngology clinic reporting 3 months of worsening right ear pain and 1 month of pulsatile tinnitus and hearing loss. He denied a history of fever, otorrhea, prior ear infections, vertigo, or otologic surgery. The patient first saw his primary care physician, who visualized a mass in the right ear canal and attempted needle aspiration, which led to self-resolved bleeding. He was given ciprofloxacin ear drops and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, which did not improve his symptoms. On examination, his right external auditory canal (EAC) was completely obstructed by a fleshy, pulsatile mass with a red hue (Figure 1A). Results of Weber tuning fork examination lateralized to the right ear and a Rinne examination suggested a conductive hearing loss. Formal audiogram results confirmed conductive hearing loss in the right ear and type B tympanometry, which was indicative of poor eardrum mobility. Computed tomography (CT) of the temporal bone without contrast showed a well-circumscribed 9-mm lesion in the EAC with bony erosion along the junction of the anterior wall and floor (Figure 1, B and C). Magnetic resonance imaging results showed a well-circumscribed, contrast-enhancing mass that was confined to the EAC (Figure 1D).

### INPUT:
A woman in her mid-50s with a medical history significant for pulmonary embolism 10 years prior (previously receiving anticoagulation therapy) presented to the emergency department with 10 days of progressively worsening, sharp, nonradiating chest pain. The pain was present at rest, 7 of 10 in severity, and worse with inspiration. She experienced concomitant exertional shortness of breath, dry cough, and lightheadedness. Her cardiac history was otherwise unremarkable. Family history was notable for breast cancer in her mother and her sister, but no known inherited hypercoagulable disorders. In the emergency department, her vital signs were as follows: temperature 37.0 °C, blood pressure 130/76 mm Hg, heart rate 97/min, respiratory rate 16/min, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. Physical examination results were unremarkable, with no cardiac murmurs, rubs, pulmonary crackles, jugular venous distention, or lower extremity edema. Laboratory test results were remarkable for an elevated D-dimer level, an elevated C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a mildly elevated pro-BNP level, but normal levels of troponin and procalcitonin. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with evidence of right heart strain, and a computed tomography angiogram of the chest demonstrated an occlusive pulmonary embolism of the left main pulmonary artery and several peripheral consolidations in the left lower lung field consistent with infarction. The patient started anticoagulation therapy with intravenous heparin. A subsequent echocardiogram revealed bowing of the interventricular septum into the left ventricle and a very large (6.6 × 4.1-cm), mobile, nonhomogeneous, pedunculated mass straddling the tricuspid valve and moving between the right atrium and right ventricle (Figure 1 and Video).

### INPUT:
A 55-year-old woman was referred to the eye clinic for unilateral uveitis and 2 days of sudden vision loss in her right eye. She reported experiencing light sensitivity and mild eye pain. She was in otherwise good health without any chronic medical problems. She reported receiving anticoagulation therapy in the past for a mitral valve problem. Her visual acuity was 20/200 OD and 20/20 OS. The examination of the left eye was unremarkable. Slitlamp examination of her right eye revealed 3+ anterior chamber inflammation with vitreous cells. An examination of the dilated fundus showed optic nerve edema with an overlying white infiltrate. In addition, there was inferior retinal whitening consistent with an artery occlusion (Figure 1A). The whitening was attributable to inner retina ischemia, with sparing in the distribution of the cilioretinal artery. An inferior hemicentral retinal artery occlusion was confirmed on intravenous fluorescein angiography (Figure 1B). No embolus was noted at any retinal artery branch points. Notably, a dog bit the patient’s hand 2 months before presentation. Since that time, the patient developed a persistent cough, night sweats, and low-grade fevers that were treated unsuccessfully with 2 courses of oral antibiotics.

### INPUT:
A 72-year-old man with metastatic, well-differentiated, small intestinal neuroendocrine tumor (NET) presented for routine follow-up in September 2020 with worsening fatigue and flushing. He was initially diagnosed with metastatic involvement of the liver, bone, and intra-abdominal lymph nodes in 2015 and received 3 treatments with peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) in 2017. After 2 years of disease stability he was retreated with PRRT in November 2019 because of radiographic progression of disease and worsening symptoms. A third dose of PRRT was given in March 2020; a fourth was deferred owing to persistent thrombocytopenia after treatment. Gallium 68 dotatate positron emission tomography–computed tomography in July 2020 revealed stable disease (Figure, A).

### INPUT:
A woman in her 60s presented to our dermatology outpatient department with a 5-year history of pruritic papules on the right side of her lower back. She was otherwise healthy, with no family history of a similar condition. Physical examination results showed multiple dome-shaped, skin-colored, firm papules on her right lower back, arranged in a blaschkoid distribution (Figure 1A). The lesions varied in size, with some coalescing into irregular-shaped, larger papules. Telangiectasis could be seen on some of the lesions. A skin biopsy was performed on her back and submitted for further histopathologic analysis (Figure 1B and C).

### INPUT:
A 50-year-old man presented with left eye redness and headaches for 2 months. Results from a previous computed tomographic scan of the head were unremarkable. He denied ocular disease, trauma, or surgery. He had no medical problems aside from chronic back pain due to a herniated disc. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/25 OS. Intraocular pressure, extraocular motility, and pupillary examination results were normal. The right eye was unremarkable. Examination of the left eye showed 2 temporal scleral nodules with surrounding hyperemia and no scleromalacia. He experienced substantial pain with palpation. Posterior examination results were unremarkable. The results of the following laboratory tests were all unremarkable: tuberculosis interferon-γ release assay, rapid plasma reagin, fluorescent treponemal antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and angiotensin-converting enzyme. The rheumatoid factor level (18 IU/mL [normal range, <14 IU/mL]) and C-reactive protein level (26 mg/L [normal range, 0-5 mg/L]) were elevated. In addition, Lyme IgG, IgM, and reflex Western blot assays were positive for antibodies. The patient denied travel to Lyme-endemic regions, tick bites, or rashes. The patient started oral prednisone therapy for possible rheumatoid arthritis (RA)–associated nodular scleritis, doxycycline therapy for positive Lyme studies, and was referred to a rheumatologist for further RA evaluation. Two weeks after presentation and initiation of oral prednisone therapy, the patient noted improvement in pain, but the scleral nodules and hyperemia persisted. Therefore, subconjunctival triamcinolone acetonide (0.5 mL of 40 mg/mL) was administered to the left eye. Further confirmatory RA workup by rheumatology did not reveal other systemic findings thought to be associated with RA on review of symptoms or clinical examination. The patient's back pain was associated with his herniated disc. Subsequently, the patient’s examination results showed new scleral thinning of the left eye with persistence of the scleral nodules (Figure 1).

### INPUT:
A 73-year-old woman was referred to our service for assessment of a slow-growing conjunctival lesion in the left eye. She had first noticed left eye discomfort and a fullness of the left lower eyelid 3 months previously. She denied any vision or systemic symptoms. Her ophthalmic history was noncontributory. The patient’s medical history was notable only for prostate carcinoma, which was treated with radiotherapy 12 years ago. On examination, her visual acuities were 20/25 OU. Slitlamp examination of the anterior segment revealed diffuse yellow-pink polypoidal papules affecting the inferior fornix and inferior palpebral conjunctiva of the left eye (Figure 1A). The upper palpebral conjunctiva in the left eye had a velvety yellow appearance (Figure 1B). The remainder of the examination of both eyes was unremarkable. Initial investigations, including a complete blood cell count, urinalysis, and measurement of inflammatory markers, kidney function, and prostate-specific antigen level, were within normal limits. Serum electrophoresis showed raised monoclonal IgM bands (7.25 g/L; reference range, 0.50-2.00 g/L) with a κ/λ light-chain ratio of 2.92 (reference range, 0.260-1.65).

### INPUT:
An 89-year-old asymptomatic man presented to a new eye care professional for a routine examination. Examination findings showed a large choroidal mass in the left eye suspicious for a malignant neoplasm. The patient’s ocular history showed a cataract surgical procedure, YAG capsulotomy, and subsequent repair of retinal detachment with scleral buckle and pneumatic retinopexy in the left eye approximately 30 years earlier. Ophthalmoscopic examination results of the left eye revealed a peripheral retinal atrophy from previous cryotherapy treatment. A large choroidal mass was observed in the inferotemporal region. The patient was referred for further evaluation of the mass, which was suspected to represent choroidal melanoma. Our examination findings showed a visual acuity of 20/20 OD and 20/60 OS, with intraocular pressures of 20 mm Hg OD and 16 mm Hg OS measured using a tonometer (Tono-pen; Reichert Inc). Ophthalmoscopy results of the right eye were normal. In the left eye, a 360° encircling band with overlying retinal atrophy was documented. There was a variably pigmented, abruptly elevated mass deep in the inferotemporal retina, measuring 12.0 mm in diameter (Figure, A) and without overlying drusen, orange pigment, or subretinal fluid. Ultrasonography results showed that the mass was dome shaped and echodense, with posterior shadowing (Figure, B); it measured 4.6 mm thick. Optical coherence tomographic imaging revealed an intact macula.

### INPUT:
A 39-year-old male patient with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and bone metastases presented in April 2020 with lower back pain, which was aggravated while standing and walking. He reported no known trauma, and no motor or sensory deficits were noted during clinical examination. He had no fever. After the initial sarcoma diagnosis in September 2018, the patient received 8 cycles of doxorubicin hydrochloride and ifosfamide along with regional hyperthermia, followed by good tumor response. The patient had a history of a pathological fracture of L4, which had been treated with radiotherapy and vertebroplasty in November 2019 and remained unchanged on imaging obtained in April 2020. The treatment regimen recently had been switched to gemcitabine hydrochloride and docetaxel in January 2020 following osseous progression during maintenance chemotherapy with trofosfamide, idarubicin hydrochloride, and etoposide. On restaging computed tomography, symmetrical enlargement of both psoas muscles was observed with intramuscular hypodensity (Figure, A). The patient reported lower back pain but no motor or sensory deficits. Further workup with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed extensive, nearly symmetrical swelling in both psoas muscles and sharply delineated, peripheral contrast enhancement of the fascia with strict horizontal bounds (Figure, B and C).

Case report: A patient in their late 70s with a history of Crohn disease, coronary artery disease, hypercholesterolemia, and transient ischemic attack presented with sudden, painless, left-sided vision loss. He denied headache, scalp tenderness, and jaw claudication. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 103 mm/h and a magnetic resonance angiographic examination of the brain was negative for mass, infarction, and hemorrhage. Examination results of a right, superficial, temporal artery biopsy specimen showed chronic, nongranulomatous inflammation surrounding adventitial vessels and extensive subintimal fibrosis, without giant cells or segmental loss of the internal elastic lamina, which was interpreted as compatible with temporal arteritis. High-dose corticosteroid therapy was initiated (1 g methylprednisolone intravenously for 3 days followed by 60 mg/d of oral prednisone). A neuro-ophthalmologic examination performed 1 week later showed an unreactive left pupil with an obvious relative afferent pupillary defect. Optic nerve pallor concomitant with edema and a single flame-shaped hemorrhage at the 4-o’clock position on the disc margin was also observed. Two weeks later, persistent elevation of the ESR and C-reactive protein levels, despite continued oral prednisone therapy, prompted a review of the temporal artery biopsy findings. This disclosed abundant transmural deposits of amorphous eosinophilic acellular material that was congophilic and exhibited apple-green birefringence under polarized light, consistent with amyloid deposits (Figure). Immunohistochemical staining showed IgM and λ light chain restriction.

### INPUT:
A previously healthy, middle-aged patient presented with rapidly increasing shortness of breath despite empirical antibiotic treatment for presumed pneumonia. A computed tomographic image of the chest was notable for diffuse, ground-glass opacities. An infectious disease workup was unrevealing, and the patient was diagnosed with acute-on-chronic respiratory failure resulting from dermatomyositis-associated interstitial lung disease. Progressive hypoxia refractory to mechanical ventilation necessitated venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) using the ProtekDuo dual-lumen cannula (LivaNova). In its standard configuration, deoxygenated blood is drained from the right atrium while oxygenated blood is ejected into the main pulmonary artery, and the device serves as both a right ventricular support and an ECMO (RVS-ECMO) cannula. End-stage lung disease was established and, as part of a lung transplant evaluation, the patient underwent catheterization of the left side of the heart and coronary angiography. The left coronary artery angiogram revealed mild luminal irregularities. The right coronary artery (RCA) angiogram is shown in Figure 1 and Video 1.

A middle-aged man presented with chest pain, elevated troponin-T of 1037 ng/L (normal <14 ng/L; to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1), and anterior T-wave inversion on electrocardiography. He was a smoker with hypertension and kidney dysfunction, with a history of left-sided paresthesia. Coronary angiography demonstrated unobstructed coronary arteries. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging revealed subendocardial midinferolateral late gadolinium enhancement with corresponding hypokinesis consistent with a partial-thickness myocardial infarction. Prolonged Holter monitoring showed no evidence of atrial fibrillation. Two years later, he had a similar presentation consistent with a non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Repeated coronary angiography again demonstrated unobstructed coronary arteries. The CMR revealed the same midinferolateral late gadolinium enhancement as at the initial examination (Figure, A) but with focal enhancement on T2 short tau inversion recovery sequences (Figure, B), with increased T1 and T2 values suggestive of associated edema from an acute infarction in the same territory. A mobile interatrial septum was noted on 4-chamber cine imaging. A transthoracic echocardiogram bubble study demonstrated color flow at rest across the interatrial septum and a large shunt on Valsalva maneuver consistent with a grade 3 patent foramen ovale (PFO) (Video). Coincidentally, a brain MR scan to investigate the recurrent paresthesia revealed bilateral white matter lesions thought to be secondary to small-vessel disease greater in number than expected for the patient’s age, raising suspicion for microemboli.

### INPUT:
A 75-year-old woman presented with several weeks of intermittent headache that had progressed to severe, persistent headache with right eye pain. She had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. She denied tobacco, alcohol, or drug use. A neurological examination was notable for disorientation to the month, deficits in short-term memory, and an upward drift of the left arm. Cranial nerve, sensory, coordination, and deep tendon reflex examinations were normal. She walked with a slightly wide but steady gait. Her serum red and white blood cell counts, coagulation profile, and electrolyte levels were within normal limits. Blood cultures had negative results. A 24-hour electroencephalogram showed right hemispheric slowing and multiple right centroparietal seizures of 1 minute each, without noticeable clinical correlates. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain was remarkable for a large T2-hyperintense lesion in the right temporoparietal region, with an increased diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) signal (low apparent diffusion coefficient), a low signal on susceptibility-weighted imaging, increased T1 signal intensity in and around the lesion, and a contrast-enhancing rim with leptomeningeal enhancement (Figure 1). A smaller satellite lesion with a similar MRI profile was noted inferiorly in the right anterior temporal lobe. A computed tomography scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis did not show any metastatic disease. A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile showed a normal red blood cell count and protein and glucose levels and a mildly elevated white blood cell count of 11 cells/μL (to convert to cells × 109/L, multiply by 0.001). The fluid was absent oligoclonal bands and had negative bacterial and fungal culture results, a meningitis-encephalitis polymerase chain reaction panel, and a paraneoplastic panel. Cytology and flow cytometry had negative results. The patient then underwent surgical biopsy of the temporoparietal lesion.

### INPUT:
A 40-year-old woman with refractory glaucoma was referred for decreased vision in the right eye after an aqueous shunting surgical procedure 3 weeks prior. The surgical procedure was a 2-staged Baerveldt implantation after which she developed fluctuating but progressive visual decline. The patient’s ocular history was significant for Sturge-Weber syndrome with bilateral cutaneous port-wine stains, secondary glaucoma in the right eye, and an irregular globe with a white cataract and chronic retinal detachment (RD) in the left eye. At presentation, visual acuity was hand motion OD and a long-standing history of no light perception OS. Intraocular pressures by Goldmann applanation tonometry were 16 mm Hg OD and 28 mm Hg OS. Anterior segment examination of the right eye revealed a properly positioned plate and tube, and dilated fundus examination revealed a red glow of the fundus with shifting subretinal fluid and RD extending from the 2- to 11-o’clock position (Figure 1A). B-scan ultrasonography of the right eye confirmed the RD and demonstrated homogeneous diffuse choroidal thickening (Figure 1B).

### INPUT:
A 49-year-old African American woman who was hospitalized with hypervolemia due to supraventricular tachycardia presented with acute unilateral painless vision loss. Her active medical problems included atrial flutter on anticoagulation, antisynthetase syndrome (which was diagnosed based on the presence of autoantibodies against aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase), fever with negative infectious workup results, and interstitial lung disease that was managed with azathioprine. Two weeks before the onset of sudden vision loss, the patient developed a rapidly evolving purpuric rash on her hands and feet that progressed to digital ischemia (Figure 1A). She was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone, which was completed 3 days before the onset of loss of vision and transitioned to treatment with azathioprine, 150 mg, and prednisone, 80 mg, that she was taking at the time of her vision loss.

An 82-year-old woman with an ocular history significant for bilateral nuclear sclerotic cataracts presented to the Cornea Service at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, Miami, Florida, with a history of blurred vision in the right eye after phacoemulsification cataract extraction 8 weeks earlier. Current ophthalmic medications included topical prednisolone acetate, 1%, in the right eye 6 times per day. The patient reported no improvement with the treatment. On examination, her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/80 OD and 20/20 OS. Pupils were reactive without relative afferent pupillary defect, and intraocular pressures were 18 mm Hg in the right eye and 11 mm Hg in the left eye. A slitlamp biomicroscopic examination of the right eye revealed grade 2 to 3 diffuse central corneal edema and folds (Figure 1). The anterior chamber was deep and the posterior chamber intraocular lens was in good position within the capsular bag. Although the view to the posterior pole of the right eye was hazy owing to corneal edema, dilated fundus examination findings were unremarkable. Examination of the left eye revealed a few guttate. The central corneal thickness by ultrasound pachymetry was 957 μm in the right eye and 547 μm in the left eye.

A 17-month-old girl was referred to pediatric dermatology for evaluation of a slow-growing, nontender plaque on the lower back. The child's mother reported that, on discovery, the plaque was initially 1 × 1 cm and had since grown in size with the child. She was uncertain if the plaque was present at birth. The patient’s medical history was significant for dermal melanocytosis of the right hip and mid back, increased head circumference (97th percentile), and expressive language delay. There was no family history of congenital birthmarks or neurofibromatosis type 1 or 2. Physical examination revealed a well-appearing girl with normal vital signs and Fitzpatrick type III skin type. On the left lower back, there was a 15 × 5-cm indurated skin-colored to yellow, firm, multinodular plaque with hypertrichosis, extending from the midline to the left lower flank (Figure, A). There were additional blue-gray patches on the back and right hip, as well as a small café au lait macule on the right lower back. Limited neurologic examination was within normal limits. A 4-mm punch biopsy was performed for further diagnostic evaluation (Figure, B-D).

### INPUT:
A 9-year-old girl was referred to the pediatric otolaryngology clinic with a 3-month history of a left-sided neck mass. The mass had been slowly enlarging and she had been experiencing mild intermittent pain, but no additional symptoms were reported. Her medical history was significant for several episodes of upper respiratory infection during the previous winter season, and she previously had an adenotonsillectomy several years prior and bilateral ear tubes placed 1 year before presentation. Physical examination showed a mildly tender, nonmobile, left parotid mass near the angle of the mandible with no overlying skin changes or drainage around the mass. There was no lymphadenopathy or other lesions noted in the neck area, and cranial nerve VII was fully intact. Ultrasonography results of the neck showed a left 1.5-cm preauricular nodular mass with internal and marginal vascularity. A neck magnetic resonance imaging study without contrast performed at an outside institution revealed the 1.5-cm heterogeneous intraparotid nodule that was predominantly isotense to glandular tissue on T1 images with vague hypointensity of a small irregular central region, as well as vague hyperintensity on T2 images. She subsequently underwent fine needle aspiration biopsy to assess the lesion, which demonstrated benign-appearing salivary gland tissue and clusters of myoepithelial cells. The mass was continuing to enlarge, and the patient’s pain was increasing in that area, so the decision was made to perform left superficial parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve. Intraoperatively, the left parotid mass was noted to be just below the lower branches of the facial nerve. The excised parotid mass was sent to the pathology department for analysis. Gross examination of the specimen demonstrated a 1.6 × 1.5 × 1.1–cm tan-white, well-circumscribed lesion that was partially surrounded by salivary gland parenchyma (Figure, A). Histologic examination of the nodule was performed (Figure, B and C).

A 71-year-old man with non-Hodgkin lymphoma receiving maintenance obinutuzumab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) infusions underwent uneventful pars plana vitrectomy of the right eye for vitreomacular traction. Diluted triamcinolone acetonide (TA) was used to stain the posterior hyaloid. After removal of 25-gauge trocar cannulas, subconjunctival TA and ceftazidime was injected. Owing to cystoid changes in the central macula, a short-acting gas tamponade with sulfur hexafluoride was used to tamponade any cystoid abnormalities that may have been unroofed. Despite unremarkable postoperative day 1 (POD1) examination findings, the patient presented on postoperative week 3 with a painless central scotoma and worsening floaters. His visual acuity was 20/400 OD and intraocular pressure was normal. There was no external hyperemia or chemosis, and the anterior chamber was deep and quiet with no cells or flare. On dilated fundus examination, there were 15 to 20 cells per high-power field (using a 1 × 1-mm2 high-intensity incidental slit beam) and a white macular lesion with disc edema and scattered intraretinal and peripapillary hemorrhages and mixed venous and arterial sheathing. Optical coherence tomography of the macula showed atrophy, full-thickness hyperreflectivity, and a residual epiretinal membrane (Figure).

A 47-year-old man with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes for more than 15 years was referred for proliferative diabetic retinopathy management. His chief complaint was acute onset of blurry vision in the right eye. He described intermittent foggy vision and the appearance of “a hair moving across the vision of his right eye” for the past few weeks. His most recent hemoglobin A1c level was 8.3%, and 2 months prior to his visit, he had restarted diabetes medications. His medications included metformin and glimepiride. His corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. His pupil, color vision, and anterior segment examinations had normal results bilaterally. A posterior segment examination of the right eye showed mild temporal elevation of the optic disc with blurred margins, mild peripapillary hemorrhages, a small amount of preretinal hemorrhage, and small-caliber branching vessels at the temporal disc with no fibrosis (Figure 1A). The left eye showed a normal optic disc, a cup-disc ratio of 0.1, and some microaneurysms at the macula. There were a few scattered dot-blot hemorrhages bilaterally. Fluorescein angiography of the right eye showed mild leakage from the abnormal vessels at the temporal optic disc (Figure 1B).

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:

1. **Oral Submucous Fibrosis**

   The patient's history of prolonged areca nut chewing is a significant risk factor for oral submucous fibrosis. Clinical features such as progressive reduction in oral aperture (interincisal distance of 25 mm), burning sensation exacerbated by spicy foods, and thickened buccal mucosa with white-tan plaques support this diagnosis. Biopsy findings of subepithelial fibrosis with stromal hyalinization further confirm oral submucous fibrosis.

   Oral lichen planus can present with white plaques and mucosal changes. However, it is often associated with a reticular pattern and may involve erosive lesions, which are not described. Biopsy typically shows a band-like lymphocytic infiltrate, which is absent here.

3. **Leukoplakia**

   Leukoplakia presents as white plaques that cannot be scraped off and is a premalignant condition. The absence of dysplasia on biopsy makes this less likely, but it remains a consideration due to the mucosal changes.

4. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Oral Cavity**

   While the patient has risk factors (areca nut chewing), the biopsy did not show epithelial dysplasia or malignancy. However, squamous cell carcinoma can develop on a background of oral submucous fibrosis, warranting ongoing surveillance.

5. **Systemic Sclerosis (Scleroderma)**

   Scleroderma can cause oral manifestations like reduced oral aperture due to skin tightening. However, it usually presents with skin changes and systemic symptoms, which the patient does not have.

6. **Burning Mouth Syndrome**

   This condition causes a burning sensation in the mouth without observable clinical signs. The presence of mucosal lesions and fibrosis makes this less likely.

7. **Oral Candidiasis**

   Oral candidiasis can cause white plaques, but these are typically removable and associated with immunosuppression or antibiotic use, which are not indicated here.

8. **Iron Deficiency Anemia (Plummer-Vinson Syndrome)**

   Plummer-Vinson syndrome can cause mucosal changes and burning sensation. However, other features like esophageal webs and anemia symptoms are not reported.

9. **Pemphigus Vulgaris**

   Pemphigus vulgaris involves painful erosions and bullae, with acantholysis seen on biopsy, which is absent in this case.

10. **Amyloidosis**

    Oral amyloidosis can cause macroglossia and mucosal changes but is rare and often associated with systemic disease, which is not suggested here.

### INPUT:
A Black man in his early 70s with a history of coronary artery disease after coronary artery bypass operations, hypertension, and colon polyps presented to oculoplastic surgery with 1 week of progressive right-sided proptosis and headache, described as severe pain radiating to the back of his head. This was associated with right eyelid ptosis and blurry vision. Prior to presentation, an outside ophthalmologist treated him with 1 week of oral prednisone, 20 mg/d, for presumed orbital inflammation with no improvement. He denied additional symptoms. Notably, he described headache and sudden vision loss in the right eye after coronary artery bypass grafting 1 year ago for several days before spontaneous improvement with incomplete resolution. Personal and family histories were negative for malignant neoplasm and autoimmune disease. Examination revealed right-sided uncorrected Snellen visual acuity of 20/60 associated with restricted supraduction, abduction, and infraduction. Pupils were equal in size without a relative afferent pupillary defect, and intraocular pressures were 10 mm Hg OD and 11 mm Hg OS. Visual fields had temporal restriction to confrontation of the right eye. Vision, motility, and visual fields were normal on the left. Pertinent findings included right-sided proptosis of 2 mm, cranial nerve V1 and V2 hypoesthesia, eyelid ptosis with a margin to reflex distance 1 of 0 mm, optic disc pallor, and vessel attenuation. Outside magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated an infiltrative mass involving right greater than left orbital apices, the right optic nerve, and right extraocular muscles. There was enhancement of the cavernous sinuses, right pterygopalatine fossa, right sphenoid wing, and right middle cranial fossa dura (Figure 1).

### INPUT:
An 82-year-old with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and history of past cigarette smoking presented to pulmonary clinic for evaluation of dyspnea that had worsened over the previous 5 years. Two years prior, she was diagnosed with a right lower lobe segmental pulmonary embolism on a computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram after evaluation of shortness of breath. Warfarin was initiated but discontinued after 2 months due to recurrent epistaxis. On presentation to the pulmonary clinic, the patient reported dyspnea with minimal activity, fatigue, lightheadedness, and leg swelling. Her temperature was 96.8 °F (36 °C); blood pressure, 120/71 mm Hg; heart rate, 73/min; and oxygen saturation, 98% on room air. She appeared frail and had multiple telangiectasias on her lips, tongue, and hands. She had jugular venous distension, a cardiac systolic murmur, right ventricular heave, and bilateral lower extremity edema to the knees. Laboratory testing revealed brain-type natriuretic peptide level of 1333 pg/mL (reference, <100 pg/mL) and hemoglobin level of 12.9 g/dL (reference, 13.9-16.3 g/dL). During a 6-minute walk test on room air, her oxygen saturation decreased to 87%. With oxygen delivered by nasal cannula at 4 L/min, her oxygen saturation was 98%, and she walked 90 m (15% of predicted). An echocardiogram showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, moderate-severe right ventricular dilatation, and right ventricular systolic pressure of 60 to 70 mm Hg (reference, 35-40 mm Hg). Findings on an echocardiogram performed 10 years prior were normal.

A 28-year-old man presented with a 5-day history of painful cervical lymphadenopathy along with fever, nausea, and vomiting. Treatment with antibiotics and corticosteroids was started, without improvement of symptoms. He denied recent travel, sick contacts, or autoimmune disease. His medical history was significant for α-thalassemia but otherwise noncontributory. On examination, he had tender lymphadenopathy involving right level V. A computed tomography scan of the neck revealed a collection of enlarged, matted nodes without evidence of an abscess. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy showed nondiagnostic reactive lymph nodes. He was subsequently admitted to the hospital, where the lymphadenopathy progressed to the left side of the neck and a skin eruption developed over his face, back, and trunk. Results of an infectious disease and rheumatological workup, including bone marrow biopsy, were negative. Given his persistent symptoms, the ear, nose, and throat service consulted for excisional biopsy. On pathologic examination, the lymph nodes showed extensive coagulative necrosis, apoptosis, and karyorrhectic debris (Figure 1). Cellular components included histiocytes and dendritic cells, with absent neutrophils and hematoxylin bodies.

A man in his 90s presented to the emergency department with symptoms of fever, hemoptysis, and syncopal episodes. He had a history of breast cancer and pulmonary nodules with biopsy findings negative for metastatic disease but positive for granulomatous inflammation. Initial vital signs included blood pressure of 103/66 mm Hg, heart rate of 190 bpm, and temperature of 38.7 °C. Electrocardiogram showed monomorphic ventricular tachycardia with a morphology suggesting right ventricular (RV) origin (Figure 1). In addition to receiving intravenous amiodarone hydrochloride, he had correction of mild hypokalemia (3.1 mEq/L [reference range, 3.5-5.2 mEq/L]; to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 1.0). Successful arrhythmia termination occurred shortly thereafter, and his vital signs remained stable. Chest computed tomographic angiography excluded pulmonary embolism but showed pulmonary nodules and mediastinal lymphadenopathy that had progressed compared with his previous computed tomography. An echocardiogram showed severe RV and left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction with multiple areas of hypokinesis.

He denied any overlying loss of hair, sharp pain, or bleeding from the scalp lesion, and he only reported pain with prolonged pressure. On his scalp examination, a 7-cm ill-defined spongy and pulsatile mass was noted with an overlying gray patch of hair. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain/orbit was initially performed (Figure, A and B), which demonstrated an ill-defined, diffuse, intensely enhancing scalp lesion in the left frontoparietal region with very prominent vascularity and underlying calvarial thickening. No osseous destruction or intracranial extension was present. Subsequent catheter angiography (Figure, C) confirmed the hypervascular mass, supplied via hypertrophied superficial temporal and occipital arteries with marked internal vascularity without direct involvement of the calvarium or intracranial structures. The patient underwent biopsy under general anesthesia; the specimen showed an ill-defined deep dermal/subcutaneous proliferation of spindle cells without significant nuclear pleomorphism or mitotic activity. The lesions stained positive for S100 and SOX10 immunostains.

### INPUT:
A man in his 30s presented for evaluation of asymptomatic erythematous scaly plaques over the face and proximal extremities. The lesions started as an erythematous papule on the face, which had progressed to larger plaques within 10 years. There was involvement of the upper respiratory tract, causing palatal perforation and stridor, necessitating a tracheostomy a year ago. In addition, there was history of wheezing and breathlessness. There was no history of preceding trauma, fever, malaise, joint pain, cough, epistaxis, hemoptysis, or hematuria. Examination revealed multiple well-defined brown erythematous scaly plaques with central scarring measuring 2 × 1 to 8 × 7 cm on the face, arm, and thighs. The patient also had saddle nose deformity, perforation of the hard palate, and necrotic plaques on the ear, causing destruction of ear cartilage (Figure, A and B). There was cervical lymphadenopathy: multiple, nontender, discrete nodes, ranging from 1.5 to 2 cm without any surface changes. The results of sensory examination and peripheral nerve examination were within normal limits. Respiratory examination and chest radiography results were normal. Hemogram showed anemia (hemoglobin, 10.1 g/dL [to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0]); the results of a kidney function test, a liver function test, a fasting blood glucose test, and routine urinalysis were within normal limits. Serologic analysis results for HIV-1/2, antinuclear antibody, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. Punch skin biopsy was obtained for histopathologic analysis and culture (Figure, C).

### INPUT:
A 13-year-old boy with a 7-day history of painless vision loss and central scotoma in his left eye was referred to the department of ophthalmology. Three weeks prior, he had presented with mild fever and flulike symptoms, associated with a severe frontal headache that was mildly relieved by analgesics. His medical history was positive for relapsing urinary tract infections since early infancy without adequate follow-up. Findings of an ophthalmological examination 1 year prior were reported as normal. At initial examination, he was conscious but somewhat lethargic. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/80 OS. Pupillary light responses, extrinsic ocular motility, anterior segment biomicroscopy, and intraocular pressure were normal in both eyes. Dilated fundus examination revealed a bilateral sectorial macular star that was more extended in the left eye, with retinal veins slightly dilated and tortuous, attenuated arterioles, some juxta and peripapillary nerve fiber layer infarcts, and optic disc edema with marked papillary telangiectasia; in addition, some faint, small, tan-yellow dots were observed at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium in the posterior pole, some of them already grayish and with a hypopigmented halo (Figure 1). Optical coherence tomography displayed elevated optic discs and hyperreflective material in the outer plexiform layer temporal to the optic disc in both eyes and a macular neurosensory detachment in the left eye. Results of visual field testing were normal in the right eye and showed a central scotoma in the left eye.

### INPUT:
A 64-year-old woman with a 2-year history of seizure disorder presented to the emergency department (ED) at an outside hospital with breakthrough seizures. One month prior to her ED visit, she had been treated with oral antibiotics when she presented to an urgent care center with left-sided otorrhea, otalgia, and hearing loss. In the ED, she denied headaches, fever, otalgia, otorrhea, or hearing loss. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with contrast showed diffuse enhancement and possible coalescence in the left mastoid process with adjacent dural enhancement and sigmoid sinus occlusion. She received intravenous vancomycin and cefepime and was started on a heparin drip before being transferred to our facility. On presentation at our facility, the patient appeared well with normal vital signs. There was no periauricular swelling or erythema. Otoscopic examination showed no inflammation of the external auditory canals, and the tympanic membranes were translucent without evidence of retraction or effusion. Computed tomographic venogram confirmed occlusion of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses, and computed tomography of the temporal bone showed coalescence of mastoid air cells with erosion into the sigmoid sinus. Mastoidectomy was performed for biopsy and culture specimens. Histologic findings from the specimens demonstrated cells with oval nuclei and abundant cytoplasm arranged in syncytial clusters with occasional whorls, pseudoinclusions, and psammomatous calcifications (Figure, A). Immunohistochemical stains were positive for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and vimentin (Figure, B).

A 6-year child presented with headache for 1 month and seizures followed by altered consciousness for 1 day. She had new-onset daily occipital headache for 1 month of mild to moderate severity and pulsating character. Occasionally, the headache became severe accompanied by vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. The child had 4 to 5 episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures 1 day prior to admission. She remained unconscious for several hours and spontaneously regained consciousness over 24 hours. There was no history of fever, weight loss, limb weakness, vision impairment, or any strokelike illness. Her birth and developmental history were unremarkable. On examination, her pulse rate was 80 beats per minute (regular) with all peripheral pulses palpable without any radio-femoral delay. Her blood pressure was 170/110 mm Hg with less than 10 mm Hg difference of systolic and diastolic blood pressure in other limbs. Abdominal examination revealed abdominal bruit. Fundus examination revealed papilledema with changes of hypertensive retinopathy. She was not oriented to place and time. The cranial nerves, motor, sensory, and autonomic system examination were unremarkable. Meningeal signs were absent. There was no evidence of neurocutaneous markers. Her cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral white matter hyperintensity that was more marked in the bilateral parieto-occipital region. Ultrasound of the abdomen revealed a small right kidney and renal Doppler was suggestive of right renal-artery stenosis. Her computed tomography angiography revealed short segment (3 cm) and short circumferential thickening of the descending aorta with right renal artery narrowing (Figure 1). Her repeat cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed significant reduction in the white matter hyperintensities.

A 71-year-old man presented to the otolaryngology clinic for evaluation of a parapharyngeal space (PPS) mass that was incidentally found on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the face. The patient experienced left jaw tightness, aural fullness, and facial discomfort. The MRI results demonstrated a well-circumscribed, ovoid mass in the left prestyloid PPS that measured 12 × 15 × 22 mm. The lesion was isointense on T1-weighted imaging, was hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging, and demonstrated heterogeneous enhancement following gadolinium administration (Figure 1). A computed tomography–guided fine-needle aspiration was performed, which demonstrated blood, fibrin, and rare mesenchymal cells. Given his ongoing symptoms, the patient requested surgical resection. The patient underwent transoral robotic surgery for resection of his PPS mass to achieve definitive diagnosis and treatment. Histopathologic evaluation demonstrated a well-circumscribed, 12-mm mass.

### INPUT:
A 70-year-old man with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and gallstones presented to the emergency department with 3 days of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. He reported no hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena and had no history of abdominal surgery. On admission to the emergency department, he was afebrile, his blood pressure was 80/60 mm Hg, and heart rate was 122/min. On physical examination, his abdomen was distended, tympanic, and slightly tender to palpation diffusely. Blood testing showed a white blood cell count of 10 450/μL (84.1% neutrophils); C-reactive protein level, 9.5 mg/dL; potassium level, 3.0 mEq/L (reference, 3.6-5.2 mEq/L); and creatinine level, 5.57 mg/dL (429.39 μmol/L, up from a baseline level of 0.80 mg/dL [70.72 μmol/L]). Sodium and liver function values were normal. In the emergency department, he received a 500-mL bolus of intravenous crystalloid fluid and 1 g of intravenous ceftriaxone. A nasogastric tube was placed and initially drained 300 mL of biliary fluid. A non–contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was performed (Figure 1).

### INPUT:
A 75-year-old woman with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with isolated deletion 5q (del5q) presented with multiple nonhealing skin ulcers on the chest and upper extremities. Four years earlier, she started taking lenalidomide, 10 mg/d (28-day cycle), to treat worsening anemia; after 2 cycles of treatment, she became transfusion independent. Since then, she has remained stable with the same dose and schedule of lenalidomide without significant adverse effects. The presenting skin lesions developed 1 month before presentation and began as small pustules that rapidly transformed into painful ulcers. She was treated with valacyclovir for a presumed diagnosis of shingles, but the lesions did not improve. Because of suspected necrotizing fasciitis, she underwent incision and drainage of the lesions. Cultures from the surgical specimen grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus hemolyticus. However, the lesions continued to worsen despite vancomycin and additional debridement. Thus, she was transferred to our facility. Physical examination showed multiple cutaneous ulcers with gray undermined borders and red papules of varying depths involving the chest, back, and upper extremity; lesions were as large as 9 × 15 cm. A complete blood cell count showed a white blood cell count of 16.2 × 103/μL (to convert to 109/L, multiply by 1.0) with an absolute neutrophil count of 12.7 × 103/μL, hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0), and platelet count of 262 × 103/μL with no circulating blasts. Results of additional laboratory studies, including blood culture and tests for herpes zoster virus (via polymerase chain reaction), antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were all negative. Additionally, the patient also had hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for which she was taking lisinopril and simvastatin, respectively. Pathologic sampling from skin lesions demonstrated a dense dermal infiltrate with predominantly neutrophils along with reactive histiocytes, fibroblasts, and angioplasia (Figure, A). Immunohistochemical staining showed myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils (Figure, B), histiocytic markers (CD43, CD63, CD168), and CD117-positive mast cells, but no immature myeloid precursors. Results of Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver staining were unremarkable.

### INPUT:
A 62-year-old patient presented to the ophthalmology department with sudden painless vision loss in his right eye that occurred 24 hours ago. He also reported a 4-week history of right ear pain and fullness, discomfort over his frontal and maxillary sinuses, and nasal congestion without discharge. Over the past 2 weeks, he had experienced drenching night sweats, cramps in his quadriceps, and weight loss of 3 kg. He denied respiratory symptoms, headaches, scalp tenderness, or jaw claudication. He took no regular medication and did not smoke. At presentation, his visual acuities were perception of light OD and 20/20 OS. There was a right relative afferent pupillary defect. Dilated fundus examination showed a cherry red spot in the right macula with hyperreflectivity and thickening of the inner retinal layers on optical coherence tomography (Figure 1A and B). External eye examination results and ocular motility were normal. Examination by an otolaryngologist revealed normal tympanic membranes and a dry but otherwise normal nasal mucosa on flexible endoscopy. Blood tests showed leukocytosis (white blood cell count, 15 000 /µL; to convert to 109 per liter, multiply by 0.001) with neutrophilia (white blood cell count, 12 500 /µL), elevated C-reactive protein (19.4 mg/dL; to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10), elevated plasma viscosity (2.06 mPas), and thrombocytosis (467 ×103/µL; to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 1).

### INPUT:
A 25-month-old child with unilateral hearing loss was referred to a pediatric ear, nose, and throat surgeon in a secondary care hospital. Clinical findings suggested unilateral right middle ear effusion associated with ipsilateral conductive hearing loss. After an initial observation period, a right tympanostomy tube was inserted. During the procedure, a clear liquid pulsating from the middle ear was noted, and samples were sent for β-2-transferrine analysis. This confirmed the presence of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. The patient was referred to our tertiary referral center hospital. The leak settled with conservative management, and imaging of the brain and skull base was performed. A high-resolution computed tomography scan of the temporal bone showed a lytic aspect of the right temporal bone extending to the petrous apex and the petrous bone, sparing the otic capsule (Figure 1A). There was soft tissue opacification of the right mastoid air cells. Magnetic resonance imaging of the skull base with contrast was performed (Figure 1B). It showed a hyperintense T2 signal in the petrous apex and mastoid air cells. There was a suspected communication into the soft tissues of the right neck in the posterior triangle. Magnetic resonance imaging also showed signs of Chiari malformation type 1. After a skull base multidisciplinary discussion, the patient underwent a bone biopsy through a transmastoid approach.

### INPUT:
A 12-year-old boy presented to the clinic with a 3-month history of intermittent stridor. His symptoms were initially most prominent while playing sports and were suspected to be due to asthma or seasonal allergies. However, medical management with albuterol, intranasal fluticasone, and cetirizine failed to provide relief. More recently, the patient’s parents noted that he developed stridor while sleeping and while at rest, prompting the family to present for medical attention. Previous workup, including pulmonary function testing, was concerning for an upper airway obstructive process, for which he was referred to otolaryngology. In-office flexible videostroboscopy revealed a mass in the distal cervical trachea that appeared nearly obstructive. Chest radiography confirmed the presence of an approximately 1.5-cm, well-circumscribed soft tissue mass within the cervical trachea. Direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy were performed in the operating room under general anesthesia. This demonstrated an exophytic, pedunculated mass that emanated from the anterior wall of the cervical trachea (Figure 1A and B). The patient was intubated via Seldinger technique to bypass the mass, with a 4.0-mm cuffed endotracheal tube loaded over a 0-degree Hopkins endoscope (Figure 1C). With the airway secured, attention was turned to excision of the mass. Lidocaine, 1%, with epinephrine 1:100 000 was injected in a submucosal plane, and laryngeal scissors were used to excise the attachment of the mass from the tracheal wall. The mass was then resected en bloc and removed with laryngeal cupped forceps. The attachment site was then ablated with the Coblator (Figure 1D).

---

**Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results:**

1. **Tracheal Tumor**  
   The discovery of a 1.5-cm, well-circumscribed mass in the cervical trachea strongly suggests a tracheal tumor as the most probable diagnosis.

2. **Laryngeal Papillomatosis**  
   This condition involves the growth of papillomas in the airway and could explain the exophytic, pedunculated mass observed during bronchoscopy.

3. **Tracheal Hemangioma**  
   A vascular malformation like a hemangioma can present as a tracheal mass causing airway obstruction in pediatric patients.

4. **Tracheal Granuloma**  
   Chronic irritation or previous injury could lead to granuloma formation within the trachea, presenting as a mass.

5. **Tracheal Cyst**  
   Congenital cysts can occur in the trachea and may become symptomatic if they enlarge enough to obstruct the airway.

6. **Foreign Body Aspiration**  
   While less likely due to the chronicity and imaging findings, a retained foreign body can lead to granulation tissue and mass formation.

7. **Subglottic Stenosis**  
   Typically presents with airway narrowing rather than a discrete mass, making it a less likely diagnosis.

8. **Tracheal Web**  
   A thin membrane causing airway obstruction; however, it does not present as a mass lesion.

9. **Vocal Cord Dysfunction**  
   Involves abnormal movement of the vocal cords but does not account for the tracheal mass found on imaging.

10. **Asthma**  
    Given the lack of response to asthma medications and the identification of a tracheal mass, asthma is the least likely diagnosis.","['Otolaryngology', 'Pediatrics', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Pulmonary Medicine']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,F

A man in his mid-40s presented to the emergency department after a fall with head trauma. A head computed tomography showed a 0.9-cm left subdural hematoma with a mild left to right midline shift. His ethanol level was 202 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.2171); magnesium, 1.7 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.4114); potassium, 4.4 mEq/L (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1); and ionized calcium, 4.6 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.25). The patient developed cardiac arrest due to ventricular arrhythmias in the emergency department and was successfully resuscitated. Echocardiography demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% and no regional wall motion abnormalities. He subsequently underwent embolization of the middle meningeal artery. After embolization, however, a worsening rightward midline shift was discovered. As a result, on the 11th day of his hospitalization, he had a burr hole evacuation. During day 15 of admission, the patient had 3 episodes of torsade de pointes (TdP) while receiving 50 mg of metoprolol succinate daily, and his 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is shown in Figure 1.

### INPUT:
A male patient in his late 40s presented with a 3-year history of nonhealing ulcers in his groin and axillae. These lesions started as itchy, weepy, reddish papules and plaques, which gradually progressed to form ulcers and were associated with pain and pus discharge. They did not heal completely after multiple courses of topical as well as systemic antibiotics, antifungals, and steroids. He frequently experienced scaling and greasiness on his scalp, which was treated with shampoos and topical steroids. He also complained of polyuria and polydipsia for the past 4 years. General examination revealed multiple mobile, firm, nonmatted, and nontender lymph nodes in cervical and inguinal region. On systemic examination, hepatomegaly (2 cm below the right costal margin) was seen. There was also bilateral enlargement of the parotid area, which was tender on palpation. Cutaneous examination revealed yellowish greasy scales on the scalp, suggestive of seborrheic dermatitis. Erythematous edematous papules were present over the retroauricular areas and the inframammary folds (Figure, A). On examination of external genitalia, deep ulcers were observed in the bilateral inguinal folds, resembling knife-cut ulcers (Figure, B). Similar lesions were present over the junction of the scrotum and were associated with yellowish pus discharge. A 3.5-mm punch biopsy specimen was obtained for histopathological examination from the edge of an ulcer on one of the groin folds (Figure, C and D).

A 48-year-old man presented with 3 days of worsening right orbital swelling, eye pain, blurry vision, and 3 months of bilateral photophobia. He also reported bilateral rhinorrhea, congestion, and right frontal and temporal headaches. Active medical issues included hypertension, very poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, tobacco use, and asthma. His brother and father both had a history of chronic orbital swelling. Vital signs were unremarkable, and examination of the right eye showed moderate chemosis, injected conjunctiva, and periorbital edema. Both eyes were proptotic, right worse than left. He had normal bilateral extraocular movements, pupillary light reflexes, and gross vision. Computed tomography with contrast revealed bilateral ethmoid and frontal sinus opacification and right worse than left orbital fat stranding (Figure 1A). Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast demonstrated both enlargement and enhancement of bilateral extraocular muscles, especially the right superior rectus (Figure 1B). Initially he was started on antibiotic therapy. Right nasal biopsy, right endoscopic sinus surgery, and right anterior superior orbital tissue biopsy were performed. Intraoperatively, the sinus mucosa demonstrated only edema and mild secretions, but there was no necrosis or purulence. Both orbital and nasal cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Orbital biopsy showed nodular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates without evidence of fungal infection or necrosis (Figure 1C). Further workup revealed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, total IgG, and IgG4 levels and normal white blood cell count, thyroid-stimulating hormone, angiotensin-converting enzyme, lysozyme, antinuclear antibody, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) levels.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 50s presented with bleeding wounds and nodules on the bilateral hips and forearms. She previously received failed systemic and radiation therapy for tumor stage mycosis fungoides (MF). She had received 11 courses of extended beam radiation therapy, including 3 courses of total skin irradiation of 24 to 30 Gy, and focal irradiation to the left posterior thigh and hip/buttock with 2.5/3 Gy to 12.5/24 Gy, respectively, and the right posterior thigh and hip with 2 Gy to 20 and 26 Gy, respectively. Seven years before this visit, she underwent a reduced-intensity, matched, unrelated donor, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Her post-transplant course was complicated by severe chronic graft vs host disease of the skin, eyes, and gut, for which she received systemic corticosteroid therapy, tacrolimus, methotrexate, and long-term extracorporeal photopheresis. Three years after the HSCT, she developed chronic ulcerations on the hips, back, and arms at the site of previously irradiated tumors, as well as multiple friable, hemorrhagic, and bleeding nodules on bilateral hips and her forearms while receiving treatment with corticosteroids and extracorporeal photopheresis. She underwent several debulking procedures and excision biopsies of the nodules, which revealed granulation tissue on histology. In this latest visit, physical examination revealed recurrent hemorrhagic and friable nodules on her left lateral hip and left lateral buttock (Figure 1). Similar nodules were noted on her right hip and forearm. The patient underwent repeated debulking and biopsy. She was also treated with micafungin, amphotericin B, levofloxacin, dapsone, acyclovir, pentamidine, penicillin VK, and posaconazole. Positron emission tomography (PET) computed tomography (CT) results did not show evidence of visceral or extracutaneous disease.

### INPUT:
A woman in her mid-50s with a medical history of nonspecific T-wave abnormalities on electrocardiogram (ECG) reported new-onset chest discomfort, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath that woke her from sleep. Emergency medical services found her to be in a wide complex tachycardia. She was administered a 150-mg bolus of intravenous amiodarone, which failed to terminate her arrhythmia. She ultimately required synchronized cardioversion with a biphasic direct current shock of 100 J. On arrival to the emergency department, her vital signs were stable. Serum electrolyte levels were within normal range and C-reactive protein was less than 6 mg/dL (to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10). High-sensitivity troponin peaked at 1078 pg/mL. Her initial 12-lead ECG is shown in Figure 1A. She continued in sinus rhythm with episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia observed on telemetry, as shown in Figure 1B. Cardiac catheterization revealed patent coronary arteries. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was remarkable for a dilated right ventricle with moderately reduced systolic function and transmural late gadolinium enhancement with akinesis and dyskinesis involving the right ventricular (RV) free wall and outflow tract extending to the left ventricular (LV) anterior, septal, and apical segments.

### INPUT:
A 68-year-old woman with a history of keratoconus was referred for evaluation of a choroidal lesion in her left eye. She reported intermittent dull pain in her left eye for 1 month that improved with acetaminophen. Her family history was significant for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (mother) and leukemia (mother and maternal grandfather). On examination, her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25 OD and 20/200 OS, limited by keratoconus. Extraocular movements were full, there was no relative afferent pupillary defect, and intraocular pressures were 13 mm Hg OD and 11 mm Hg OS. There was no proptosis. Anterior segment examination demonstrated keratoconus with corneal scarring in both eyes and Descemet folds in the left eye. Both eyes had mixed cataract. There were no signs of anterior segment or vitreous inflammation. Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed an amelanotic area of choroidal thickening (confirmed by optical coherence tomography) overhanging the inferonasal margin of the optic disc with associated subretinal fluid and scattered areas of hyperpigmentation (Figure 1A). There was an additional, subtle amelanotic elevated lesion under the fovea. Fundus autofluorescence demonstrated hyperautofluorescence in a leopard-spotting pattern (Figure 1B). Indocyanine green angiography revealed hypocyanescent lesions inferonasal to the disc and at the fovea.

### INPUT:
A 19-year-old female presented for evaluation of painful lesions on the tongue that had been present for at least 3 months. She stated that the pain was exacerbated by spicy foods. She had initially presented to a primary care practitioner, was prescribed clotrimazole lozenges, and reported mild initial improvement followed by symptom progression. Subsequently, the practitioner referred the patient to an otolaryngologist. The patient denied any enlarged lymph nodes, fevers, fatigue, rash, weight loss, or abnormal gastrointestinal symptoms and had no noteworthy medical history. She reported mild alcohol consumption, denied any cigarette or illicit substance use, and endorsed engaging in oral and anal intercourse. A physical examination was notable for bilateral raised leukoplakia on the tongue; it was larger on the right side than the left and had a slightly hairy appearance. The lesion was tender to touch and could not be scraped off (Figure 1A). The lips and oral mucosa were without lesions, masses, or ulcers. The patient had no cervical lymphadenopathy. The findings of the physical examination were otherwise unremarkable.

### INPUT:
A previously healthy 12-year-old girl presented with a 3-month history of nasal obstruction, progressive dysphonia, recurrent deep neck abscesses, and tender, bulky cervical lymphadenopathy. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck with contrast at her initial hospital admission was concerning for suppurative lymphadenitis. Despite incision and drainage, and intravenous ampicillin and sulbactam, her cervical lymphadenopathy persisted. Results of subsequent workup—including Haemophilus, tetanus, and pneumococcal antibody titers; QuantiFERON-TB Gold test; serum IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE levels; absolute lymphocyte count; neutrophil phenotype and function; angiotensin-converting enzyme level; HLA-B27 test; and antinuclear antibody level—were within normal limits. Magnetic resonance imaging of the neck with gadolinium contrast demonstrated bilateral, bulky, enlarged cervical lymph nodes, as well as enhancing nodules in the left laryngeal ventricle (2.3 × 1.6 × 1.2 cm), right false vocal cord, and right tracheal wall (0.6 × 0.4 cm). Findings from nasal endoscopy, awake flexible laryngoscopy, and operative microlaryngoscopy revealed yellow submucosal masses in the left nasal cavity, left laryngeal ventricle, and right trachea, as well as left vocal cord paresis (Figure, A). Biopsies were taken of the tracheal, laryngeal, and nasal cavity masses, and an excisional biopsy was taken of a left cervical lymph node (Figure, B). Histopathologic examination revealed a prominent infiltrate of benign-appearing histiocytes with numerous forms showing emperipolesis and some nuclei showing distinct central nucleoli. Immunohistochemical staining in these cells was positive for S100 and negative for CD1a.

A 55-year-old male patient with a history of hypercholesterolemia and anxiety was referred for progressive imbalance while walking and intense fear of falling for the past 14 years. The patient had become progressively disabled and had been using a wheelchair for 4 years prior to presentation. Neurological examination showed gaze-evoked horizontal nystagmus in both directions along with slow saccades and gaze restriction in both vertical and horizontal planes. There was ataxic dysarthria. Tone was normal in all 4 limbs but stretch reflexes were absent and plantar fascia were mute. Limb power was normal. Ataxia was seen on finger-to-nose and heel-knee-shin tests. Chorea was present in both legs. Ankle inversion with bilateral hammertoes was noted. Electromyography revealed sensory neuronopathy. On brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffuse cerebellar atrophy was noted along with T2 hyperintensities in bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles, cerebellar white matter, pons, and bilateral thalamus (Figure). Psychiatric treatment was commenced for his severe anxiety but did not relieve the fear of falling.

### INPUT:
An 81-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of a slow-growing mass in his left cheek. He denied having any symptoms, tenderness, numbness, or facial nerve weakness. Physical examination revealed a mass in the buccinator space that was smooth, was nontender to palpation, and had no overlying cutaneous changes. A contrast-enhanced maxillofacial computed tomography scan demonstrated a 1.8 × 1.8 × 1.9-cm rounded, well-circumscribed lesion at the anterior aspect of the left masticator space (Figure 1). The mass was abutting the parotid duct, which did not appear dilated, and appeared to have a peripheral rim of hyperenhancing soft tissue with a central cystic/necrotic component. Results of ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration revealed rare epithelial cells with degenerative changes and inflammatory cells present. Findings from a core biopsy demonstrated a spindle cell neoplasm of uncertain origin. On immunostaining, spindle cells were CK8/18, S100, and SOX10 negative; myosin and smooth muscle actin (SMA) negative; and CD31 negative. However, STAT6 staining was diffusely positive.

An otherwise healthy woman in her 60s presented to a tertiary otolaryngology clinic reporting a 1-year medical history of progressively worsening hoarseness and dyspnea. She denied any history of dysphagia, odynophagia, fevers, unintentional weight loss, cough, or reflux symptoms. There was no prior history of smoking, head and neck surgeries, or radiation exposure. She was treated for asthma with inhaled steroids by her primary care physician without improvement in symptoms. On physical examination, the patient was stridulous and considerably hoarse. Her neck examination was unremarkable. Subsequent videostroboscopy revealed severe laryngeal mucosal edema, most significant in the false vocal folds, interarytenoid, and postcricoid regions (Figure 1A). There was right true vocal fold immobility with compensatory squeeze of the false vocal folds and an absent mucosal wave. Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the neck with contrast showed irregularity along the free edges of the true vocal folds but no evidence of a neoplasm or cervical lymphadenopathy. The patient underwent urgent direct laryngoscopy with biopsy, which showed edematous, irregular, friable laryngeal mucosa with significant airway narrowing.

A 29-year-old Pakistani man was referred to the otolaryngology clinic for increased postnasal drip, pharyngitis, odynophagia, cervicalgia, cervical lymphadenopathy, and right-sided otalgia that had persisted for more than a week. He was breastfeeding his 10-month-old, had no history of alcohol use, and had a remote history of hookah use. He was a Southern California native with travel history to Pakistan, Turkey, Jordan, Israel, Qatar, and Dubai 5 years prior to symptom onset. One month prior to onset, he drove from Los Angeles, California, to Houston, Texas. He denied recent unintentional weight loss, cough, fever, night sweats, chills, stridor, dyspnea, dysphonia, or rash. On examination, his vital signs were within normal limits, and physical examination revealed a small right tonsillolith, mild tonsillar erythema that was worse on the right side, and a mobile 2-cm, right level 2 lymph node that was slightly tender to palpation. Laboratory evaluation was notable for an elevated eosinophil count and positive Epstein-Barr immunoglobulin G. His white blood cell count and mononucleosis spot test result were within normal parameters. His symptoms persisted despite treatment with penicillin, azithromycin, and steroids from his primary physician and amoxicillin-clavulanate, sinus rinses, fluticasone propionate, and azelastine spray from an otolaryngologist to treat any contributing postnasal drainage and tonsillitis. Flexible transnasal videolaryngoscopy revealed a lesion on the laryngeal surface of the right epiglottis passing midline extending to the right aryepiglottic fold, but not involving the true vocal cords (Figure 1A). Given inconclusive office biopsy results, direct laryngoscopy with biopsy was performed, showing extensively inflamed squamous mucosa with ulceration, granulation tissue, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and atypia (Figure 1B).

A 75-year-old man presented with horizontal binocular diplopia, right-sided ptosis, and a new headache that was progressive over 3 days. He reported difficulty opening his jaw, pain when chewing, and a 2.3-kg weight loss. The week prior, he experienced left-sided ptosis that persisted for 2 days and subsequently resolved. He denied vision changes, eye pain, scalp tenderness, and myalgias. Past medical history included schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and supraventricular tachycardia. His examination demonstrated normal visual acuity in both eyes. Pupils were equal, round, and reactive. There was right upper-eyelid ptosis. Extraocular motility demonstrated limitation of elevation and abduction bilaterally (Figure 1). Results of dilated fundus examination were normal, and the remainder of his neurologic examination results were normal. His eye movements and ptosis did not change with fatiguability, rest, or an ice-pack test. Investigations revealed a C-reactive protein level of 292 mg/L (normal, <10 mg/L; to convert to milligrams per deciliter, divide by 10) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 93 mm/h (normal, <30 mm/h). A lumbar puncture demonstrated normal opening pressure, cell count, and glucose and protein levels. Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast of the brain demonstrated diffuse edema and enhancement of the scalp, skull base, neck, and paraspinal soft tissues, as well as T2 hyperintensity and enhancement of the extraocular muscles bilaterally. An additional test was obtained, and a diagnosis was made.

A 66-year-old African American woman presented to the otolaryngology clinic with a several-month history of severe nasal congestion. Five years before this otolaryngology evaluation, the patient developed diffuse skin plaques with erythema and was subsequently diagnosed with hypopigmented cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL, mycosis fungoides type). The patient was treated with a regimen of narrowband UV-B phototherapy and triamcinolone cream, which she has continued for 4 years. Owing to significant worsening of her symptoms 4 months before her evaluation, a biopsy of her cutaneous lesions was performed to rule out progression of CTCL (Figure 1). Physical examination demonstrated large annular plaques with peripheral hyperpigmentation of the body. There were also confluent, indurated pink plaques with slightly raised edges along the forehead, malar eminence, and scalp. The nasal septum demonstrated an inverted V deformity with compromise of the keystone junction. Nasal passages were obstructed with thick mucus and synechiae formation, nearly obstructing the entire nasal passage bilaterally.

A 9-year-old girl was referred to a pediatric retina specialist for evaluation of changes in the peripheral retinal pigment epithelium. Ocular history included high hyperopia and amblyopia, and abnormal foveal contour was discovered when she was aged 3 years. Family history was noncontributory. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/50 in the right eye and 20/30 in the left. Pupils were round and reactive to light, and intraocular pressure and anterior segment examination were within normal limits. Dilated fundus examination revealed blunted foveal reflexes and abnormal vasculature in the inferonasal quadrant of the right eye. Fluorescein angiography displayed symmetric bilateral circular areas of hypofluorescence around the macula and irregular fovea with no leakage (Figure 1A). Color fundus photography showed symmetric bilateral mottling of the retinal pigment epithelium in the periphery (Figure 1B). Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography on initial examination showed an abnormal foveal contour with loss of the foveal pit and intraretinal cystoid cavities within the inner nuclear layer.

   - The patient exhibits an abnormal foveal contour with loss of the foveal pit, as seen on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. The blunted foveal reflexes and decreased visual acuity are consistent with foveal hypoplasia. High hyperopia and amblyopia further support this diagnosis. The absence of systemic findings makes isolated foveal hypoplasia the most likely diagnosis.

2. **Ocular Albinism**  
   - Ocular albinism can present with foveal hypoplasia and reduced visual acuity. However, the lack of nystagmus and normal pigmentation of the skin and hair make this less likely.

3. **Aniridia**  
   - Aniridia is associated with foveal hypoplasia and visual impairment. The normal anterior segment examination and absence of iris abnormalities make this diagnosis less probable.

4. **X-linked Juvenile Retinoschisis**  
   - Intraretinal cystoid spaces within the inner nuclear layer are characteristic. However, this condition primarily affects males, making it less likely in a female patient.

5. **Familial Exudative Vitreoretinopathy**  
   - Abnormal peripheral vasculature could suggest this condition. However, the lack of significant familial history and exudation reduces its likelihood.

6. **Achromatopsia**  
   - Presents with reduced visual acuity and foveal hypoplasia. The absence of photophobia and nystagmus lowers its probability.

7. **Stickler Syndrome**  
   - Associated with retinal abnormalities but usually presents with systemic features like skeletal abnormalities, which are not mentioned.

8. **Cone Dystrophy**  
   - Can cause decreased visual acuity and foveal changes. The early age of onset and lack of progressive symptoms make this less likely.

9. **Best Vitelliform Macular Dystrophy**  
   - Typically presents with vitelliform lesions at the macula, which are not described in this case.

10. **Retinitis Pigmentosa**  
    - Characterized by peripheral retinal pigment epithelial changes but usually includes night blindness and visual field constriction, which are not reported.","['Retinal Disorders', 'Pediatrics', 'Ophthalmology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,M

### INPUT:
A 3-year-old girl presented with a vascular lesion involving the left orbit and face. She had a pink macule on her left cheek at birth, which became raised and discolored around age 3 to 4 weeks. She was diagnosed with a capillary hemangioma, and propranolol was started at age 1 month with progression despite dosage increases. Topical timolol was tried without improvement; oral prednisolone decreased the size of the lesion, but was poorly tolerated and discontinued. An ophthalmic evaluation at an outside hospital was concerning for amblyopia because of anisohypermetropia, greater on the left, and a left esotropia and hypertropia. A magnetic resonance image revealed an orbital mass surrounding the left lateral rectus muscle with mass effect on the globe and extension into the eyelid, pterygopalatine fossa, and cheek. Given the risk of amblyopia, the patient underwent 2 embolization and debulking procedures of the orbital and cheek components of the lesion, which were positive for glucose transporter 1 on pathology. However, the esotropia abruptly worsened after the second debulking. At age 3 years, she presented to the clinic with a persistent cheek and orbit lesion, dense amblyopia, large-angle monocular esotropia and hypertropia, and proptosis of the left eye. The left extraocular muscle showed inability to abduct past midline (Figure 1A). A repeated magnetic resonance image showed persistent orbital involvement causing medial displacement of the lateral rectus muscle and mass effect on the globe (Figure 1B).

### INPUT:
A 9-year-old boy was referred to the pediatric retina service to evaluate progressive vision loss. His medical history included neonatal seizures. He was initially evaluated at an outside institution and was found to have bilateral symmetric vision loss with nyctalopia. The onset of the symptoms was unknown. At that time, his best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/70 OU. The patient did not receive any ophthalmological care until 2 years later, when he was seen for marked vision loss and was noted to have a BCVA of light perception in both eyes. When he presented to the pediatric retina service, he demonstrated poor mentation and was unable to recall simple things such as the name of his siblings. His BCVA was light perception. His pupils were round and reactive. The anterior segment examination and intraocular pressures were within normal limits. Fundus autofluorescence disclosed attenuated, narrow vasculature and diffuse peripheral patchy hypoautofluorescence (Figure 1A). Color fundus photography showed optic disc pallor, attenuated retinal vasculature, prominent choroidal markings, and central retinal atrophy with diffusely mottled pigmentation (Figure 1B). Optical coherence tomography displayed decreased retinal thickness, more prominent in the inner layers, and hyper-reflective dots in the outer retinal layers. Family history included unilateral vision loss in his paternal grandmother in her late 20s. Both parents were healthy and denied consanguinity. The patient has 3 half brothers, all of whom are healthy.

### INPUT:
An 88-year-old man presented with persistent subretinal fluid (SRF) and enlarging pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs) in each eye following 32 near monthly injections of anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Ocular history included presumed exudative age-related macular degeneration. Central serous chorioretinopathy was also suspected secondary to the presence of yellow subretinal deposits located within an inferior macular detachment in the right eye. Visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/25 OS. He had pseudophakia with an otherwise normal anterior segment examination in each eye. Fundus examination was remarkable for macular PEDs and SRF in each eye. There was an epiretinal membrane in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) in the right eye disclosed a central PED with SRF that extended beyond the inferior border of the PED (Figure, A). Hyperreflective foci, suggestive of vitelliform material, were visible on the photoreceptors. OCT in the left eye demonstrated 2 PEDs in the parafovea (Figure, B). SRF was present with overlying thickening of the photoreceptors. The choroid was thin in each eye. Fluorescein angiography revealed punctate hyperfluorescent staining within the body of the PEDs in each eye. There was no evidence of leakage in either eye. Fundus autofluorescence displayed dispersed, speckled hyperautofluorescence corresponding to the potential vitelliform material and SRF in the right eye. Review of the autofluorescence 3 years prior revealed boat-shaped hyperautofluorescence located in the most inferior aspect of the SRF in the right eye.

### INPUT:
A White woman in her 70s with a medical history notable only for mitral valve repair was incidentally found to have cervical lymphadenopathy on magnetic resonance imaging while undergoing workup for shoulder pain. A fine-needle biopsy of an enlarged left-sided cervical lymph node yielded benign results. One month later, she presented to a local emergency department with diffuse abdominal pain. Symptoms began 6 weeks earlier and had been intermittent in nature. She had also experienced fatigue, night sweats, decreased appetite, and weight loss for 6 weeks. She otherwise denied having fevers, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or easy bruising. Physical examination revealed bilateral cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymphadenopathy in addition to mild diffuse abdominal pain. Laboratory results revealed a hemoglobin level of 13.1 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10), a white blood cell count of 6.4 × 103/μL, and a platelet count of 404 × 103/μL (to convert to × 109/L, multiply by 1) in addition to negative results for HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C assays. Additional workup results were notable for elevated levels of interleukin (IL) 10 (1091 pg/mL), IL-6 (3.1 pg/mL), C-reactive protein (4.9 mg/dL [to convert to mg/L, multiply by 10]), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (79 mm/h). A computed tomography scan of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis further revealed extensive cervical, supraclavicular, retroperitoneal, pelvic, and inguinal lymphadenopathy, with extensive inflammation and fat stranding adjacent to these enlarged nodes. Positron emission tomography–computed tomography further demonstrated fluorodeoxyglucose-avid lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm. The patient then underwent excisional biopsy of an enlarged right cervical lymph node (Figure).

8. **Sweet's syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis)**

9. **Pyoderma gangrenosum**

10. **Erythema nodosum**

---

**Explanation:**

The most likely diagnosis is **cutaneous metastasis from an intra-abdominal sarcoma**, given the patient's history of a long-standing abdominal mass that has recently increased in size, along with the development of skin lesions. The rapid enlargement of the abdominal mass suggests malignant transformation, and sarcomas commonly metastasize to the skin.

**Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma** and **cutaneous involvement of non-Hodgkin lymphoma** are also strong possibilities due to the presentation of erythematous plaques and systemic symptoms like weight loss.

**Leukemia cutis** is considered due to skin infiltration by leukemic cells, which can present as erythematous plaques.

**Kaposi sarcoma** is less likely but included due to the presentation of skin lesions; however, it is more common in immunocompromised patients.

**Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma** is a rare lymphoma that affects subcutaneous tissue and could present similarly.

Metastasis from an **adenocarcinoma** (e.g., gastric or colon cancer) is considered due to abdominal symptoms and possible GI bleeding.

**Sweet's syndrome** and **pyoderma gangrenosum** are less likely due to the absence of fever and ulceration, respectively.

**Erythema nodosum** is least likely given the chronicity and characteristics of the skin lesions.","['Dermatology', 'Oncology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,40.0,F

### INPUT:
A woman aged 44 years was referred for progressive parkinsonism with poor levodopa response. Her medical history comprised unexplained sensory hearing loss, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis. At age 23 years, she had bilateral cataract surgery, and over the last 2 years, she developed worsening stiffness and walking difficulties with frequent falls. She reported features of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome (RLS), visual daytime hallucinations, and rapid cognitive decline. She was given levodopa/benserazide (up to 200 mg/50 mg 4 times daily) without improvement on her Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale scores. Therefore, her dopaminergic medication was ceased. Family history was negative for movement or developmental disorders. Her neurologic examination showed hypomimia, symmetrical bradykinesia, and rigidity of the extremities without tremors (Video). There was full range of eye movements with large-amplitude saccadic intrusions on smooth pursuit in all directions. Neuropsychological assessment revealed significant abnormalities in cognitive functioning, affecting verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills (ie, speed of information processing, visuospatial skills, verbal and visual memory loss, executive skills). Mini-Mental Status Examination score was 26 of 30 points. Systemic examination was unremarkable. Laboratory and cerebral spinal fluid testing (ie, paraneoplastic antibodies Hu, Yo, Ri, CV2, Ma2, amphiphysin, glutamic acid decarboxylase, N-methyl-d-aspartic acid, LGI1, and Caspr2, 14-3-3 protein) were normal. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed mild frontal and parietal atrophy. An electroencephalogram demonstrated slowing in keeping with moderate generalized encephalopathy. Total-body positron emission tomography (PET) using fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) as a tracer showed no FDG-avid lesions; however, a subsequent brain-specific FDG-PET/MRI revealed hypometabolism throughout the left cerebral hemisphere and crossed cerebellar diaschisis (Figure 1). As the patient’s cognitive function and parkinsonism had deteriorated rapidly, a brain biopsy of the left frontal cortex was done. Immunohistochemistry showed scattered globular inclusions consistent with Lewy bodies.

### INPUT:
An 18-year-old female presented to the primary care physician with a 4-month history of a slowly progressive painless lateral neck mass on the right side. The patient denied any history of dysphagia, dysphonia, drainage, previous neck surgery, trauma, or recent fever. There was no significant medical or family history of thyroid disease. On examination, the mass moved with swallowing. The patient had normal thyroid stimulating hormone and calcium levels and a parathyroid hormone (PTH) level of 63 pg/mL. Neck ultrasonography revealed a well-circumscribed anechoic lesion with a diameter of 5.9 cm in the right thyroid lobe without any internal solid nodularity or septation. A neck computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an intrathyroidal lesion extending inferiorly to 3 cm above the angle of Louis causing tracheal compression and displacement (Figure, A). The patient underwent right hemithyroidectomy to relieve tracheal compression. A near-infrared autofluorescence (NIRAF) camera yielded a homogenously dim lesion (Figure, B). Pathologic examination confirmed a normal right thyroid lobe, a normal right parathyroid gland, and a cystic lesion at the inferior pole with no evidence of malignant disease in the specimen. The tissue inside the lesion stained positive for PTH.

A 23-year-old man presented with 6 months of intermittent bilateral retro-orbital pain associated with blurred vision and wavy lines in the vision of both eyes, followed by worsening numbness and tingling of his hands and legs. Medical history was notable for mild obesity (body mass index of 30 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]). Visual acuity was 20/20 OU, with briskly reactive pupils OU and no relative afferent pupillary defect. Intraocular pressure was 17 mm Hg OU. Ishihara color plates were 13/13 OU. Extraocular movements were full. Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed blurring and elevation of the nasal margins of the optic disc consistent with grade 1 optic disc edema in both eyes (Figure). Optical coherence tomography showed an elevated mean peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness of 170 μm OD and 150 μm OS. Automated visual fields demonstrated subtle enlargement of the blind spots.

---

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses Using All Patient Information:

1. **Left trochlear nerve palsy due to pituitary macroadenoma**

   - **Justification:** The patient has untreated hyperprolactinemia, suggesting a pituitary adenoma. An expanding pituitary macroadenoma can compress adjacent cranial nerves, including the trochlear nerve, leading to diplopia and ophthalmoplegia. Headache and nausea are consistent with a mass effect causing increased intracranial pressure.

2. **Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri)**

   - **Justification:** Although more common in young women, it can occur in men. Increased intracranial pressure can cause headache, nausea, and cranial nerve VI palsy, but cranial nerve IV can also be affected.

3. **Left trochlear nerve palsy secondary to demyelinating disease (multiple sclerosis)**

   - **Justification:** Demyelinating lesions can affect cranial nerves, leading to isolated nerve palsies in young adults. Although less common, multiple sclerosis should be considered.

4. **Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (idiopathic orbital inflammation)**

   - **Justification:** This syndrome causes painful ophthalmoplegia due to inflammation in the cavernous sinus or orbital apex, affecting cranial nerves III, IV, and VI.

5. **Myasthenia gravis affecting ocular muscles**

   - **Justification:** Myasthenia gravis can present with diplopia and ophthalmoplegia. However, it usually affects multiple extraocular muscles and presents with fatigability, which is not described here.

6. **Brainstem lesion affecting the trochlear nerve (e.g., midbrain tumor)**

   - **Justification:** A lesion in the dorsal midbrain could affect the trochlear nerve nucleus, leading to isolated cranial nerve IV palsy.

7. **Orbital apex syndrome due to mass lesion**

   - **Justification:** A mass at the orbital apex can compress cranial nerves II, III, IV, V1, and VI, but visual acuity and fields are normal, making this less likely.

8. **Congenital superior oblique palsy**

   - **Justification:** Congenital palsy typically presents in childhood, but decompensation can occur later. However, sudden onset makes this less probable.

9. **Microvascular cranial nerve palsy due to diabetes mellitus**

   - **Justification:** Common in older adults with vascular risk factors. The patient is young and has no mention of diabetes.

10. **Traumatic left superior oblique muscle injury**

    - **Justification:** There is no history of trauma, making this diagnosis least likely.","['Endocrinology', 'Neuro-ophthalmology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Radiology', 'Diabetes and Endocrinology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,F

A 12-year-old boy with an unremarkable medical and ocular history was admitted for workup of anemia (hemoglobin, 6.7 g/dL; to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10) and leukopenia (white blood cell count, 1220 cells/μL; to convert to ×10^9 cells per liter, multiply by 0.001) with associated symptoms of headache, malaise, recent cough, and fever. Inflammatory markers were elevated with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 130 mm/h and a C-reactive protein level of 1.48 mg/dL (to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10). The patient noted floaters in his right eye, which prompted an ophthalmology consultation. On bedside examination, his near visual acuity was J1+ (Snellen equivalent, 20/20 OU), and color vision was full in both eyes; the patient’s intraocular pressure, pupils, extraocular movements, and confrontational visual fields were all unremarkable. Dilated examination revealed grade I and II optic disc edema in the right and left eyes, respectively, and peripapillary hemorrhage in the right eye. Optical coherence tomography was obtained 3 days after initial consultation, which confirmed bilateral disc edema, more pronounced in the left eye than the right eye (Figure 1), and 24-2 Humphrey visual field examination in both eyes was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits with and without contrast and lumbar puncture were obtained, and results showed diffuse signal abnormality in the bone marrow compartment and findings suggestive of papilledema. Magnetic resonance venography did not reveal thrombosis. Opening pressure during lumbar puncture was 37 cm H2O (upper limit of normal, 28 cm H2O); all cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) viral serology test results were negative, and glucose level and red and white blood cell counts were all within normal limits. CSF protein was slightly decreased at 10.4 mg/dL, and CSF cytospin findings were unremarkable.

### INPUT:
A 64-year-old woman presented to the otolaryngology clinic with hoarseness of voice for 3 weeks associated with intermittent dry cough. She had no medical history or family history of cancer and was not a smoker. In the absence of other suggestive symptoms, as well as a normal physical examination that did not reveal any enlarged cervical lymph nodes or oropharyngeal or neck mass and an unremarkable nasoendoscopic examination, a diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux was made. The patient was advised to try conservative management with dietary advice and proton pump inhibitors, and a clinical review was scheduled in 6 weeks. The patient only returned 3 months later when her hoarseness became worse. Repeat nasoendoscopy now showed left vocal cord palsy in the paramedian position. In the absence of a history of trauma and associated neurological or systemic symptoms, the main concern was an underlying tumor that impinged on the vagus nerve at various points or its recurrent branch. Results of a computed tomographic (CT) scan showed an ill-defined soft tissue mass, which was likely nodal disease, at the left supraclavicular (Figure 1), as well as the prevertebral and paravertebral region, which partially encased the left common carotid, left subclavian, and left vertebral arteries. This was along the expected course of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve and likely accounted for the left vocal cord palsy. However, the primary site of disease remained unclear. A fused positron emission tomography with CT (PET/CT) scan with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) tracer was then performed.

A 32-year-old man was referred by his dentist to an oral surgeon for evaluation of persistent bilateral cheek swelling and mouth pain. Two months prior to presentation, the patient had awoken with bilateral linear “gashes” in his mandibular vestibule that were accompanied by bilateral buccal facial swellings. Since that day, the facial swelling remained unchanged, and although the mucosal lesions healed, the oral pain persisted. The patient’s medical history was noteworthy for depression, for which he was taking bupropion and fluoxetine, and prior alcohol use disorder, for which he was 3 years sober. He denied any smokeless tobacco use but endorsed daily electronic cigarette use. The extraoral examination detected bilateral buccal facial swelling of the lower facial third without associated trismus or lymphadenopathy (Figure, A). Intraorally, bilateral scarring of the mandibular buccal vestibule was noted with focal areas of ulceration. Small aphthous ulcerations were also present on the right buccal mucosa (Figure, B). An incisional biopsy of the right vestibular lesion was performed, and the specimen showed diffuse plasmalymphocytic infiltrates within the lamina propria. On higher magnification, noncaseating granulomatous inflammation was observed (Figure, C). Staining for acid-fast bacilli was negative.

A 49-year-old African American man with no significant medical history came to the clinic because of abnormal retinal findings and mildly decreased visual acuity. He was told about these same findings 10 years ago but did not have a repeated eye examination until recently by another retina specialist. He reported no family history of retinal diseases. He initially received anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment, but was later referred because of a concern about either the idiopathic or paraneoplastic variant of acute exudative polymorphous vitelliform maculopathy (AEPVM). Initial workup by his primary care physician was unremarkable for malignancy. His best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/60 OD and 20/50 OS. An anterior segment examination was normal. Dilated fundus examination revealed multiple vitelliform lesions involving the macula and superior macula bilaterally (Figure 1). Fluorescein angiography revealed staining of these lesions with a pseudohypopyon appearance of the central vitelliform lesion in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed hyperreflectance corresponding to the yellow pigment in the vitelliform lesions in the subretinal space. No evidence of a choroidal neovascular membrane was present on examination or imaging.

A previously healthy 8-year-old girl presented to an outpatient clinic for further evaluation of a fluctuating right parotid mass that had been present for 3 years. The patient was not immunocompromised and denied any trauma to the area. In the 2 months prior, she had received multiple rounds of antibiotics from other health care professionals. Outside computed tomography of the face showed a 3-cm cystic structure in the superficial aspect of the right parotid gland with associated lymphadenopathy. An outside health care professional had attempted incision and drainage of the area with negative cultures. The patient presented to our clinic with an isolated right 2-cm fluctuant and tender mass overlying the parotid gland. There was no accompanying cervical lymphadenopathy, and facial nerve function remained fully intact. The patient denied fevers or systemic symptoms. Results of laboratory evaluation revealed normal complete blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels with negative infectious workup results for Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, HIV, and tuberculosis (TB). Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 1.9-cm peripherally enhancing, centrally necrotic lesion overlying the superficial right parotid gland with multiple subcentimeter necrotic lymph nodes within the right parotid gland (Figure 1).

A woman in her 40s with a 20-year history of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss was referred by her primary care physician for evaluation of left ventricular hypertrophy detected by echocardiography. The echocardiogram was performed because of an abnormal electrocardiogram demonstrating sinus tachycardia accompanied by high QRS voltage with a strain pattern in the precordial leads. She had no history of other illnesses. On physical examination, the patient was 154 cm tall and weighed 38 kg. The cardiovascular examination was unremarkable. Neurological examination showed mild cognitive impairment, poor coordination, and muscle weakness of the bilateral lower limbs. Blood test results revealed impaired glucose tolerance, hypothyroidism, and elevated levels of lactic acid (32.4 mg/dL) and pyruvate acid (1.91 mg/dL; to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 113.56). Review of the transthoracic echocardiogram showed diffuse hypertrophy, moderately decreased contractility of the left ventricle, and increased intramyocardial signal intensity (Video). The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. On admission, brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated cerebellar atrophy. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated diffuse biventricular hypertrophy and moderately impaired left ventricular systolic function. A wide range of nodular and band-shaped late gadolinium enhancement was detected in the middle and epicardial layers of the left ventricular myocardium. Coronary angiography revealed no significant stenoses of the epicardial coronary arteries.

Final diagnosis: Atypical vasculitis.  
Case report: An otherwise healthy White woman in her 60s presented with right jaw pain, trismus, and facial swelling. Symptoms started a year before, after receiving dental implants for new lower dentures. The patient noted right upper and lower eyelid swelling most notable in the morning but denied associated fevers, chills, vision changes, dysphagia, headaches, urinary symptoms, or rashes. Physical examination revealed a 3-cm round fluctuant area lateral to the right lateral canthus, mildly tender to palpation. No overlying warmth or erythema and no lymphadenopathy. The patient’s dentures appeared to be well fitting, but mouth opening was at approximately 50% of expected. Laboratory results included an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 20 mm/h, and normal complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel results, and lactate levels. Findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure, A) were most consistent with osteomyelitis of the mandible with inflammation of surrounding soft tissues. Right temporalis muscle biopsy results for Gram stain and culture, fungal stain and culture, and acid-fast bacillus stain were unremarkable. The patient’s symptoms did not improve after 7 weeks of empirical intravenous ertapenem followed by 8 weeks of oral cefuroxime and minocycline. Additional laboratory test results, including serum IgG4, SPEP, brucella AB, Q fever AB, RF, urinalysis, and microalbumin/creatinine levels, were all unremarkable. Results for p-ANCA and c-ANCA were negative. Repeated MRI findings showed progression of the inflammation and new involvement of the temporal lobe

### INPUT:
A 13-month-old girl with an unremarkable medical history and no ocular history was brought to the emergency department by her parents for bilateral eyelid ecchymosis and edema for 1 month, as well as a mass on the right temporal area that was persistent for the past month and a half. She had hit the right side of her head on a table 1 month before symptoms developed, but had no other recent trauma. The mass had not changed in size, was not tender, and had no other associated symptoms. Her parents had not noticed any change in vision. At bedside, the patient was playful and in no acute distress. On examination, she fixed and followed in each eye. Her pupils were equal and reactive to light without afferent pupillary defect. Both eyes were soft to palpation and her extraocular movements were full. Externally, her examination was notable for bilateral upper eyelid ecchymosis and edema, as well as a soft, well-circumscribed mass on the right temporal region (Figure 1). There was no obvious proptosis. She was also noted to have subconjunctival hemorrhage temporally on the right eye. Otherwise, findings of her anterior examination and dilated fundoscopic examination were normal.

### INPUT:
A 59-year-old Asian woman with no history of any systemic illness presented with a 1-month history of blurred vision in her right eye. Her visual acuity was 20/400 OD and 20/20 OS. The anterior segments were quiet and vitreous was clear in both eyes. Fundus examination in the right eye revealed a solitary, elevated choroidal lesion with a creamy yellow appearance in the macular region involving the optic disc (Figure 1A). Ultrasonography confirmed a dome-shaped choroidal mass with intermediate echodensity measuring 14 mm in diameter and 4 mm in thickness (Figure 1B). Fluorescein angiography demonstrated scattered pinpoint hyperfluorescence of the mass and late leakage of the disc. Indocyanine green angiography revealed hypofluorescence in both early and late phases. Optical coherence tomography disclosed a choroidal mass with undulating surface and shallow subretinal fluid. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbit revealed an intraocular mass with hyperintensity on T1-weighted and hypointensity on T2-weighted scans with contrast enhancement extending into the adjacent retrobulbar fat, suspicious for scleral invasion. Blood test results including a complete blood cell count, tuberculosis, syphilis, and angiotensin-converting enzyme were all negative. The patient then developed gingivitis with a white blood cell count up to 12 350/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001) in the next 2 weeks that failed to respond to intravenous antibiotics. There were more pigments overlying the intraocular mass with prominent intraretinal hemorrhage along the optic disc compared with clinical findings at first presentation.

### INPUT:
A White woman in her 50s with a clinical history of recurrent respiratory infections and diarrhea presented with painful oral erosions that began 2 years before. Results of a previous intestinal biopsy had shown unspecific findings and absence of apoptosis. She reported a 5-kg weight loss that she attributed to impaired intake owing to the oral lesions. She was also being evaluated for a mediastinal mass detected in radiography of the chest performed for pneumonia. Physical examination revealed whitish edematous lacy patches with erosions on the dorsal and lateral aspects of the tongue and buccal mucosa (Figure, A); skin and nails were not involved. A lingual biopsy specimen was obtained for pathologic evaluation and direct immunofluorescence (DIF; Figure, B and C). The result of indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) testing, using monkey esophagus, salt-skin split, and rat bladder as substrates, was negative. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblot analysis did not detect any desmoglein-1 or -3, bullous pemphigoid-180 or -230, collagen VII, desmocollin-1 to -3, laminin-332, envoplakin, or periplakin antibodies. Results were normal for liver function; negative for hepatitis B and C; indicative of hypogammaglobulinemia, with a decreased immunoglobulin (Ig) G serum level of 465 mg/dL (normal, 750-1600 g/L; for g/L, multiply by 0.01); and normal for IgA and IgM levels. Positron emission tomography revealed a 10-cm hypercapturing extrapulmonary mass (Figure, D). Surgical excision of the mediastinal mass was performed; its histopathologic features were consistent with a type AB thymoma, Masaoka-Koga stage 2A.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 50s presented to our dermatology department with an asymptomatic, arc-shaped, depressed skin groove on the left side of her forehead, frontal scalp, and vertex area. Localized linear hair loss and hair thinning on the left scalp area were observed. The patient reported that when the lesion had begun to appear, approximately 10 years earlier, she had received 2 doses of intralesional steroid via injection on a small bald patch on the vertex. Thereafter, the lesion gradually progressed to the frontal scalp and eventually made a linear furrow on the left side of her forehead. Physical examination revealed 2 long, curved-line, depressed, alopecic patches on the left side of the vertex and frontal scalp area extending to the left eyebrow (Figure, A and B). The lesions measured (length × width) 7 × 2 cm and 6 × 1 cm, respectively. Dermoscopic examination of the alopecic area revealed several short vellus hairs, yellow dots, and honeycomb hyperpigmentation; however, broken hairs were not seen. The result of a hair pull test was negative. The patient denied any trauma history and had no history of connective tissue disease nor any evidence of systemic involvement, such as arthralgia, photosensitivity, or skin rashes. Skin biopsies were performed on the left side of the vertex and the forehead. Histopathologic findings of the 2 biopsy specimens were identical (Figure, C and D).

### INPUT:
A 44-year-old man presented to the otolaryngology clinic with a 6-month history of a right neck mass with compressive symptoms. He first noticed swelling that progressed to pressure and dyspnea while supine. He reported fatigue but denied pain, voice change, weight loss, hemoptysis, and dysphagia. A physical examination revealed a visible and palpable fullness to the right neck without overlying cutaneous or sinus tract changes. Results of a complete blood cell count, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, triiodothyronine and levorotatory thyroxine testing, and a complete metabolic panel were normal. Ultrasonography showed a 7.9 × 6.3-cm septate cystic mass lateral to the right thyroid gland. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the neck demonstrated a large, nonenhancing cystic-appearing lesion abutting the lateral and posterior margins of the right thyroid lobe and extending from the level of the piriform sinus to the thoracic inlet (Figure). Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration revealed clear fluid with a parathyroid hormone (PTH) level of 67 pg/mL (reference range, <100 pg/mL; to convert to ng/L multiply by 1.00). A barium swallow study showed no communication between the cyst and the piriform sinus. Excision in the operating room was performed, and right thyroid lobectomy was necessary because of the intimate association of the lesion to the thyroid lobe.

### INPUT:
A 50-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of a neck mass that was associated with hoarseness of voice and globus sensation. Physical examination showed thyromegaly (right greater than left) with an approximately 5-cm palpable nodule in the right lobe. There was no tenderness or cervical lymphadenopathy. There was no prior radiation exposure to the head and neck area. Thyroid function test results were normal, and he did not take thyroid medications. A relative had received a diagnosis of papillary thyroid cancer at age 50 years. There was no other pertinent family history, including a history of multiple endocrine neoplasia. Ultrasonography results showed a multinodular goiter with a dominant 4.6-cm right thyroid nodule, 1.6-cm left-sided thyroid nodule, and suspect left level IV lymph node. Ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy results showed papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) (Bethesda VI) with a BRAFV600E variation in the left nodule and lymph node, and atypia of undetermined significance (Bethesda III) with a suspicious Afirma genomic sequence classifier in the right nodule. He underwent total thyroidectomy with modified left lateral neck dissection. Gross examination of the specimen showed a 2.9-cm pale-tan, partially circumscribed, soft nodule in the right thyroid lobe; a 1.4-cm pale-tan, fibrotic, centrally brown nodule in the left lobe; and a 1.8-cm pale-tan, rubbery, partially circumscribed nodule in the isthmus. Histologic examination of the right thyroid lesion was performed (Figure), with ancillary testing.

### INPUT:
A 33-year-old man with a history of hereditary bilateral retinoblastoma as an infant presented to a primary care clinic with 1 week of right lower extremity swelling. At age 8 months, he was treated with right enucleation and left eye radiotherapy (50.4 Gy). At age 4 years, he developed a recurrence of the retinoblastoma in the nasal cavity and was treated with 4 cycles of vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide followed by 1 cycle of cisplatin, etoposide, and intrathecal cytarabine. Primary care evaluation was prompted by his mother, as the patient had not noticed his lower extremity edema. He had no fevers, weight loss, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, or history of deep vein thrombosis. His physical examination was notable for firm, nonpitting edema to the hip. He did not have any associated tenderness, inguinal lymphadenopathy, or palpable abdominal masses. His vital signs were within normal limits and he ambulated comfortably. Laboratory work results, including a complete blood cell count with a differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, and D-dimer levels, were within normal limits. Doppler ultrasonography of his right lower extremity showed no deep vein thrombosis. A computed tomography venogram demonstrated a 4.0 × 3.5 cm mass of likely vascular origin that was extending into the right common iliac vein (Figure).

### INPUT:
A 54-year-old woman presented with a 3-day history of right ptosis and double vision. She was otherwise healthy and did not take any regular medications. Initially, she had horizontal diplopia on the first day that was worse at the end of the day, but this resolved when the right eyelid ptosis became complete. She denied any difficulty with her speech, swallowing, weakness, or sensory changes. She presented to the emergency department, and the emergency department physician reported a normal neurological examination result apart from the right-sided ptosis and limited eye movements. She was referred to ophthalmology and had a visual acuity of 20/20 OU. Both pupils were equal sizes and reactive to light. She was found to only have a complete limitation of elevation of her right eye and a limitation of abduction in her left eye (Figure). She was orthophoric in primary position, and there were no eyelid twitches. Orbicularis oculi strength was reduced on both sides. A dilated fundus examination had normal results bilaterally. An initial neurological examination, including assessments of motor strength in the upper and lower extremities and reflexes and a sensory examination, had normal results.

    ",Ocular myasthenia gravis,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Myasthenia Gravis**
2. **Cranial Nerve III Palsy**
3. **Cranial Nerve VI Palsy**
4. **Thyroid Eye Disease**
5. **Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia**
6. **Brainstem Stroke**
7. **Mitochondrial Myopathy (Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia)**
8. **Miller Fisher Syndrome**
9. **Botulism**
10. **Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome**

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses Using All Patient Information:

1. **Myasthenia Gravis**

   *The presentation of fluctuating diplopia worse at the end of the day, right ptosis, bilateral extraocular muscle weakness (limitation of elevation in the right eye and abduction in the left eye), and reduced orbicularis oculi strength on both sides strongly suggests myasthenia gravis. The absence of pupil involvement and normal neurological examination elsewhere supports this diagnosis.*

2. **Mitochondrial Myopathy (Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia)**

   *This condition can cause bilateral ptosis and ophthalmoplegia. However, it usually presents at a younger age and progresses slowly, making it less likely but still a consideration.*

3. **Thyroid Eye Disease**

   *Thyroid eye disease can cause extraocular muscle dysfunction and ptosis. The lack of other signs such as proptosis and a euthyroid status makes it less likely but it remains in the differential.*

4. **Botulism**

   *Botulism can present with ophthalmoplegia and ptosis due to cranial nerve involvement. However, it typically also includes autonomic symptoms and generalized weakness, which are not present here.*

5. **Miller Fisher Syndrome**

   *A variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome characterized by ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia. The patient does not exhibit ataxia or areflexia, making this diagnosis less probable.*

6. **Cranial Nerve III Palsy**

   *A third nerve palsy could explain the ptosis and limitation of elevation in the right eye. However, the pupils are normal, and there is also involvement of the left eye, which is unusual for an isolated nerve palsy.*

7. **Cranial Nerve VI Palsy**

   *A sixth nerve palsy could explain the limitation of abduction in the left eye. Bilateral involvement and additional signs make an isolated nerve palsy less likely.*

8. **Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia**

   *Caused by a lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus, leading to impaired horizontal eye movements. It is more common in multiple sclerosis, typically affecting younger individuals.*

9. **Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome**

   *This syndrome causes muscle weakness but usually affects the proximal muscles and is associated with autonomic symptoms and diminished reflexes, which are not observed in this patient.*

10. **Brainstem Stroke**

    *A stroke could cause cranial nerve deficits, but the absence of other neurological signs and the normal motor and sensory examinations make this diagnosis less likely.*

---

**Final Notes:**

Based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings—specifically the fluctuating nature of the symptoms, involvement of multiple cranial nerves, fatigability, and lack of pupil involvement—**myasthenia gravis** is the most probable diagnosis. Further investigations such as antibody testing (acetylcholine receptor antibodies), electromyography, and a Tensilon test would be helpful in confirming the diagnosis.","['Myasthenia Gravis', 'Neuro-ophthalmology', 'Neurology', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Ophthalmology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,54.0,M

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy Black man in his 30s presented to the dermatology clinic for evaluation of hypopigmented, intermittently pruritic patches. Patches were confined to his face and neck and occurred intermittently after his last child was born approximately 10 years ago. He had no history of eczema, atopic skin conditions, or autoimmune conditions and denied family history of such. In previous evaluations, the areas were treated with petroleum-based creams, low- to medium-potency topical steroids, pimecrolimus, and topical antifungals, without consistent improvement. Physical examination identified multiple hypopigmented macules and subtle patches symmetrically distributed across the lower aspect of the forehead, cheeks, nasofacial sulci, and nasolabial folds; and along the jawline and neck (Figure, A and B). Many had a slight overlying scale that was tested with potassium hydroxide and was negative for hyphae. No hair or nail abnormalities were noted. A 4-mm punch biopsy of a hypopigmented patch on the right cheek was performed (Figure, C and D).

### INPUT:
A 71-year-old man with a history of intermittent generalized pruritus of unclear etiology and right knee osteoarthritis underwent total knee arthroplasty. He presented 8 weeks postoperatively with a 1-week history of scattered pruritic bullae around his incision site. He reported that the symptoms were unlike any rashes he had had before. He had no fever, knee pain, or lower extremity swelling. He was taking no medications and had no allergies. On examination, he was afebrile and well-appearing. Knee examination showed no effusion and normal range of motion without pain. His incision was fully healed. Several 1- to 2-cm tense, fluid-filled bullae were present around the incision. There was no surrounding erythema or edema. He received topical iodine for 2 weeks, during which time 4 new tense bullae appeared (Figure, left panel). Three bullae subsequently ruptured, while 1 remained intact. Drainage from the ruptured bullae was clear. He was advised to continue using iodine on the affected skin for wound care and was prescribed a 7-day course of oral cephalexin and a tapering regimen of low-dose prednisone. After completion of the antibiotic course, the bullae and pruritus remained unchanged (Figure, right panel). Superficial cultures of the bullae were negative for bacterial growth.

### INPUT:
A 39-year-old man with metastatic breast cancer treated with anti-ERBB2 (formerly HER2) chemotherapy (ado-trastuzumab emtansine) presented to the emergency department with acute onset paralysis. Earlier that day he had upper-back muscle spasms while gardening. A few hours later, he developed weakness of both hands and legs, followed by urinary retention and saddle anesthesia. On arrival to the emergency department, the patient was febrile but hemodynamically stable. On physical examination, he had areflexia and weakness affecting all 4 limbs, with a sensory deficit distal to the T4 dermatome. Proprioception and vibratory sensation were intact throughout. Speech, comprehension, and cranial nerves were intact. Laboratory test results revealed elevated levels of inflammatory markers. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, including white and red blood cell counts, protein and glucose levels, infectious studies, and cytologic testing, was unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the total spine showed vertebral body metastases unchanged from a computed tomography scan obtained 8 months prior (Figure 1), multiple areas of new leptomeningeal enhancement around the distal spinal cord, and tumor infiltration of multiple vertebral bodies. An electromyogram showed grossly preserved motor conduction in the upper and lower extremities. F wave latencies (a measure of nerve conduction velocity between the spine and limb) were undetectable in the upper extremities and were normal in the lower extremities, suggesting upper motor neuron disease. Sensory conduction amplitudes of upper and lower extremity peripheral nerves were mildly decreased.

### INPUT:
A 63-year-old woman presented with progressive unsteadiness, malaise, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting of 1 month’s duration. She had recently experienced acute pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, a tonic-clonic seizure, transient episodes with tetaniform stiffness in both upper limbs, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding caused by gastric angiodysplasia, which was treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and argon electrocoagulation. Her medical history included alcohol intake of 2 to 4 drinks daily for several years that had stopped 10 years before admission, hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, dilated ischemic cardiomyopathy, and a stroke 12 years earlier and recovered without sequelae. Her medications included omeprazole, furosemide, atorvastatin, allopurinol, metformin, levetiracetam, and acenocoumarol. Physical examination revealed confusion, dysarthria, appendicular dysmetria with truncal ataxia, and downbeat nystagmus. She was well nourished. Results of blood tests showed a mild creatinine increase of 1.62 mg/dL (normal range, 0.4-1.2 mg/dL; to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4), serum phosphate levels of 2.4 mg/dL (normal range, 2.5-4.5 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.323), corrected calcium levels of 7.1 mg/dL (normal range, 9.0-10.5 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.25), and serum magnesium levels of 0.3 mg/dL (normal range, 1.8-2.5 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.4114). The results of tests for blood cell count, liver function, and thyroid function were normal, as were levels of sodium; potassium; vitamin B12; folic acid; vitamin E; and antinuclear, antineutrophil cytoplasmic, antigliadin, anti–glutamic acid decarboxylase, and anti-transglutaminase antibodies. Cerebrospinal fluid levels were normal, including proteins, glucose, and cell count; polymerase chain reaction for herpes viruses; and enterovirus. Oligoclonal bands (IgG and IgM) were absent, and IgG index was normal. Onconeural and neuronal membrane antibodies were negative in paired samples of cerebrospinal fluid and serum, and included the following: Hu, Yo, Ri, CV2, amphiphysin, Ma2, recoverin, SOX1, titin, Zic4, glutamic acid decarboxylase 65, N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor, contactin-associated protein-like 2, LGT1, γ-aminobutyric acid type B , AMPA1/AMPA2, dipeptidyl-peptidase–like protein 6, and Purkinje cells.

### INPUT:
A 5-month-old girl presented to the emergency department with acute oropharyngeal bleeding that self-resolved. Prior to presentation, she had a several-month history of slow feeding and intermittent noisy breathing. Physical examination revealed inspiratory stridor that was worse when supine. Bedside flexible endoscopy findings revealed a fleshy supraglottic mass obscuring a view of the glottis. The patient’s airway was secured in the operating room with an endotracheal tube over a 0° Hopkins rod. The mass was pedunculated on the lingual surface of the epiglottis and had areas of high vascularity and other areas of thrombosis (Figure, A). The vallecula, aryepiglottic folds, arytenoids, glottis, and subglottis were otherwise uninvolved. A biopsy was obtained, and pathology results revealed relatively high proliferation of small, irregular vessels with plump endothelial cells staining positive for glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) (Figure, B and C).

### INPUT:
A 33-year-old man was referred for evaluation of intermittent esotropia. When playing video games at a distance or when reading, he developed oscillopsia with eyestrain and noted that his right eye turned up and in. He had undergone strabismus surgery for crossed eyes as a young child and more recently had laser in situ keratomileusis performed. He was medically healthy and neurodevelopmentally normal but had been born 4½ weeks premature. There was no family history of strabismus, and he denied diplopia. On examination, corrected visual acuity was 20/30 − 2 OD and 20/15 OS. Both pupils reacted briskly to light with no afferent pupillary defect. He had 1+ apparent overaction of the right inferior oblique and superior rectus muscles. When he was inattentive, his eyes appeared to be straight (Figure 1). Prism and alternate cover testing during near fixation showed a right esotropia and dissociated vertical divergence when fixing with his preferred left eye (Figure 1, left inset) and a larger left esotropia during forced fixation with his right eye (Figure 1, right inset). He had no cycloplegic refractive error, and retinal examination showed no objective torsion. Placement of +3.00 lenses eliminated his esotropia at near but could not be used to alleviate his symptoms at distance, showing a high accommodation-to-convergence ratio.

### INPUT:
A teenage boy presented with a 1-year history of multiple indurated cords on the anterior neck area. The lesions appeared without an identifiable cause and spread around the neck. The cords eventually covered the entire anterior neck and upper and lower clavicle areas. The skin lesions formed a corrugated pattern at the time of presentation. The patient had previously been treated with moisturizers at a local clinic for 2 months without any signs of improvement. The patient denied any manipulation or trauma at those sites. There was no personal or family history of keloid formation. The boy was otherwise healthy and met normal developmental milestones. On examination of the patient, there were many short, skin-colored, parallel cords on the patient’s anterior neck areas (Figure, A and B). These cords were indurated, slightly raised, and well defined with a shiny surface. The cords had a uniform width of approximately 2 mm, and the lengths varied from 3 mm to 2 cm. During the course of the examination, an ill-defined sclerotic plaque surrounding the underside of the clavicle was found. It had a shiny surface, irregular shape, and measured 10 × 4 cm. No similar lesions were found on any other part of the patient’s body. Inspection of the patient’s skin revealed no abnormal nail fold capillary dilation or hemorrhage; no sclerodactyly, distal digital pitting, or Raynaud disease; and no extracutaneous involvement. A punch biopsy specimen from the affected area was obtained (Figure, C and D).

### INPUT:
A 58-year-old man with interstitial cystitis presented for pentosan polysulfate (Elmiron) maculopathy screening. He reported no visual symptoms or ocular history, and routine eye examination results 6 months prior were reportedly normal. He was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis in 2004 and had been taking pentosan polysulfate, 100 mg twice daily, for 4½ years for a cumulative dose of 324 g. His medical history was otherwise significant for moderate bilateral hearing loss detected in early childhood and type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism treated with a therapeutic regimen of metformin, pravastatin, and levothyroxine supplementation, respectively. At presentation, his visual acuity was 20/20−2 OD and 20/20 OS, intraocular pressures by rebound tonometry were normal, and anterior segment examination results were unremarkable. He had trace cortical cataracts and nuclear sclerosis in each eye. Dilated fundus examination in each eye revealed cup-disc ratios of 0.2, mild retinal pigment epithelium mottling, and scattered, deep punctate, hypopigmented lesions. Macular optical coherence tomography imaging demonstrated trace irregularity to the outer retinal bands. Fundus autofluorescence imaging showed irregularly distributed speckled hypoautofluorescence in the posterior pole of each eye (Figure).

### INPUT:
An 82-year-old man presented to the emergency department with 2 months of diarrhea and 2 weeks of rash. He had sustained a left radius fracture 6 months prior, which resulted in deconditioning and poor appetite. His diet consisted of mostly vegetables, and he lost 4 kg (8.8 lb) during this time. Two months prior, he developed postprandial nonbloody diarrhea that occurred 5 times daily. Two weeks prior, a pruritic rash in his extremities emerged. He had no fever, night sweats, or abdominal pain. Past medical history included chronic nondeforming rheumatoid arthritis, hypothyroidism, and colon adenocarcinoma resected 10 years prior. His medications were prednisolone (1 mg/d) and levothyroxine. On examination, he was afebrile, with blood pressure 90/46 mm Hg; pulse, 90/min and regular; and respirations, 18/min. Body mass index was 16.8 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). He was alert, cognitively intact, and appeared emaciated. Glossitis and a scaly pruritic rash with an erythematous brawny peeling base on his neck and extremities were noted (Figure). Findings on cardiovascular, pulmonary, abdominal, and neurologic examinations were unremarkable.

### INPUT:
A 70-year-old White man with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia was referred to our institution for evaluation of bilateral asymmetric corneal lesions by his primary eye care professional. The patient required spectacles for best-corrected visual acuity but otherwise had no other significant ocular complaints. He was not taking medications known to cause corneal depositions, nor was there a known family history of corneal dystrophy. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Slitlamp examination of the cornea of the right eye revealed multiple, discrete nodular opacities in the superior and inferior quadrants without neovascularization or surface elevation. Similar findings were seen in the left eye, but the superior lesions were notable for possessing well-circumscribed, plaquelike features located in the posterior stroma without involvement of the anterior surface (Figure, A). No crystalline changes were noted with these deposits.

A 28-year-old woman presented to her primary care physician for hematochezia. She had previously lived for a few years in Uganda and frequently swam in the Nile River. After returning to the US, she experienced recurrent diarrhea. In April 2018, she had an appendectomy for acute appendicitis. In February 2019, 22 months after her return from Uganda, she developed intermittent hematochezia. She had no vomiting, fever, or weight loss during this time. On evaluation, vital signs were normal and abdominal examination showed a soft, nontender abdomen. Rectal examination was normal. A complete blood cell count and comprehensive metabolic panel were notable for a normal hemoglobin level and an absolute eosinophil count of 304 cells/μL. Results of testing including stool microscopy, HIV fourth-generation assay, hepatitis B serologies, and a rectal swab for gonorrhea and chlamydia were negative. A colonoscopy demonstrated granular mucosa in the rectum. Internal hemorrhoids were present, but there were no masses, vascular malformations, or other abnormalities.

### INPUT:
A 19-month-old girl presented for evaluation of widespread edema and acute dermatitis. Following an upper respiratory tract infection 1 month prior, she developed disseminated red, scaly patches and a progressive eruption of hyperpigmented and hypopigmented patches of skin. She had occasional nonbloody loose stools but no fevers or vomiting. Although she was otherwise well, her growth had fallen from the 75th to the 25th percentile for height and weight over the preceding 9 months, and she could speak only 2 words. Her medical history was notable for atopic dermatitis and diarrhea in infancy that prompted allergy testing at age 6 months; she was subsequently diagnosed with milk, egg, and peanut allergies. Her parents avoided feeding her these foods, providing her only soy-based milk and formula, with improvement of dermatitis, until age 1 year. Since then her diet had consisted of multiple rice milk feeds daily, supplemented only with pureed fruits and vegetables, pasta, snack puffs, and sunflower butter. The patient had no history of meconium ileus or family history of cystic fibrosis. There was no recent travel and no changes to the home environment. On presentation, the patient was irritable, with normal vital signs. She displayed prominent labial swelling and pitting edema of the legs bilaterally. Skin examination was notable for erythematous, denuded patches with peeling scale and reticulate hyperpigmentation, accentuated on the abdomen, back, diaper area, and extensor extremities (Figure; left panel). Notably, her skin also demonstrated widespread patches of hypopigmentation, with an accompanying band of hypopigmentation proximally at the site of newest hair growth (Figure; right panel).

### INPUT:
A woman in her 60s presented as a transfer from an outside hospital. The division of dermatology was consulted for evaluation of lesions on the face, chest, back, and arms that were gradually increasing in size and number over the past year. Physical examination revealed leonine facies with madarosis and an eschar on the nasal dorsum (Figure, A). Red-to-brown dome-shaped papules coalescing into plaques were present on the upper extremities. The lesions were nontender and nonpruritic. Cervical and axillary lymph nodes were palpable. The patient had a muffled voice and reported shortness of breath with exertion. Results of laboratory investigation demonstrated marked leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 77.5 × 103/uL with 76.5% lymphocytes. No blasts were present on peripheral smear. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis demonstrated multiple enlarged mediastinal, axillary, subpectoral, abdominopelvic, and inguinal lymph nodes. Small pulmonary nodules were also detected. A punch biopsy was obtained from the right arm (Figure, B, C, and D).

### INPUT:
A 16-year-old girl with acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage developed tender, 1- to 2-cm erythematous plaques and nodules during treatment with chemotherapy. Previously, she had been well, with morphological remission found on a recent bone marrow biopsy. The patient had no significant dermatological history, except an allergy to cashew nuts and a prior episode (6 mo) of urticaria during a platelet transfusion that had resolved with 1 dose of oral antihistamine. The patient’s medications included ondansetron, aprepitant, prednisolone, and oxycodone (supportive care initiated with chemotherapy), and long-term posaconazole and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole treatment. Lesions were noted on day 2 of the fourth cycle of a chemotherapy regimen comprising fludarabine, cytarabine, and filgrastim (G-CSF). Initially present over the distal limbs, palms, and soles, the lesions progressed to the proximal limbs and lower trunk during 24 hours (Figure, A and B). The patient developed a fever, which we extensively investigated. Intravenous cefotaxime was commenced, but because no infectious source was identified, the fever was thought to be secondary to cytarabine.

### INPUT:
An 18-year-old woman with unremarkable medical history was referred to the oculoplastics service for evaluation of progressive gradual-onset ptosis and ophthalmoplegia in both eyes in the past 2 years (Figure). She had emigrated from Ghana 2 years before but denied any illness there. Her visual acuity without correction was 20/20 OD and 20/20 OS, although she had to manually elevate her eyelids to see the Snellen chart. She had no movement of the right eye past midline in elevation, adduction, depression, and abduction and no movement of the left eye past midline in elevation, depression, and abduction, with 50% deficit of adduction. Her external examination results were notable for a margin reflex distance 1 of −4 mm OU and a levator function of 0 OU. On funduscopic examination, her optic nerves were sharp and pink without atrophy, maculae and retinal vasculature were normal, and peripheral retina appeared normal without pigment abnormalities. A review of systems was negative for fatigue, generalized muscle weakness, or neurologic deficits.

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy woman in her 50s was referred to the Department of Dermatology with a 5-year history of an asymptomatic, gradually enlarging, reddish hematomalike plaque with a brownish peripheral border in her left axilla (Figure 1). The patient described the spontaneous onset of the lesion and reported no previous history of trauma or any other systemic symptoms; she had previously applied a topical antifungal cream but observed no lesion improvement. Physical examination revealed a nonindurated and well-defined 10 × 8-cm reddish-brown annular plaque with peripheral ecchymosis. No local lymphadenopathy was observed. Two biopsy specimens were obtained from different areas of the lesion for immunohistochemical studies; vascular channel endothelial cells were positive for CD31, CD34, and D2-40 and negative for human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) (latent nuclear antigen) and Wilms tumor 1 (WT1). Serologic tests for HIV and hepatitis B and C were negative.

### INPUT:
A previously healthy young adult presented with 1 week of fatigue, palpitations, and dyspnea on exertion, preceded by fever, myalgias, sore throat, and cough. Emergency department evaluation noted a heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure of 173/90 mm Hg, and a temperature of 37.1 °C. An electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm with complete heart block (CHB) and a narrow QRS junctional escape at 65 beats per minute (Figure, A). Investigation revealed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 30 mm/h (normal limits, 0-15 mm/h) and a C-reactive protein level of 6.3 mg/dL (reference range, 0.0-1.0 mg/dL [to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10.0]). Tests for kidney function, hepatic function, a complete blood cell count, troponin T levels, creatine kinase levels, thyrotropin levels, antinuclear antibodies, and rheumatoid factor had normal results, and tests for anti–streptolysin O and anti–DNAse B titers, Lyme IgG and IgM titers, Coxiella burnetti and Bartonella serologies, Epstein-Barr virus serology, and cytomegalovirus quantification had negative results. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no structural abnormalities, while fluorine 18–labeledfluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography (FDG-PET–CT) showed a small focal area of FDG uptake in the region of the membranous septum (Figure, B). Systemic FDG uptake was absent. A CT showed no hilar adenopathy or pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities. Over the next 48 hours, the patient’s junctional rhythm accelerated to 90 beats per minute with ventriculoatrial block before acutely degenerating to a narrow complex escape rhythm of 45 beats per minutes associated with lightheadedness (Figure, C).

A 40-year-old previously healthy man presented to the emergency department with 24 hours of dizziness, imbalance, bilateral lower extremity weakness, blurred vision, chest pain, and a painful rash on the left foot with tenderness of the fingers and toes. In the emergency department, the patient’s temperature was 36.7 °C (98.1 °F); blood pressure, 121/82 mm Hg; pulse, 74/min; respiratory rate, 15/min; and oxygen saturation, 99% on room air. Physical examination revealed petechiae within a poorly demarcated erythematous patch on the left dorsal foot (Figure 1, left panel), splinter hemorrhages on the right thumbnail (Figure 1, center panel), and petechial macules on the palms and soles, most numerous on the distal digits. There was no murmur or plop on cardiac auscultation. Neurologic examination findings were significant for left eye nystagmus and inability to adduct the right eye on left gaze, consistent with right-sided internuclear ophthalmoplegia. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head showed 2 acute infarcts in the right cerebellum. Results of laboratory testing were notable for mild leukocytosis (12.2 × 109/L), mild thrombocytosis (439 × 109/L), and elevated troponin level (4.4 ng/mL); results of a comprehensive metabolic panel and the remainder of the complete blood cell count were normal. An electrocardiogram showed T-wave inversions in lead V2, consistent with a non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Transthoracic echocardiogram and cardiac CT angiography (Figure 1, right panel) were performed.

A 68-year-old man presented to the emergency eye clinic with a 3-week history of progressive left eye redness and discomfort unresponsive to topical antibiotics or lubricants, as prescribed by his optometrist. The intraocular pressure (IOP) was raised (26 mm Hg) and was treated with a topical β-blocker. Otherwise, his condition was managed conservatively for presumed viral conjunctivitis. He self-presented 6 days later with intermittent visual blurring, mild eyelid swelling, and conjunctival chemosis. The IOP remained raised (24 mm Hg). An inflammatory or allergic etiology was suspected; therefore, topical corticosteroids and a prostaglandin analogue were also prescribed. One week later at planned follow-up, the patient had dilated and tortuous bulbar blood vessels (Figure 1). Further interrogation of the history revealed a left-sided nonspecific dull headache, constant for the previous 2 months, and an annoying “whooshing” noise in the patient’s left ear.

Final diagnosis: Rett syndrome.  
Case report: A 42-year-old man presented with clinical features of microcephaly, short stature, intellectual disability, severe degree of scoliosis, gait abnormality, and encephalopathy (Figure, A and B). He was born in 1973 at 38th week of gestation followed by a normal delivery (weight, 3.15 kg and head circumference, 42 cm) to nonconsanguineous parents. The head size was normal at birth, and no other abnormalities were seen during his infancy. At age 2 years, his parents noticed that he had delayed motor and language milestones. He experienced a progressive developmental delay such as reduction of head growth, loss of acquired communication, and loss of motor functions between ages 9 and 12 years. The severity of scoliosis increased with age, and he became a wheelchair user at age 18 years. He was referred to us at age 40 years with the characteristic features of growth deceleration (height, 142 cm; weight, 22 kg; body mass index, 11 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]), apraxia, left-sided hemiplegia, spasticity, sleep apnea, constipation, osteoporosis, hypoalgesia, and repetitive hand tapping (Video). Blood reports showed anemia (hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL; to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10) and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (47 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259). There was no history of autistic behavior, vision or hearing impairments, or epilepsy. The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with T wave inversion (V3-V6), and echocardiography showed mild cardiomegaly. The brain magnetic resonance imaging studies showed a diffuse reduction in the corpus callosum involving splenium and enlarged right ventricle, resulting in cerebral lateral ventricular asymmetry (Figure, C).

### INPUT:
A well-appearing 14-month-old boy was referred for the evaluation of recurrent left subconjunctival hemorrhage with increasing frequency since 7 months of age. Multiple prior office visits with referring ophthalmologists during which eyes were dilated showed normal results. Clinical examination revealed 180° of left interior subconjunctival hemorrhage with overlying conjunctival elevation and mild fullness of the left lower eyelid (Figure 1A). Fixation was central, steady, and maintained bilaterally, with full ocular motility and absence of appreciable proptosis. Penlight anterior segment examination demonstrated normally formed anterior segment structures without inflammation or hyphema in either eye, although the left eye exhibited a small intraocular lightly pigmented lesion at the 5-o'clock limbus. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) was deemed appropriate and further demonstrated normal intraocular pressures bilaterally. Handheld slitlamp examination localized the left eye 2-mm limbal lesion on the posterior corneal surface. The surrounding corneal and iris structures were normal appearing without evidence of vascularization. Ultrasound biomicroscopy was used to further evaluate both the intraocular lesion and better characterize the left lower eyelid fullness. This demonstrated no iris, angle, or ciliary body involvement by the intraocular lesion. A 10-MHz contact B-scan examination showed a large inferior orbital lesion measuring more than 17 mm in the anterior-to-posterior dimension (Figure 1B). Doppler ultrasonography did not demonstrate significant flow to suggest a vascular cause.

Laboratory examination findings were significant for leukocytosis with neutrophilia (white blood cell count, 19.8 K/μL; neutrophil count, 18.2 K/μL [to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001]), anemia (hemoglobin level, 9.6 g/dL [to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0]), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (>130 mm/h), and elevated C-reactive protein level (3.1 mg/dL [to convert to mg/L, multiply by 10]). Ultrasonography revealed multiple enlarged hyperemic lymph nodes within the right side of the neck, the largest measuring 3.4 × 2.4 × 2.1 cm in the submandibular space. He was treated with oral antibiotics without improvement. Ultrasonography at 1-month follow-up revealed interval enlargement of the lymph nodes, which appeared rounded in shape, without preservation of internal architecture. The mother reported that the patient lost 3.2 kg in 2 months, without any chills or night sweats, difficulty swallowing or breathing, change in voice, abdominal pain, recent travel, or exposure to animals or pets. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated extensive unilateral right-sided neck adenopathy, the largest nodes measuring approximately 4 cm at level IB; an approximately 2-cm destructive mass involving the left maxillary malar eminence; and additional lesions involving the T4 vertebra and upper sternum (Figure, A and B). Fluorodeoxyglucose 18F-labeled positron emission tomography with computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) demonstrated extensive FDG-avid right-sided cervical lymphadenopathy and innumerable FDG-avid lytic foci involving the axial and appendicular skeleton (Figure, C).

### INPUT:
The patient is a 48-year-old woman with a history of a rectal adenocarcinoma (cT3N2bM0) diagnosed 9 years prior. Following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, low anterior resection, and 6 cycles of adjuvant FOLFOX therapy (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin), she had developed a lung metastasis (KRAS wild type) 1 year later. She subsequently developed multiple lung metastases treated with palliative local interventions (lobectomy, radiofrequency ablation) and 4 lines of chemotherapy. Owing to symptomatic lung disease, she was enrolled in a clinical trial (NCT03502733) following informed consent and achieved a confirmed partial response. After 9 months, contrast computed tomography restaging scans noted a new, 1-cm posterior subglottic lesion of unclear origin (Figure, A). She had no shortness of breath or noisy breathing, dysphagia, voice change, or hemoptysis. A partial response was maintained without evidence of progression of lung disease.

### INPUT:
A 69-year-old man returning from a vacation in Cuba was brought to the emergency department directly from the airport. His medical history was unremarkable, and he had no allergies. He had been well until 2 hours before the flight home, when at the Havana airport, he developed generalized weakness, increased sweating, severe nausea, and vomiting. In flight, he had lethargy, vomiting, and urinary incontinence. On arrival to the emergency department, he was stuporous and required intubation. Initial laboratory tests showed a hemoglobin level of 10.9 g/dL (reference range, 12.0-15.2 g/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10.0]), a creatinine level of 1.31 mg/dL (reference range, 0.51-1.08 [to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4]), and a pH of 7.22 with a normal anion gap. Serum electrolyte levels; a white blood cell count; levels of glucose, creatine kinase, lactic acid, and thyrotropin; coagulation studies; and liver function tests had normal results. An electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia at 53 bpm and borderline QT interval prolongation (QTc; 465 milliseconds). A urine toxicology screen had negative results for acetaminophen, salicylates, opiates, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, and ethanol. Cerebrospinal fluid was clear, with normal levels of glucose, total protein, and white blood cells and negative microbiology and cytology testing results. A malaria smear and antigen test, respiratory viral assay, and cultures of cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and urine had negative results. Computed tomography of the head showed bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi (Figure 1). Within several hours, his level of consciousness improved spontaneously, and he was extubated. His blood pressure was 99/61 mm Hg; pulse, 80 bpm; temperature, 37.6 °C; and oxygen saturation, 99% on room air. The patient was alert but disoriented. The pupils were 2 mm and reactive. Involuntary facial muscle twitching was noted. His muscle tone was normal, and he had mild proximal muscle weakness with occasional bilateral upper extremity and lower extremity fasciculations and jerky movements. Deep tendon reflexes were normal, with flexor plantar responses. His sensations to pain and vibration were normal.

### INPUT:
A 9-year-old, vaccinated girl with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and β-thalassemia trait presented with 1 month of progressive dyspnea, snoring, dysphagia, and weight loss. Both parents had a history of latent tuberculosis infection treated after immigrating to the US from Syria shortly after the patient’s birth. The patient’s pediatrician diagnosed her with reactive airway disease and adenotonsillar hypertrophy. She was referred to the otolaryngology clinic, where flexible laryngoscopy revealed diffuse upper airway lymphoid hyperplasia and supraglottic edema. She was sent to the emergency department, where she was stridulous and afebrile with a normal white blood cell count and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. A computed tomography scan of the neck revealed diffuse edema and contrast enhancement of the nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and supraglottis. A chest radiograph was normal. The patient was taken urgently to the operating room for direct microlaryngoscopy (Figure 1A and B) and intubated. Results of biopsies and cultures of the tonsils, adenoids, and supraglottis revealed diffuse non-necrotizing granulomas (Figure 1C) and oropharyngeal flora with negative acid-fast bacilli and Grocott methenamine silver stains. She remained intubated, and treatment with systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics was initiated. During this time, she had a normal angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level and normal titers for antinuclear antibody (ANA), cytoplasmic antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody, perinuclear antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody, antimyeloperoxidase antibody, antiproteinase 3 antibody, anti–double-stranded DNA antibody, Smith antibody, Sjogren antibodies, and histoplasma antibodies. She also had normal results on tuberculin purified protein derivative and interferon-γ release assay (QuantiFERON; Qiagen).

### INPUT:
A 19-year-old White man who was previously in good health, with no reported history of drug abuse, presented with progressive bilateral nasal airway obstruction, crusting, and saddle nose deformity over a 6-month period. The patient denied systemic symptoms, including oral ulcers, sicca, photosensitivity, dermatitis, or arthralgias. His medical history had negative results for allergic rhinitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, epistaxis, nasal trauma, or surgery. His family history was noncontributory. An in-office nasal endoscopy demonstrated synechiae bridging from the septum to the lateral nasal walls, polypoid changes, and yellow crusting bilaterally. His immune workup showed elevated complement C3 (200 mg/dL) and total hemolytic complement (CH50; >60 U/mL) levels, with otherwise unremarkable levels of C4, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, rheumatoid factor, Sjögren antibodies, angiotensin-converting enzyme, antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, bullous pemphigoid IgG antibodies, and quantitative immunoglobulins and IgG subclasses (IgG4, 53 mg/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 0.01]). Nasal cultures had positive results for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides. Preoperative computed tomography showed no evidence of paranasal mucosal disease or bone erosion. An operative endoscopy with elevation of the mucoperichondrial flaps revealed an absence of the quadrangular cartilage caudal struts and irregular, friable tissue along the cartilage and perichondrium. Surgical pathology examination demonstrated prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate (Figure, A), angiocentric fibrosis with a relative lack of eosinophils (Figure, B), and increased IgG4 absolute count (up to 50 cells per high-power field), although an IgG4-IgG ratio that was only slightly elevated (0.2) (Figure, C and D).

### INPUT:
A 71-year-old woman with no history of smoking was referred to our tertiary center in August 2018 for an asymptomatic left level 5 neck mass that had been present for 6 months. Biopsy of the mass demonstrated metastatic p16-positive (human papillomavirus [HPV]-related) squamous cell carcinoma. Examination revealed a large left base of tongue mass filling the vallecula. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated an enhancing mass within the left base of tongue and bilateral cervical adenopathy. The patient was treated with concurrent radiation therapy and cetuximab, completing treatment without breaks in November 2018. Her 3-month posttreatment fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography/CT (FDG-PET/CT) imaging results demonstrated resolution of the activity at the base of tongue mass and the involved cervical lymph nodes, consistent with complete treatment response. In July 2019, the patient presented with a palpable left supraclavicular lymph node. Restaging FDG-PET/CT demonstrated avid supraclavicular and anterolateral neck adenopathy. Additionally, there was moderately intense activity isolated to the left thyroid lobe. Ultrasonography of the thyroid demonstrated a 4-cm mass within the gland, and subsequent biopsy was performed with immunohistochemistry staining positive for p16, CK5, and p40 and negative for thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) (Figure, A, B). After multidisciplinary review of the case, the patient was offered salvage left modified radical neck dissection and total thyroidectomy. Surgical pathology confirmed the diagnosis (Figure, C).

A 34-year-old woman presented with a 3-month history of progressive, unilateral lower lip and chin numbness and ipsilateral facial fullness. The hypoesthesia was limited to the distribution of the mandibular branch of the left trigeminal nerve (V3). On review of systems, the patient denied experiencing visual changes, dizziness, headaches, oral or neck pain, voice changes, weight or appetite changes, or swallowing dysfunction; however, she did report biting her lip occasionally due to the numbness. On examination, there were no palpable masses noted in the head, neck, or face. Aside from the V3 sensory deficit, the patient had no cranial nerve deficits. The patient had no significant medical history; prior surgical history was notable for tonsillectomy. Magnetic resonance imaging of the face revealed a T1 isointense, T2 hyperintense 5.9-cm lesion in the left masticator space, which appeared to be centered in the lateral pterygoid muscle with benign-appearing remodeling of the posterior maxillary wall (Figure).

A previously healthy 64-year-old woman was referred for a neuro-ophthalmological evaluation of bilateral optic nerve head edema that was noticed 2 months previously during a routine optometric examination. She denied having any symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (ICP), including headaches, pulsatile tinnitus, and transient visual obscurations. Findings on computed tomography of the brain without contrast were unremarkable. She was then seen by an ophthalmologist who confirmed bilateral severe optic nerve edema and requested magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits without contrast. It demonstrated signs of increased ICP, including empty sella, posterior flattening of the globes, and widened optic nerve sheaths, but no other abnormalities (Figure 1A).

### INPUT:
A man in his 40s presented to an outside ophthalmologist with a 3-day history of an inferior scotoma in his right eye. His Snellen visual acuities were 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. His intraocular pressures were 21 mm Hg OD and 14 mm Hg OS. The right eye had a relative afferent pupillary defect and mild optic nerve edema. To rule out optic neuritis, a magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain and orbits was obtained; the results were unremarkable. Six days after symptom onset, his visual acuity decreased to 20/70 OD and the disc edema increased. In addition, the right eye had developed 2+ anterior chamber cell, keratic precipitates, and a possible branch vein occlusion. At this time the patient was referred to our clinic. On presentation 1 day later, visual acuity was light perception OD and still 20/20 OS. The right eye had 3+ anterior chamber cell, inferior keratic precipitates, and 1+ vitreous cell. The right optic nerve had grade 4 disc edema with flame-shaped peripapillary hemorrhages. The fundus examination results of the right eye revealed the following superior quadrant retinal findings: extensive intraretinal and preretinal hemorrhages along vessels, arteriolar attenuation and sheathing, venous engorgement, and tortuosity. The inferior midperiphery had numerous small areas of deep retinal whitening (Figure 1). Examination results of the left eye were normal.

A 75-year old man with a history of follicular lymphoma and breast cancer presented with a 3-month history of gradual vision loss and 1-month history of confusion and difficulty with word finding. He had been diagnosed with hormone receptor–positive right breast cancer 8 years prior and underwent lumpectomy and treatment with an aromatase inhibitor, with remission since. Five years later, he subsequently developed left inguinal adenopathy, which biopsy results showed was follicular lymphoma. At that time, he was treated with a course of bendamustine and rituximab with subsequent maintenance treatment with rituximab for 2 years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed, demonstrating T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity in the left occipital and temporal lobes, crossing the corpus callosum and extending into the right occipital lobe without enhancement (Figure).

A 55-year-old man from the Southeastern US with a history of smoking, poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A1c level, 15.5%), and chronic pain from osteoarthritis treated with inhalational medical marijuana presented with 4 months of productive cough, 22.7-kg (50-lb) weight loss, subjective fevers, and 3 days of worsening chest pain. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a large right upper lobe cavitary mass. He was treated empirically with intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsy was performed. Lung tissue was sent for bacterial, fungal, mycobacterial, and Nocardia cultures and for histopathology. BAL cultures grew 100 colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL of group B streptococci and 1 CFU/mL of Aspergillus niger. Results of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and GeneXpert MTB/RIF testing were negative. Voriconazole was added to his treatment. Transbronchial biopsy histopathology showed acute and chronic inflammation, granulation tissue and necrosis, and negative fungal and AFB stains. Two weeks later, the patient reported worsening right-sided chest pain provoked by palpation, right arm movement, and deep inspiration. Repeat chest CT demonstrated cavitary mass enlargement with possible pleural invasion (Figure 1, left). He developed hypoxemia and required intubation. A right-sided tension pneumothorax developed and required emergency chest tube placement, which yielded charcoal-colored pleural fluid (Figure 1, right).

### INPUT:
A 44-year-old man presented with an asymptomatic enlarging right parotid mass of about 6 years’ duration. He had no prior medical or surgical history and took no medications. Ultrasonography demonstrated a solid and hypoechoic mass, 1.5 × 1.0 × 0.9 cm, in the inferior right parotid gland with minimal vascularity and without extraparotid extension. No lymph node abnormality was observed. Fine-needle aspiration was performed, and the smear was extremely cellular and showed sheets and clusters of bland polygonal epithelial cells admixed with bright pink filamentous matrix. Because of the size and location, extracapsular dissection II was carried out.1 The final pathology of the lesion showed histologic findings compatible with salivary gland carcinoma, with microcystic and papillary architecture (Figure, A and B). Abundant bubbly secretion was present within these microcystic spaces, and this material was positive for periodic acid–Schiff (Figure, C). Immunohistochemically, there was positivity for epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin (CK) 7 and CK19, S100 protein, and gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP-15). Stains for gastrointestinal stromal tumors 1 (DOG1) and p63 were negative. The tumor appeared to be contained within the surgical excision margins. There was perineural invasion without evidence of neoplastic emboli in the peritumoral lymphovascular spaces. The patient underwent a right parotidectomy I to IV1 and a level II superselective neck dissection.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Secretory carcinoma,"### OUTPUT:

**Step 1:** **Pleomorphic Adenoma**

- Considered as it is the most common benign salivary gland tumor, often presenting as a painless, slow-growing mass in the parotid gland.

**Step 2:** **Warthin Tumor**

- Considered due to its prevalence in middle-aged men and its occurrence in the parotid gland, typically appearing as a cystic mass.

**Step 3:** **Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma**

- Considered as the most common malignant salivary gland tumor, which can present with a mixture of cell types and cystic spaces.

**Step 4:** **Acinic Cell Carcinoma**

- Considered due to its occurrence in the parotid gland and the presence of bland epithelial cells; it may exhibit microcystic patterns.

**Step 5:** **Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma**

- Considered because of its characteristic perineural invasion and cribriform architecture.

**Step 6:** **Basal Cell Adenoma**

- Considered as a benign tumor of the parotid gland, composed of basaloid epithelial cells forming various patterns.

**Step 7:** **Epithelial-Myoepithelial Carcinoma**

- Considered due to its biphasic nature with ductal and myoepithelial cells and potential for papillary structures.

**Step 8:** **Secretory Carcinoma (Mammary Analogue Secretory Carcinoma)**

- Considered because of its microcystic and papillary architecture, PAS-positive secretions, and specific immunoprofile.

**Step 9:** **Oncocytoma**

- Considered as a benign parotid tumor composed of oncocytic cells, usually presenting as a painless mass.

**Step 10:** **Salivary Duct Carcinoma**

- Considered due to its papillary and cystic architecture, though it typically occurs in older individuals.

---

**Reranked Differential Diagnoses Using All Patient Information and Test Results:**

1. **Secretory Carcinoma (Mammary Analogue Secretory Carcinoma)**
   - **Justification:** The tumor's microcystic and papillary architecture, abundant bubbly PAS-positive secretions, and immunohistochemical positivity for EMA, CK7, CK19, S100 protein, and GCDFP-15 strongly support this diagnosis. The negativity for DOG1 and p63 further rules out other tumors.

2. **Acinic Cell Carcinoma**
   - **Justification:** Shares some overlapping features but typically shows DOG1 positivity and lacks GCDFP-15 expression.

3. **Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma**
   - **Justification:** Presence of perineural invasion aligns with this diagnosis; however, the immunoprofile and lack of cribriform pattern make it less likely.

4. **Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma**
   - **Justification:** Common malignant tumor with mucin production, but the immunohistochemistry does not match.

5. **Epithelial-Myoepithelial Carcinoma**
   - **Justification:** Biphasic cellular components could explain some features, but immunoprofile is inconsistent.

6. **Basal Cell Adenoma**
   - **Justification:** Benign tumor with basaloid cells; less likely due to evidence of perineural invasion.

7. **Pleomorphic Adenoma**
   - **Justification:** Common benign tumor but does not align with malignant features or immunohistochemistry.

8. **Salivary Duct Carcinoma**
   - **Justification:** Presents with papillary structures but typically in older patients and with different markers.

9. **Warthin Tumor**
   - **Justification:** Benign cystic tumor more common in smokers; histology and immunoprofile do not match.

10. **Oncocytoma**
    - **Justification:** Composed of oncocytic cells, which are not described in this case.

---

**Final Diagnosis:** **Secretory Carcinoma (Mammary Analogue Secretory Carcinoma)**

- **Supporting Evidence:**
  - **Histology:** Microcystic and papillary architecture with abundant bubbly secretions.
  - **Stains:** PAS-positive material within microcystic spaces.
  - **Immunohistochemistry:** Positive for EMA, CK7, CK19, S100 protein, GCDFP-15; negative for DOG1 and p63.
  - **Clinical Features:** Occurs in parotid gland of middle-aged adults; can show perineural invasion.","['Otolaryngology', 'Salivary Gland Disorders', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Oncology', 'Head and Neck Cancer']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,44.0,F

### INPUT:
A 32-year-old woman with a diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy sought care for angina and dyspnea with exertion. Her chest pain and dyspnea were chronic and had recently increased in frequency. Her cardiomyopathy followed a diagnosis of myocarditis after repeated putative chest colds and chest pain at age 14 years, at which time the ejection fraction was reported to be 30%. The results of a graded exercise stress test at 22 years were unremarkable. On examination, she was afebrile. Her heart rate was 68 beats per minute, her blood pressure was 114/77 mm Hg, and her examination was notable for an absence of jugular venous distension, peripheral edema, and murmurs or extra heart sounds. Her electrocardiogram, shown in Figure 1, was notable for right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block, unchanged from her electrocardiogram at age 14 years. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction of 40%. An exercise nuclear stress test revealed a fixed, severe apical defect, a partially reversible severe anterior wall defect, moderate global hypokinesis, and severe hypokinesis of the distal anterior wall and apex. Her ejection fraction was estimated to be 32%. Given these findings, left-sided heart catheterization was performed.

A woman in her 30s with a history of treatment-naive HIV (CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3) and untreated syphilis presented to the emergency department with 3 weeks of progressively worsening dysphonia, dyspnea, and biphasic stridor. On arrival to the hospital, the patient had a computed tomography scan performed; results demonstrated an obstructive laryngeal mass but no signs of local invasion or lymphadenopathy. The patient was taken urgently to the operating room where an awake tracheostomy was performed without complication. Findings of a direct laryngoscopy demonstrated violaceous nodules of the base of the tongue as well as a mass of the infraglottis and subglottis, which was nearly completely obstructing the airway (Figure, A and B). Full physical examination findings also demonstrated violaceous nodules involving the patient’s lower extremities. Results of an excisional biopsy demonstrated a subepithelial spindle cell lesion with extravasation of erythrocytes and stained strongly for human herpesvirus-8 (Figure, C).

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results:

**1. Kaposi's sarcoma**  
- Most likely due to the patient's HIV status with CD4 count < 200 cells/mm³.
- Presence of violaceous nodules on the lower extremities and base of the tongue.
- Biopsy shows subepithelial spindle cell lesion with erythrocyte extravasation.
- Strong positivity for human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), which is characteristic of Kaposi's sarcoma.

**2. Syphilitic gumma**  
- Considered due to untreated syphilis.
- Can cause granulomatous lesions in the larynx.
- Less likely as biopsy findings are not consistent with syphilitic pathology.

**3. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma**  
- Possible in immunocompromised patients.
- May present as a laryngeal mass.
- Biopsy does not support lymphoma.

**4. Fungal infection (e.g., Histoplasmosis)**  
- Immunocompromised patients are susceptible.
- Can cause lesions in the airway.
- Biopsy lacks fungal elements.

**5. Tuberculosis of the larynx**  
- Considered in immunocompromised hosts.
- Biopsy does not show granulomatous inflammation typical of tuberculosis.

**6. Laryngeal papillomatosis**  
- Caused by HPV infection.
- Presents with papillomatous growths, not spindle cell lesions.

**7. Laryngeal carcinoma**  
- Less likely given the patient's age and lack of risk factors.
- Biopsy findings are not consistent with carcinoma.

**8. Sarcoidosis**  
- Can involve the larynx but is less common.
- Biopsy does not show non-caseating granulomas.

**9. Amyloidosis**  
- Rare cause of laryngeal masses.
- Biopsy does not demonstrate amyloid deposits.

**10. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis**  
- Unlikely due to lack of systemic vasculitic symptoms.
- Biopsy does not support vasculitis.","['HIV', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Allergy and Clinical Immunology', 'Laryngology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,30.0,M

### INPUT:
A 38-year-old man without a significant medical history presented with worsening dyspnea and lower extremity edema at 1 week post partum. When at full term, a planned vaginal delivery was complicated by breached position of the fetus, fetal distress, and new onset of fever. The delivery was converted to a cesarean birth, which was uncomplicated. Perioperatively, he had an episode of chest pain that resolved spontaneously. Troponin levels were normal. A vascular ultrasound study ruled out deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremities. A non–electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated computed tomography angiogram showed no pulmonary embolism but was otherwise not diagnostic owing to motion artifacts (Figure 1A). He had progressive dyspnea, mild pulmonary congestion noted on chest radiography, and an elevated brain-type natriuretic peptide level greater than 800 pg/mL (conversion to ng/L is 1:1). Physical examination findings showed a new heart murmur. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed, which showed a normal-sized left ventricle and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, severe aortic regurgitation (AR), and a mildly dilated aortic root (Figure 1B and Video). The patient was transferred to our institution for further treatment. The patient was afebrile at that point, and his white blood cell count was within normal limits.

### INPUT:
A 17-year-old white female patient was referred to the otolaryngology clinic with a 6-month history of a left-sided neck mass. Her primary care physician initially obtained an ultrasonographic image, which demonstrated a left, level 2 lymph node measuring 4.0 × 1.5 × 2.8 cm. The patient then underwent several courses of antibiotic treatment, but the mass persisted. After a period of conservative management, she developed a sore throat and fever. She subsequently underwent a computed tomographic scan of the neck and chest with contrast, which demonstrated an isolated, enlarged, homogenously enhancing left-neck level 2B lymph node measuring 3.4 × 2.8 × 2.1 cm (Figure 1A). When she presented to our facility, she was found to have an asymptomatically enlarged left level 2/5A neck mass that was nontender and fixed. The patient had an unremarkable medical, surgical, and social history and no known infectious exposures. A white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level were both elevated, at 11 310 cells/μL (to convert to cells × 109 per liter, multiply by 0.001) and 56.2 mg/L (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 9.524), respectively. Studies for influenza A and B, HIV, cytomegalovirus, American foulbrood, Bartonella henselae, infectious mononucleosis, and Epstein-Barr virus had negative results. An ultrasonography-guided needle biopsy was performed. Fine-needle aspiration and flow cytometry had negative results for lymphoproliferative disorders or a malignant condition. A tissue culture had negative results. Given the inconclusive diagnosis, the patient underwent a left neck dissection of levels 2A, 2B, and 5A. Intraoperative frozen sections did not show a malignant process. On final analysis, a pathologic examination of the largest lymph node was performed (Figure 1B).

### INPUT:
A 44-year-old woman was referred to the Department of Otolaryngology from the Department of Sleep Medicine for surgical evaluation of her tonsillar hypertrophy. The patient’s medical history was notable for severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) diagnosed in the fall of 2017, when she presented with snoring, progressive daytime fatigue, and several years of migraines. Since her diagnosis, she had been adherent to use of nightly continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). However, she had persistent daytime fatigue and morning headaches. Several months before presentation, the patient noticed that her bite changed from an overbite to an underbite (Figure, A), which had been attributed to dental malocclusion from her CPAP machine. Examination findings of the oropharynx showed an oropharynx score of a Mallampati 4, with 3-plus tonsils and macroglossia without scalloping of the tongue (Figure, B). Nasopharyngolaryngoscopic examination findings showed that the tonsils did not approximate at midline, with a narrow anterior-to-posterior dimension of the airway owing to macroglossia and no retrognathia. On further review of systems, the patient reported growth in her tongue and feet and intermittent swelling with numbness in her hands over the past year.

A 61-year-old white woman with seronegative rheumatoid arthritis presented with hand and wrist pain. Over 2 years, she was prescribed various therapies including prednisone, methotrexate, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, abatacept, and anakinra; she experienced intermittent improvement in her joint pain but had persistently elevated levels of inflammatory markers. She continued to experience asymmetric small- and large-joint polyarthralgias and later developed intermittent fevers (temperatures up to 38.3°C [101°F]) along with a 50-lb (22.7-kg) unintentional weight loss over the course of a few months. On examination, there was subtle synovitis in bilateral metacarpophalangeal joints. Findings on cardiac, pulmonary, and neurologic examinations were unremarkable. Laboratory evaluation was notable for a normocytic anemia and elevated C-reactive protein level (7.7 mg/dL [73.3 nmol/L]). Results of esophagogastroduodenoscopy with gastric biopsies and bone marrow biopsy were unremarkable. Findings on further workup including transthoracic echocardiography to assess for endocarditis, carotid magnetic resonance angiography to assess for vasculitis, and abdominal fat pad biopsy for amyloidosis were also unremarkable. Tocilizumab was initiated. Over the next several months, she developed intermittent abdominal pain, steatorrhea, protein-losing enteropathy, and symmetric bilateral lower extremity edema requiring diuresis. Results of infectious stool studies, celiac serology, and fecal elastase testing were normal. Repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy (Figure, panel A) was performed, with gastric and duodenal biopsies (Figure, panels B and C).

A healthy man in his 60s was referred by his dentist to an oral surgeon for evaluation of a palatal swelling of unknown duration. The patient first presented to his dentist with a complaint of “it feels like there is something on the roof of [his] mouth.” He was never aware of the palatal lesion before his initial presentation. He denied any pain or discomfort from the site, and stated that the increasing size of the mass was what first alerted him to its presence. The extraoral examination results were within normal limits, with no evidence of swelling, expansion, trismus, or lymphadenopathy. Intraoral examination revealed a focally ulcerated, fluctuant 2.5 × 2 × 1-cm pink-red submucosal swelling in the right palatal mucosa (Figure, A). The lesion involved almost the entire right side of the hard palatal mucosa and soft palate and terminated at the palatal midline. Imaging studies were unremarkable.

### INPUT:
A man in his 30s with active bulimia was brought by ambulance to the emergency department after a syncopal event that followed 1 hour of palpitations and intermittent lightheadedness. When emergency responders arrived, the patient was responsive but groggy. An electrocardiogram (ECG) in the field demonstrated a regular wide complex tachycardia. En route to the hospital, 6 mg of adenosine followed by 12 mg of adenosine were administered intravenously, without a change in his rhythm. On arrival to the emergency department, he was in a regular wide complex tachycardia with a heart rate of 225 beats per minute (Figure, A), with an initial blood pressure of 108/77 mm Hg. He was oriented but slow to respond. After sedation, a synchronized, biphasic, 200-J shock converted him to sinus rhythm with bigeminy (Figure, B), which settled to normal sinus rhythm. An intravenous amiodarone infusion was administered. His initial laboratory evaluation revealed hypokalemia (2.8 mEq/L; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1.0), hypomagnesemia (3.6 mEq/L; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.50), and an elevated serum troponin (0.13 nanograms per milliliter; to convert to micrograms per milliliter, multiply by 1.0). Potassium and magnesium replacement was administered orally and intravenously. He reported no family history of sudden cardiac death or unexplained premature death. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal biventricular size and function.

He believed that the neck mass made these episodes worse than normal. The patient was otherwise previously healthy until he developed an upper respiratory infection. His physician noted visible swelling in the right neck and clinically interpreted the finding as enlarged lymph nodes associated with the infection. After 2 weeks, the neck swelling persisted despite the resolution of other symptoms. He was subsequently treated with a course of antibiotics, which did not result in any improvement. The mass slowly enlarged over the next 6 months. The patient reported new symptoms, including waxing and waning pain that radiated to the back of his neck, headaches, and intermittent dysphagia. He also noted periods during which the mass would fluctuate in size. Otolaryngologic examination findings were within normal limits except for a single, nontender, compressible right neck mass deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and extending into level V. The patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan prior to presentation at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center’s otolaryngology clinic. The scan showed a fatty-appearing tumor within the right carotid space. The patient underwent surgical excision, and a mass measuring 8.0 × 6.5 × 4.7–cm was removed from the carotid space (Figure, A). Additional material from the mass was excised at the level of the base of the skull. Gross pathologic examination demonstrated yellowish-brown, homogenous, lobular adipose tissue covered by a thin, tan, transparent membrane (Figure, A). Histopathologic examination showed relatively uniform univacuolar and multivacuolated, granular eosinophilic cells with centrally placed nucleoli (Figure, B and C). In addition, several level II and level III lymph nodes were excised, all of which were found to be benign.

### INPUT:
A 31-year-old male patient presented with right nasal pain and radiating facial pain over the previous 3 years. He reported feeling a mass in his right nostril that had not changed in size, as well as associated nasal tenderness to the external nose, worsening pain with exposure to cold temperatures, and frequent sneezing. Prior to presentation, he had been prescribed fluticasone and loratadine for allergic rhinitis without resolution of symptoms. He denied difficulty breathing, epistaxis, rhinorrhea, fever, chills, weight loss, or night sweats. He was a nonsmoker and nondrinker. On physical examination, his external nose had no visible lesions. A rhinoscopy revealed normal mucosa with a submucosal, round, firm, tender lesion, measuring approximately 1 cm and located on the right anterior nasal septum. No drainage was visualized. His turbinates appeared normal. The patient underwent surgical excision of the septal lesion under general anesthesia for definitive diagnosis. The specimen measured 1.1 × 0.7 × 0.2 cm and was erythematous, soft, vascular, and adherent, with a broad base to the anterior superior nasal septal mucosa just inferior to the upper lateral cartilage (Figure 1A and B). The lesion was excised down through the perichondrium.

A 61-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, psychosis, and recurrent venous thromboembolism was admitted to the emergency department with fatigue, weakness, and arthralgias after an unexplained fall. At presentation, she was experiencing psychosis and being treated in an inpatient psychiatric ward. She was nonadherent with medications and denied drug and alcohol abuse. On examination, she appeared comfortable. Her blood pressure was 150/67 mm Hg; heart rate, 77/min; temperature, 36.7°C (98.1°F); respiratory rate, 16/min; and oxygen saturation, 99% on room air. On both lower extremities, there was peripheral edema with widespread hematomas, scattered ecchymosis, petechiae, and diffuse perifollicular purpura (Figure). The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. Laboratory test results showed a normocytic anemia (hemoglobin level, 5.2 g/dL [reference, 13.5-17.5 g/dL]; mean corpuscular volume, 85 fL [reference, 80-100 fL]); normal platelet count (thrombocytes, 285 ×109/L [reference, 150-400 ×109/L]); and a mild leukopenia (leukocytes, 3.9 ×109 [reference, 4.3-10 ×109/L]). Folic acid level was low (3 nmol/L [reference, ≥5 nmol/L]) and vitamin B12 level was normal (478 pg/mL [reference, 193-982 pg/mL]). Results for iron panel, reticulocyte count, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), international normalized ratio, liver function tests, and levels of indirect bilirubin, haptoglobin, fibrinogen, and creatine kinase were all within reference range. Chest radiographs and computed tomography of the head were negative for any acute pathology. A 12-lead electrocardiogram revealed no abnormalities. Ultrasound of both lower legs showed no thromboembolism.

### INPUT:
A 31-year-old Hispanic man had a 3-year history of a steadily growing, increasingly pruritic, painless mass behind the right ear. The patient denied bleeding from the mass, ear pain, trauma, fever, fatigue, night sweats, or recent illnesses. His medical history included eczema treated with triamcinolone acetonide cream. Otherwise, the patient had no family history or exposure to tobacco or alcohol. On physical examination, a 2-cm, nontender, mobile retroauricular mass with superficial excoriations was palpable over the right mastoid cortex. The patient had no hearing deficits and no fistula into the external auditory canal. There was no palpable head and neck lymphadenopathy. Serologic studies revealed an elevated absolute eosinophil count of 790/μL (reference range, <700/μL; to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001) and an eosinophilia percentage of 9.7% (reference range, <6.0%). The T1-weighted postcontrast magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck showed a heterogeneously enhancing mass with irregular borders in the right retroauricular space, with a tract coursing anteriorly toward the parotid gland (Figure, A).

### INPUT:
A 20-year-old man was referred by his family physician to a community mental health team in London, United Kingdom. His mental state had deteriorated progressively over the previous 12 months, following the death of his father. After a period living alone, he had returned to the family home 4 months prior to his presentation and had been noted to be socially withdrawn, preoccupied, and distractible. His family physician, suspecting a depressive episode, had prescribed citalopram up to a dosage of 40 mg once daily, to no effect. His family subsequently sought advice from the family physician when the patient was noted to be speaking to himself, expressing concerns about people meaning him harm, and professing the belief that he could hear other peoples’ thoughts. The patient had been born in Sierra Leone after a complicated delivery and had traveled to the United Kingdom as a child with his family, who were fleeing from a civil war. On arrival in the United Kingdom, his family claimed asylum and moved into a small apartment in a high-rise building in central London. Although there was no reported developmental delay, he had struggled academically at school and was bullied for having overweight. He left school without qualifications at age 16 years and worked as a shop assistant. He left this job about a year prior to his referral to psychiatry after a period of sick leave following the death of his father. He was a nonsmoker, did not drink alcohol, and denied illicit drug use. A paternal relative was reported to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia. There was no comorbid physical illness. On review, the patient was kempt and had overweight. Eye contact was fleeting, and he presented as anxious, with a degree of psychomotor agitation. His speech was normal in rate, volume, and tone, although tangential. There was no other evidence of thought disorder. He denied feeling low in mood or suicidal and was objectively euthymic. There was some sleep disturbance, with the patient reporting being fearful to go to sleep owing to persecutory beliefs regarding his neighbors. He reflected that over the preceding few months, he had experienced a sensation of detachment from his immediate environment, as though it was not real, making his world similar to that of a video game. He reported that in the apartment where he had previously been living, he had realized that something was amiss and had become convinced that the door number of his neighbor’s flat, number 6, signified that they meant him harm. He explained this was because 6 was associated with the number of the devil. He reported hearing his neighbors commenting negatively about his appearance. These distressing experiences prompted him to return to his family home, but he continued to hear his neighbors’ voices making derogatory comments about his appearance and began to hear them commenting on his actions and thoughts in the third person as well. On returning home, his paranoia regarding his previous neighbors worsened, resulting in him rarely leaving the house. The volume and frequency of derogatory auditory hallucinations also worsened, and he reported hearing the thoughts of others as well. There was a degree of insight, and although the patient was convinced of the reality of his experiences, he also saw the stress of losing his father as associated with his experiences and was accepting of input from mental health services.

### INPUT:
A 45-year-old man was referred to a tertiary care center for hoarseness. He had a left vocal fold polyp that was removed 2 months earlier at an outside institution, with benign pathology reported. Subsequent stroboscopy revealed a hemorrhagic-appearing polyp (2-3 mm). He was sent for preoperative voice therapy, with plans for excision. However, his voice worsened with therapy, and he returned to the otolaryngology clinic after a few weeks. A larger, 6- to 7-mm, irregular, left vocal fold mass was noted. Preoperative imaging was nonspecific, revealing a small soft-tissue density along the true vocal fold. The patient was taken to the operating room for excision (Figure, A). After the final pathology results were obtained, the patient was taken back to the operating room for cordectomy with negative margins.

An 11-day-old girl with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and unilateral renal agenesis presented with a right neck mass and intermittent inspiratory stridor present at birth. The patient did not require positive pressure or intubation, but she had intermittent stridor associated with desaturations. She had feeding difficulty and failure to thrive. On physical examination, the newborn had facial dysmorphism, including a broad and flat nasal dorsum and mild micrognathia. Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed a cystic lesion consistent with a vallecular cyst. A modified barium swallow study demonstrated laryngeal penetration and aspiration of thin and nectar-thick liquids. A diffuse, soft, palpable mass was present along the right neck. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a multispatial mildly enhancing mass within the bilateral retropharyngeal, parapharyngeal, and carotid spaces, with a mildly hyperintense signal relative to muscle on T1-weighted and T2-weighted images and associated restricted diffusion. The mass was largest on the right side, with convex borders, mild superior displacement of the right parotid gland, and posterior displacement of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle (Figure, A, B). The T2-weighted MRI also demonstrated a hyperintense, nonenhancing lesion within the base of the tongue consistent with a vallecular cyst. The thyroid appeared normal and in its expected location, but no thymus was present in the mediastinum. The patient was taken to the operating room for excision of the vallecular cyst, and a fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the right neck mass was performed for cytopathological analysis (Figure, C, D).

### INPUT:
A 33-year-old otherwise healthy black man presented to the emergency department for evaluation of blurry vision in both eyes. He had no relevant medical, family, or ocular history. There was no history of trauma or ocular surgery. One month prior to presentation, he had developed fevers, chills, and coughing. After several days, he had developed redness, pain, photophobia, and blurry vision in his left eye, and he had subsequently developed similar symptoms in his right eye. On presentation, his visual acuity was counting fingers OU. Intraocular pressures were 14 mm Hg OU. A slitlamp examination revealed mild conjunctival redness, 2+ anterior chamber cell, and flare in both eyes, as well as mild posterior synechiae. The cornea was clear without keratic precipitates, and there were no iris nodules. Pigment was present on the anterior lens capsule. A fundus examination demonstrated a moderate amount of vitreous cell, hyperemia and edema of the optic disc, and retinal detachments in both eyes (Figure). The detachments were inferior and shifted with the patient’s head position, suggesting serous detachments. Findings were similar bilaterally. A B-scan ultrasonographic test demonstrated bullous retinal detachments and diffusely thickened choroid.

A 48-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 2-month history of progressive lower extremity weakness, sensory loss, and sphincter dysfunction. In the weeks prior to onset, he traveled to Yosemite National Park but denied any particular infectious exposures or symptoms including rash. He reported no personal or family medical history. Although he did consume a variety of nutraceuticals, he denied medication and recreational drug use. On examination, mental status, cranial nerves, and upper extremities were normal. Lower extremities were significant for his right side having greater pyramidal weakness than the left, with brisk reflexes and right ankle clonus, as well as a sensory level to pinprick at T6. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the total spine with and without gadolinium is seen in Figure 1. Initial investigations were notable for normal complete blood cell count, electrolytes, kidney and liver function, B12, and thyrotropin as well as an unremarkable MRI of the brain. Three lumbar punctures were performed over the course of the patient’s hospitalization, each with a white blood cell count less than 5 /µL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001), normal IgG index, absent oligoclonal bands, normal protein and glucose levels, and benign cytology. A comprehensive infectious and inflammatory workup including HIV, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, Lyme disease, antinuclear antibodies, astrocyte aquaporin-4 autoantibody, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein autoantibody, and serum and cerebrospinal fluid autoimmune panels were negative. Whole-body positron emission tomography demonstrated hypermetabolism of the midthoracic cord.

Final diagnosis: Male breast cancer.
Case report: A 43-year-old African American woman presented with a nontender, self-palpated mass in her left breast. She had hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and obesity and was a current smoker. Her medications included carvedilol, furosemide, lisinopril, metformin, and aspirin but no testosterone or herbal supplements. Family history was significant for a sister with brain cancer, diagnosed in her 40s. On physical examination, her vital signs were within normal limits; her body mass index, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, was 53. Her left nipple was retracted. At the 2-o’clock position of the left breast, 3 cm from the nipple, there was a 3.5 × 3.0–cm firm mass. The right breast was normal without masses, and there was no palpable axillary lymphadenopathy. She underwent a bilateral diagnostic mammogram, which showed a partially obscured mass in the left upper outer quadrant with linear extension to the nipple (Figure, left panel). Targeted ultrasound showed a 2.0 × 1.6 × 1.6–cm irregular hypoechoic mass (Figure, right panel).

### INPUT:
A 66-year-old woman presented to the emergency department for painful and pruritic ulcerative cutaneous lesions involving her back, nose, lips (Figure, A), and mucosal lesions involving her oral cavity and oropharynx. The lesions initially only involved her lips and nasal bridge, and appeared 5 months prior while she was living on a ranch in Mexico. The lesions did not respond to treatment with an unknown oral antibiotic. Her medical history included hypertension treated with captopril and a remote history of psoriasis. Physical examination demonstrated several dry, crusted skin lesions with blistering and ulceration, and shallow erythematous ulcerations of her oral mucosa. Internal medicine, otolaryngology, and dermatology departments were consulted. Results of flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy demonstrated erythematous and ulcerative lesions with surrounding leukoplakia involving the base of tongue, glossoepiglottic fold, lingual and laryngeal surfaces of the epiglottis, and aryepiglottic folds (Figure, C and D). A QuantiFERON-TB Gold test was obtained, and results were found to be positive. Serum antigen testing for blastomyces, histoplasmosis, syphilis, HIV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human herpesvirus 6, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, varicella zoster virus, human polyomavirus 2, and West Nile virus were performed, and all results were found to be negative. A biopsy of the skin lesion was obtained from the edge of the lesion found on the patient’s back (Figure, B). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay serological testing was subsequently performed, and results demonstrated elevated levels of antidesmoglein 1 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and antidesmoglein 3 IgG.

A healthy Asian woman in her 20s presented with a 5-month history of progressive bilateral nasal obstruction. She also complained of recurrent epistaxis. She had no notable medical history except stable asthma. On physical examination, nasopharyngoscopy showed a pedunculated mass with a smooth mucosal surface arising from the roof of the nasopharynx. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging (Figure, A and B) revealed a midline, well-defined, pedunculated polypoid lesion with areas of calcifications in the nasopharynx, measuring approximately 1.2 × 1.5 × 2.0 cm. An endoscopic resection via retrovelar approach using a 70-degree endoscope combined with transnasal approach was performed under general anesthesia. The mass was completely resected with its stalk and with adequate surgical margin. Histopathological results (Figure, C and D) showed that the tumor cells were arranged in papillary structures with fibrovascular cores and these cells also had nuclear grooves. Results of other investigations after surgery were negative for cancer, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neck and thyroid ultrasonography. In addition, no residual tumor or systemic metastasis was observed on positron emission tomography (PET)-CT results. There was no evidence of recurrence at 12-month postoperative follow-up.

### INPUT:
A 51-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and nephrolithiasis presented to the emergency department with left flank and left upper quadrant abdominal pain. She stated that “I think I have a kidney stone blocking my kidney” but denied nausea, vomiting, fever, dysuria, hematuria, or weight loss. She had no history of chronic abdominal pain. Past surgical history was noteworthy for emergency exploratory laparotomy and splenectomy for blunt trauma 14 years prior. Physical examination revealed a comfortable-appearing patient in no acute distress. Her temperature was 36.8°C; pulse, 77/min; and blood pressure, 125/86 mm Hg. Abdominal palpation elicited only mild epigastric tenderness without masses or rebound. There was no costovertebral angle tenderness. Laboratory data revealed normal levels of serum urea nitrogen and creatinine and normal liver function. A complete blood cell count showed leukocytosis (15 300/μL with 54% neutrophils, 38% lymphocytes, 8% monocytes); hemoglobin level, 15.5 g/dL; and hematocrit, 45.2%. Urinalysis revealed no red or white blood cells and was negative for leukocyte esterase and nitrate. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a well-circumscribed mass with a small focus of central high density resulting in surrounding streak artifact (Figure 1).

A 60-year-old man with a history of Lyme disease presented with polydipsia and polyuria and received a diagnosis of diabetes insipidus. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results revealed a thickening and enhancement of the pituitary gland, stalk, and hypothalamus. The abnormal imaging findings improved on subsequent MRIs without treatment. Surveillance pituitary MRIs remained stable. Four years later, MRI results (Figure) revealed bilateral T1 and T2 low-intensity intraconal soft tissue masses with avid enhancement on postcontrast images. The optic nerves were encased with no evidence of infiltration of the nerves, vascular structures, or extraocular muscles. He reported the sensation of eye fullness and denied pain. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. His pupils were symmetric and responded to light and near effort; there was no relative afferent pupillary defect. The results of testing with an Amsler grid and Ishihara color plates were normal. His visual fields were full to confrontation. The optic nerves and retina were normal bilaterally. There was bilateral periorbital swelling and proptosis. Exophthalmometry measurements on a base of 92 were 17 mm on the right and 19 mm on the left. Applanation tonometry results were 12 mm Hg on the right and 15 mm Hg on the left. Extraocular motility examination results revealed substantial (−3) deficits in both eyes. The remainder of the neurologic examination results were normal.

### INPUT:
A 45-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital following 3 weeks of dysphagia; 1 week of nasal regurgitation, nonproductive cough, and breathy voice; and a 25-pound weight loss over the preceding 2 months. She had been diagnosed a year earlier with HIV infection and hepatic tuberculosis. Baseline CD4 count was 7 cells/μL, and following treatment with HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) consisting of dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate, she achieved full virological suppression; however, CD4 counts remained low at 31 cells/μL. She had completed 12 months of directly observed therapy with ethambutol, moxifloxacin, and rifabutin—a liver-sparing regimen—owing to toxic effects from the first-line regimen 1 month prior to admission. Physical examination revealed evidence of perforation of the hard palate (Figure, A). A computed tomographic scan of the chest revealed necrotic lymph nodes, and a palatine biopsy was performed (Figure, B and C).

### INPUT:
A man in his 60s with a history of end-stage renal disease who had a kidney transplant 9 months previously presented with progressive cough, dyspnea, and hoarseness. His history also included chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and a 14-pack-year smoking history. He initially presented 3 months prior with upper respiratory symptoms, which continued to worsen despite oral antibiotic therapy. His cough became productive with white, frothy phlegm that was accompanied by fever, wheezing, hoarseness, and fatigue. His dyspnea worsened in the supine position. Flexible laryngotracheoscopy results revealed diffuse, white-to-yellow pseudomembranous changes involving the glottis and supraglottis (Figure, A), posterior tracheal wall, and left mainstem bronchus with skip lesions in the subglottis and distal 1 cm of the trachea (Figure, B). Glottic mobility was limited in both abduction and adduction with substantial airway obstruction. Computed tomographic findings revealed posterior tracheal wall thickening with the loss of the fat plane between the trachea and esophagus, and a moderate to severe obstruction within the distal left mainstem bronchus. Biopsy results are shown in Figure, C.

### INPUT:
A 59-year-old Hispanic man presented with a 6-month history of intermittent pain in the right posterior mandibular gingiva. His local dentist had prescribed an antibiotic and performed a tooth extraction in the area 6 months prior with no improvement in symptoms. Ultimately, his pain became persistent and radiated to the right lower lip. He had a history of stage IV endometrial serous adenocarcinoma (ESA) 4 years prior that was treated with total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, and peritoneal lavage. He had developed a recurrence for which he had just completed 3 cycles of treatment with carboplatin. He also had a history of anxiety, hypertension, and pterygium, and he was taking gabapentin, lorazepam, prochlorperazine, metoprolol succinate, bromfenac and ketorolac ophthalmic solution, and aprepitant. Intraoral examination revealed a 1.5 × 1.0-cm firm, erythematous gingival mass in the area of missing right mandibular second bicuspid and first molar with buccal and lingual expansion (Figure 1A). The right mandibular first bicuspid was grade 3 mobile. A periapical radiograph was obtained, and results showed a diffuse, poorly demarcated radiolucency measuring approximately 1.2 × 0.8 cm (Figure 1B). Findings from an incisional biopsy of the mass showed an infiltrative tumor (Figure 1C). Tumor cells were positive for CK7, PAX8, and WT-1, and negative for CK20 and TTF-1 (Figure 1C, inset).

### INPUT:
A 70-year-old Indian man presented with a generalized rash over the lower extremity associated with pedal edema extending up to the shins. The onset was gradual and started on the lower extremities and gradually extended to involve the lower trunk. The rash was associated with mild discomfort. The patient denied itching, weeping, or bleeding from the rash. He denied any constitutional symptoms (weight loss, fever, night sweats), joint pains, history of blood in urine, periorbital edema, and recent intake of medications or herbal medications. Social history was significant for 25 pack-years of smoking. Physical examination revealed multiple well-defined, coalescent, erythematous, palpable, purpuralike lesions that were predominantly present over the trunk and lower extremities (Figure, A and B). Laboratory test results at presentation included a hemoglobin level of 11.2 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10), mean corpuscular volume of 84 fL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 72 mm/h, and a lactate dehydrogenase level of 412 IU/L. Hepatic and renal function levels were within normal limits. Complement levels were normal. Hepatitis B and C and HIV profiles were negative. A chest radiograph showed a 2-cm lesion in the upper lobe of the left lung. A computed tomographic scan of the chest showed a spiculated mass in the same region along with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. An ultrasound of the abdomen showed bilateral adrenal masses. A lesional skin biopsy specimen was obtained (Figure, C).

### INPUT:
A woman in her 50s presented with an abdominal skin eruption of 2 days’ duration. Her medical history included hepatitis C, cirrhosis, and an orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) 3 years prior that was subsequently treated with tacrolimus, 5 mg, and mycophenolate, 750 mg, twice daily. Approximately 2½ years after the transplant, the patient developed gastric outlet obstruction secondary to an infiltrative gastric wall mass. The gastric wall mass was found to be associated with plasmablastic posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (pPTLD). She was subsequently instructed to stop use of mycophenolate and decrease use of tacrolimus to 0.25 mg daily, then treated with 1 cycle of CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone) and lenalidomide, resulting in symptomatic and radiologic improvement. Five weeks after treatment with CHOP chemotherapy, the patient presented with an acute-onset abdominal skin eruption without fever or pain. A computed tomographic scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed possible abdominal wall cellulitis, so treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin was empirically started. Physical examination revealed confluent indurated violaceous papules and plaques coalescing into an annular pattern encircling the healed OLT incisional scar with central sparing (Figure 1A). A 4-mm punch biopsy specimen was obtained for histopathological evaluation (Figure 1B and C) and bacterial and fungal cultures.

### INPUT:
A 46-year-old African swimmer presented with a 1-month history of progressive left hearing loss and vertigo. She also reported asthenia, sleep disorders, and urinary frequency. The urinary frequency has been treated for 2 years with many drugs (tamsulosin, desmopressin, and solifenacin) without improvement. The patient had spent her childhood in eastern Africa, where she swam in Lake Tanganyika. Her history did not reveal trauma, infection, or any other associated conditions at the onset of the complaints. The ear, nose, and throat examination revealed a right horizontal nystagmus and a poorly delineated hypoesthesia of the left pinna. She could not walk properly owing to her vertigo. The rest of the clinical examination findings were unremarkable. Additional examinations (ie, pure-tone audiometry, video nystagmography, tympanometry) revealed left profound hearing loss with an air-bone gap of 40 dB and central vertigo. Otoacoustic emissions were absent on the left side. There was no left acoustic reflex. Auditory brainstem responses showed asymmetric interpeak latencies of waves I through V and III through V, suggesting slower conduction on the left side. Computed tomography and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 24 × 20-mm hemorrhagic lesion in the left middle cerebellar peduncle associated with a thickening of the cochleovestibular nerve (Figure). The patient was referred to urology, where a 13 × 8-mm mass was discovered in the lateral wall of the prostate gland. Biopsies of prostate and brain lesions, blood tests, and urinalysis were performed.

### INPUT:
A white woman in her 70s presented with a gradually enlarging right supraorbital mass that had been neglected for 4 years. Her comorbidities included congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and a 50-pack-year history of tobacco abuse. Physical examination revealed a firm, nonmobile, nontender, bulging mass situated over the right frontal sinus, which expanded to the upper right eyelid. The mass covered the globe completely, resulting in total vision obstruction (Figure, A). However, the patient’s vision remained intact when the mass was elevated off the eye with great effort. Her right pupil was round and reactive to light without afferent pupillary defect. No palpable lymphadenopathy was noted. A non–contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a large, right supraorbital mass with bony destruction of the anterior table of the right frontal sinus (Figure, B). It extended into the superior aspect of the orbit, displacing the right globe inferiorly. Air was seen within the mass (Figure, C). A fine-needle aspiration biopsy yielded inconclusive results. After medical clearance, the patient was taken to the operating room for a wedge excisional biopsy with decompression of the right supraorbital mass under monitored anesthesia care. Histopathological investigation revealed large nests of neoplastic epithelioid cells surrounded by fibrotic tissue and necroinflammatory debris. The neoplastic cells contained round nuclei with single prominent nucleoli and abundant clear to vacuolated cytoplasm (Figure, D).

A man in his 30s was referred for evaluation of bilateral papilledema and progressive visual loss in the right eye, which deteriorated to blindness in 3 months. He denied any other neurologic symptoms, such as headache, nausea, vomiting, seizures, and paresis. He had a 4-year history of Behçet disease (BD), and his condition had been stabilized with thalidomide. His optic neuropathy of BD had been treated with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone for 4 days followed by oral prednisone for a month without improvement. His best-corrected visual acuity was no light perception OD and 20/20 OS. Intraocular pressure was 21 mm Hg OD and 19 mm Hg OS. Fundus examination revealed papilledema in both eyes (Figure 1A). No obvious sign of optic disc ischemia or active uveitis was observed by fundus fluorescein angiography bilaterally. Humphrey visual fields showed complete visual field loss in the right eye and peripheral visual field defects in the left eye. His anterior segment was normal in both eyes except for relative afferent pupillary defect in the right eye. Cranial nerve examination was otherwise unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed no remarkable abnormalities except for partially empty sella (Figure 1B). He had normal blood pressure levels. Results of laboratory testing regarding systemic infection were negative, and his serum D-dimer level was normal.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 30s presented with painless swelling of the left upper limb and nodules on the left side of the chest and abdomen. The lesions had started a month previously as red nodules on the left axilla, ipsilateral chest, and back. Twenty days later, she developed edema in the left upper limb. While being evaluated for the cutaneous lesions, the patient was diagnosed with AIDS and began antiretroviral therapy. On examination, 6 erythematous, firm, subcutaneous nodules were present on the left side of the chest, abdomen, and left upper limb, varying in size from 2 × 2 cm to 4 × 4 cm (Figure, A). There was diffuse erythema and edema on the left upper limb, leading to difficulty in limb movement (Figure, A). Multiple dilated superficial vessels were present on the posterior aspect of the left arm and ipsilateral chest wall. Left axillary lymph nodes were grossly enlarged, firm, nontender, and nonmatted, with the largest lymph node measuring 6 × 4 cm. The patient’s CD4 cell count was 141/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001), and her HIV load was 504 473 copies/mL. A skin biopsy sample was obtained from the plaque and sent for histopathologic examination (Figure, B and C).

### INPUT:
A 44-year-old woman with a 2-week history of fevers, night sweats, chills, and petechiae presented with painless, blurry vision in the left eye. Her ocular symptoms began 2 days prior when she noticed dark scotomas in her central field and decreased visual acuity. There was no recent trauma or strenuous physical activity. She had no relevant medical, ocular, or family history, and she denied use of illicit drugs or anticoagulants. Uncorrected visual acuity was 20/30 OD and 20/400 OS. Extraocular motility and intraocular pressures were normal. Results of an anterior examination was unremarkable. Dilated funduscopic examination of the left eye revealed a pink optic nerve with sharp margins, diffuse intraretinal hemorrhages and Roth spots extending from the posterior pole to the far periphery, and preretinal hemorrhage overlying the central macula (Figure, A). Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography through the preretinal macular hemorrhage demonstrated layered blood in the sub–internal limiting membrane space (Figure, B).

### INPUT:
A 31-year-old gravida 1, para 1 man with a history of Wolff-Parkinson-White disease and recently diagnosed stage II Hodgkin lymphoma presented with a pruritic rash. He was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma at 35 weeks’ gestation, and 1 week later he underwent cesarean delivery. At 3 weeks’ postpartum, he began chemotherapy (cycle 1, day 1) with adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD). On day 15 of cycle 1, he presented with linear, hyperpigmented streaks and welts on his arms, back, and legs. Intense, diffuse pruritus had developed within 24 hours of the patient’s first day of treatment, and his symptoms were poorly responsive to antihistamines and topical steroids. Pruritus was followed by the appearance of dark scratch marks as demonstrated in the Figure. Laboratory test results revealed a white blood cell count of 1.6 ×103 cells/mm3, with an absolute neutrophil count of 500 cells/mm3 and a total bilirubin of 0.3 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 17.104), which was unchanged from the baseline total bilirubin.

A woman in her 20s presented with rapidly growing, severely painful oral lesions on the left hard palate of 2 months’ duration. Her medical history was significant for Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia refractory to multiple treatments, including chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, with transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) status posttreatment. At the time of evaluation, she had been hospitalized for 5 months with severe protein-calorie malnutrition, pancytopenia, and recurrent neutropenic fevers. The patient was febrile (38.3°C), with a white blood cell count of 0.5/μL (absolute neutrophil count 0.00; to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001), hemoglobin levels of 7.6g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0), hematocrit 21%, and platelet count 9/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 1.0). She was not receiving active cancer treatment. She appeared cachectic and pale. Intraoral examination revealed poor oral hygiene. The left hard palate exhibited a large swelling with a 5×3-cm indurated area of ulceration, central necrosis, and desquamation (Figure, A). The patient was treated palliatively with dexamethasone solution and nystatin rinse. A biopsy was not recommended owing to medical instability. However, the patient retained a sloughed fragment of the affected tissue, which was submitted for histologic evaluation. A maxillofacial computed tomography (CT) scan completed the etiological investigation.

### INPUT:
A 33-year-old white woman presented with a 5-month history of a progressively necrotic plaque on the nose and scattered nodules on the extremities. The plaque first appeared as a small inflammatory papule on the left nostril. Shortly thereafter, the patient was hospitalized at an outside facility for multifocal pneumonia. She was also treated for a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection of her nose. Despite antibiotic therapy, the papule continued to grow and ulcerate and eventually became necrotic (Figure, A). One month before presentation at our facility, the patient began developing erythematous papules on her arms and legs. The papules enlarged and ulcerated. Some of them healed spontaneously with poxlike scars. She had no recent history of travel. At admission, the patient was tachycardic and febrile to a temperature of 38.5°C. Routine laboratory testing revealed normocytic anemia (hemoglobin, 7.7 g/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10]). Shave biopsies of necrotic nodules on the left arm and left cheek (Figure, B-D) and, later, an excisional biopsy of a cervical lymph node were performed. Head computed tomography demonstrated a soft-tissue mass that encased the nasal bone and extended into the right maxillary sinus and left nasal cavity. Chest computed tomography showed bilateral pulmonary nodules. Physical examination revealed a necrotic plaque with surrounding erythema on the distal nose (Figure, A). A 1 × 1-cm crateriform papule with central necrosis was present on the left malar cheek. Multiple nodules with central, dry necrosis and areas of poxlike scarring were scattered across the extremities. Slight contractures of her fingers were also noted.

**Reranked Differential Diagnosis:**

1. **Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma**
   - The patient's rapidly enlarging scalp lesion, cervical lymphadenopathy, mild normocytic anemia, elevated LDH, and prior abdominal adenopathy point toward a systemic lymphoproliferative disorder like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

2. **Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma**
   - The itchy skin lesion and lymphadenopathy are consistent with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Although more common in younger patients, it remains a possibility.

3. **Leukemia cutis**
   - Skin infiltration by leukemic cells can present with rapidly growing lesions and systemic symptoms like anemia and elevated LDH.

4. **Merkel cell carcinoma**
   - This aggressive neuroendocrine skin cancer presents as a rapidly enlarging, painless lesion in elderly patients but is less likely without sun exposure history.

5. **Cutaneous metastasis from gastric carcinoma**
   - Considering the abdominal pain and weight loss, a gastric carcinoma metastasizing to the skin is possible, though cutaneous metastases are relatively rare.

6. **Malignant melanoma**
   - While melanoma can present as a pigmented lesion, the lack of other typical features makes it less likely.

7. **Squamous cell carcinoma**
   - Common in sun-exposed areas, it can present as an enlarging lesion but usually lacks systemic symptoms.

8. **Angiosarcoma**
   - A rare vascular tumor that can present on the scalp of elderly patients but is less consistent with lymphadenopathy and systemic findings.

9. **Kaposi sarcoma**
   - More common in immunocompromised individuals; the presentation is less typical for this patient.

10. **Basal cell carcinoma**
    - Typically slow-growing and unlikely to cause systemic symptoms like lymphadenopathy or anemia.","['Dermatology', 'Oncology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,67.0,M

A 55-year-old woman with no significant medical history presented with several weeks of malaise and a 6.8-kg weight loss associated with poor appetite. She reported no fevers, night sweats, abdominal pain, emesis, and diarrhea. Physical examination revealed a thin habitus; no palmar erythema, spider angiomas, or gynecomastia were observed. Laboratory tests showed normal complete blood cell count and chemistry panel findings. Hepatic panel showed an elevated alkaline phosphatase level (209 U/L; upper limit of normal [ULN], 150 U/L [3.49 μkat/L; ULN, 2.5 μkat/L]), normal total bilirubin level (0.4 mg/dL [6.84 μmol/L]), elevated alanine aminotransferase level (41 U/L; ULN, 35 U/L [0.68 μkat/L; ULN, 0.58 μkat/L]), and normal aspartate aminotransferase level (27 U/L [0.45 μkat/L]). A single-phase computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed multiple hypoattenuating masses with rim enhancement throughout the liver, intussusception of the small bowel, and normal liver contour with no signs of portal hypertension (Figure 1, left). α-Fetoprotein (AFP) level was elevated (1252 ng/mL; ULN, 9 ng/mL); levels of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (<2 U/mL) and carcinoembryonic antigen (2.8 ng/mL) were normal. A triple-phase CT scan was obtained to further evaluate the small bowel, which revealed no small bowel abnormalities but instead demonstrated a 3.3 × 2.8-cm heterogeneously enhancing pancreatic tail mass not seen on the previous single-phase CT (Figure 1, right).

### INPUT:
A man in his 70s with a history of pulmonary embolism presented to the emergency department with acute right eye vision loss. He described a 2-week medical history of diplopia and blurry vision as well as 4 months of nasal congestion and progressive headaches despite multiple antibiotic courses. He denied a medical history of sinonasal issues, immunodeficiency, autoimmune disease, malignant disease, or diabetes. On examination, he was afebrile with stable vital signs. Ophthalmologic evaluation revealed a right afferent pupillary defect and cranial sixth-nerve palsy. Computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging of the sinuses revealed abnormal soft tissue throughout his sinuses with destruction of the sinus walls and skull base as well as extension of abnormal appearing tissue into the right orbital apex and posterior nasal septum. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated a normal white blood cell count and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level. Nasal endoscopy showed bloody mucus and crusting around the right middle turbinate and sphenoethmoidal recess. The acute nature of his vision loss amid concern for a destructive sinonasal process warranted operative intervention. Abnormal soft tissue with associated destruction throughout his sinonasal cavities and right orbital apex was identified. Frozen sections revealed negative results for fungal elements and cellular dysplasia but demonstrated widespread inflammation with giant cells.

### INPUT:
A 32-year-old Hispanic woman without significant medical history presented with nasal pain and swelling, progressive for 6 weeks. She had been hospitalized for this problem at an outside hospital and treated with antibiotics, without improvement. The swelling worsened and extended to her upper lip. She developed difficulty swallowing, headache, and nasal drainage. On presentation, she was afebrile without leukocytosis. Physical examination demonstrated diffuse swelling and tenderness of the nose with honey-colored crusting that extended to above her upper lip. Axial and sagittal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) (Figure, A and B) demonstrated marked soft tissue swelling and fullness with abnormal enhancement along the nasal cavity, including bilateral nasal ala, with areas of necrosis and emphysema. No significant bony erosion or associated calcification on bone windows was noted. After bedside debridement of the nasal soft tissue region, axial postcontrast T1-weighted fat-suppressed and sagittal T2-weighted fat-suppressed magnetic resonance imaging through the nasal cavity (Figure, C and D) demonstrated soft tissue fullness isointense to muscle on T1-weighted images, hyperintense on T2-weighted images, and with homogenous enhancement of the solid component on postcontrast T1-weighted images.

A boy presented with a left posterior triangle neck mass that had progressed for 3 years following a motor vehicle accident. On physical examination, the mass was firm, mobile, tender to palpation, and caused restricted range of motion. Ultrasound imaging of the soft tissue of the neck was obtained, which demonstrated a neck mass with dense acoustic shadowing (Figure 1A). Further evaluation with contrasted computed tomography (CT) imaging showed a 3.3×2.9×2.6-cm ossified lesion in the left posterior-lateral cervical soft tissue near the atlanto-axial junction. The lesion was well circumscribed and separate from the underlying bone (Figure 1B). The patient underwent excision of the mass without complication. The gross pathology specimen showed a firm, irregular, encapsulated mass.

### INPUT:
A 1-week-old, full-term female newborn presented with increasingly labored breathing, xerostomia, and poor bowel movements. She had been born after an uncomplicated pregnancy, during which routine prenatal ultrasonography had not detected any anatomical abnormalities or lesions. On physical examination, there were no abnormalities other than symmetrical submucosal swelling of the floor of the mouth and a midline external punctum present in the submental area (Figure, A). The tongue was displaced posteriorly and superiorly. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the neck and face performed shortly after presentation showed a midline sublingual lesion extending inferiorly through the mylohyoid muscle (Figure, B-D). The intrinsic muscles of the tongue appeared minimally displaced without obvious infiltration; however, the genioglossus muscle was difficult to locate relative to the mass. A thin-walled, multiloculated lesion was identified, measuring approximately 2.0 × 2.5 × 3.2 cm. The mass was bright on T2-weighted imaging and dark on T1-weighted imaging and did not enhance with intravenous gadolinium. There were no obvious fluid-fluid levels or calcifications. When in-phase and out-of-phase images were compared, there was no significant signal intensity drop, suggesting an absence of fat within the lesion.

### INPUT:
A 50-year-old man with hypertension, diabetes, and allergies presented to the ophthalmology clinic for an evaluation of uveitis after experiencing 9 months of eye redness and pain that started in his right eye and involved both eyes within a few months. The patient had a history of asthma and had recently been hospitalized after radiologic findings of pulmonary infiltrates. The patient was diagnosed with pneumonia, myocarditis, and hypereosinophilic syndrome and received high-dose intravenous corticosteroids. At hospital discharge, the patient’s medications were changed to prednisone, 11 mg orally once daily, and azathioprine, 100 mg orally once daily. Although the severity of the ocular symptoms was variable, there was no improvement with the described medication regimen or with currently prescribed topical corticosteroids given 4 times daily in both eyes. The patient denied rash, headache, and joint pain. Serologic testing ruled out infectious causes of inflammation. On examination, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25 OU. Intraocular pressure for the right eye was 16 mm Hg and for the left eye was 24 mm Hg. Slitlamp examination showed trace hyperemia of the right eye and 2+ diffuse scleral hyperemia of the left eye (Figure). Corneas were clear bilaterally, and sensitivity was symmetric and full. There was no cell or flare in the anterior chamber, and he had clear lenses with normal irises. The fundus examination was unremarkable bilaterally with no vitreous cell or haze, a flat macula, a cup-disc ratio of 0.3, and a peripheral retina without holes or tears.

A man in his mid-60s with a history of breast cancer (status post lumpectomy 7 years earlier [N0, M0]) and benign thyroid nodules presented for evaluation of right-sided proptosis. Bulging of the right eye was first noted 6 months earlier elsewhere when he reported progressive proptosis, worsening vision, and tearing in the right eye. He did not report any pain or diplopia. Visual acuity was 20/150 OD (no improvement with pinhole) and 20/20 OS. Pupillary reaction and confrontational visual fields were normal. External examination was notable for proptosis of 7 mm, hypoglobus, and resistance to retropulsion. A firm, nontender mass was palpable in the right superotemporal orbit. The palpebral lobe of the right lacrimal gland was erythematous and prominent compared with the normal-appearing left lacrimal gland. Ocular motility showed −2 abduction deficit, right eye. Slitlamp examination revealed pseudophakia and posterior capsular opacification (right > left), but was otherwise normal. Sensation was normal in the V1, V2 distribution, and there was no preauricular, submandibular, or anterior cervical lymphadenopathy. Computed tomographic scan of the orbits without contrast from an outside facility revealed a spherical mass of unclear cause in the area of the right lacrimal gland.

An otherwise healthy man in his 30s presented to an outside health care professional with a 2-day history of floaters in his left eye. He denied additional ocular symptoms and reported no relevant medical, ocular, or family history; medication use; or allergies. The findings of a review of systems were unremarkable. A workup for posterior uveitis was initiated, and the patient began therapy with oral antiviral and oral corticosteroid medications. One week later, his symptoms had worsened, and he was referred for consultation. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/15 OD and 20/60 OS. Intraocular pressures, extraocular movements, visual fields by confrontation, and pupil responses were normal. Anterior segment examination and dilated fundus examination of the right eye had normal findings. However, the left eye had 3+ anterior chamber cell and 1+ flare, nongranulomatous keratic precipitates, and a clear lens. The dilated fundus examination revealed 2+ vitritis, a hyperemic disc with blurred margins, macular striae with a blunted foveal reflex, and vascular sheathing with segmental periarteriolar inflammatory plaques in multiple quadrants. The peripheral retina had well-demarcated peripheral retinal whitening with scalloped margins and intraretinal hemorrhages in all quadrants (Figure 1A and B). Four days later, repeat fundus photography showed that the peripheral lesions had coalesced into larger circumferential necrotic regions (Figure 1C).

### INPUT:
A farmer in his 50s presented with bilateral periauricular swelling that began 6 months prior (Figure 1). The swelling was mild at onset and gradually progressive. There was no history of associated pain, but she reported occasional pruritus over the swelling. There was no history of fever, weight loss, or loss of appetite. She denied any history of similar swelling elsewhere in her body. General physical and systemic examination had normal results. On examination of the swelling on the right side, there was a diffuse swelling around the pinna measuring approximately 6 cm over the preauricular, postauricular, and infra-auricular region. It was a nontender, soft swelling without fluctuation and abnormal pulsations. There were similar findings in the left side. Mouth opening was adequate, secretions from both parotid ducts were normal, and facial nerve function was intact on both sides. She had undergone fine-needle aspiration cytology and incisional biopsy. The results of both were consistent with reactive lymphadenitis. She was prescribed oral antibiotics for 1 week but showed no improvement. A contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan of the head and neck showed bilateral multiple enhancing lymph nodes in the postauricular region, the largest measuring 16 × 11 mm2 on the right side and 15.4 × 10.6 mm2 on the left, along with bilateral intraparotid nodes, the largest measuring 16.4 × 10.2 mm2 on the right and 15.3 × 10.7 mm2 on the left side. Her serum eosinophil count was slightly elevated, and her erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 15 mm/h. However, the IgE level was not measured. She was then scheduled for excisional biopsy at our center. The biopsy specimen included skin and subcutaneous tissue along with 2 underlying lymph nodes.

### INPUT:
A man in his 60s presented for initial dermatologic evaluation of a 2-year history of a pruritic and sometimes burning hyperpigmented eruption on the bilateral palms. The eruption had gradually spread from the left palm to the right palm and then focally onto the bilateral volar aspect of the wrists in recent months (Figure, A and B). He had not experienced involvement of the plantar surfaces. No additional concerns were reported, and there was no family history of similar lesions. There was no known history of travel in relation to onset of the lesions. Limited clinical examination revealed well-marginated brown atrophic patches on the bilateral palms extending focally onto the volar aspect of the wrist and centrally surmounted by spiny keratotic pits in the palmar creases. Two punch biopsy specimens were obtained for diagnostic clarification (Figure, C and D).

### INPUT:
A 63-year-old woman with a history of well-controlled hypertension, lumbar stenosis, and hip arthroplasty with revisions presented with bilateral loss of vision and hearing for several weeks. She also reported a history of painful paresthesias at her feet beginning about 1 year prior. On examination, her visual acuity was initially 20/80 OD and 20/200 OS; it deteriorated over the next 2 months to finger counting bilaterally. The Weber test gave a nonlateralizing result, and bone conduction hearing was absent bilaterally. There was length-dependent loss of vibratory sensation and absent reflexes at both lower extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated abnormal enhancement of bilateral optic nerves (Figure, A). Optical coherence tomography and fluorescein angiogram were normal. Nerve conduction studies showed mild sensory axonal polyneuropathy. Laboratory tests were notable for elevated thyrotropin (63 mlU/ml), low levels of free thyroxine (T4) (0.2 ng/dL), and elevated levels of cerebrospinal fluid protein (94 mg/dL). Cerebrospinal fluid IgG index, oligoclonal bands, aquaporin 4 antibody, paraneoplastic panel, and protein electrophoresis test results were all normal. She was treated empirically with high-dose steroids and plasmapheresis, with no improvement in symptoms.

### INPUT:
A postmenopausal man in his mid-50s with a known history of endometriosis and adenomyosis presented to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain that he rated 10 of 10 in intensity and which had developed suddenly 5 days before presentation. The abdominal pain was associated with diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal bloating. On examination, the patient was afebrile and his abdomen was soft and nondistended without guarding or rebound but tender in the left lower quadrant. The patient had a palpable nodule in the posterior vaginal fornix and fullness in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen on bimanual examination. Laboratory investigations had normal findings with the exception of an elevated cancer antigen 125 level of 158 U/mL (to convert to kilounits per liter, multiply by 1.0). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple abnormal findings that included a bulky uterus with a thickened myometrium, endometriomas, right pleural effusion, pelvic peritonitis and ascites, enlarged lymph nodes, and solid extracolonic implants in the omentum caudal to the transverse colon (Figure, A) and in the cul-de-sac adjacent to the upper rectum (Figure, B).

### INPUT:
A man in his early 50s with hypothyroidism and a 10-month history of painless lumps in his neck presented with achiness and decreased visual acuity in his right eye for 2 months. Associated symptoms included dysphagia and fever and chills. A previous otolaryngology evaluation revealed an intranasal mass with enlargement of multiple submandibular lymph nodes. A needle aspiration biopsy of 1 of the submandibular lymph nodes revealed atypical cells with mature lymphocytes. Computed tomography of the sinus confirmed a nasal polyp and a soft tissue mass in the right lacrimal gland region. The excised nasal polyp was benign. Incisional biopsy of the lacrimal gland lesion revealed chronic inflammatory infiltrate composed of predominantly T cells with scattered B cells and mature plasma cells, but no evidence of a lymphoproliferative process. The patient was referred for evaluation in our clinic. Ocular history was noncontributory. On examination, visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/25 OS. Intraocular pressure was unremarkable and ocular motility was intact in both eyes. Clinical evaluation revealed a firm mass of 5 × 4 × 3 cm fixed to the superotemporal orbital rim in the right lacrimal gland region (Figure 1) with intact overlying skin. Slitlamp examination was unremarkable in both eyes without evidence of conjunctival inflammatory signs. Ophthalmoscopic examination was unremarkable in both eyes without compression of the optic nerve or disc edema.

A pregnant man in his late 30s had normal findings on anatomic ultrasonography at 19 weeks’ gestation. Follow-up ultrasonography at 32 weeks’ gestation identified fetal hydrops. The fetal ultrasonogram showed a large left-sided hydrothorax, mediastinal shift, and ascites. After ruling out infectious causes, an ultrasonography-guided thoracoamniotic shunt was placed successfully at 32 weeks’ gestation. Results of follow-up ultrasonography on postoperative day 3 showed improvement in the fetal hydrothorax and resolution of hydrops and identified a feeding vessel originating from the descending aorta supplying a lung mass (Figure 1A).

### INPUT:
An adolescent boy presented with a 3-month history of a growing, painless mass in the right thigh. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed an inhomogeneous nodule in the subcutaneous layer with a largest diameter of approximately 5 cm. No enlarged lymph nodes were detectable in the groin. Results of a complete blood cell count and levels of alkaline phosphatase, lactic dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein were unremarkable. An ultrasonography-guided core needle biopsy was performed, and histopathologic evaluation showed the aspects of a small round-cell tumor, which was confirmed to be a Ewing sarcoma by immunohistochemical and molecular analysis (with positivity for the EWS-FLI1 fusion gene [OMIM 133450]). The patient then underwent disease staging with computed tomography (CT) of the chest and whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). The CT findings were negative for secondary lesions; the FDG-PET scan demonstrated, as expected, high uptake in the right thigh (maximum standard uptake variable [SUVmax], 8.4) at the site of the subcutaneous tumor and at a second lesion in the left ankle joint (SUVmax, 12.0). The patient reported vague pain around the left ankle but no functional limitations and no history of trauma at that site. A radiograph of the ankle did not show calcifications within the soft-tissue lesion. An MRI scan of the ankle showed a 1.5-cm soft tissue mass in the posterior recess of the ankle joint with a low to intermediate signal in T1- and T2-weighted sequences and moderate contrast enhancement throughout the lesion (Figure 1).

### INPUT:
A healthy 8-month-old female infant was admitted for management of a rapidly progressive, painful anogenital ulcer. The lesion had developed acutely over 48 hours, starting as symmetric pink patches leading to pustules, erosions, and ulceration. Associated symptoms included generalized fatigue, but no fevers, chills, or other systemic symptoms. The child’s parents denied any new topical exposures or medications. The child was born via vaginal delivery at full term. Pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes. The child had no major medical issues and met all developmental milestones. There was no relevant family medical history. Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics were initiated on admission. Dermatology was consulted prior to scheduled debridement and skin grafting. Physical examination revealed a well-appearing infant with normal vital signs. Extending from the gluteal cleft to just medial to the labia, there was a symmetric, well-defined ulcer with a cribriform base, central necrosis, and rolled, pink-to-violaceous, undermined border (Figure, A). Initial laboratory workup was significant for leukocytosis (22 000/mm3) and thrombocytosis (764 000/mm3). Serum zinc and alkaline phosphatase were within normal limits. A punch biopsy of the edge of the ulcer was obtained and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (Figure, B and C). Microbial stains were negative. Tissue cultures for anaerobic and/or aerobic, mycobacterial, and fungal organisms were all negative, though wound cultures grew Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Enterococcus faecalis. Viral cultures were negative.

The right pupil was 3.5 mm and briskly reactive, while the left pupil was 8.5 mm and unreactive to light or near effort; there was no relative afferent pupillary defect. Results of testing with the use of an Amsler grid and Ishihara color plates were within normal limits. Visual fields were full to confrontation. The optic nerves and retina were normal in both eyes. External examination was notable for left periorbital swelling, proptosis, and moderate ptosis of the upper eyelid (Figure 1A). Extraocular motility examination results were normal in the right eye but demonstrated severe ophthalmoparesis of the left eye: 0% supraduction (Figure 1B), 20% of normal abduction/adduction, and 10% of normal infraduction (not pictured). Corneal reflex was normal in the right eye but diminished in the left eye, and facial strength was normal bilaterally. The remainder of the neurologic examination results were normal.

A boy in his midteens presented to an ophthalmology practice with his parents reporting worsening blurry vision on the right side for the past 2 weeks. He had a history of migraine headaches, for which he took nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for symptomatic relief. At his examination, he reported feeling tired but denied other medical problems. On examination, his visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Intraocular pressure was 15 mm Hg OU, extraocular motility was normal, and findings of the anterior segment examination were normal. There was no afferent pupillary defect, and dilated fundus examination revealed healthy-appearing optic nerves and normal retinas. Automated perimetry demonstrated a right-sided homonymous hemianopia. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain performed the same day revealed subacute infarction of portions of the left occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes (Figure).

### INPUT:
A man in his early 50s was referred for decreased vision. Symptom onset was approximately 3 months prior to presentation when the patient began reporting difficulty reading. He was initially evaluated by his local eye care professional and noted to have visual acuity of 20/100 OD and 20/25 OS with cecocentral visual field defect in the right eye. Results of ophthalmoscopic examination of the optic nerves at this time revealed mild elevation of the optic nerves. Magnetic resonance imaging findings of the orbits were normal. At presentation 3 months after onset of decreased vision, the patient reported that his vision continued to worsen. Best corrected visual acuity was measured at 20/400 OD and 20/40 OS. Both optic nerves were found to be mildly hyperemic with a few telangiectatic vessels on the left and trace temporal pallor on the right. Color vision was 3/13 in the right eye and normal in the left. There was no relative afferent pupillary defect. The patient’s 24-2 Humphrey visual field in the right eye is shown in the Figure. The left eye had a very similar pattern.

### INPUT:
A 44-year-old African American man without traditional atherosclerotic risk factors or known coronary artery disease (CAD) presented to the emergency department with chest pain. He had 3 previous children (2 live births and 1 spontaneous abortion); his last child was born more than 5 years ago. His chest pain began spontaneously 1 hour prior to presentation and was described as retrosternal with radiation to his upper and middle back. On physical examination, his blood pressure was 128/88 mm Hg, his pulse was regular at 96 beats per minute, his respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute, and his temperature was 36.9° C. Pulse oximetry was 100% in room air. The chest was nontender. Pertinent physical findings included normal central venous pressures, clear lung fields, normal first and second heart sounds, an audible fourth heart sound, and no murmurs. The electrocardiogram (Figure 1A) demonstrated anterior ST-segment elevations consistent with an anterior acute current of injury. Results from the chest radiography were normal. Initial troponin I concentration was 0.02 ng/mL but rose to 177.76 ng/mL over the ensuing 4 hours (the patient’s chest pain had resolved by this time). Urgent coronary angiography was performed (Figure 1B). Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow grade 2 was observed in the left anterior descending artery and second diagonal branch.

**Step 10:** Sickle cell disease-related myocardial ischemia

---

**Reranked Differential Diagnosis using all patient information and test results:**

1. **Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD)**
   - *Reasoning:* The patient is a 44-year-old individual with prior pregnancies, suggesting potential hormonal or connective tissue factors that predispose to SCAD. SCAD is a non-atherosclerotic cause of myocardial infarction, more common in women but can occur in individuals with a history of pregnancy. The lack of traditional atherosclerotic risk factors and acute coronary findings support this diagnosis.

2. **Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome**
   - *Reasoning:* A history of spontaneous abortion raises suspicion for antiphospholipid syndrome, which can cause arterial thrombosis leading to myocardial infarction in the absence of atherosclerosis.

3. **Acute myocardial infarction due to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease**
   - *Reasoning:* Despite the absence of traditional risk factors, coronary artery disease remains a common cause of MI. The patient's age and ethnicity may contribute to non-traditional risk factors.

4. **Coronary vasospasm (Prinzmetal angina)**
   - *Reasoning:* Coronary vasospasm can cause myocardial ischemia and infarction with ST-segment elevations. It tends to occur at rest and may explain the acute presentation.

5. **Takayasu arteritis**
   - *Reasoning:* This large-vessel vasculitis can involve the coronary arteries, leading to ischemia. It is more common in younger individuals and can present with myocardial infarction.

6. **Cocaine-induced myocardial infarction**
   - *Reasoning:* Cocaine use causes vasospasm and thrombosis. While there is no mention of substance use, it remains a differential in acute MI in younger patients.

7. **Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (stress-induced cardiomyopathy)**
   - *Reasoning:* Often presents with chest pain and ST-segment changes but typically does not show significant coronary artery obstruction on angiography.

8. **Aortic dissection**
   - *Reasoning:* Presents with chest pain radiating to the back. However, normal chest radiography and absence of mediastinal widening make this less likely.

9. **Coronary embolism from infective endocarditis**
   - *Reasoning:* Could cause acute coronary occlusion, but there's no evidence of infection or embolic phenomena.

10. **Sickle cell disease-related myocardial ischemia**
    - *Reasoning:* Sickle cell disease can cause vaso-occlusion leading to MI. Less likely without a history of sickle cell disease or anemia.","['Radiology', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Acute Coronary Syndromes', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiac Imaging']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,44.0,F

A child younger than 10 years presented with an 8-week history of bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy unresponsive to a 10-day course of Augmentin (GlaxoSmithKline). The patient’s parents denied any associated fevers, chills, night sweats, sore throat, abdominal pain, or weight changes. Medical history was noncontributory. Physical examination showed bilateral, mobile, nontender cervical lymphadenopathy without erythema or swelling. Tonsils were symmetric and not enlarged. There was no noticeable thyromegaly or nodules. Laboratory testing was significant for an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (37 mmol/h). Ultrasonography demonstrated cervical lymphadenopathy bilaterally with the largest node measuring 3.8 cm in maximum dimension. Lymph node needle core biopsy demonstrated increased histiocytes and numerous plasma cells on tissue section (Figure, A). Scattered neutrophils and rare giant cells were also present. Findings of Grocott methenamine silver, acid-fast, and Warthin-Starry stains were negative. The CD-68 immunostain showed numerous histiocytes. The specimen stained positive for CD-30 and S-100 immunostains showing emperipolesis (Figure, B and C). Findings of a CD1a stain were negative.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 30s presented with a slow-growing mass in the upper lip that had developed over several years. She had no history of underlying medical diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, hepatitis, and tuberculosis. On physical examination, a whitish, firm, painless, nodular mass on the superficial layer of the left upper lip was observed (Figure, A). Given the possibility of a tumorous lesion, complete excision was planned under local anesthesia. In surgery, the 1.5 × 1.2 cm, whitish, firm, nodular, and well-encapsulated mass was excised completely without rupture of the capsule from the surrounding mucosa. On histopathologic examination, an encapsulated salivary gland tumor with epithelial and myoepithelial cells, ductlike structures, and mixed stroma was observed (Figure, B). One month after surgery, the surgical wound on the left upper lip was clean and well healed. One year later, there had been no recurrence, and the patient had no symptoms at the left upper lip.

### INPUT:
A woman in her late 20s presented with mildly itchy, erythematous plaques of 3 months’ duration on both legs. The lesions started to appear on the left pretibial region as small papules, which gradually increased in size and coalesced to form bigger plaques. No history of local trauma, prolonged standing, and occupational exposure to mineral dust or recent drug intake was recollected. She was not diabetic. On examination, large, ill-defined, erythematous plaques were present on the pretibial areas extending onto the lateral aspect of both legs. The plaques were surmounted by multiple, discrete atrophic scars. The periphery of the plaques showed increased vascularity in the form of telangiectasias and venous prominences, along with atrophy of the overlying skin (Figure, A). There were no lesions elsewhere on the body. A skin biopsy sample was obtained from the plaque and sent for histopathological examination (Figure, B and C).

### INPUT:
A Korean American man in his early 60s was referred for evaluation of bilateral acute-angle closure and retinal detachments. He had emmetropia, and his ocular and medical history were unremarkable. Over the preceding few days, he noticed worsening blurry vision with redness in both eyes associated with headaches, nausea, and severe tinnitus. On presentation, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/200 OD and 20/400 OS. Intraocular pressure was 45 mm Hg OU. Pupils were 4 mm and minimally reactive. There was 1+ conjunctival injection, diffuse corneal edema with Descemet folds, and the anterior chamber was shallow in both eyes. After the administration of multiple rounds of topical and oral medications, his intraocular pressure improved to 18 mm Hg OD and 19 mm Hg OS. A dilated fundus examination revealed tilted discs, serous retinal detachments, and multiple yellow, depigmented chorioretinal spots throughout the posterior pole in both eyes. B-scan ultrasonography showed shallow retinal detachments, choroidal thickening, and extensive, shallow choroidal detachments extending anteriorly in both eyes (Figure 1A). A-scan ultrasonography showed normal axial length of 22 mm OU. Optical coherence tomography indicated subretinal fluid and enhanced depth imaging demonstrated significant choroidal thickening in both eyes (Figure 1B). Fluorescein angiography revealed pinpoint hyperfluorescence with leakage. Indocyanine green angiography showed diffuse leakage throughout the posterior pole in both eyes.

An African American man in his 30s with metastatic soft tissue sarcoma of the right lower extremity, with a medical history of above-knee right leg amputation, received treatment with nivolumab (an anti–programmed cell death 1 [anti–PD-1] antibody) with an initial good tolerance. His medical history was negative for any skin cancers. After 2 months of treatment, the patient presented with diffuse hyperpigmented macules. This was thought to be related to his chronic atopic dermatitis and he was prescribed topical steroids and moisturizing. Four months later the patient presented with diffuse macular cutaneous eruption and pruritus. A skin punch biopsy of the back revealed mild epidermal acanthosis, focal parakeratosis, and interface dermatitis with numerous dyskeratotic cells and underlying lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate with scattered dermal melanophages. Oral steroids were prescribed and 3 weeks later the rash had resolved; however, the patient developed numerous hypopigmented macules and patches, covering more than 30% of his body surface area (Figure, A) compared with the prior skin examination (Figure, B). A new biopsy showed epithelial basal vacuolar changes, underlying lichenoid lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with scattered eosinophils and interface dermatitis with marked pigment incontinence and a reduced number of junctional melanocytes (Figure, C).

An elderly woman presented to the emergency department describing unremitting pain in the left iliac fossa with accompanying tenderness, fever, and tachypnea. She also noted swelling in her left inguinofemoral region, left scrotum, and left femur. Her symptoms started 2 days before admission and the pain was progressively worsening. The patient did not report vomiting, constipation, or change in her bowel habits. Her history was significant for hypertension and hypothyroidism; her last colonoscopy, 4 years ago, revealed diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon. The patient’s condition was stable (blood pressure, 130/85 mm Hg, heart rate, 88 beats/min), but she was febrile (temperature, 38.6°C). Physical examination showed cellulitis in her left inguinal canal, scrotum, and femur along with sensitivity in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. Initial laboratory test findings exhibited white blood cell count of 16 700/μL (to convert to 109/L, multiply by 0.001) and C-reactive protein of 340 mg/L (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 9.524). Chest roentgenogram was negative for free air under the diaphragm but was remarkable for some air-fluid levels. The patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with oral contrast (diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium solution) (Figure, A and B).

### INPUT:
A 12-month-old healthy girl was seen at the outpatient ophthalmology clinic with gradually worsening bilateral temporal facial swelling and proptosis that developed in the setting of a recent bilateral ear infection 10 days prior. She was currently being treated with oral amoxicillin. Her mother reported a recent decrease in appetite, decreased feeding, increased irritability, and near-constant crying. On examination, she was inconsolable and crying. Her pulse rate was 112 beats/min, blood pressure was 122/68 mm Hg, and temperature was 38.7°C. She had soft, bitemporal facial masses (Figure, A). She was proptotic and demonstrated a substantial change in her ocular appearance compared with photographs taken 4 weeks earlier that her mother brought for our review. She appeared to be orthophoric in primary gaze but had bilateral abduction deficits. Her pupils were round and reactive, without an afferent pupillary defect. Her anterior and posterior segment examination results were normal, without evidence of optic nerve edema or pallor. Her pediatrician had obtained a complete blood cell count and head radiograph 10 days prior that were both normal.

### INPUT:
A middle-aged white man presented to the ophthalmology clinic for a third opinion. The patient had been experiencing redness, tearing, and foreign-body sensation in both eyes for 7 months. He was diagnosed with giant papillary conjunctivitis and follicular conjunctivitis by ophthalmologists at other institutions and was treated with topical corticosteroids and oral doxycycline. Topical corticosteroid eyedrops (0.5% loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension) seemed to control his symptoms, but attempts to wean the medication resulted in recurrence. He denied any significant ocular history. His medical history included hypothyroidism and breast cancer in the setting of Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic disorder with a predisposition to various cancers, including carcinoma of the colon, breast, and uterus. At the time of examination, visual acuity was 20/25 OU. Pupil anatomy, intraocular pressure, confrontation visual fields, and extraocular movements were within normal limits. Slitlamp examination revealed mild meibomian gland dysfunction bilaterally, and follicular conjunctivitis was evident on eversion of all 4 eyelids. The bulbar conjunctiva demonstrated hyperemia and elevation medially (Figure 1). The remainder of the examination, including dilated funduscopic examination, was within normal limits.

### INPUT:
A 46-year-old woman with salivary duct carcinoma of the right parotid gland presented for evaluation of a 3-week history of multiple new pruritic skin lesions on the right chest. The patient’s salivary duct carcinoma was androgen receptor positive and HER2 positive. She had previously undergone parotidectomy followed by radiation therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and trastuzumab. She had continued with androgen-deprivation therapy and palliative radiation therapy for osseous metastases. The patient endorsed erythematous skin changes within the field of radiation and a 2-month history of painful right upper extremity lymphedema that began after her most recent radiation treatment. She denied fevers or other systemic symptoms associated with the onset of the skin lesions. Physical examination revealed numerous nontender, firm, pebblelike, pink papules on the right anterior neck, upper chest, and back, arising on a background of confluent blanchable violaceous erythema (Figure, A), as well as similar-appearing lesions on the right chest wall on a background of normal-appearing skin. Concurrent skin biopsies from the right chest wall, clavicular area, and upper right back were performed (Figure, B and C).

### INPUT:
A woman in her 30s with a medical history of asthma, social history of smoking, and allergy to shellfish presented to the emergency department with tongue swelling. The patient reported a history of a local burn from hot food but denied any history of trauma, foreign body, or piercing. She was evaluated, given a presumptive diagnosis of sialadenitis, and discharged home with ibuprofen and clindamycin. She returned several days later with worsening tongue swelling, voice change, and subjective fever. Postcontrast axial computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a midline lesion within the oral tongue that was predominantly hypodense and demonstrated rim enhancement. No calcifications were seen within the lesion (Figure, A). The lesion was predominantly isointense to muscle on axial T1-weighted images without intravenous (IV) contrast (Figure, B). Axial T2-weighted images with fat saturation showed predominantly hyperintense signal relative to muscle as well as punctate internal foci of T2 hypointensity (not shown). The lesion was hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging (Figure, C) and hypointense on the apparent diffusion coefficient map (not shown). Sagittal T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with IV contrast and fat suppression demonstrated signal hypointense to muscle centrally with peripheral enhancement (Figure, D).

### INPUT:
A previously healthy 18-year-old college student presented to the emergency department with a 6-month history of fatigue, dry cough, dyspnea, and unintentional weight loss of 18 kg (from 100 to 82 kg). Four months ago, she was treated for presumed pneumonia with azithromycin without improvement. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use intravenous drugs. She was born in the United States and had not traveled outside of the country. She took no medications. On examination, her temperature was 37°C, heart rate 110/min, blood pressure 123/72 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 20/min. She had a palpable 2×2-cm firm, nontender, right supraclavicular lymph node and decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion in the right lower lung field. No hepatosplenomegaly or leg edema was noted. Routine laboratory tests, including complete blood cell counts, renal function, electrolytes, and hepatic function, were within normal limits. A chest x-ray demonstrated diffuse homogeneous opacification of the right lung field. Computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a 15 × 11-cm centrally necrotic mass in the right anterior mediastinum displacing the trachea to the left, a large right pleural effusion, and compression of the superior vena cava (Figure 1).
