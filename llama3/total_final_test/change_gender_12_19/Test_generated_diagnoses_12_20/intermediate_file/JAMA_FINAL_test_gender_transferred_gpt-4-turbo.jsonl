Recently, the motion of her right limb joint was slightly limited. She was born to healthy parents and did not have any medical disease. On physical examination, there was an ill-defined, stony-hard plaque involving her right thigh above the patella extending to her right buttocks with loss of skin elasticity. The affected skin was associated with mild hypertrichosis and hyperpigmentation (Figure 1A). Laboratory tests revealed normal results for routine blood tests, autoantibodies, immunoglobulins, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Magnetic resonance imaging of the right thigh demonstrated slight thickening of subcutaneous tissue and T2 signal abnormality (Figure 1B).

He reported severe pruritus in the affected area. He had no history of skin diseases, allergies, or cardiovascular disease. Medications for the patient’s myasthenia gravis included prednisone tablets (20 mg daily), tacrolimus (1.5 mg twice per day), pyridostigmine bromide (30 mg daily), and losartan potassium (50 mg daily) for hypertension. On presentation, the patient’s temperature was 37.8 °C; heart rate, 120 beats/min, blood pressure, 120/65 mm Hg; and oxygen saturation levels, 97% on room air. On physical examination, the confluent erythema with scales involved more than 95% of body surface area, including the patient’s head, trunk (Figure 1A), and extremities, but results on mucosal examination were unremarkable.

The initial best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 4/20 (approximately 20/100), and an irregular superficial corneal ulcer with an epithelial defect size of 3 mm × 5 mm was found in the center of edematous cornea. He received penetrating keratoplasty 4 months later, as the ulcer did not heal with intensive medication. Then, topical tobramycin dexamethasone, topical tacrolimus, and daily oral prednisone, 40 mg, were prescribed, with a gradual taper of prednisone to a maintenance dose of 10 mg. At 5-month postoperative follow-up, some thin snowflakelike matter was found deposited on the iris and in the angle, with rare cell and mild flare in the anterior chamber.

Born by cesarean delivery to nonconsanguineous parents, he developed difficulties with head control, standing, and feeding at age 10 months. Subsequently, he faced progressive motor challenges (walking, speech, and swallow); contractures in his fingers, toes, wrists, and knees; and scoliosis. In adolescence, he experienced progressive stiffness, episodes of painful spasms and oculomotor crisis, and galactorrhea unrelated to childbirth in adulthood. His symptoms worsened with age and progressed to his using a wheelchair, having difficulty in speech, and not having access to education. He had a younger brother with similar symptoms who passed away at age 20 years of unknown causes. Upon presentation at age 31 years, he was admitted to our center for further evaluation. He had thin limbs and was of standard height. The neurological and psychological examinations revealed scoliosis, contractures in his fingers and toes, carpal inversion, dysarthria, dysphagia, hypertonia, decreased tendon reflexes, absence of Babinski sign (Figure, A and B), and no psychiatric problems. Blood test results indicated hyperprolactinemia (prolactin level of 47.40 ng/mL; to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1). An electroencephalogram revealed atypical spike-slow wave synchronization in specific brain regions during sleep. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed significant global atrophy particularly in his anterior temporal, lateral, and frontal regions (Figure, C).

He was referred to the Ocular Oncology Service, Wills Eye Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for suspected choroidal melanoma. He disclosed a history of macular degeneration in both eyes and retinal detachment in the left eye that was treated 35 years previously. Medical history revealed cutaneous basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, both treated surgically. On examination, visual acuity was 20/50 OD and 20/400 OS. External examination showed posterior-chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes and conjunctival scarring in the left eye from circumferential scleral buckle surgery with no visible extraocular tumor. Fundus evaluation showed macular drusen in the right eye and a pale optic disc with geographic macular atrophy in the left eye, explaining his visual acuity of 20/400 OS. In addition, a shallow circumferential buckle effect and an inferotemporal mass measuring 15.0 × 10.0 mm in basal dimension and 9.1 mm in thickness (Figure, A) were seen in the left eye. The mass appeared elevated, amelanotic with overlying retinal vasculature, and with chorioretinal atrophy. No retinal detachment or breaks were seen. By ultrasonography the mass was echolucent (Figure, A inset). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a T1, T2-hypointense shallow circumferential band in the left eye. In addition, there was an inferotemporal nodular mass in the left eye showing T1 (gadolinium) hypointense, T2-hyperintense features, underlying the encircling buckle, and with adjacent subtle delineation.

The skin findings could be a manifestation of this condition.\n\n5. **Recurrence or Progression of Leukemia/Cancer** - The multi-organ involvement and systemic symptoms raise the possibility of leukemic infiltration or other malignant processes related to the underlying multiple myeloma or acute myeloid leukemia.\n\n6. **Drug Reactions or Toxicity** - The patient's extensive medication exposure during conditioning treatment for transplantation raises the possibility of drug-related reactions, which may include skin manifestations and organ dysfunctions.\n\n7. **Paraneoplastic Syndromes** - Linked to underlying malignancies, these syndromes may cause unexpected clinical symptoms, including cutaneous and neurologic manifestations.\n\n8. **Metastatic Disease** - Considering the pulmonary nodules and the previous history of malignancy, there is a possibility of metastases causing the reported symptoms.\n\n9. **Autoimmune Disorders** - Autoimmune conditions could also explain the skin and systemic symptoms, especially in the context of altered immune status and potential treatment-related immunological effects.\n\n10. **Bacterial Skin and Soft Tissue Infection** - Secondary skin infections, including ecthyma gangrenosum or streptococcal or staphylococcal infections, could present with necrotic lesions in a patient with significant immune compromise.\n\n### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:\n\n1. **Invasive Fungal Infection** - Prioritized due to the appearance of the skin lesions, neutropenic status, negative blood cultures, and the presence of lung nodules and ground-glass opacities suggestive of fungal dissemination.\n\n2. **Graft vs Host Disease (GvHD)** - The physical manifestations on the skin, despite the pre-transplant stage, could have an early presentation, particularly under the severe immune stress and conditioning regimen.\n\n3. **Viral Infections** - The involvement of lungs and altered mental status are concordant with opportunistic viral infections, which are plausible given the severe immunocompromised state.\n\n4. **Neutropenic Sepsis** - Still highly relevant due to systemic signs of infection and severe neutropenia, although negative blood cultures reduce this likelihood slightly.\n\n5. **Drug Reactions or Toxicity** - The broad range of severe manifestations, including AKI and mucositis, keep this within the top differentials, considering the extensive pharmacological exposure.\n\n6. **Recurrence or Progression of Leukemia/Cancer** - The systemic nature of the symptoms and history of malignancies necessitate consideration of this differential, although less likely than primary infections or complications.\n\n7. **Metastatic Disease** - Given the pulmonary nodules, this remains a differential; however, it is less probable than primary infection or GvHD in this clinical scenario.\n\n8. **Autoimmune Disorders** - Possible but lower in likelihood given the acute presentation and the predominance of other more acute and severe differentials.\n\n9. **Paraneoplastic Syndromes** - While certainly possible, this scenario is less probable than direct infection or malignancy effects.\n\n10. **Bacterial Skin and Soft Tissue Infection** - Although the skin lesions could be bacterial in origin, cultures and the clinical context suggest a different primary pathology.\n\nFurther diagnostic investigations and response to empirical therapies will be crucial to refining and confirming these differential diagnoses.\n", "topic": "['Infectious Diseases', 'Skin Infections', 'Dermatology', 'Hematology', 'Oncology']"}

Recurrent syringomyelia-related neural damage - Given the patient’s surgical history and recurrent syrinx, neurological compromise affecting her shoulder could be contributing to her symptoms.\n\n3. Brachial plexopathy - This could explain the combination of pain, numbness, and muscle atrophy although it may not fully account for the severe joint destruction.\n\n4. Cervical radiculopathy - Nerve root compression in the cervical spine could account for symptoms but might not explain the severe structural changes in the shoulder.\n\n5. Rotator cuff tear - Could have contributed to shoulder dysfunction and pain, but less likely to result in the osseous changes observed.\n\n6. Shoulder osteoarthritis - A possible diagnosis but it usually presents with less severe joint destruction compared to what is observed in this case.\n\n7. Adhesive capsulitis - Could explain stiffness and reduced range of motion, but does not typically lead to such severe osseous changes.\n\n8.

Rheumatoid arthritis - Negative rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody, along with lack of other systemic symptoms make this less likely.\n\n10. Septic arthritis - She does not display typical signs of infection such as elevated inflammatory markers, fever, or acute onset, which makes this diagnosis less likely.\n\nGiven the severity of joint destruction and absence of the left humeral head, along with the patient’s neurological history, Charcot arthropathy due to syringomyelia appears most consistent with the findings.", "topic": "['Emergency Medicine', 'Neurology', 'Rheumatology', 'Spinal Cord Disorders', 'Radiology']"}

Lung ultrasound demonstrated multiple B-lines in both lung fields. Diagnostic coronary angiography revealed a total occlusion in the left main coronary artery. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was successful in opening the osteal left main and drug-eluting stents were placed in the left main and left anterior descending arteries. Following PCI, the patient had episodes of supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Electrical cardioversion was performed and a loading dose of amiodarone was administered. Chest radiography during the loading dose of amiodarone showed infiltrates in both lung fields (Figure 1A). While in the intensive cardiovascular care unit, maintenance doses of amiodarone were continued because of episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, and torsades de pointes. On the third day of hospitalization, despite adequate diuresis, the chest radiography showed persistent pulmonary edema. Chest computed tomography showed a reticular pattern predominantly in the perihilar area with consolidation and diffuse ground-glass opacity in both lung fields (Figure 1B).

In the past month, she felt neck stiffness, accompanied by swelling and persistent dull pain of the upper anterior chest wall, which could be transiently relieved by taking oral ibuprofen. Six days before admission, the patient’s neck stiffness transited to an endurable dull ache. When turning her head, there was severe burning pain in the posterior neck and occiput, followed immediately by an electric shocklike numbness on ipsilateral side tongue, which led to a forced head position.

It is characterized by syncope, often triggered by pressure on the carotid sinus, which could be influenced by the patient’s edema and head positioning.\n\n**Step 3: Myasthenia Gravis**\n- The dysphagia and physical exhaustion could point towards a neurological disorder like Myasthenia Gravis, which affects the voluntary muscles of the body, emphasizing issues with muscle fatigue and function.\n\n**Step 4: Sinusitis**\n- Chronic sinus congestion and facial edema may also suggest chronic or acute sinusitis, potentially exacerbated by an immunocompromised state from systemic steroid use or other underlying factors.\n\n**Step 5: Heart Failure**\n- Consideration of cardiovascular etiologies such as Heart Failure is wise, given the syncopal episodes and physical exhaustion. Heart failure could also indirectly contribute to facial edema.\n\n**Step 6: Superior Vena Cava Syndrome**\n- The combined presentation of facial edema, erythema, and exhaustion might suggest Superior Vena Cava Syndrome, where obstruction in the superior vena cava leads to venous congestion in the upper body.\n\n**Step 7: Allergic Reaction**\n- The patient’s current medication regimen and symptoms like chemosis and hyperemia could also raise the possibility of an allergic or hypersensitive reaction to one or more of the ophthalmic medications.\n\n**Step 8: Neurological Tumor**\n- Given the neurological symptoms (dysphagia, syncope), exploration of neurological causes such as a brain or neck tumor, which might press on nerves or blood vessels, causing the described symptoms, is necessary.\n\n**Step 9: Amyloidosis**\n- Amyloidosis can cause varied symptoms including facial edema and general tiredness, often related to deposition of abnormal protein in tissues.\n\n**Step 10: Dermatomyositis**\n- Finally, considering autoimmune conditions, Dermatomyositis could explain the combination of muscle weakness, facial rash (erythema), and facial edema.\n\n### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:\n\n1. **Cushing's Syndrome** (due to chronic steroid use, visible systemic signs like facial edema, erythema)\n2. **Superior Vena Cava Syndrome** (could account for upper body edema and syncopal episodes)\n3. **Heart Failure** (explains edema, exhaustion, and syncope)\n4. **Sinusitis** (chronic facial symptoms and sinus congestion)\n5. **Carotid Sinus Syndrome** (could explain syncopal episodes related to head positioning or pressure)\n6. **Myasthenia Gravis** (muscle weakness presenting as exhaustion and dysphagia)\n7. **Neurological Tumor** (potential pressing on structures leading to physiological symptoms)\n8. **Allergic Reaction** (to medications causing ocular and possibly systemic reactions)\n9. **Amyloidosis** (systemic presentation including tiredness and facial edema)\n10. **Dermatomyositis** (muscle weakness, facial erythema, dysphagia)\n\nEach diagnosis considered fits a portion of the clinical presentation, but thorough investigation and appropriate diagnostic testing are crucial for accurate identification and management.", "topic": "['Glaucoma', 'Hematology', 'Oncology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Radiation Oncology']"}

He also reported odynophonia, globus sensation, and mild dysphagia to solids. The patient had been treated previously with steroids and amoxicillin for the presumptive diagnosis of chronic laryngitis but reported no improvement in symptoms. Laboratory workup was positive for elevated antinuclear antibodies and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and was consequently referred to our institution. On presentation, the patient had only minimal dysphonia. He underwent a transnasal flexible laryngoscopy that demonstrated a severely edematous epiglottis, posterior pharyngeal wall, aryepiglottic folds, and arytenoids (Figure, A). The vocal folds were difficult to visualize but seemed normal in appearance and mobility. Stroboscopy could not be performed because of obstruction from the prolapsing arytenoids. Interestingly, the patient denied any shortness of breath. Results of laboratory testing revealed normal levels of all components of a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and angiotensin-converting enzyme. The patient’s erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated to 75 mm/h (reference range, 0-15 mm/h). Findings of chest radiography were normal.

His ocular history was notable for recent cataract surgery 5 weeks prior to presentation that was complicated by endophthalmitis. A normal funduscopic examination was documented prior to cataract surgery. At the time of initial presentation to his local retina specialist 1 week following his cataract surgery, the patient had severe pain and redness. His visual acuity was light perception. An examination revealed a 2-mm hypopyon and dense vitreous haze with no view of the retina. He was treated for presumed endophthalmitis with a vitreous tap and intravitreal injections of vancomycin (1 mg/0.1 mL), ceftazidime (2.2 mg/0.1 mL), and dexamethasone (0.4 mg/0.1 mL). The vitreous sample obtained at the time of treatment grew Staphylococcus caprae susceptible to vancomycin. At time of examination in our clinic 4 weeks following treatment, the patient was receiving topical steroid and cycloplegic drops. His best-corrected visual acuity had improved to 20/70. Examination showed a deep and quiet anterior chamber with a well-positioned intraocular lens without any plaques or deposits on the lens capsule. Dilated ophthalmoscopic examination demonstrated improvement in the vitreous debris with 1+ vitritis and numerous superficial, round, white lesions spread throughout the fundus in all 4 quadrants and in the macula (Figure 1A).

His symptoms began after relocation to California and occurred more frequently at his home. However, he could not discern any environmental or dietary triggers. He reported pruritus and swelling, which were usually moderate but occasionally severe, prompting several emergency department visits. During an emergency department visit, he was diagnosed with acute parotitis based on clinical and radiographic findings of diffuse gland edema, without salivary stones or masses. His symptoms responded to oral prednisone bursts and diphenhydramine, but not to second-generation antihistamines or montelukast. His workup included immune serology and total immunoglobulin (Ig) E measurements, all of which were within normal limits. A differential blood cell count revealed 10% eosinophils (normal, <6%) and an absolute eosinophil count 500/µL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001).

Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris - Features of orange-red plaques and scaling could mimic, but lacks the classic island of sparing, and the serological findings do not support this.\n7. Psoriasis - Considered due to papular rash, but systemic symptoms and autoantibody presence are atypical for psoriasis.\n8.

Because of the high risk of retinal redetachment, the silicone oil was retained throughout the glaucoma procedures. The patient presented 9 months after the last cyclophotocoagulation procedure. At presentation, he was taking dorzolamide-timolol, brimonidine, netarsudil, and latanoprost for his left eye. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/80 OD and light perception OS. Intraocular pressures (IOPs) were 11 mm Hg OD and 20 mm Hg OS. Examination of the left eye revealed a large, firm, pink subconjunctival mass inferotemporally near the Ahmed valve (Figure 1). There was a left hypertropia of more than 45° by Hirschberg test. The anterior chamber was deep with fine silicone oil bubbles superiorly. The aphakic left eye revealed a well-positioned tube.

His chest examination revealed bilateral coarse breath sounds and distant heart sounds. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 10% with elevated filling pressures and no significant valvular abnormalities. Owing to hemodynamic instability, the patient was given venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) with the peripheral ventricular assist device (pVAD) Impella CP (Abiomed) and was administered high-dose intravenous corticosteroids.

No poliosis or skin changes were noted. A review of systems was unremarkable, most notably a lack of any pulmonary symptoms. A focused laboratory evaluation identified a significantly elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level and antinuclear antibody titer, but serum lysozyme, syphilis, and tuberculosis testing had negative results. To better differentiate between Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome, a lymphoproliferative disorder, or sarcoidosis as the underlying cause of the vitreous inflammation and multilobulated, serous RD in both eyes, a computed tomographic scan was performed.

There was no history of alopecia, oral ulcers, rashes, or Raynaud phenomenon. He did not report preceding fever, diarrhea, or dysuria. There was no history of weight loss or anorexia. Medical history included tertiary hyperparathyroidism related to end-stage kidney disease from chronic glomerulonephritis. The patient had successfully received an ABO-incompatible kidney transplant 1 year ago, but this was complicated by invasive fungal (Volvariella volvacea) infection of the central nervous system. Medications included tacrolimus (0.5 mg twice daily), prednisolone (10 mg daily), cinacalcet (12.5 mg daily), and voriconazole (500 mg daily). On examination, his fingers and toes were symmetrically and diffusely swollen and tender. There was no rash, enthesitis, psoriatic nail changes, clubbing, or lower limb edema. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Alkaline phosphatase level was elevated at 640 U/L (10.69 μkat/L) (reference range, 40-130 U/L [0.67-2.17 μkat/L]).

Three weeks prior, she had developed acute urinary retention. Neurological examination revealed weakness in bilateral lower limbs (Medical Research Council grade 4 on the right and grade 3 on the left), extensor plantar responses, and a sensory level at T6. Magnetic resonance imaging of her thoracic spine was performed 10 days after the onset of weakness and did not show any signal abnormalities or restricted diffusion.

Neuromyelitis optica - Even though antibodies to aquaporin 4 were negative, the clinical presentation and spine imaging findings can still be consistent with seronegative neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD).\n\n4. Multiple sclerosis - Characterized by neurologic symptoms disseminated in space and time, the presentation could fit, but typical MS lesions or enhancements were not identified on the initial MRI, reducing this likelihood.\n\n5. Guillain-Barré syndrome - Normally associated with ascending paralysis and protein elevation in CSF, but the strictly spinal presentation and sensory level outlined at T6 are less typical.\n\n6.

The tumor typically enhances with contrast, which was absent in this case.\n\n8. Myasthenia gravis - Known for fluctuating muscle weakness and fatiguability, typically affecting ocular and bulbar muscles first, making it less likely in isolated lower limb and sensory symptoms.\n\n9. Lyme disease - Can present with neurological symptoms during its disseminated phase, but there is no mention of erythema migrans or exposure history, and diagnostics do not suggest Lyme disease.\n\n10. Paraneoplastic syndrome - While the comprehensive workup for an occult malignancy is negative and no specific paraneoplastic antibodies were found, the systemic skin lesions and rapid neurologic decline could suggest this, but less likely without supportive laboratory confirmation.\n\nThe detailed review and reranking incorporate the clinical presentation, lab findings, and imaging studies, aligning with the most probable diagnoses based on all available information.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Neurology', 'Spinal Cord Disorders']"}

His ocular history included pseudoexfoliation syndrome and glaucomatous optic neuropathy in the right eye. Past ocular surgery included uncomplicated trabeculectomy in the right eye treated with mitomycin C (3 months prior) and no ocular surgery history in the left eye. His medical history included pulmonary Mycobacterium avium infection secondary to hypogammaglobulinemia. Computed tomography scan 2 months prior exhibited reactivation and he started treatment with clarithromycin (1000 mg/d), ethambutol (15 mg/kg/d), and rifabutin (300 mg/d). Best-corrected visual acuity was hand motions OD and 20/20 OS. Intraocular pressures were 4 mm Hg OD and 13 mm Hg OS. Anterior segment examination of the right eye showed substantial conjunctival hyperemia and substantial cellular response in the anterior chamber (2 to 3+) along with a 1-mm hypopyon. There was no leak at the trabeculectomy bleb (negative Seidel test). B-scan ultrasonography showed no retinal detachment or mass. Presumed diagnosis of bleb-related infectious endophthalmitis was made and he was referred for treatment. Pars plana vitrectomy was performed, including vitreous sampling, and showed very light growth of Staphylococcus aureus in 1 colony on 1 plate, which was highly suspicious for contaminant. Intravitreal amikacin and vancomycin were administered after vitreous sampling was performed. Postoperatively, the patient initiated treatment with topical antibiotics and corticosteroids. His visual acuity returned to 20/30. Two months later, he presented again with a similar acute vision loss in the left eye (counting fingers). Anterior segment examination showed conjunctival hyperemia, cellular reaction, and a small hypopyon (Figure).\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Rifabutin-associated uveitis", "predict": "1.

Bleb-related infectious endophthalmitis - Despite initial treatment and apparent resolution in the right eye, the recurrence of similar symptoms in the left eye where no surgery occurred suggests this may not be the primary/persistent issue.\n2. Endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis - The patient's immunodeficiency and recent systemic Mycobacterium avium infection treatment put him at risk for systemic infections spreading to the eye.\n3. Autoimmune uveitis - Given the bilateral occurrence and the inflammatory signs, this is possible, and systemic autoimmune connections should be explored.\n4. Toxic anterior segment syndrome (TASS) - Less likely due to the late onset after surgery and bilaterality with no left eye surgery.\n5. Fungal endophthalmitis - Considering the light growth of Staphylococcus aureus previously viewed as contaminant and the patient's immunocompromised state, a fungal cause could be possible.\n6. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis - While more common in people with significant immunosuppression such as HIV/AIDS, his underlying hypogammaglobulinemia and antibiotic regimen might predispose him to viral infections.\n7. Panuveitis - Both eyes showing inflammation indicates a possible systemic inflammatory or infectious process.\n8. Acute angle-closure glaucoma - Though less likely, cannot be fully ruled out without appropriate assessments.\n9. Non-infectious inflammatory reaction to surgery - Initial response after trabeculectomy and subsequent resolution suggests this was transient.\n10. Retinal detachment - Unlikely due to negative B-scan ultrasonography results but should be considered if no other causes are confirmed and symptoms persist.\n\nContinued investigation with a focus on systemic infection control, broader infectious disease testing, and possibly consultation with a rheumatologist or immunologist for potential systemic inflammatory conditions is recommended.", "topic": "['Infectious Diseases', 'Ophthalmology', 'Adverse Drug Events', 'Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology', 'Glaucoma']"}

Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis - Closely considers the arthritis aspect, although less likely due to the skin and eye manifestations not being as prominently featured in typical cases.\n\n4. Psoriasis - The plaques described could suggest psoriasis; however, the joint involvement typically seen in psoriatic arthritis tends not to be as debilitating in children and would less likely affect the ability to clench fists entirely.\n\n5. Lupus - Systemic lupus erythematosus might present with similar symptoms including rashes, arthritis, and potentially uveitis, but other typical symptoms like renal or neurological involvement are not mentioned.\n\n6.

He had been healthy until 6 years earlier when he had suddenly developed peripheral neuropathy, with subsequent workup revealing a diagnosis of immunoglobulin M (IgM) monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. His symptoms had rapidly progressed during the past few months. In addition to worsening neuropathy, he had developed fatigue, weight loss, and sudden altered mental status. An ischemic stroke was identified. The patient was hospitalized, and extensive diagnostic examinations and procedures were completed. A lymphoproliferative disorder with plasmocytic differentiation was detected in a bone marrow biopsy specimen, which together with the monoclonal IgM paraproteinemia was consistent with Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM). Weeks later, the patient developed an asymptomatic rash of his lower legs. A physical examination revealed several bright red, nonblanchable, pinpoint macules of the bilateral lower legs (Figure, A). An antinuclear antibody test result was positive (titer 1:320, diffuse pattern). Other laboratory testing procedures (ie, complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, anti-Sjogren syndrome [SS]-A and SS-B, anti–double-stranded DNA, complement [C]3 and C4, homocysteine, β-2-glycoprotein, anticardiolipin, lupus anticoagulant, and vitamin C) returned normal.

Cervical Osteoarthritis - Could account for skeletal abnormalities impacting swallowing, though less likely to specifically cause the clicking or the contact seen on SD-CT.\n5. Thyroid Cartilage Fracture - The symptoms and SD-CT findings might suggest a structural issue like a fracture, but typically would have a trauma history.\n6. Tonsillar Abscess - Could cause pain and difficulty swallowing, though usually more acute onset and visible on laryngoscopy.\n7.

He denied a history of fever, otorrhea, prior ear infections, vertigo, or otologic surgery. The patient first saw his primary care physician, who visualized a mass in the right ear canal and attempted needle aspiration, which led to self-resolved bleeding.

Formal audiogram results confirmed conductive hearing loss in the right ear and type B tympanometry, which was indicative of poor eardrum mobility.

The rheumatoid factor level (18 IU/mL [normal range, <14 IU/mL]) and C-reactive protein level (26 mg/L [normal range, 0-5 mg/L]) were elevated. In addition, Lyme IgG, IgM, and reflex Western blot assays were positive for antibodies. The patient denied travel to Lyme-endemic regions, tick bites, or rashes. The patient started oral prednisone therapy for possible rheumatoid arthritis (RA)–associated nodular scleritis, doxycycline therapy for positive Lyme studies, and was referred to a rheumatologist for further RA evaluation. Two weeks after presentation and initiation of oral prednisone therapy, the patient noted improvement in pain, but the scleral nodules and hyperemia persisted. Therefore, subconjunctival triamcinolone acetonide (0.5 mL of 40 mg/mL) was administered to the left eye. Further confirmatory RA workup by rheumatology did not reveal other systemic findings thought to be associated with RA on review of symptoms or clinical examination. The patient's back pain was associated with his herniated disc. Subsequently, the patient’s examination results showed new scleral thinning of the left eye with persistence of the scleral nodules (Figure 1).\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Mycobacterium infectious scleritis", "predict": "1. **Rheumatoid Arthritis-Associated Nodular Scleritis**\n2. **Lyme Disease**\n3. **Scleritis Associated with Systemic Vasculitis**\n4. **Idiopathic Scleritis**\n5. **Infectious Scleritis**\n6. **Episcleritis**\n7. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis**\n8. **Herpes Simplex Virus Scleritis**\n9. **Gouty Scleritis**\n10. **Tuberculosis-Related Scleritis**\n\n### Reranking Based on Patient Information:\n\n1. **Rheumatoid Arthritis-Associated Nodular Scleritis** - The presence of rheumatoid factor and C-reactive protein elevation, along with the characteristic scleral nodules, makes this a strong possibility despite the lack of other systemic RA findings.\n2. **Lyme Disease** - Positive Lyme serologies, including IgG, IgM, and reflex Western blot suggest Lyme disease, although the patient denies typical exposure.\n3. **Idiopathic Scleritis** - Given the negative investigations for other causes and the persistence of symptoms, idiopathic scleritis becomes a plausible diagnosis if other systemic associations are ruled out.\n4. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis** - Should be considered due to the granulomatous appearance of the nodules and negative tests for more common etiologies, although specific ANCA tests were negative.\n5. **Scleritis Associated with Systemic Vasculitis** - Should still be considered due to elevated inflammatory markers, though specific systemic symptoms of vasculitis are absent.\n6. **Infectious Scleritis** - Although specific infectious tests (TB, RPR, treponemal tests) were negative, this remains a possibility due to chronic inflammation and nodule formation.\n7. **Herpes Simplex Virus Scleritis** - A consideration due to its capability to cause scleral nodules and inflammation, though specific testing for HSV was not mentioned.\n8. **Gouty Scleritis** - Possible given the nodular presentation and unexplained inflammation, though more common in patients with a history of gout.\n9. **Episcleritis** - Less likely due to the severity and nature of the symptoms and scleral thinning, but should still be considered in the differential.\n10. **Tuberculosis-Related Scleritis** - Lower in the ranking given the specific negative tuberculosis test result and lack of systemic symptoms typically associated with tuberculosis.", "topic": "['Ophthalmology', 'Intraocular Inflammation', 'Infectious Diseases']"}

The mass had been slowly enlarging and she had been experiencing mild intermittent pain, but no additional symptoms were reported. Her medical history was significant for several episodes of upper respiratory infection during the previous winter season, and she previously had an adenotonsillectomy several years prior and bilateral ear tubes placed 1 year before presentation. Physical examination showed a mildly tender, nonmobile, left parotid mass near the angle of the mandible with no overlying skin changes or drainage around the mass. There was no lymphadenopathy or other lesions noted in the neck area, and cranial nerve VII was fully intact. Ultrasonography results of the neck showed a left 1.5-cm preauricular nodular mass with internal and marginal vascularity. A neck magnetic resonance imaging study without contrast performed at an outside institution revealed the 1.5-cm heterogeneous intraparotid nodule that was predominantly isotense to glandular tissue on T1 images with vague hypointensity of a small irregular central region, as well as vague hyperintensity on T2 images. She subsequently underwent fine needle aspiration biopsy to assess the lesion, which demonstrated benign-appearing salivary gland tissue and clusters of myoepithelial cells. The mass was continuing to enlarge, and the patient’s pain was increasing in that area, so the decision was made to perform left superficial parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve. Intraoperatively, the left parotid mass was noted to be just below the lower branches of the facial nerve. The excised parotid mass was sent to the pathology department for analysis. Gross examination of the specimen demonstrated a 1.6 × 1.5 × 1.1–cm tan-white, well-circumscribed lesion that was partially surrounded by salivary gland parenchyma (Figure, A).

Two years prior, she was diagnosed with a right lower lobe segmental pulmonary embolism on a computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram after evaluation of shortness of breath. Warfarin was initiated but discontinued after 2 months due to recurrent epistaxis. On presentation to the pulmonary clinic, the patient reported dyspnea with minimal activity, fatigue, lightheadedness, and leg swelling. Her temperature was 96.8 °F (36 °C); blood pressure, 120/71 mm Hg; heart rate, 73/min; and oxygen saturation, 98% on room air. She appeared frail and had multiple telangiectasias on her lips, tongue, and hands. She had jugular venous distension, a cardiac systolic murmur, right ventricular heave, and bilateral lower extremity edema to the knees.

However, specific systemic symptoms or other neurofibromas would typically be present for a definitive diagnosis.\n3. Hemangioma - The prominently vascular nature of the lesion shown in angiography and MRI might hint at a vascular tumor like a hemangioma; however, the biopsy findings favor schwannoma.\n4. Meningioma - While primarily an intracranial tumor, meningiomas can manifest ectopically. The MRI features could suggest such, but the biopsy findings, particularly the immunostaining results, are not supportive.\n5. Cutaneous metastasis - Always a consideration in a patient with an unusual or progressively enlarging lesion, though the immunoprofile and lack of other primary malignancy signs make this less likely.\n6. Lymphoma - A possibility given the enlargement and characteristics of the mass but less likely due to the positive S100 and SOX10 staining, and lack of typical lymphoma markers or morphological features in the biopsy.\n7. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans - While characterized as a spindle cell proliferation, the positive staining for S100 and SOX10 is not typical for this diagnosis.\n8. Squamous cell carcinoma - Considered given the nature of the lesion and its location, but lacks support without evidence of epithelial atypia or keratinocyte involvement in biopsy.\n9. Melanoma - The presence of S100 could be suggestive but the lesion’s behavior, histological features, and additional negative markers like SOX10 make this unlikely.\n10.

Four years earlier, she started taking lenalidomide, 10 mg/d (28-day cycle), to treat worsening anemia; after 2 cycles of treatment, she became transfusion independent. Since then, she has remained stable with the same dose and schedule of lenalidomide without significant adverse effects. The presenting skin lesions developed 1 month before presentation and began as small pustules that rapidly transformed into painful ulcers. She was treated with valacyclovir for a presumed diagnosis of shingles, but the lesions did not improve. Because of suspected necrotizing fasciitis, she underwent incision and drainage of the lesions. Cultures from the surgical specimen grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus hemolyticus. However, the lesions continued to worsen despite vancomycin and additional debridement. Thus, she was transferred to our facility. Physical examination showed multiple cutaneous ulcers with gray undermined borders and red papules of varying depths involving the chest, back, and upper extremity; lesions were as large as 9 × 15 cm. A complete blood cell count showed a white blood cell count of 16.2 × 103/μL (to convert to 109/L, multiply by 1.0) with an absolute neutrophil count of 12.7 × 103/μL, hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0), and platelet count of 262 × 103/μL with no circulating blasts. Results of additional laboratory studies, including blood culture and tests for herpes zoster virus (via polymerase chain reaction), antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were all negative.

His symptoms were initially most prominent while playing sports and were suspected to be due to asthma or seasonal allergies. However, medical management with albuterol, intranasal fluticasone, and cetirizine failed to provide relief. More recently, the patient’s parents noted that he developed stridor while sleeping and while at rest, prompting the family to present for medical attention. Previous workup, including pulmonary function testing, was concerning for an upper airway obstructive process, for which he was referred to otolaryngology. In-office flexible videostroboscopy revealed a mass in the distal cervical trachea that appeared nearly obstructive. Chest radiography confirmed the presence of an approximately 1.5-cm, well-circumscribed soft tissue mass within the cervical trachea. Direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy were performed in the operating room under general anesthesia. This demonstrated an exophytic, pedunculated mass that emanated from the anterior wall of the cervical trachea (Figure 1A and B). The patient was intubated via Seldinger technique to bypass the mass, with a 4.0-mm cuffed endotracheal tube loaded over a 0-degree Hopkins endoscope (Figure 1C). With the airway secured, attention was turned to excision of the mass. Lidocaine, 1%, with epinephrine 1:100 000 was injected in a submucosal plane, and laryngeal scissors were used to excise the attachment of the mass from the tracheal wall. The mass was then resected en bloc and removed with laryngeal cupped forceps.

On systemic examination, hepatomegaly (2 cm below the right costal margin) was seen. There was also bilateral enlargement of the parotid area, which was tender on palpation. Cutaneous examination revealed yellowish greasy scales on the scalp, suggestive of seborrheic dermatitis. Erythematous edematous papules were present over the retroauricular areas and the inframammary folds (Figure, A). On examination of external genitalia, deep ulcers were observed in the bilateral inguinal folds, resembling knife-cut ulcers (Figure, B).

He also reported bilateral rhinorrhea, congestion, and right frontal and temporal headaches. Active medical issues included hypertension, very poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, tobacco use, and asthma. His brother and father both had a history of chronic orbital swelling. Vital signs were unremarkable, and examination of the right eye showed moderate chemosis, injected conjunctiva, and periorbital edema. Both eyes were proptotic, right worse than left. He had normal bilateral extraocular movements, pupillary light reflexes, and gross vision. Computed tomography with contrast revealed bilateral ethmoid and frontal sinus opacification and right worse than left orbital fat stranding (Figure 1A). Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast demonstrated both enlargement and enhancement of bilateral extraocular muscles, especially the right superior rectus (Figure 1B). Initially he was started on antibiotic therapy. Right nasal biopsy, right endoscopic sinus surgery, and right anterior superior orbital tissue biopsy were performed. Intraoperatively, the sinus mucosa demonstrated only edema and mild secretions, but there was no necrosis or purulence. Both orbital and nasal cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Orbital biopsy showed nodular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates without evidence of fungal infection or necrosis (Figure 1C).

Seven years before this visit, she underwent a reduced-intensity, matched, unrelated donor, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Her post-transplant course was complicated by severe chronic graft vs host disease of the skin, eyes, and gut, for which she received systemic corticosteroid therapy, tacrolimus, methotrexate, and long-term extracorporeal photopheresis. Three years after the HSCT, she developed chronic ulcerations on the hips, back, and arms at the site of previously irradiated tumors, as well as multiple friable, hemorrhagic, and bleeding nodules on bilateral hips and her forearms while receiving treatment with corticosteroids and extracorporeal photopheresis. She underwent several debulking procedures and excision biopsies of the nodules, which revealed granulation tissue on histology. In this latest visit, physical examination revealed recurrent hemorrhagic and friable nodules on her left lateral hip and left lateral buttock (Figure 1). Similar nodules were noted on her right hip and forearm. The patient underwent repeated debulking and biopsy. She was also treated with micafungin, amphotericin B, levofloxacin, dapsone, acyclovir, pentamidine, penicillin VK, and posaconazole.

Recurrent mycosis fungoides - Despite past treatments, the recurrent nature of mycosis fungoides and the presence of nodules and ulceration could indicate a recurrence or remnant disease.\n4. Angiosarcoma - A malignancy that can develop as a secondary condition in chronically irradiated and inflamed tissues, so this should be considered given the patient’s radiation history.\n5. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma - Secondary to radiation therapy and chronic inflammation from GVHD, this type of carcinoma is a possible diagnosis.\n6. Pyoderma gangrenosum - Characterized by ulcerative lesions and could be considered because of the chronic inflammatory and immune-modulated status of the patient.\n7. Infective dermatitis - While the extensive antimicrobial coverage might address common agents, the condition of the patient could predispose her to unusual infections.\n8. Drug reaction - Ongoing treatments, including corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive medications, could cause drug reactions manifesting as nodular and ulcerative skin lesions.\n9. Lymphomatoid papulosis - Although less likely, considering the patient’s history of lymphoproliferative disorder, this cutaneous lymphoma variant could coexist or recur.\n10.

The patient had become progressively disabled and had been using a wheelchair for 4 years prior to presentation. Neurological examination showed gaze-evoked horizontal nystagmus in both directions along with slow saccades and gaze restriction in both vertical and horizontal planes. There was ataxic dysarthria. Tone was normal in all 4 limbs but stretch reflexes were absent and plantar fascia were mute. Limb power was normal. Ataxia was seen on finger-to-nose and heel-knee-shin tests. Chorea was present in both legs. Ankle inversion with bilateral hammertoes was noted. Electromyography revealed sensory neuronopathy. On brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffuse cerebellar atrophy was noted along with T2 hyperintensities in bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles, cerebellar white matter, pons, and bilateral thalamus (Figure). Psychiatric treatment was commenced for his severe anxiety but did not relieve the fear of falling.\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Mitochondrial ataxia", "predict": "1. **Multiple System Atrophy (MSA)** - This diagnosis is suggested by progressive ataxia, cerebellar and brainstem signs such as poor coordination, abnormal eye movements, and dysarthria, as well as the specific imaging findings of hyperintensities in middle cerebellar peduncles.\n2. **Spinocerebellar Ataxia** - Considered due to the patient's progressive cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, and characteristic neuroimaging findings, along with the chronic progression over many years.\n3. **Friedreich’s Ataxia** - This consideration is driven by the presence of ataxic dysarthria, sensory neuronopathy on electromyography, and cerebellar atrophy on MRI. However, the late onset in this patient is atypical for Friedreich's Ataxia.\n4. **Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP)** - Included due to the presence of spasticity, progressive gait disturbance, and mild lower limb muscle atrophy but normally presents with spastic rather than ataxic gait.\n5. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)** - Considered because of the multiple neurological symptoms and MRI findings that include hyperintensities, although the distribution and clinical picture are not typical.\n6. **Wilson’s Disease** - A possibility due to the movement disorder (chorea), though other typical features like hepatic dysfunction and Kayser-Fleischer rings may not be present.\n7. **Neuroacanthocytosis** - The presence of chorea and cerebellar signs raises this possibility, but acanthocytes would need to be seen on blood smear for confirmation.\n8. **Vitamin E Deficiency** - Possible given the sensory neuronopathy and ataxia, requires dietary history and vitamin level assessment for confirmation.\n9. **Paraneoplastic Cerebellar Degeneration** - Considered due to the subacute onset of neurological symptoms in association with cerebellar atrophy but typically progresses more rapidly.\n10. **Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD)** - Included because of rapid progression and MRI findings, yet the progression here is unusually long for CJD.\n\n### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Considering All Patient Information:\n1. **Multiple System Atrophy (MSA)**\n   - The combination of ataxia, dysarthria, normal muscle tone with absent reflexes, slow saccades, gaze-evoked nystagmus, and lack of fear relief with psychiatric treatment point to a degenerative cerebellar disease. MRI findings highly supportive.\n2. **Spinocerebellar Ataxia**\n   - Chronic progression and combination of cerebellar and extrapyramidal signs are suggestive.\n3. **Friedreich’s Ataxia**\n   - Late onset is unusual, but sensory neuronopathy and cerebellar degeneration fit the profile.\n4. **Paraneoplastic Cerebellar Degeneration**\n   - Should consider malignancy screening given progressive neurological degeneration despite slower than typical progression.\n5. **Wilson’s Disease**\n   - Less likely due to age and lack of hepatic or corneal manifestations, but movement disorders and psychiatric symptoms make it considerable.\n6. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**\n   - Atypical but cannot be entirely ruled out without further immune profile testing.\n7. **Neuroacanthocytosis**\n   - Chorea and cerebellar symptoms place it in consideration but lower in likelihood without evidence of acanthocytes.\n8. **Vitamin E Deficiency**\n   - Simple test for confirmation, but less likely given common dietary sources.\n9. **Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP)**\n   - Presence of spasticity conflates with ataxia, atypical for pure HSP presentation.\n10. **Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD)**\n    - Less likely due to prolonged disease course, typically CJD progresses more quickly.", "topic": "['Neurogenetics', 'Neurology', 'Neuromuscular Diseases']"}

She denied any history of dysphagia, odynophagia, fevers, unintentional weight loss, cough, or reflux symptoms. There was no prior history of smoking, head and neck surgeries, or radiation exposure. She was treated for asthma with inhaled steroids by her primary care physician without improvement in symptoms. On physical examination, the patient was stridulous and considerably hoarse. Her neck examination was unremarkable. Subsequent videostroboscopy revealed severe laryngeal mucosal edema, most significant in the false vocal folds, interarytenoid, and postcricoid regions (Figure 1A). There was right true vocal fold immobility with compensatory squeeze of the false vocal folds and an absent mucosal wave. Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the neck with contrast showed irregularity along the free edges of the true vocal folds but no evidence of a neoplasm or cervical lymphadenopathy.

Infectious Laryngitis\n   - Although an atypical presentation for chronic laryngitis, a chronic fungal infection might cause these symptoms.\n\n9. Laryngeal Papillomatosis\n   - Less likely due to patient's age and absence of typical risk factors like HPV.\n\n10.

He was a Southern California native with travel history to Pakistan, Turkey, Jordan, Israel, Qatar, and Dubai 5 years prior to symptom onset. One month prior to onset, he drove from Los Angeles, California, to Houston, Texas. He denied recent unintentional weight loss, cough, fever, night sweats, chills, stridor, dyspnea, dysphonia, or rash. On examination, his vital signs were within normal limits, and physical examination revealed a small right tonsillolith, mild tonsillar erythema that was worse on the right side, and a mobile 2-cm, right level 2 lymph node that was slightly tender to palpation. Laboratory evaluation was notable for an elevated eosinophil count and positive Epstein-Barr immunoglobulin G. His white blood cell count and mononucleosis spot test result were within normal parameters. His symptoms persisted despite treatment with penicillin, azithromycin, and steroids from his primary physician and amoxicillin-clavulanate, sinus rinses, fluticasone propionate, and azelastine spray from an otolaryngologist to treat any contributing postnasal drainage and tonsillitis. Flexible transnasal videolaryngoscopy revealed a lesion on the laryngeal surface of the right epiglottis passing midline extending to the right aryepiglottic fold, but not involving the true vocal cords (Figure 1A).

She had a pink macule on her left cheek at birth, which became raised and discolored around age 3 to 4 weeks. She was diagnosed with a capillary hemangioma, and propranolol was started at age 1 month with progression despite dosage increases. Topical timolol was tried without improvement; oral prednisolone decreased the size of the lesion, but was poorly tolerated and discontinued. An ophthalmic evaluation at an outside hospital was concerning for amblyopia because of anisohypermetropia, greater on the left, and a left esotropia and hypertropia. A magnetic resonance image revealed an orbital mass surrounding the left lateral rectus muscle with mass effect on the globe and extension into the eyelid, pterygopalatine fossa, and cheek. Given the risk of amblyopia, the patient underwent 2 embolization and debulking procedures of the orbital and cheek components of the lesion, which were positive for glucose transporter 1 on pathology. However, the esotropia abruptly worsened after the second debulking.

It can cause ophthalmoplegia, headache, and facial numbness and could be triggered by surgery or tumor impact.\n\n**Step 3: Meningitis**  \nMeningitis, the inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, could present with headache, cranial nerve deficits, and may appear after major surgery due to infectious complications.\n\n**Step 4: Brainstem Stroke**  \nA stroke in the brainstem can impair multiple cranial nerves and cause acute symptoms such as ophthalmoplegia, headache, and facial numbness.\n\n**Step 5: Diabetic Third Nerve Palsy**  \nGiven her age and no known history provided about systemic diseases, diabetic third nerve palsy could be a consideration if the patient had diabetes. This would not typically affect both eyes simultaneously, but individual assessment per eye could be merited.\n\n**Step 6: Myasthenia Gravis**  \nMyasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease that affects neuromuscular function and can lead to symptoms of muscle weakness including ophthalmoplegia.\n\n**Step 7: Orbital Cellulitis**  \nOrbital cellulitis is an infection involving the contents of the orbit (fat and ocular muscles) that can pressure the nerves and cause ophthalmoplegia, and although less likely, it should be considered particularly if there are signs of infection or a compromised immune status.\n\n**Step 8: Basilar Artery Migraine**  \nBasilar artery migraine is a form of migraine that can cause complex visual disturbances and could theoretically lead to transient ophthalmoplegia, particularly in patients with a history of migraine.\n\n**Step 9: Multiple Sclerosis**  \nA demyelinating disease like multiple sclerosis can sometimes present with acute cranial nerve symptoms including ophthalmoplegia, especially if lesions occur near the brainstem.\n\n**Step 10: Guillain-Barré Syndrome**\nAlthough classically associated with ascending paralysis, variants of Guillain-Barré syndrome can involve cranial nerves leading to ophthalmoplegia.\n\n### Reranked Differential Diagnoses Considering Given Patient Information:\n\n1. **Pituitary Apoplexy** - Given her known macro adenoma, recent surgery, and acute onset.\n2. **Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis** - Possible due to recent surgery and proximity of the tumor to the sinus.\n3. **Brainstem Stroke** - Due to the possibility of vascular compromise from the surgery or tumor effects.\n4. **Meningitis** - Concern due to postoperative setting and the patient’s complex clinical picture making her susceptible to infections.\n5. **Myasthenia Gravis** - Less likely but could cause ophthalmoplegia, warrants exclusion in the differential diagnosis.\n6. **Multiple Sclerosis** - Unlikely due to sudden onset but a possible demyelinating event should be considered.\n7. **Diabetic Third Nerve Palsy** - If the patient has an unknown history of diabetes; however, simultaneous bilateral involvement is atypical.\n8. **Orbital Cellulitis** - Less likely given the intraoperative setting and absence indicative early signs of infection.\n9. **Basilar Artery Migraine** - Although unlikely, it should be considered if the patient had a pertinent history.\n10. **Guillain-Barré Syndrome** - Least likely due to the primary focus on cranial nerve involvement which doesn't closely fit typical presentations.\n\nPrioritizing evaluation, imaging, and possibly surgery considerations for the first few diagnoses especially pituitary apoplexy is crucial.

The echocardiogram was performed because of an abnormal electrocardiogram demonstrating sinus tachycardia accompanied by high QRS voltage with a strain pattern in the precordial leads. She had no history of other illnesses. On physical examination, the patient was 154 cm tall and weighed 38 kg. The cardiovascular examination was unremarkable.

Review of the transthoracic echocardiogram showed diffuse hypertrophy, moderately decreased contractility of the left ventricle, and increased intramyocardial signal intensity (Video). The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. On admission, brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated cerebellar atrophy. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated diffuse biventricular hypertrophy and moderately impaired left ventricular systolic function.

Physical examination revealed a 3-cm round fluctuant area lateral to the right lateral canthus, mildly tender to palpation. No overlying warmth or erythema and no lymphadenopathy. The patient’s dentures appeared to be well fitting, but mouth opening was at approximately 50% of expected. Laboratory results included an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 20 mm/h, and normal complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel results, and lactate levels. Findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure, A) were most consistent with osteomyelitis of the mandible with inflammation of surrounding soft tissues.

However, the ESR level would typically be higher, and negative results for temporal arteritis on biopsy lean against it.\n\n3. **Temporal Arteritis** - Similar reasoning as Giant Cell Arteritis, and with both overlapping in their clinical manifestations related to temporal and systemic inflammation, it continued to be a highly considered differential until biopsy results indicated otherwise.\n\n4. **Sarcoidosis** - Known for causing granulomatous inflammation which could theoretically involve the cranial structures and mimic some of the localized signs seen in this patient. However, lack of supportive serological evidence and typical systemic symptoms make it less likely.\n\n5. **Osteomyelitis** - The initial MRI results suggested osteomyelitis, but the lack of improvement with extended courses of appropriate antibiotics and lack of evidence on cultures moves this lower on the list.\n\n6. **Lymphoma** - Generalized lymphatic system involvement could present similarly, but again, specific testing and lack of supporting systemic symptoms reduce suspicion.\n\n7. **Sjögren's Syndrome** - Could potentially explain some of the facial and oral symptoms, but the severity, site of swelling, and lack of response to typical treatments along with negative specific serology decrease its likelihood.\n\n8. **Parotitis** - While this could fit symptomatically in part, the localization and the extent of the symptoms, along with additional findings on imaging, make this less plausible.\n\n9. **Orbital Cellulitis** - Although it involves inflammation of tissues around the eye, the involvement of jaw and deeper structures along with the progression into the temporal lobe seen in MRI goes beyond the typical reach of this diagnosis.\n\n10. **Mucormycosis** - Often aggressive in immunocompromised individuals; negative fungal cultures and the patient's otherwise healthy status make this far less likely.\n\n11. **Trigeminal Neuralgia** - Generally would not cause visible swelling or abnormal MRI findings; this is primarily a diagnosis of pain without significant physical findings.\n\nGiven the follow-up studies and unique progression, *Atypical Vasculitis* fits as the most likely diagnosis after considering all aspects of the patient's presentation and testing outcomes.", "topic": "['Otolaryngology', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Dental Medicine']"}

Primary care evaluation was prompted by his mother, as the patient had not noticed his lower extremity edema. He had no fevers, weight loss, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, or history of deep vein thrombosis. His physical examination was notable for firm, nonpitting edema to the hip. He did not have any associated tenderness, inguinal lymphadenopathy, or palpable abdominal masses. His vital signs were within normal limits and he ambulated comfortably. Laboratory work results, including a complete blood cell count with a differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, and D-dimer levels, were within normal limits. Doppler ultrasonography of his right lower extremity showed no deep vein thrombosis.

She had recently experienced acute pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, a tonic-clonic seizure, transient episodes with tetaniform stiffness in both upper limbs, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding caused by gastric angiodysplasia, which was treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and argon electrocoagulation. Her medical history included alcohol intake of 2 to 4 drinks daily for several years that had stopped 10 years before admission, hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, dilated ischemic cardiomyopathy, and a stroke 12 years earlier and recovered without sequelae. Her medications included omeprazole, furosemide, atorvastatin, allopurinol, metformin, levetiracetam, and acenocoumarol. Physical examination revealed confusion, dysarthria, appendicular dysmetria with truncal ataxia, and downbeat nystagmus. She was well nourished. Results of blood tests showed a mild creatinine increase of 1.62 mg/dL (normal range, 0.4-1.2 mg/dL; to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4), serum phosphate levels of 2.4 mg/dL (normal range, 2.5-4.5 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.323), corrected calcium levels of 7.1 mg/dL (normal range, 9.0-10.5 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.25), and serum magnesium levels of 0.3 mg/dL (normal range, 1.8-2.5 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.4114). The results of tests for blood cell count, liver function, and thyroid function were normal, as were levels of sodium; potassium; vitamin B12; folic acid; vitamin E; and antinuclear, antineutrophil cytoplasmic, antigliadin, anti–glutamic acid decarboxylase, and anti-transglutaminase antibodies. Cerebrospinal fluid levels were normal, including proteins, glucose, and cell count; polymerase chain reaction for herpes viruses; and enterovirus. Oligoclonal bands (IgG and IgM) were absent, and IgG index was normal. Onconeural and neuronal membrane antibodies were negative in paired samples of cerebrospinal fluid and serum, and included the following: Hu, Yo, Ri, CV2, amphiphysin, Ma2, recoverin, SOX1, titin, Zic4, glutamic acid decarboxylase 65, N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor, contactin-associated protein-like 2, LGT1, γ-aminobutyric acid type B , AMPA1/AMPA2, dipeptidyl-peptidase–like protein 6, and Purkinje cells.

He had undergone strabismus surgery for crossed eyes as a young child and more recently had laser in situ keratomileusis performed. He was medically healthy and neurodevelopmentally normal but had been born 4½ weeks premature. There was no family history of strabismus, and he denied diplopia. On examination, corrected visual acuity was 20/30 − 2 OD and 20/15 OS. Both pupils reacted briskly to light with no afferent pupillary defect. He had 1+ apparent overaction of the right inferior oblique and superior rectus muscles. When he was inattentive, his eyes appeared to be straight (Figure 1). Prism and alternate cover testing during near fixation showed a right esotropia and dissociated vertical divergence when fixing with his preferred left eye (Figure 1, left inset) and a larger left esotropia during forced fixation with his right eye (Figure 1, right inset).

The patient denied any manipulation or trauma at those sites. There was no personal or family history of keloid formation. The boy was otherwise healthy and met normal developmental milestones. On examination of the patient, there were many short, skin-colored, parallel cords on the patient’s anterior neck areas (Figure, A and B). These cords were indurated, slightly raised, and well defined with a shiny surface. The cords had a uniform width of approximately 2 mm, and the lengths varied from 3 mm to 2 cm. During the course of the examination, an ill-defined sclerotic plaque surrounding the underside of the clavicle was found. It had a shiny surface, irregular shape, and measured 10 × 4 cm.

A carotid cavernous sinus fistula could explain the vascular symptoms, elevated IOP, and auditory signs reported by the patient.\n\n2. **Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma** - Initially suspected due to raised intraocular pressure and eye redness; however, these symptoms also overlap with other diagnoses. Still a consideration but less likely given the overall presentation and progression under typical glaucoma treatment.\n\n3. **Temporal Arteritis** - The patient's age and symptoms of a chronic headache make this a differential to consider. Although, less likely due to lack of systemic symptoms typical of temporal arteritis such as jaw claudication or significant vision loss.\n\n4. **Scleritis** - Possible due to the eye redness and pain. The nature of the redness and presence of dull headache might indicate an underlying systemic inflammation.\n\n5. **Uveitis** - The internal ocular inflammation could explain the discomfort and raised IOP; however, symptoms like \"whooshing\" sound and severe redness extending with conjunctival chemosis might be less typical.\n\n6. **Orbital Cellulitis** - The symptoms of eyelid swelling and worsening of the eye condition could suggest an infectious etiology, but other cardinal signs like fever and severe pain might not be prominent.\n\n7. **Keratitis** - While it could cause redness and discomfort, it typically presents with more focal corneal signs rather than the broad symptoms seen here.\n\n8. **Conjunctivitis** - Initially considered but less likely given the severity and progression of symptoms despite treatment appropriate for conjunctivitis.\n\n9. **Orbital Tumor** - This could explain progressive symptoms and headache, but other more acute signs and symptoms are less consistent with this diagnosis.\n\n10. **Allergic Reaction** - Potential initial consideration for redness and swelling, but the chronicity and progression of symptoms suggest a more complex underlying issue.", "topic": "['Radiology', 'Neuroimaging', 'Neurology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Pediatrics']"}

He was born in 1973 at 38th week of gestation followed by a normal delivery (weight, 3.15 kg and head circumference, 42 cm) to nonconsanguineous parents. The head size was normal at birth, and no other abnormalities were seen during his infancy. At age 2 years, his parents noticed that he had delayed motor and language milestones. He experienced a progressive developmental delay such as reduction of head growth, loss of acquired communication, and loss of motor functions between ages 9 and 12 years. The severity of scoliosis increased with age, and he became a wheelchair user at age 18 years. He was referred to us at age 40 years with the characteristic features of growth deceleration (height, 142 cm; weight, 22 kg; body mass index, 11 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]), apraxia, left-sided hemiplegia, spasticity, sleep apnea, constipation, osteoporosis, hypoalgesia, and repetitive hand tapping (Video). Blood reports showed anemia (hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL; to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10) and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (47 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259). There was no history of autistic behavior, vision or hearing impairments, or epilepsy. The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with T wave inversion (V3-V6), and echocardiography showed mild cardiomegaly. The brain magnetic resonance imaging studies showed a diffuse reduction in the corpus callosum involving splenium and enlarged right ventricle, resulting in cerebral lateral ventricular asymmetry (Figure, C).\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Rett syndrome", "predict": "### Step-by-step Differential Diagnosis Process:\n\n1. **Cerebral Palsy** - Given the early motor delays, gait abnormalities, and left-sided hemiplegia.\n2. **Fragile X Syndrome** - Considered due to intellectual disability and developmental delays.\n3. **Down Syndrome** - Potential consideration given the intellectual disability and physical growth attributes.\n4. **Wilson's Disease** - Considered because of the progressive neurological dysfunction, although typically associated with liver disease symptoms not reported in the case.\n5. **Angelman Syndrome** - Intellectual disability, developmental delays, and movement disorders prompt consideration.\n6. **Prader-Willi Syndrome** - Included due to short stature, weight issues, and developmental milestones delay.\n7. **Tay-Sachs Disease** - Added to the differential due to progressive neurological decline noted from a young age.\n8. **Huntington's Disease** - Considered due to neurological decline and movement issues, though typically with later onset.\n9. **Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy** - Included due to progressive muscle weakness, though usually presents earlier and is muscular rather than neurological.\n10. **Rett Syndrome** - Initially not considered typical in males but included due to characteristic repetition of movements, developmental regression, and other matching clinical features.\n\n### Reranking of Differential Diagnoses Based on Full Patient Information and Test Results:\n\n1. **Rett Syndrome** - Despite being rare in males, patient's symptoms highly align with typical Rett syndrome manifestations, making it the most likely diagnosis.\n2. **Cerebral Palsy** - Possibility remains due to early motor milestones delay and hemiplegia, but less specific to all other symptoms.\n3. **Angelman Syndrome** - Some symptom overlap, notably in movement and developmental issues, but lack of characteristic laughter and other key manifestations.\n4. **Prader-Willi Syndrome** - Consideration remains due to growth issues but lacks genetic testing support and some hallmark symptoms.\n5. **Fragile X Syndrome** - Remains a plausible consideration given intellectual impairment; however, usually accompanied by distinct facial features not mentioned.\n6. **Down Syndrome** - Physical and cognitive developmental issues align, though typically includes distinct facial features not described.\n7. **Tay-Sachs Disease** - Progressive neurodegeneration is a fit, but the typical early fatal outcome does not align with patient age.\n8. **Huntington's Disease** - Progressive neurodegeneration fits, but onset usually later and lacks genetic confirmation.\n9. **Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy** - Less likely due to primarily muscular focus rather than neurological.\n10. **Wilson's Disease** - Least likely due to absence of hepatic symptoms typically associated with this disorder in presented case.\n\nGiven the overall clinical presentation and unique aspects of this case, Rett syndrome, though rare in males, emerges as the most fitting diagnosis supported by symptomatology and lack of critical features typical of other disorders.", "topic": "['Adolescent Medicine', 'Genetics and Genomics', 'Neurogenetics', 'Pediatrics', 'Neurology']"}

Multiple prior office visits with referring ophthalmologists during which eyes were dilated showed normal results. Clinical examination revealed 180° of left interior subconjunctival hemorrhage with overlying conjunctival elevation and mild fullness of the left lower eyelid (Figure 1A). Fixation was central, steady, and maintained bilaterally, with full ocular motility and absence of appreciable proptosis. Penlight anterior segment examination demonstrated normally formed anterior segment structures without inflammation or hyphema in either eye, although the left eye exhibited a small intraocular lightly pigmented lesion at the 5-o'clock limbus. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) was deemed appropriate and further demonstrated normal intraocular pressures bilaterally. Handheld slitlamp examination localized the left eye 2-mm limbal lesion on the posterior corneal surface. The surrounding corneal and iris structures were normal appearing without evidence of vascularization. Ultrasound biomicroscopy was used to further evaluate both the intraocular lesion and better characterize the left lower eyelid fullness. This demonstrated no iris, angle, or ciliary body involvement by the intraocular lesion. A 10-MHz contact B-scan examination showed a large inferior orbital lesion measuring more than 17 mm in the anterior-to-posterior dimension (Figure 1B).

Lymphoma - Given the presence of adenopathy and the nature of the involvement, a lymphoma could be considered though less likely due to positive staining for squamous cell markers.\n5. Thyroid carcinoma - A primary thyroid carcinoma is possible but less likely given the negative staining for TTF-1 which is often positive in thyroid malignancies.\n6.

Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a large right upper lobe cavitary mass. He was treated empirically with intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsy was performed. Lung tissue was sent for bacterial, fungal, mycobacterial, and Nocardia cultures and for histopathology. BAL cultures grew 100 colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL of group B streptococci and 1 CFU/mL of Aspergillus niger. Results of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and GeneXpert MTB/RIF testing were negative. Voriconazole was added to his treatment. Transbronchial biopsy histopathology showed acute and chronic inflammation, granulation tissue and necrosis, and negative fungal and AFB stains. Two weeks later, the patient reported worsening right-sided chest pain provoked by palpation, right arm movement, and deep inspiration. Repeat chest CT demonstrated cavitary mass enlargement with possible pleural invasion (Figure 1, left). He developed hypoxemia and required intubation.

Her primary care physician initially obtained an ultrasonographic image, which demonstrated a left, level 2 lymph node measuring 4.0 × 1.5 × 2.8 cm. The patient then underwent several courses of antibiotic treatment, but the mass persisted. After a period of conservative management, she developed a sore throat and fever.

His turbinates appeared normal. The patient underwent surgical excision of the septal lesion under general anesthesia for definitive diagnosis. The specimen measured 1.1 × 0.7 × 0.2 cm and was erythematous, soft, vascular, and adherent, with a broad base to the anterior superior nasal septal mucosa just inferior to the upper lateral cartilage (Figure 1A and B).

Chondroma - The anatomical location at the nasal septum and the firmness of the lesion supports this possibility, although the vascular nature revealed in surgery makes it less likely.\n4. Inverted Papilloma - Should also be considered due to its nature of appearing as a unilateral nasal mass; however, the lack of characteristic epithelial changes noted during surgical examination lowers its likelihood.\n5. Squamous Cell Carcinoma - The chronicity and location raise this as a possibility; however, the lack of aggressive growth and other systemic symptoms make this less probable.\n6. Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis - This vasculitis could cause nasal lesions but usually presents with more systemic signs and more aggressive symptoms.\n7.

His mental state had deteriorated progressively over the previous 12 months, following the death of his father. After a period living alone, he had returned to the family home 4 months prior to his presentation and had been noted to be socially withdrawn, preoccupied, and distractible. His family physician, suspecting a depressive episode, had prescribed citalopram up to a dosage of 40 mg once daily, to no effect. His family subsequently sought advice from the family physician when the patient was noted to be speaking to himself, expressing concerns about people meaning him harm, and professing the belief that he could hear other peoples’ thoughts. The patient had been born in Sierra Leone after a complicated delivery and had traveled to the United Kingdom as a child with his family, who were fleeing from a civil war. On arrival in the United Kingdom, his family claimed asylum and moved into a small apartment in a high-rise building in central London. Although there was no reported developmental delay, he had struggled academically at school and was bullied for having overweight. He left school without qualifications at age 16 years and worked as a shop assistant. He left this job about a year prior to his referral to psychiatry after a period of sick leave following the death of his father. He was a nonsmoker, did not drink alcohol, and denied illicit drug use. A paternal relative was reported to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia. There was no comorbid physical illness. On review, the patient was kempt and had overweight. Eye contact was fleeting, and he presented as anxious, with a degree of psychomotor agitation. His speech was normal in rate, volume, and tone, although tangential. There was no other evidence of thought disorder. He denied feeling low in mood or suicidal and was objectively euthymic. There was some sleep disturbance, with the patient reporting being fearful to go to sleep owing to persecutory beliefs regarding his neighbors. He reflected that over the preceding few months, he had experienced a sensation of detachment from his immediate environment, as though it was not real, making his world similar to that of a video game. He reported that in the apartment where he had previously been living, he had realized that something was amiss and had become convinced that the door number of his neighbor’s flat, number 6, signified that they meant him harm. He explained this was because 6 was associated with the number of the devil. He reported hearing his neighbors commenting negatively about his appearance. These distressing experiences prompted him to return to his family home, but he continued to hear his neighbors’ voices making derogatory comments about his appearance and began to hear them commenting on his actions and thoughts in the third person as well. On returning home, his paranoia regarding his previous neighbors worsened, resulting in him rarely leaving the house. The volume and frequency of derogatory auditory hallucinations also worsened, and he reported hearing the thoughts of others as well. There was a degree of insight, and although the patient was convinced of the reality of his experiences, he also saw the stress of losing his father as associated with his experiences and was accepting of input from mental health services.\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Schizophrenia", "predict": "**Step 1: Schizophrenia**\n\n**Step 2: Schizoaffective Disorder**\n\n**Step 3: Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features**\n\n**Step 4: Delusional Disorder**\n\n**Step 5: Bipolar Disorder with Psychotic Features**\n\n**Step 6: Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)**\n\n**Step 7: Substance-induced Psychotic Disorder**\n\n**Step 8: Psychotic Disorder due to Another Medical Condition**\n\n**Step 9: Brief Psychotic Disorder**\n\n**Step 10: Adjustment Disorder with Psychotic Features**\n\n### Reranking of Differential Diagnoses Based on Patient Information and Test Results:\n\n1. **Schizophrenia** - Given the presence of delusions, hallucinations, social withdrawal, the duration of symptoms (over 6 months), familial history, and the lack of mood symptoms align strongly with this diagnosis.\n\n2. **Schizoaffective Disorder** - While similar to schizophrenia, this disorder includes mood episodes.

The cornea was clear without keratic precipitates, and there were no iris nodules. Pigment was present on the anterior lens capsule. A fundus examination demonstrated a moderate amount of vitreous cell, hyperemia and edema of the optic disc, and retinal detachments in both eyes (Figure).

One month before presentation at our facility, the patient began developing erythematous papules on her arms and legs. The papules enlarged and ulcerated. Some of them healed spontaneously with poxlike scars. She had no recent history of travel. At admission, the patient was tachycardic and febrile to a temperature of 38.5°C. Routine laboratory testing revealed normocytic anemia (hemoglobin, 7.7 g/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10]). Shave biopsies of necrotic nodules on the left arm and left cheek (Figure, B-D) and, later, an excisional biopsy of a cervical lymph node were performed. Head computed tomography demonstrated a soft-tissue mass that encased the nasal bone and extended into the right maxillary sinus and left nasal cavity. Chest computed tomography showed bilateral pulmonary nodules. Physical examination revealed a necrotic plaque with surrounding erythema on the distal nose (Figure, A). A 1 × 1-cm crateriform papule with central necrosis was present on the left malar cheek. Multiple nodules with central, dry necrosis and areas of poxlike scarring were scattered across the extremities.

She was living in Japan and recently visited a neighboring island but denied any international travel. On examination, her blood pressure was 142/84 mm Hg; temperature, 38.3°C; pulse, 91/min; respiratory rate, 24/min; and oxygen saturation, 97% on ambient air. She was alert and oriented. There were no mucosal lesions or conjunctival injection. A maculopapular rash was noted on the trunk and extremities (Figure) as well as the palms and soles. The face was not involved. The lungs were clear to auscultation. No hepatosplenomegaly was noted. Neurologic examination, including results of motor, sensory, and reflex testing, was unremarkable. There was no neck stiffness or lymphadenopathy. Laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 2900/μL (80% neutrophils, 13% lymphocytes, 6% monocytes, 0% eosinophils, and 0% basophils); hemoglobin level, 15.2 g/dL; and platelet count, 187 ×103/μL.

Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia - Should be strongly considered due to the erythematous and slightly raised appearance of the lesion in the genital area of an elderly patient.\n5. Insect bite reaction - Less likely given the location and patient's medical history, but can appear as a hemispherical papule though usually accompanied by more acute itching.\n6.

The lesion had developed acutely over 48 hours, starting as symmetric pink patches leading to pustules, erosions, and ulceration. Associated symptoms included generalized fatigue, but no fevers, chills, or other systemic symptoms. The child’s parents denied any new topical exposures or medications. The child was born via vaginal delivery at full term. Pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes. The child had no major medical issues and met all developmental milestones. There was no relevant family medical history. Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics were initiated on admission. Dermatology was consulted prior to scheduled debridement and skin grafting. Physical examination revealed a well-appearing infant with normal vital signs. Extending from the gluteal cleft to just medial to the labia, there was a symmetric, well-defined ulcer with a cribriform base, central necrosis, and rolled, pink-to-violaceous, undermined border (Figure, A). Initial laboratory workup was significant for leukocytosis (22 000/mm3) and thrombocytosis (764 000/mm3). Serum zinc and alkaline phosphatase were within normal limits. A punch biopsy of the edge of the ulcer was obtained and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (Figure, B and C). Microbial stains were negative.

He had emmetropia, and his ocular and medical history were unremarkable. Over the preceding few days, he noticed worsening blurry vision with redness in both eyes associated with headaches, nausea, and severe tinnitus. On presentation, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/200 OD and 20/400 OS. Intraocular pressure was 45 mm Hg OU. Pupils were 4 mm and minimally reactive. There was 1+ conjunctival injection, diffuse corneal edema with Descemet folds, and the anterior chamber was shallow in both eyes. After the administration of multiple rounds of topical and oral medications, his intraocular pressure improved to 18 mm Hg OD and 19 mm Hg OS. A dilated fundus examination revealed tilted discs, serous retinal detachments, and multiple yellow, depigmented chorioretinal spots throughout the posterior pole in both eyes. B-scan ultrasonography showed shallow retinal detachments, choroidal thickening, and extensive, shallow choroidal detachments extending anteriorly in both eyes (Figure 1A). A-scan ultrasonography showed normal axial length of 22 mm OU.

Sagittal T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with IV contrast and fat suppression demonstrated signal hypointense to muscle centrally with peripheral enhancement (Figure, D).\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Abscess", "predict": "**Step 1: Differential Diagnosis**\n1.

Abscess - Given the hypodense center with rim enhancement on CT, hyperintensity on DWI, and overall imaging characteristics suggesting fluid collection or necrosis.\n2. Squamous cell carcinoma - Considered due to the persistent and worsening nature of the swelling, though typically might show more aggressive features.\n3. Lymphoma - Included due to potential multinodular appearance and hyperintense T2 signal.\n4. Tuberculosis - Although less common, could manifest as hypointense nodules with peripheral enhancement.\n5. Sialadenitis - Initially diagnosed, explaining some signs of inflammation though not perfectly aligning with imaging.\n6. Hemangioma - Consideration due to hyperintense T2 signal and demographic, but less likely due to lack of typical enhancement pattern.\n7. Salivary gland tumor - Possible given location and imaging but lower on the list due to signal characteristics.\n8. Amyloidosis - Less likely, receptor for localized deposition but can sometimes present with soft tissue swelling.\n9. Lipoma - Considers fat-containing lesions but less likely due to hypointensity and other imaging characteristics.\n10. Vascular malformation - A potential differential but typically shows more distinct vascular markers on imaging.", "topic": "['Radiology', 'Trauma and Injury', 'Neuroimaging', 'Neurology', 'Otolaryngology']"}

Rerank all 10 differential diagnosis using all patient information and test results. Let’s think step by step.\n### INPUT:\nA previously healthy 18-year-old college student presented to the emergency department with a 6-month history of fatigue, dry cough, dyspnea, and unintentional weight loss of 18 kg (from 100 to 82 kg). Four months ago, she was treated for presumed pneumonia with azithromycin without improvement. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use intravenous drugs. She was born in the United States and had not traveled outside of the country. She took no medications. On examination, her temperature was 37°C, heart rate 110/min, blood pressure 123/72 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 20/min. She had a palpable 2×2-cm firm, nontender, right supraclavicular lymph node and decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion in the right lower lung field. No hepatosplenomegaly or leg edema was noted. Routine laboratory tests, including complete blood cell counts, renal function, electrolytes, and hepatic function, were within normal limits. A chest x-ray demonstrated diffuse homogeneous opacification of the right lung field. Computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a 15 × 11-cm centrally necrotic mass in the right anterior mediastinum displacing the trachea to the left, a large right pleural effusion, and compression of the superior vena cava (Figure 1).\n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Hodgkin lymphoma", "predict": "**Step 1: Lymphoma**\n- Primary suspicion based on the age, presentation with lymphadenopathy (supraclavicular lymph node), mediastinal mass, and constitutional symptoms.\n\n**Step 2: Thymoma**\n- Considered due to presence of an anterior mediastinal mass, which is commonly associated with thymomas.\n\n**Step 3: Germ cell tumor**\n- Included due to mediastinal mass; typically seen in younger patients.\n\n**Step 4: Sarcoidosis**\n- Characteristic symptoms include cough, dyspnea, and lymphadenopathy; however, the large necrotic mass is atypical for sarcoidosis.\n\n**Step 5: Tuberculosis**\n- Chronic cough, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy suggest this diagnosis, but rare in the U.S. without travel history or known exposure.\n\n**Step 6: Lung Cancer**\n- Despite her young age, the presence of a large lung-related mass and weight loss bring this into consideration.\n\n**Step 7: Metastatic Cancer**\n- Given a large mass and significant weight loss, a metastatic origin from an unknown primary should be considered.\n\n**Step 8: Thymic Carcinoma**\n- Rarer than thymoma but associated with aggressive features and could present similarly.\n\n**Step 9: Hodgkin's Lymphoma**\n- Similar to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but specific consideration given the age and lymphadenopathy.\n\n**Step 10: Bronchogenic Cyst**\n- Less likely considered but included due to mass in the thoracic region and the presentation of respiratory symptoms.\n\n**Reranking of Differential Diagnosis Considering All Information:**\n1. **Lymphoma** - Most consistent given the symptomatology, young age, and the presence of a large necrotic mediastinal mass alongside significant constitutional symptoms.\n2. **Germ cell tumor** - Generally more common in this age group than some other causes of mediastinal masses.\n3. **Thymoma** - Common with anterior mediastinal masses but less likely to produce significant systemic symptoms of weight loss and night sweats.\n4. **Hodgkin's Lymphoma** - Very plausible due to age and presentation, particularly with the significant lymphadenopathy.\n5. **Lung Cancer** - Less typical in this age group but cannot be ruled out given the mass and respiratory complaints.\n6. **Metastatic Cancer** - Should remain suspected despite the young age until primary focus and histological examination are concluded.\n7. **Thymic Carcinoma** - A possibility given the aggressive nature of the mediastinal mass and displacement of the trachea.\n8. **Tuberculosis** - Lower on the differential in a U.S. born patient without significant travel history but still possible.\n9. **Sarcoidosis** - Further down the list due to the atypical presentation with a necrotic central mass.\n10. **Bronchogenic Cyst** - Least likely given the patient's symptoms and the characteristics of the mass, but should still be considered in differential until further diagnostic results are available.", "topic": "['Adolescent Medicine', 'Pediatrics', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Lymphomas', 'Hematology']"}
