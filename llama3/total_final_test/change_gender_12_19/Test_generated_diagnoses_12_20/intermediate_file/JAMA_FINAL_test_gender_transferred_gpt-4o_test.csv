### INPUT:
A 77-year-old female with history of hypertension and asthma presented with 3 months of progressive decline in vision in the left eye. She had no known ocular history. At presentation, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/100 OD and 20/50 OS. Intraocular pressures were normal bilaterally and pupils were equally reactive. Examination of the right eye was unremarkable except for moderate cataract. The left-eye slitlamp examination was remarkable for a shallow but quiet anterior chamber and moderate cataract. Dilated fundus examination of the left eye revealed shallow peripheral serous choroidal detachments, bullous inferior macula-involving retinal detachment with shifting fluid, and diffuse hyperpigmented lesions involving the macula and superior fundus that corresponded to areas of nodular retinal pigment epithelium thickening on optical coherence tomography (Figure 1). These hyperpigmented lesions were associated with hyperautofluorescence and blockage on fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography. No retinal breaks were seen on scleral depressed examination. Ultrasound biomicroscopy demonstrated 360° ciliochoroidal effusion. Axial length was 24.30 mm OD and 24.32 mm OS. The patient denied a history of known refractive error.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Idiopathic uveal effusion syndrome,"1. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease**  
   - Considering the choroidal effusion, retinal pigment epithelium changes, and lack of ocular history.

2. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy**  
   - Due to shifting fluid and serous choroidal detachments, common in systemic corticosteroid use.

3. **Uveal Effusion Syndrome**  
   - Characterized by ciliochoroidal effusion and peripheral serous detachments with no apparent cause.

4. **Age-Related Macular Degeneration**  
   - Due to hyperpigmented lesions and changes in the macula.

5. **Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy**  
   - Can present with macular detachment and serous choroidal components.

6. **Lymphoma**  
   - Intraocular lymphomas could have subretinal detachments and retinal pigment epithelium changes.

7. **Scleritis**  
   - Though classic symptoms are absent, it can have associated ciliochoroidal effusion and serous detachments.

8. **Metastatic Tumor**  
   - Can present with subretinal fluid and retinal detachments.

9. **Posterior Scleritis**  
   - Though inflammation is not overt, deep inflammation can mimic choroidal effusion.

10. **Choroidal Melanoma**  
   - Presents variably, can cause retinal detachment and hyperpigmented lesions.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy**  
   - Given shifting fluid and presumption of possible systemic steroid use for asthma.

2. **Uveal Effusion Syndrome**  
   - Due to presence of unexplained ciliochoroidal effusions.

3. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease**  
   - Less likely due to lack of systemic involvement but still possible with ocular symptoms.

4. **Age-Related Macular Degeneration**  
   - Given patient's age and macular changes.

5. **Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy**  
   - Possible due to serous detachment pattern.

6. **Lymphoma**  
   - Intraocular presentation could account for effusions and lesions.

7. **Metastatic Tumor**  
   - With systemic review, could become more plausible.

8. **Posterior Scleritis**  
   - Possible despite lack of overt signs due to choroidal involvement.

9. **Scleritis**  
   - Less likely but considered for differential purposes.

10. **Choroidal Melanoma**  
   - Less evidence but a differential due to retinal changes and subretinal fluid.","['Retinal Disorders', 'Ophthalmic Imaging', 'Ophthalmology', 'Macular Diseases']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,77.0,M

### INPUT:
A 23-year-old female patient sought evaluation at the vascular thyroid surgery clinic for a large neck tumor that appeared abruptly 10 days prior. The patient reported experiencing tightness and discomfort in the left side of the neck but denied experiencing any pain. She denied any recent incidents of neck trauma or impact. Furthermore, her medical history did not reveal any previous hematological disorders. The ultrasonography examination detected the presence of a well-defined, solid mass located in the left lobe of the thyroid gland. The mass exhibited regular shape, distinct boundaries, heterogeneous echogenicity, and observable blood flow signals. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck detected heterogeneous density mass shadows within the soft tissue region near the left lobe of the thyroid, exhibiting distinct boundaries measuring 53 × 41 × 88 mm. Subsequent enhanced CT did not reveal notable enhancement of the cystic components of the mass (Figure 1). Due to persistent symptoms, the patient expressed a desire for surgical resection. Consequently, the patient underwent open surgery to remove the mass, aiming to establish a definitive diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Vagal schwannoma,"1. **Thyroid Adenoma**: A benign tumor of the thyroid gland, often presenting as a well-defined mass with regular shape and distinct boundaries in imaging studies.
   
2. **Follicular Thyroid Carcinoma**: A type of malignancy that can appear as a solid mass in the thyroid with regular margins; requires histological examination for confirmation.
   
3. **Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma**: An aggressive form of thyroid cancer, can present with a rapidly enlarging neck mass.
   
4. **Thyroid Cyst**: Although noted there was no significant enhancement of cystic components, a thyroid cyst could present as a palpable mass.
   
5. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst**: A congenital neck mass that can become symptomatic and noticeable in a young adult.
   
6. **Parathyroid Adenoma**: Though less common in the thyroid region, it can at times present as a palpable neck mass.
   
7. **Lymphoma of the Thyroid**: Primary thyroid lymphoma is a rare condition that can manifest as a large, rapidly enlarging mass.
   
8. **Hemangioma**: A vascular tumor that can be found in soft tissues, including in the neck region.
   
9. **Metastatic Neck Mass**: Metastasis to the thyroid or surrounding areas can present as a neck mass, rare in a young patient without a history of cancer.
   
10. **Riedel's Thyroiditis**: A rare fibrosing condition that can cause a thyroid enlargement and mimic a mass.

**Reranked Differential Diagnosis:**

1. **Follicular Thyroid Carcinoma**: Uncommon in the age but fits the presentation as a solid thyroid mass.
2. **Thyroid Adenoma**: Most benign and common thyroid lesion leading to a mass, especially with sonographic features described.
3. **Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma**: Considered due to rapid appearance and young age being unusual.
4. **Lymphoma of the Thyroid**: Due to the described mass characteristics and absence of systemic symptoms.
5. **Hemangioma**: Based on the vascular nature of the mass.
6. **Riedel's Thyroiditis**: As a rare condition but with characteristic solid mass presentation.
7. **Thyroid Cyst**: Less likely due to imaging features but not excluded.
8. **Parathyroid Adenoma**: Uncommon presentation but considered based on location.
9. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst**: Typically more common in midline and younger presentation.
10. **Metastatic Neck Mass**: Unlikely without history of malignancy given the patient’s age.","['Endocrinology', 'Thyroid Disorders', 'Diabetes and Endocrinology', 'Endocrine Surgery', 'Head and Neck Surgery']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,23.0,M

### INPUT:
A female patient was evaluated by the dermatology inpatient consult service. She reported a 5-week history of a skin lesion on the right anterior thigh with intermittent itching and mild tenderness to palpation. There was no preceding trauma to the area. The lesion was stable in size. She denied systemic symptoms of fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, and dyspnea on exertion. She was unhoused and sleeping on the streets with her dog prior to hospitalization. Physical examination was remarkable for a 5-cm erythematous plaque studded with papules and pustules (Figure 1A). No pus or granules could be expressed with pressure. The patient had no similar skin lesions elsewhere on the body. A 6-mm punch biopsy was obtained from the lesion. One half was sent for routine histopathology with special stains, and the other half was submitted for bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial culture (Figure 1B).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Deep dermatophytosis,"1. **Infective Dermatosis**: Suspect bacterial skin infection such as cellulitis given the erythematous nature of the plaque. However, no expressible pus reduces likelihood.

2. **Fungal Infection**: Given the patient's unhoused status and exposure to a dog, dermatophyte infection (e.g., tinea) could be a consideration. 

3. **Animal Exposure**: Due to recent exposure to a dog, infection like Capnocytophaga canimorsus from dog saliva could be a differential.

4. **Cutaneous Leishmaniasis**: Given potential exposures from living conditions, vector-borne parasitic infections like leishmaniasis are considered.

5. **Lupus Erythematosus**: Chronic erythematous plaques in the absence of systemic symptoms could suggest cutaneous lupus.

6. **Psoriasis**: Chronic plaque psoriasis is considered for its presentation as erythematous thickened skin lesions.

7. **Pemphigus Vulgaris**: Considered because of pustule presence, albeit rare without mucosal involvement or systemic symptoms.

8. **Granulomatous Disease**: Conditions like sarcoidosis presenting with erythematous plaques studded with papules.

9. **Vasculitis**: Cutaneous small vessel vasculitis can present with such skin changes, but usually associated with systemic symptoms.

10. **Chronic Contact Dermatitis**: Potential exposure to irritants or allergens due to unhoused status and environmental exposures.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Cutaneous Leishmaniasis**: Rises due to high-risk exposure given living conditions, vector-prone areas, and clinical presentation of non-healing plaque.

2. **Fungal Infection**: Dermatophyte infections are highly likely given common exposure with unhoused and pet ownership status.

3. **Infective Dermatosis**: Still a possibility due to classic presentation of erythematous lesion, despite lack of purulence.

4. **Granulomatous Disease**: Considering the characteristic plaques with no systemic symptoms, sarcoidosis becomes more plausible.

5. **Lupus Erythematosus**: Presence of a single stable chronic lesion can still be indicative of a dermal form of lupus.

6. **Animal Exposure**: Capnocytophaga infection due to consistent contact with dog and unhoused living.

7. **Psoriasis**: Lower on the list due to solitary lesion and absence of classical traits like scaling.

8. **Chronic Contact Dermatitis**: Mild tenderness could correspond to ongoing irritant exposure with the patient's environmental situation.

9. **Vasculitis**: Lack of multisystem involvement or acute symptomatology demotes vasculitis in differential ranking.

10. **Pemphigus Vulgaris**: Rarest scenario due to solitary, stable appearance with no mucosal involvement or systemic symptoms.",['Dermatology'],0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,-1.0,M

### INPUT:
A 74-year-old man with a history of breast cancer, now in remission, presented for evaluation of a conjunctival lesion of the right eye. Per his history, the lesion was noted over 18 years in the past by his optometrist. He reported no noticeable growth or changes to the lesion but was sent for evaluation with ocular oncology. Visual acuity with correction was 20/40 in the right eye and 20/30 in the left eye. Intraocular pressure was 14 mm Hg in the right eye and 16 mm Hg in the left eye. Anterior segment examination results were within normal limits for the left eye, and dilated fundus examination results for both eyes did not reveal concerning pathology. The conjunctiva of the right eye was notable for a small elevated pigmented lesion measuring approximately 2 × 2 mm with sentinel vessels (Figure 1A). Fundus photographs and autofluorescence (Figure 1B) as well as optical coherence tomography (OCT) were normal bilaterally. An anterior-segment OCT was performed and revealed a small elevated subepithelial lesion with shadowing vs possible scleral extension (Figure 1B).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Ciliary body melanoma with extrascleral extension masquerading as a conjunctival nevus,"1. **Conjunctival Nevus** - A common benign pigmented lesion of the conjunctiva that presents as a small, well-circumscribed nodule, often stable over time.

2. **Primary Acquired Melanosis (PAM)** - A unilateral, flat, pigmented lesion found primarily in middle-aged or elderly individuals that can remain stable or undergo malignant transformation.

3. **Conjunctival Melanoma** - A malignant tumor of the conjunctiva that usually arises from PAM or a nevus, characterized by growth and potential for metastasis.

4. **Ocular Surface Squamous Neoplasia (OSSN)** - A range of dysplastic changes in the squamous epithelium, presenting as elevated conjunctival lesions with or without pigmentation.

5. **Limbal Dermoid** - A benign, congenital choristoma often appearing as a solid, tumor-like mass at the corneoscleral junction.

6. **Conjunctival Pigmentation Secondary to Medication** - Pigmentation due to deposition or drug-induced changes, often bilateral but can present unilaterally.

7. **Conjunctival Hemangioma** - A benign vascular lesion, often appearing as a reddish, elevated lesion, rather than pigmented.

8. **Conjunctival Lymphoma** - A malignant lymphoid proliferation presenting typically as a salmon-colored, fleshy mass, rather than pigmented.

9. **Pyogenic Granuloma** - A benign, rapidly growing vascular lesion that appears following trauma or surgery, often non-pigmented.

10. **Nevus of Ota** - A dermal melanocytosis involving the ocular region, causing pigmentation that can affect the conjunctiva, typically more diffuse.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Conjunctival Nevus** - Stability over years and lack of growth or change are highly suggestive of a benign process such as a nevus.
2. **Primary Acquired Melanosis** - Though typically flat, PAM should be considered due to the presence of pigment and the potential for malignant transformation.
3. **Conjunctival Melanoma** - Given the pigmentation and sentinel vessels, malignancy must remain a consideration despite the stability.
4. **Ocular Surface Squamous Neoplasia (OSSN)** - Though less common when pigmented, OSSN can present variably.
5. **Conjunctival Pigmentation Secondary to Medication** - Consideration for any history of topical or systemic medications used.
6. **Limbal Dermoid** - Less likely given the adult-onset and pigmentation description.
7. **Conjunctival Hemangioma** - Unlikely due to pigmentation and long-term stability.
8. **Conjunctival Lymphoma** - Less common presentation and color make this less likely.
9. **Pyogenic Granuloma** - Typically fast-growing and non-pigmented, making it less likely given the history.
10. **Nevus of Ota** - Unlikely due to presentation as a localized lesion rather than diffuse pigmentation.","['External Eye Disease', 'Ophthalmology', 'Breast Cancer', ""Women's Health"", 'Oncology']",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,74.0,F

### INPUT:
A 52-year-old man presented with decreased vision in both eyes. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 3 months before presentation, with a hemoglobin A1c of 13%. At that time, he was given metformin and semaglutide for glucose control. His visual acuity was 20/50 OD and 20/200 OS. Fundus examination revealed retinal hemorrhages, hard exudates, and microaneurysms bilaterally (Figure, A and B). Fluorescein angiography revealed microaneurysms with noncentral leakage in the posterior pole with absence of significant ischemia and capillary dropout. Optical coherence tomography scans from the same day showed retinal edema with intraretinal fluid accumulation in both eyes (central subfield thickness: 320 nm OD, 764 nm OS) with foveal detachment in the left eye. He was diagnosed with severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy with macular edema in both eyes. He received 2 and 3 injections of bevacizumab in the right and left eyes, respectively, followed by 2 injections of aflibercept in both eyes with minimal effect on the edema. Blood analysis showed the following values: hemoglobin, 10.4 g/dL; red blood cell count, 3.30 × 106/μL; white blood cell count, 10 470/μL; platelets, 197 × 103/μL; fasting blood glucose, 150 mg/dL (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0555); normal lipid profile; and creatinine, 1.2 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4). Hemoglobin A1c decreased to 6.8% at 7 months after presentation.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Diabetic retinopathy**: The patient's recent history of type 2 diabetes, high initial hemoglobin A1c, and fundus examination findings correspond well with this diagnosis.
2. **Macular telangiectasia**: Consistent with the edematous changes and retinal findings, though less likely given the diabetic context.
3. **Hypertensive retinopathy**: Possible given the retinal changes, but less consistent without a history or indication of hypertension.
4. **Retinal vein occlusion**: Presents with similar retinal changes but is lower on the list due to lack of sudden vision loss or specific risk factors noted.
5. **Age-related macular degeneration**: Unlikely considering the patient's age and lack of drusen or pigmentary changes.
6. **Central serous chorioretinopathy**: Typically unilateral and presents with serous detachment, which doesn’t match the described clinical picture of bilateral disease with hemorrhages.
7. **Retinal detachment**: Unlikely given the patient's symptoms and bilateral involvement.
8. **Myopic maculopathy**: Insufficient evidence as the patient’s refractive status is not detailed.
9. **Infectious endophthalmitis**: Inconsistent with presentation; more likely in post-operative or post-traumatic scenarios.

### INPUT:
A 31-year-old man presented for evaluation of bilateral blurry vision over the past month. He experienced fulminant hepatic failure 3 months ago and underwent a liver transplant 2 weeks later. Postoperative pathological results showed hepatolenticular degeneration. Routine prophylactic antiherpes virus therapy had been applied for 2 weeks. Immunosuppressants, including tacrolimus and mycophenolate sodium, were applied for subsequent maintenance therapy. He noticed the onset of decreased vision in both eyes about 2 months after the liver transplant. Diagnosed with ocular herpes virus infection, he was given systemic valaciclovir and ocular laser retinopexy around areas of necrosis. His vision was not improved and twice intravitreous injection of ganciclovir was added. However, vision was decreasing continuously. At his presentation to our clinic, the best-corrected visual acuity was finger count in the right eye and 20/125 in the left eye. On slitlamp examination of both eyes, 1+ aqueous cells and 1+ flare were presented in the anterior chamber, while the dilated fundus examination showed mild inflammation in the vitreous. Extensive patches of yellowish necrotic lesions were seen at the peripheral retina of the right eye and 1 triangular necrotic lesion in the posterior pole (Figure 1A). A large annular necrosis was found in the peripheral retina of the left eye (Figure 1B).

A 69-year-old woman presented to the rheumatology clinic 3 weeks after being hospitalized for fever, fatigue, rash, right periorbital swelling, and shortness of breath. This was her fifth inpatient stay in the past 3 years for similar symptoms. During a recent hospitalization, she had purpuric macules and plaques on her lower extremities bilaterally (Figure, left panel). Laboratory testing revealed a white blood cell count of 2.9 × 103/μL (reference, 4.2-10.8 ×103/μL); mean corpuscular volume, 96.1 fL (reference, 80-96 fL); hemoglobin level, 12.4 mg/dL (reference, 14.0-18.0 mg/dL); and a normal platelet count. C-reactive protein level was 270 mg/L (reference, 0-5 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 98 mm/h (reference, 0-20 mm/h). Results of testing for antinuclear antibody and antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies were negative. Computed tomography of the chest revealed numerous small, bilateral pulmonary nodules (Figure, right panel). Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed bilateral inferior rectus muscle enlargement with mild inflammatory changes along the extraocular muscles and optic nerves. A skin biopsy showed a perivascular neutrophilic infiltrate consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis. During her most recent hospitalization, she was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone (40 mg twice daily) for 5 days and discharged taking oral prednisone (40 mg daily) for 4 weeks. Previously, she had pericardial and pleural effusions and pulmonary infiltrates. Pericardial biopsy showed organizing pericarditis and lung biopsy revealed cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, with negative IgG4 stains. Results of bone marrow biopsy, including flow cytometry and cytogenetic testing, performed 18 months prior to the current presentation were normal.

3. **Behçet's Disease** - Accounts for systemic inflammation, potential ocular involvement, and skin vasculitis, but is less common.

4. **Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR)** - Could explain elevated inflammatory markers and recurrent systemic symptoms, typically seen with age, though not all classic signs are present.

5. **Malignancy-associated Vasculitis** - Can present with systemic symptoms and vasculitis; the recurrent nature and age are suggestive of potential underlying malignancy.

6. **Cryoglobulinemic Vasculitis** - Despite the absence of cryoglobulins and RF, the skin findings and systemic symptoms suggest consideration.

7. **Myelodysplastic Syndrome** - Given the cytopenias, recurrent inflammatory symptoms, and age, though bone marrow was previously normal.

8. **Sarcoidosis** - Compatible with pulmonary nodules and systemic symptoms, but typically associated with elevated ACE levels and specific chest findings.

9. **Adult-onset Still's Disease** - Considering the fever, rash, myalgia, and elevated inflammatory markers but typically ANA/ANCA negative.

10. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** - Even though ANA is negative, the systemic presentation with rash, serositis, and cytopenias could fit atypical lupus.

### INPUT:
A 62-year-old female was referred for evaluation of a painless right lower-eyelid lesion noted during routine glaucoma follow-up. The lesion had been present for 3 years with slow, gradual enlargement. The patient denied any associated symptoms. She was a former smoker and had no history of skin cancer or immunosuppression. The remainder of her medical history was noncontributory. Inspection of the right lower eyelid revealed a cystic-appearing nodule that transilluminated and had a few overlying telangiectasias. The cystic portion was continuous with a deeper, smooth subcutaneous component that was well defined, firm, and nonmobile, with a total lesion length of 1 cm (Figure 1A). There was no madarosis, eyelid margin effacement or preauricular lymphadenopathy. Although no overt features of malignancy were present, the deeper component was atypical for a hidrocystoma and an excisional biopsy was performed. Histopathologic evaluation showed a neoplasm composed of low-grade round nuclei growing in a micropapillary pattern within pools of extracellular mucin (Figure 1B). There was tumor present at the margin. Immunostains were positive for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor. Variable staining for INSM1, a sensitive nuclear stain for neuroendocrine differentiation, and focal staining for synaptophysin, another neuroendocrine marker, were also seen. This immunophenotype is consistent with a primary tumor derived from endocrine mucin-producing sweat gland carcinoma or a metastatic mucinous carcinoma of breast origin.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Mucinous carcinoma of the eyelid,"1. **Hidrocystoma** - Initially considered based on the cystic appearance and location, but the atypical deeper component suggests otherwise.

2. **Sebaceous carcinoma** - Excluded due to the lack of malignancy features like madarosis or eyelid margin effacement, though considered due to eyelid location.

3. **Basal cell carcinoma** - Common in eyelid lesions, but the lesion lacks characteristic features like ulceration or pearly borders.

4. **Syringoma** - Benign sweat gland tumor, considered due to the location but typically presents differently.

5. **Mucinous carcinoma** - Suspected due to the histopathologic findings of mucin pools and micropapillary pattern.

6. **Metastatic breast carcinoma** - Supported by positive estrogen and progesterone receptor staining, aligning with a breast origin.

7. **Merkel cell carcinoma** - Neuroendocrine differentiation suggested by INSM1 and synaptophysin staining makes this a consideration.

8. **Mixed tumor of the eccrine type** - Considered due to sweat gland origin, but lacks complex cellular components typical of mixed tumors.

9. **Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin** - Possible due to focal staining with synaptophysin, though less common.

10. **Primary endocrine mucin-producing sweat gland carcinoma** - A rare and specific diagnosis supported by histopathological and immunophenotypic findings.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Mucinous carcinoma** - Strong contender due to the histopathology findings and receptor positivity.
2. **Metastatic breast carcinoma** - Likely given the receptor staining with the primary site potentially being undetected breast cancer.
3. **Primary endocrine mucin-producing sweat gland carcinoma** - Considered due to the specific histopathological findings.
4. **Merkel cell carcinoma** - Considered due to positive neuroendocrine markers.
5. **Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin** - Remains in differential due to neuroendocrine staining.
6. **Sebaceous carcinoma** - Ruled out based on clinical presentation, but typically considered for eyelid lesions.
7. **Basal cell carcinoma** - Unlikely due to atypical presentation, but commonality must be considered.
8. **Hidrocystoma** - Initially suspected but ruled out due to deeper lesion analysis.
9. **Syringoma** - Typically presents differently and is benign, lower on the differential list.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 40s presented with a 10-year history of pruritic lesions on the vulva and buttock. She was diagnosed with eczema and treated at the local clinic with little improvement. She had no relevant medical history and no family history of similar skin problems. Physical examination revealed scattered, well-defined, annular gray hyperkeratotic plaques with an atrophic center and a slightly elevated edge on the vulva, buttock, groin, and intergluteal cleft (Figure 1A). There was no inguinal adenopathy, and results of routine blood work, including blood biochemistry, syphilis serologies, and HIV testing, were normal or negative. We took 2 specimens from the vulva and buttock, respectively, for histopathological examination (Figure 1B).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Genital porokeratosis,"1. **Lichen Sclerosus**: The chronic pruritic lesions and atrophic changes, especially on the vulva, could suggest lichen sclerosus, a condition characterized by white, atrophic plaques.

2. **Lichen Planus**: Consideration should be given to lichen planus, which can present with pruritic, violaceous, flat-topped papules and, occasionally, annular plaques.

3. **Psoriasis**: Given the hyperkeratotic plaques, psoriasis is a possible diagnosis to consider, despite a typical metachronous presentation elsewhere on the body.

4. **Chronic Contact Dermatitis**: The prolonged course and location of lesions might suggest a persistent contact dermatitis due to repeated exposure to an irritant or allergen.

5. **Tinea Corporis (dermatophytosis)**: The annular morphology could suggest a dermatophyte infection, although negative usual fungal elements might direct elsewhere without confirmation of fungal elements in histology.

6. **Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus**: The annular gray plaques and distribution could be a manifestation of cutaneous lupus, known to have varied presentations.

7. **Genital Warts**: Rarely, keratotic plaques can be confused with verrucous changes from HPV infections, although the presentation here is atypical.

8. **Lichen Simplex Chronicus**: Chronic rubbing or scratching from itching could lead to lichen simplex chronicus, resulting in thickened skin and hyperpigmentation.

9. **Granuloma Annulare**: Generally seen in other parts of the body, its annular rings with clear centers are a distinct dermatological pattern.

10. **Pigmented Purpuric Dermatitis**: Although rare in the described areas, it should be considered due to its morphological distinctions.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Lichen Sclerosus**: The specific presentation of annular hyperkeratotic plaques with atrophic centers aligns closely with noted clinical features. 
2. **Lichen Planus**: The presence of pruritic, sometimes annular lesions, and histopathology results would assist in distinguishing it.
3. **Psoriasis**: Given less improvement with eczema treatments, the consideration of psoriasis fits due to the well-demarcated plaques.
4. **Chronic Contact Dermatitis**: Persistent and pruritic, with little improvement, may suggest this etiology.
5. **Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus**: Requires further evaluation if photosensitivity or systemic symptoms are present.
6. **Tinea Corporis (dermatophytosis)**: Should be revisited if histological results don’t rule out fungal infection.
7. **Lichen Simplex Chronicus**: If itching is the primary complaint and histology suggests chronic scratching effect.
8. **Granuloma Annulare**: Though unlikely, confirmatory histological signs could necessitate this consideration.
9. **Genital Warts**: Although unlikely, especially with negative history of sexual transmission-associated lesions, should be reconsidered if external factors, like new partners or immunocompromised states, present.
10. **Pigmented Purpuric Dermatitis**: Least likely given presentation and normal blood work but reevaluate if discoloration or petechiae develop.","['Dermatology', 'Urology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,40.0,M

### INPUT:
A 47-year-old woman presented to our clinic with a sudden decrease in vision in the right eye. One month prior, she had presented to the emergency department with binocular diplopia, bilateral cranial nerve 6 palsies, and an undifferentiated pontine mass on brain magnetic resonance imaging. Broad serologic workup results were negative, except for a positive syphilis total antibody with a nonreactive rapid plasma reagin test. Lumbar puncture with flow cytometry and cerebrospinal fluid venereal disease research laboratory test (CSF VDRL) result was also negative. The patient reported a history of syphilis treated with intramuscular penicillin 9 years prior. She was treated with systemic corticosteroids and discharged home on a steroid taper. On our examination, her visual acuity was count fingers in the right eye and 20/20 in the left. She had a right afferent pupillary defect and intraocular pressures were 12 in the right eye and 11 in the left. Anterior segment examination was normal. Posterior examination of the right eye revealed 3+ vitreous cell, 2+ vitreous haze, and a large optic nerve head mass with optic disc hyperemia, scattered dot hemorrhages, and a subtle placoid lesion in the posterior pole (Figure 1A). Optical coherence tomography of the optic nerve demonstrated a large spherical mass protruding out of the optic nerve head (Figure 1B) and granular disruption of the ellipsoid zone in adjacent peripapillary retina.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Syphilitic gumma of optic nerve head and presumed neurosyphilis,"1. **Neurosarcoidosis**  
Given the patient's neurological involvement with symptoms and imaging findings, neurosarcoidosis is a consideration. It can present with cranial nerve palsies and pontine mass-like lesions.

2. **Optic Nerve Glioma**  
The presence of a large spherical mass at the optic nerve head suggests the potential for an optic nerve glioma.

3. **Multiple Sclerosis**  
Multiple sclerosis can present with cranial nerve involvement and optic neuritis, which could explain the patient's eye symptoms.

4. **Lymphoma**  
Primary central nervous system lymphoma can present with a mass effect in the brain and ocular involvement.

5. **Tuberculosis (TB) Meningitis**  
TB meningitis could explain the pontine mass and cranial nerve involvement, though the absence of typical systemic symptoms is noted.

6. **Behçet’s Disease**  
Behçet’s disease can cause vasculitis leading to neurological and ocular symptoms, including optic nerve involvement.

7. **Cryptococcal Meningitis**  
This could present with a disseminated infection involving both the brain and eyes, albeit more common in immunocompromised individuals.

8. **Optic Neuritis**  
Although usually associated with multiple sclerosis, isolated optic neuritis needs consideration due to visual symptoms.

9. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegener's Granulomatosis)**  
This condition can cause granulomas and vasculitis affecting central nervous system and eyes.

10. **Syphilitic Gumma**  
Given positive syphilis serology, albeit treated, a late presentation with gummatous disease affecting the central nervous system and eye is possible.

### INPUT:
A man in his 80s presented with mildly pruritic skin lesions on his upper and lower extremities that had progressively appeared during the previous month. The patient had no systemic symptoms or unexplained weight loss. Physical examination revealed erythematous, nondesquamative, annular plaques, some of which had overlying vesicles in a cluster of jewels arrangement on the flexor aspect of both wrists and lower limbs (Figure 1). There was no mucosal involvement, and the Nikolsky sign test result was negative. Chest radiography results were normal and laboratory studies—complete blood cell count, kidney, and hepatic function; urinalysis; and indirect immunofluorescence—were unremarkable except for positive circulating IgG against desmoglein-1 antigen. A skin biopsy specimen was collected from a lesion on the anterior aspect of the left wrist for histopathologic and immunofluorescent analyses, and treatment with oral prednisone (30 mg/d) tapering for 1 month was initiated.

### INPUT:
An 11-year-old girl presented to our department with progressive unilateral skin hardening on her right thigh and buttock for 7 years. Recently, the motion of her right limb joint was slightly limited. She was born to healthy parents and did not have any medical disease. On physical examination, there was an ill-defined, stony-hard plaque involving her right thigh above the patella extending to her right buttocks with loss of skin elasticity. The affected skin was associated with mild hypertrichosis and hyperpigmentation (Figure 1A). Laboratory tests revealed normal results for routine blood tests, autoantibodies, immunoglobulins, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Magnetic resonance imaging of the right thigh demonstrated slight thickening of subcutaneous tissue and T2 signal abnormality (Figure 1B). A skin biopsy was taken from the affected thigh for histopathological examination and alcian blue staining.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Segmental stiff skin syndrome,"Step 1: Morphea (Localized Scleroderma)
- Initial presentation of skin hardening and plaque formation suggests this common condition.

Step 2: Linear Scleroderma
- Considered due to the linear nature often seen in affected regions, particularly in youngsters.

Step 3: Progressive Hemifacial Atrophy (Parry-Romberg Syndrome)
- Asymmetrical facial involvement absent so less likely; primarily eliminated due to no facial asymmetry.

Step 4: Systemic Sclerosis
- Considered due to sclerosis, but systemic symptoms and lab results are not consistent.

Step 5: En Coup de Sabre
- Typically affects the forehead or scalp; no such presentation here.

Step 6: Lichen Sclerosus
- Skin changes like sclerosis considered, but typically affects different regions and presents differently.

Step 7: Hypertrophic Lichen Planus
- Hyperpigmentation and involvement of plaque-like areas lead to consideration but lack of typical lichen planus features such as polygonal papules.

Step 8: Eosinophilic Fasciitis
- Features similar in restriction and skin changes but normally show eosinophilia, absent here.

Step 9: Mixed Connective Tissue Disease
- Possible due to sclerosis, but lacks supporting serology and broader systemic involvement.

Step 10: Discoid Lupus Erythematosus
- Skin changes resemble some autoimmune conditions but discoid lupus typically presents on the face/head region with distinct scarring alopecia.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. Morphea (Localized Scleroderma)
2. Linear Scleroderma
3. Eosinophilic Fasciitis
4. Hypertrophic Lichen Planus
5. Mixed Connective Tissue Disease
6. Systemic Sclerosis
7. Lichen Sclerosus
8. Discoid Lupus Erythematosus
9. En Coup de Sabre
10. Progressive Hemifacial Atrophy (Parry-Romberg Syndrome)

Based on the given information, morphea (localized scleroderma) remains the top differential diagnosis, followed closely by linear scleroderma due to the localized skin hardening and involvement. Eosinophilic fasciitis is considered next due to the similar regional involvement, skin changes, and lack of systemic involvement.","['Dermatology', 'Connective Tissue Disease of the Skin', 'Pediatrics']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,M

### INPUT:
A man in his 30s with myasthenia gravis diagnosed at age 27 years presented to the emergency department with severe erythroderma over the past 2 months. He had excision of a thymoma 10 years before, which was classified as type B2 according to the World Health Organization histologic classification system. He reported severe pruritus in the affected area. He had no history of skin diseases, allergies, or cardiovascular disease. Medications for the patient’s myasthenia gravis included prednisone tablets (20 mg daily), tacrolimus (1.5 mg twice per day), pyridostigmine bromide (30 mg daily), and losartan potassium (50 mg daily) for hypertension. On presentation, the patient’s temperature was 37.8 °C; heart rate, 120 beats/min, blood pressure, 120/65 mm Hg; and oxygen saturation levels, 97% on room air. On physical examination, the confluent erythema with scales involved more than 95% of body surface area, including the patient’s head, trunk (Figure 1A), and extremities, but results on mucosal examination were unremarkable. Laboratory testing results revealed whole white blood cell count of 12 200/μL (81.6% neutrophils; to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001); C-reactive protein levels, 5.58 mg/dL (to convert to mg/L, multiply by 10.0); aspartate aminotransferase levels, 0.7 µkat/L (to convert to IU/L, multiply by 0.0167); alanine aminotransferase levels, 45 IU/L (to convert to µkat/L, multiply by 0.0167); and lactate dehydrogenase levels, 454 IU/L (to convert to µkat/L, multiply by 0.0167). Skin biopsy from the abdomen was performed for histopathologic examination (Figure 1B).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity,"1. **Drug-Induced Erythroderma:** Given the patient's medication history and the onset of symptoms, a drug reaction such as due to prednisone or tacrolimus could be considered.

2. **Psoriasis:** Although the patient has no history of skin disease, the presentation could suggest psoriasis, which sometimes presents after significant stress or due to medications.

3. **Exfoliative Dermatitis:** This condition may occur associated with many systemic conditions, possibly related to past thymoma or current medication.

4. **Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma:** Considering the extensive skin involvement and severe pruritus, this malignancy should be considered.

5. **Atopic Dermatitis:** Although typically presenting earlier in life, adult-onset could occur in patients with a predisposed immune dysregulation.

6. **Sezary Syndrome:** A variant of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma characterized by erythroderma and circulating malignant T-cells.

7. **Generalized Pustular Psoriasis:** A severe form of psoriasis that can present with erythroderma.

8. **Pemphigus Foliaceus:** Autoimmune blistering disorder that can present as erythroderma.

9. **Contact Dermatitis:** A less likely cause but considering environmental exposures, contact dermatitis might be considered.

10. **Erythema Multiforme:** This is less likely given the lack of mucosal involvement but might be considered if other testing supports it.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Drug-Induced Erythroderma:** Top consideration due to the temporal association with medication usage.
2. **Exfoliative Dermatitis:** Strong contender given the presentation, possibly linked to medication or systemic illness.
3. **Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma:** Important to rule out due to the potential for malignancy.
4. **Sezary Syndrome:** Needs ruling out if lymphadenopathy or malignant cells are found in the blood.
5. **Psoriasis:** Possible, given the type of rash, although patient's age and the extent of involvement are atypical.
6. **Generalized Pustular Psoriasis:** Less common but severe and requires consideration.
7. **Pemphigus Foliaceus:** Depending on biopsy results, may shift higher in ranking.
8. **Atopic Dermatitis:** Unlikely onset in a 30-year-old without past history, but considered if others ruled out.
9. **Contact Dermatitis:** Conditions surrounding eruptions can sometimes be misleading.

### INPUT:
A 51-year-old man presented with a 2-year history of progressive memory loss and left limb numbness. He had been treated for cerebral infarction; however, the symptoms worsened. Medical history was unremarkable. He graduated from high school and worked as a driver. Smoking history and alcohol misuse were denied. One of his parents died in their late 60s with cognitive decline. On examination, his Mini-Mental State Examination score was 22, and his Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 11. Cranial nerve tests revealed left-sided central facial palsy and lingual palsy. Pinprick sensation was decreased in the left arm. Results of other neurological or general examinations were unremarkable. The following investigations had normal or negative results: complete blood cell count, urine and stool analysis, liver and kidney function, cardiac enzymes, electrolytes, blood glucose, lipids, coagulation, homocysteine, vitamins, serum tumor markers, infectious panel, lupus panel, vasculitis antibodies (anti–neutrophil cytoplasmic and anti–neutrophil cytoplasmic), and demyelination antibodies (aquaporin 4 and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein). Seventy-two–hour electrocardiography detected no atrial fibrillation. Right-side heart contrast echocardiography found no right-to-left shunts on Valsalva maneuvers. Results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis were unremarkable. There were no oligoclonal bands. Enhanced cerebrospinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed diffuse subcortical white matter hyperintensities and corpus callosum atrophy. Diffusion-weighted imaging revealed multifocal restricted diffusion in the corpus callosum with corresponding low apparent diffusion coefficient values (Figure, A and B). Enhanced cerebrospinal MRI showed diffuse subcortical white matter hyperintensities and corpus callosum atrophy (Figure, C). Magnetic resonance angiography showed no atherosclerosis or stenosis.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia,"1. **Cerebral Small Vessel Disease**: Progressive memory loss, limb numbness, and MRI findings of diffuse subcortical white matter hyperintensities might indicate small vessel disease.

2. **CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy)**: Genetic cerebrovascular disorder characterized by subcortical white matter hyperintensities, especially with a family history of early cognitive decline.

3. **Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis**: Though not classical presentation, progressive cognitive decline and white matter changes on MRI could suggest this.

4. **Adult Polyglucosan Body Disease**: Causes both neurocognitive symptoms and white matter changes, albeit rare.

5. **Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus**: Typically, presents with cognitive decline and white matter changes, though gait disturbance is often more pronounced.

6. **Binswanger's Disease**: A type of vascular dementia featuring white matter changes and cognitive decline.

7. **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy**: Opportunistic infection of the brain, often with MRI white matter hyperintensity, but usually with immunocompromise (which is absent here).

8. **Familial Alzheimer's Disease**: Unusual due to the emphasis on bilateral motor symptoms and young age, but notable family history of cognitive decline may prompt consideration.

9. **Huntington's Disease**: Less likely given specific symptom presentation but can include memory loss and cognitive decline.

10. **Frontotemporal Dementia**: Distinct neocortical degeneration patterns with memory and cognitive impairments.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **CADASIL**: Given the family history, corpus callosum involvement, and compatible MRI findings.
   
2. **Cerebral Small Vessel Disease**: Supported by the subcortical white matter changes and progressive symptoms.
   
3. **Binswanger's Disease**: Consistent with chronic white matter changes and cognitive decline.
   
4. **Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis**: Has a specific presentation and MRI findings aligned with this possibility.
   
5. **Adult Polyglucosan Body Disease**: Less common, but the clinical picture and MRI alterations could match.
   
6. **Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus**: Lack of specific gait disturbance lowers the suspicion.
   
7. **Familial Alzheimer's Disease**: Atypical, but the family history suggests it's worth consideration.
   
8. **Frontotemporal Dementia**: Subcortical involvement is unusual here, but possible.
   
9. **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy**: Immunocompetence makes this less likely, even with MRI changes.

### INPUT:
A 62-year-old man presented with painless vision reduction and eye redness in the right eye for a week. The initial best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 4/20 (approximately 20/100), and an irregular superficial corneal ulcer with an epithelial defect size of 3 mm × 5 mm was found in the center of edematous cornea. He received penetrating keratoplasty 4 months later, as the ulcer did not heal with intensive medication. Then, topical tobramycin dexamethasone, topical tacrolimus, and daily oral prednisone, 40 mg, were prescribed, with a gradual taper of prednisone to a maintenance dose of 10 mg. At 5-month postoperative follow-up, some thin snowflakelike matter was found deposited on the iris and in the angle, with rare cell and mild flare in the anterior chamber. He was then diagnosed with uveitis and subsequently prescribed topical prednisone, subconjunctival triamcinolone acetonide, oral prednisone, 40 mg, and daily intravenous ganciclovir, 5 mg/kg. An aqueous sample was obtained for diagnostic polymerase chain reaction, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was detected with a DNA load of 3.12 × 107 cells. Nine months after the keratoplasty, when he presented to the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, his BCVA was 2/100 OD (approximately 20/1000 OD), and his intraocular pressure was 19 mm Hg. Diffuse tiny nodules were observed all over the iris, along with more snowflake and severe cataract (Figure 1A). The fundus could not be seen. B-ultrasonography showed a dense opacity in the anterior vitreous body (Figure 1B).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Ocular polymorphic posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders in the left eye,"**Step 1: Herpetic Keratitis**
- The patient's initial symptoms of painless vision reduction, eye redness, and an irregular corneal ulcer suggest an infectious keratitis, and Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) is a common cause.

**Step 2: Fungal Keratitis**
- Given the unhealed ulcer with intensive medication, consider Fungal Keratitis, which can present with a refractory ulcer in the cornea.

**Step 3: Acanthamoeba Keratitis**
- Consider Acanthamoeba Keratitis due to persistent corneal ulceration, especially if there is a history of contact lens wear or exposure to contaminated water.

**Step 4: Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Uveitis**
- The detection of a high EBV DNA load in the aqueous sample suggests primary or secondary EBV involvement in the uveitis.

**Step 5: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Uveitis**
- Given the patient’s immunosuppressive therapy and ocular findings, consider CMV Uveitis as a potential cause of anterior segment findings.

**Step 6: Sarcoidosis**
- With iris nodules and ocular inflammation, think about Sarcoidosis, which can present with uveitis and systemic symptoms that might not be apparent immediately.

**Step 7: Tuberculosis-Associated Uveitis**
- Consider tuberculosis, especially in geographical regions with high prevalence or if there are systemic symptoms like cough or weight loss.

**Step 8: Syphilitic Uveitis**
- Although rare, Syphilitic Uveitis can also present with iris nodules and chronic intraocular inflammation.

**Step 9: Posner-Schlossman Syndrome (Glaucomatocyclitic Crisis)**
- With symptoms of periodic elevated intraocular pressure and mild anterior chamber inflammation, consider Posner-Schlossman Syndrome.

**Step 10: Masquerade Syndrome**
- Neoplastic conditions like lymphoma can present with persistent uveitis not responding to standard treatment and should be considered as a masquerade syndrome.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Uveitis** - Detected high viral load supports this diagnosis.
2. **Fungal Keratitis** - Persistent ulcer despite treatment warrants consideration.
3. **Herpetic Keratitis** - Initial symptoms and resistance to treatment may suggest HSV.
4. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Uveitis** - Possible given immunosuppression.
5. **Masquerade Syndrome (Lymphoma)** - Due to persistent and atypical posterior inflammation.
6. **Sarcoidosis** - Non-infectious cause with ocular manifestations as described.
7. **Tuberculosis-Associated Uveitis** - Possible in specific demographic settings.
8. **Acanthamoeba Keratitis** - Non-healing ulcer prompts this consideration.
9. **Syphilitic Uveitis** - Additional testing would rule this out.
10. **Posner-Schlossman Syndrome** - Pressure dynamics align with less likely considerations.","['Cornea', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Intraocular Tumors', 'Oncology', 'Ophthalmology']",0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,62.0,F

### INPUT:
A full-term boy was born with multiple areas of erythema, vesicles, and bullae on the face, trunk, and extremities. His vital signs, including temperature, respiration, and heart rate, were within normal ranges. One month later, he returned due to skin eruptions that continued to wax and wane. Physical examination revealed multiple round or irregularly shaped erythematous macules and slightly scaly plaques of various sizes on the face, trunk, and extremities. Bullous and vesicular lesions were observed on the thighs, with scattered facial erosions. Mucous membranes were not found to be affected. He was born to healthy, nonconsanguineous parents. Growth and development were normal for his age and sex. The patient’s family medical history was unremarkable. A skin-punch biopsy and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) assays taken from 1 of the erythematous scaly plaques were performed for further analysis. At the 3-year follow-up, it was found that the vesicles and bullae began to decrease in number when he was 6 months old but intermittently returned after 1 year of age. The number of annular hyperkeratotic plaques had increased (Figure 1A). Thickened, brown, corrugated plaques developed over the neck, armpits, wrists, and ankles, along with palmoplantar hyperkeratosis.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Annular epidermolytic ichthyosis,"Let's approach this systematically.

1. **Neonatal Herpes Simplex Virus Infection** - Neonatal exposure to HSV can cause vesicles and bullae, but is less likely given the absence of systemic symptoms and mucosal involvement.

2. **Incontinence Pigmenti** - While the early vesicular stage fits, the later hyperkeratotic stages, pigmentation changes would differ and does not fit well with the described findings.

3. **Linear IgA Bullous Dermatosis** - It could present with vesicles and bullae, and respond variably over time, but erythema migrans are not typical.

4. **Epidermolysis Bullosa** - Blistering conditions that involve vesicles and bullae, usually hereditary, and often affect mucous membranes which is not present here.

5. **Impetigo Herpetiformis/Pustular Psoriasis** - Could cause vesicular eruption, but typically involves pustular lesions and systemic symptoms.

6. **Bullous Impetigo** - Presents primarily with bullae and crusts in infants but does not usually have a chronic or wax-and-wane course.

7. **Chronic Bullous Disease of Childhood (CBDC)** - Similar vesicobullous presentation with annular lesions often seen, can wax and wane.

8. **Erosive Pustular Dermatosis of the Scalp** - While the presentation involves erosions, it typically affects older patients and the scalp.

9. **Netherton Syndrome** - Presents with erythema and scaling (ichthyosis), often alongside hair abnormalities not described here.

10. **Congenital Ichthyosiform Erythroderma** - Hyperkeratosis and scaling are major features suggests ichthyotic disorders, especially given palmoplantar hyperkeratosis.

### Reranking the Differential Diagnoses:

Considering the shared clinical features, histological and immunofluorescence results (not provided but assumed available to guide diagnosis in practice), and evolution over time:

1. **Linear IgA Bullous Dermatosis** - given the pattern of annular lesions and histological correlation.
2. **Chronic Bullous Disease of Childhood (CBDC)** - due to the vesicobullous presentation and waxing-waning course.
3. **Congenital Ichthyosiform Erythroderma** - aligning hyperkeratosis with ichthyosiform features and distribution.
4. **Neonatal Herpes Simplex Virus Infection** - ruled out likely from negative serological/clinical response.
5. **Incontinence Pigmenti** - differing primarily in long-term dermatological outcomes and systemic involvement.
6. **Netherton Syndrome** - consider if ancillary signs (e.g., hair shaft abnormalities) were noted.

### INPUT:
A 65-year-old woman presented to an outpatient department with a 2-year history of left nasal obstruction. She had a history of hypertension and was taking oral medication (amlodipine [5 mg]/valsartan [80 mg] and indapamide [1.5 mg] once daily) but had poorly controlled systolic blood pressure ranging from 130 to 160 mm Hg. No associated trauma or surgical history was reported. Physical examination revealed a large tumor originating from the olfactory groove in the left nasal cavity, with feeding vessels pushing the middle turbinate outward. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a well-defined and strongly enhancing mass in the left nasal cavity, with obstructive rhinosinusitis in the frontal and ethmoid sinuses (Figure 1A). During surgical exploration, the tumor abutted the superior end of the nasal septum near the cribriform plate. Tumor excision was completed with a surgical margin of at least 5 mm, with the perichondrium of the nasal septum as the deep margin. The feeding vessels of the tumors were cauterized during the resection. Gross examination revealed a 4.8 × 3.0 × 1.8-cm whitish to pink-tan mass lesion (Figure 1B). Histopathological examination revealed sheetlike proliferation of monomorphic ovoid to spindle tumor cells containing ectatic vascular spaces. In addition, immunohistochemical staining showed positive staining for smooth-muscle actin, cyclin D1, and nuclear expression of β-catenin and negative staining for epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin, and CD34.

### INPUT:
A patient in her mid-60s with a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis underwent bilateral orthotopic lung transplant (BOLT) 6 months earlier. She was hospitalized for sepsis from pneumonia complicated by acute transplant rejection, without any cardiac symptoms. Coronary angiography prior to BOLT showed no evidence of coronary artery disease. Her only cardiac history was tricuspid valve repair at the time of BOLT. Her baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) is shown in Figure 1A. She progressed to having severe acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring intubation. As she continued to worsen, the decision was made to paralyze her a few hours later. Changes on telemetry were noted. Shortly thereafter, 12-lead ECG showed the changes in Figure 1B.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Apical pulsation caused by paralysis of the intercostal muscles,"To approach this differential diagnosis, we will analyze the new ECG changes and develop a structured list of potential diagnoses based on the patient's clinical history and presentation. Here is a step-by-step guide:

1. **Electrolyte Imbalance**: Given the patient's sepsis and ICU stay, consider electrolyte disturbances such as hyperkalemia affecting the ECG.

2. **Drug-Induced Arrhythmia**: Medications used in the ICU for sedation or treatment (e.g., paralytics, antibiotics) could potentially cause QT prolongation or other arrhythmias.

3. **Post-Lung Transplant Cardiac Issues**: Consider cardiac problems related to transplantation, such as transplant vasculopathy or stress-induced cardiomyopathy.

4. **Stress-Induced Cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo Syndrome)**: The stress of critical illness and transplant rejection could lead to this condition, affecting heart function and ECG readings.

5. **Pulmonary Embolism**: The patient has acute respiratory issues, and a large pulmonary embolism could cause ECG changes and respiratory distress.

6. **Acute Myocardial Infarction**: Although no coronary artery disease was noted prior to BOLT, acute coronary syndromes must still be considered.

7. **Hypoxia-induced Arrhythmias**: Severe respiratory distress and hypoxia can lead to arrhythmias reflected in ECG changes.

8. **Metabolic Acidosis**: The stress of sepsis and acute illness can lead to metabolic acidosis, which might manifest in ECG alterations.

9. **Pulmonary Hypertension**: Complications from chronic lung disease and transplant rejection could contribute to ECG changes due to pulmonary hypertension.

10. **Electrical Conduction Abnormalities**: Post-BOLT, there could be unique conduction system issues such as heart block or bundle branch block contributing to the ECG findings.

### INPUT:
A 52-year-old presented to the rheumatology clinic with 3 weeks of pain and duskiness of the fingertips bilaterally. The patient reported no dyspnea, cough, nasal discharge, diarrhea weight loss, or fevers. He had no history of rheumatologic disease or Raynaud disease, did not smoke cigarettes, take daily medications, ingest raw meat, or report recent travel. On presentation, his temperature was 98.2 °F (36.8 °C); blood pressure, 132/70 mm Hg; heart rate, 86/min; and oxygen saturation, 99% on room air. Findings on the physical examination were normal, other than his fingertips, which were cold and cyanotic with small ulcerations on the second and third fingertips (Figure). White blood cell count was 25.1 × 109/L (reference range, 3.8-9.8 × 109/L) and manual differential revealed 74.5% eosinophils (absolute eosinophil count, 18.7 × 109/L) and no blasts. Hemoglobin level and platelet count were normal. D-dimer level was 1.5 μg/mL (8.21 nmol/L) (reference range, 0.0-0.99 μg/mL [0.0-5.42 nmol/L]). Test results were negative for antinuclear antibodies, antiphospholipid antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies against proteinase 3 and myeloperoxidase, and HIV. Results of computed tomography of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and of flexible nasopharyngoscopy, were normal.

4. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**  
   - Unexplained eosinophilia possibly secondary to an undiagnosed malignancy.

5. **Cryoglobulinemia**  
   - May cause localized ischemia with finger ulcerations; typically, vague multifunctional involvement.

6. **Vasospastic Disorder**  
   - Considers isolated fingertip ischemia despite lack of personal/family history evidencing vasospasms.

7. **Systemic Vasculitis**  
   - Negative ANCA but possible due to eosinophil involvement.

8. **Chronic Myeloid Leukemia with Eosinophilia**  
   - Considered with abnormal hematopoietic proliferation and high eosinophils.

9. **Eosinophil-related Infection**  
   - Travel and dietary history does not support, but still potential due to high eosinophil count.

10. **Drug-induced Eosinophilia**  
   - No medication history, yet possible if recent unknown exposure to allergenic substances.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Hypereosinophilic Syndrome**  
   - Primarily supported by high eosinophils without identifiable secondary cause.

2. **Eosinophilic Leukemia**  
   - High eosinophil count with potential hematological malignancy aspect.

3. **Churg-Strauss Syndrome (Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)**  
   - Persistent consideration due to eosinophilia and potential vasculitic features.

4. **Systemic Vasculitis**  
   - Despite negative ANCA, eosinophil involvement could suggest atypical presentation.

5. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**  
   - Considered with unexplained systemic eosinophilia and potential for occult disease.

6. **Cryoglobulinemia**  
   - Possible, though less typical presentation; conditions for cryoprotein activity absent.

7. **Eosinophil-related Infection**  
   - Due to the eosinophil count, remains on lower list priority.

8. **Vasospastic Disorder**  
   - Lacks supportive history but appearance of finger changes indicates possible inclusion.

9. **Chronic Myeloid Leukemia with Eosinophilia**  
   - Persistent incorrect eosinophilic expansion raises hematological suspicion.

### INPUT:
A man in his 20s presented with a firm, mobile, painful, and fast-growing subcutaneous nodule in the glabella (Figure 1). Ultrasonography performed in B mode with a high-frequency (6-18 MHz) linear transducer revealed a hypoechoic lesion with well-defined borders in the hypodermis. After 2 months, the nodule had increased and seemed to be adhered to deep layers. A computed tomography scan was performed, which showed a 0.8 × 1.5 × 1.5-cm ovoid subcutaneous lesion with well-defined borders located in the glabella. The lesion was not affecting the epidermis and reached the muscular layer in depth without eroding bone structures. Given these findings, the lesion was excised.

Now, using all patient information and test results, let's rerank and provide the most likely diagnosis:

1. Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans - This tumor presented as a firm, mobile, painful, and fast-growing nodule. It’s a subcutaneous tumor with potential to adhere to surrounding structures, consistent with the behavior observed.
2. Nodular Fasciitis - Known for rapid growth, this can present similarly with firm, mobile nodules.
3. Pilomatricoma - Although less common, can present as a firm, subcutaneous nodule and involves the dermis and sometimes adheres to deeper structures.
4. Leiomyoma - Typically painless, however, can be considered in differential diagnosis for subcutaneous nodules.
5. Neurofibroma - Usually painless but can be mobile and subcutaneous.
6. Hemangioma - Not very painful and typically vascular.
7. Epidermoid Cyst - Commonly painless but can become painful if infected; tends to have a more superficial location.
8. Glomus Tumor - Typically painful but less likely due to depth and growth rate observed.
9. Angiolipoma - Usually non-painful despite being vascular.
10. Lipoma - Typically painless and slow-growing, making it less likely given the presentation.

The most fitting diagnosis, considering the rapid growth and adherence to deeper structures, would be Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans.","['Dermatology', 'Facial Plastic Surgery']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,20.0,F

### INPUT:
A 31-year-old man was evaluated for generalized dystonia, dysarthria, dysphagia, severe scoliosis, and motor development disorder that began in his childhood. Born by cesarean delivery to nonconsanguineous parents, he developed difficulties with head control, standing, and feeding at age 10 months. Subsequently, he faced progressive motor challenges (walking, speech, and swallow); contractures in his fingers, toes, wrists, and knees; and scoliosis. In adolescence, he experienced progressive stiffness, episodes of painful spasms and oculomotor crisis, and galactorrhea unrelated to childbirth in adulthood. His symptoms worsened with age and progressed to his using a wheelchair, having difficulty in speech, and not having access to education. He had a younger brother with similar symptoms who passed away at age 20 years of unknown causes. Upon presentation at age 31 years, he was admitted to our center for further evaluation. He had thin limbs and was of standard height. The neurological and psychological examinations revealed scoliosis, contractures in his fingers and toes, carpal inversion, dysarthria, dysphagia, hypertonia, decreased tendon reflexes, absence of Babinski sign (Figure, A and B), and no psychiatric problems. Blood test results indicated hyperprolactinemia (prolactin level of 47.40 ng/mL; to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1). An electroencephalogram revealed atypical spike-slow wave synchronization in specific brain regions during sleep. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed significant global atrophy particularly in his anterior temporal, lateral, and frontal regions (Figure, C). Levodopa treatment was initiated but quickly resulted in drug-induced hyperkinesia (Video).

### INPUT:
A woman in her 50s underwent clinical assessment for a 4-month history of recurrent palpitations, fatigue, and progressive exertion dyspnea. She had no history of cardiac disease, and there was no family history of heart disease or sudden death. Physical examination revealed an irregular pulse and a systolic murmur at the heart apex. Holter monitoring and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings documented irregular narrow-QRS tachycardia in an incessant, repetitive fashion with heart rates up to 180 beats per minute and occasional short runs of wide-QRS tachycardia. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a dilated and diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle (ejection fraction, 30%) associated with moderate to severe functional mitral regurgitation. Blood test results were within normal limits, including thyroid function, C-reactive protein, and myocardial enzymes. The patient was hospitalized, and medical therapy was initiated, including ACE inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, β-blockers, and diuretics. Coronary angiography revealed no significant coronary stenoses. A representative 12-lead ECG of the arrhythmia is shown in Figure 1.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Dual atrioventricular nodal nonreentrant tachycardia,"1. **Atrial Fibrillation**: The irregular narrow-QRS tachycardia, alongside the irregular pulse, strongly suggests atrial fibrillation as a primary consideration.
   
2. **Atrial Flutter**: While less common, atrial flutter can present with variable AV conduction leading to irregular narrow-QRS tachycardia.
   
3. **Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)**: The irregular, repetitive fashion of tachycardia may also signal a form of SVT, which typically involves reentrant circuits at the atrioventricular node or within the atria.
   
4. **Ventricular Tachycardia**: Although usually associated with wide-QRS complexes, occasional wide-QRS tachycardia episodes make ventricular tachycardia a consideration, possibly overlaying the primary rhythm.
   
5. **Dilated Cardiomyopathy**: Given the patient’s dilated, hypokinetic left ventricle and functional mitral regurgitation, dilated cardiomyopathy (possibly secondary to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy) is considered.
   
6. **Valvular Heart Disease**: Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation could result in secondary arrhythmias due to volume overload or a dilated left atrium.
   
7. **Hypertensive Heart Disease**: Chronic hypertension could cause left ventricular hypotrophy and failure, manifesting as arrhythmias and similar echocardiographic findings.
   
8. **Tachycardia-induced Cardiomyopathy**: Persistent tachycardia could cause the myocardium to weaken over time, resulting in a dilated, hypokinetic ventricle.
   
9. **Percival Sinus Node Dysfunction**: Although typically attributed to bradycardia, dysfunction could contribute to erratic supraventricular rhythms.
   
10. **Alcohol-induced Cardiomyopathy**: Chronic alcohol consumption can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy and related arrhythmias.

### Rerank based on all information and test results:
1. **Atrial Fibrillation**: Fits the irregular narrow-QRS tachycardia and irregular pulse; most consistent with presented symptoms.
2. **Tachycardia-induced Cardiomyopathy**: Matches the arrhythmia leading to hypokinetic and dilated left ventricle over time.
3. **Dilated Cardiomyopathy**: Particularly in the absence of ischemic heart disease which can lead to functionally impaired ventricles.
4. **Atrial Flutter**: Could explain irregular narrow-QRS tachycardia if variable conduction exists.
5. **Valvular Heart Disease**: Functional mitral regurgitation may worsen cardiac function leading to arrhythmias.
6. **Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)**: Less characteristic but still a possibility for narrow-QRS rapid sequence.
7. **Ventricular Tachycardia**: Occasional wide-QRS features but less likely as primary cause given the narrow-QRS focus.
8. **Hypertensive Heart Disease**: No mention of hypertension but could contribute to cardiac changes if present.
9. **Percival Sinus Node Dysfunction**: Unlikely given the tachycardic rather than bradycardic focus of symptoms.
10. **Alcohol-induced Cardiomyopathy**: No mention of alcohol use but remains a possibility for a dilated cardiomyopathy cause.","['Cardiology', 'Rhythm Disorders', 'Heart Failure']",0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,50.0,M

Hydromorphone (0.5 mg intravenously as needed) was added for breakthrough pain. She was prescribed chewable lanthanum tablets (500 mg 3 times daily) for treatment of a blood phosphate level of 8.1 mg/dL (reference, 2.5-4.5 mg/dL). On hospital day 7, the patient developed intermittent apneic episodes, during which her oxygen saturation was 80% on room air; heart rate, 86/min; and blood pressure, 106/45 mm Hg. Physical examination revealed bilateral rhonchi and responsiveness to verbal commands only with deep painful stimulus. A chest radiograph showed 4 radio-opaque coin-shaped opacities in the stomach (Figure).

### INPUT:
A healthy patient in their teens presented to the emergency department with high-grade fever (38.7 °C), neck pain, and a foreign body sensation in the throat after eating chicken 3 days prior. Laboratory investigations demonstrated an elevated leukocyte count (22 500/µL; to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). Lateral soft tissue radiography showed a radio-opaque foreign body at the level of C6. Computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed a 2-cm radio-opaque osseous foreign body at the level of the cricopharyngeus muscle with signs of esophageal perforation, including air leak tracking toward the left lobe of the thyroid gland (Figure, A and B). The patient was brought to the operating room, and the esophageal foreign body was successfully removed. Postoperatively, the patient continued to become febrile despite intravenous antibiotic therapy. A repeated CT scan of the neck and chest was done (Figure, C).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Emphysematous thyroiditis,"1. **Retropharyngeal abscess** - Given the presence of fever, neck pain, elevated leukocyte count, and signs of potential infection post foreign body removal.
   
2. **Esophageal perforation with mediastinitis** - The esophageal perforation and subsequent air leak could lead to infection in the mediastinum, especially given persistent fever post-operatively.

3. **Deep neck space infection** - High-grade fever and neck pain could indicate an infection in the deep neck spaces secondary to the initial foreign body and esophageal perforation.

4. **Thyroid gland abscess** - The air leak tracking towards the thyroid gland could indicate an infection, leading to an abscess formation in the thyroid region.

5. **Peritonsillar abscess** - Although less typical in the context, the neck pain and fever could reflect an abscess near the tonsils.

6. **Laryngeal abscess** - Post-foreign body removal, laryngeal inflammation or an abscess could explain the continued fever despite antibiotic therapy.

7. **Ludwig's angina** - While typically involves the submandibular space, any neck infection post-foreign body could exhibit similar widespread inflammation into these areas.

### INPUT:
A 68-year-old woman presented with progressive right-sided facial numbness and weakness, vision changes, and headaches. Her symptoms began 5 years earlier with right temple numbness, which expanded to include the entire right face and mouth. She then developed progressive right facial weakness with a droop, slurred speech, and eyelid ptosis. Finally, binocular vertical and horizontal diplopia and periorbital headaches began. Trials of gabapentin and steroids provided no relief. Her history was significant for a left cheek melanoma completely excised years prior, numerous cutaneous squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the bilateral head and neck removed without issue, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Her medications included metformin and simvastatin; she had no history of smoking or drinking. On examination, she had right-sided ptosis and severe right facial weakness in a lower motor neuron pattern with temporal wasting. The right pupil was fixed and dilated. There was no afferent pupillary defect. The left pupil was appropriately sized and reactive. Her right-sided vision was impaired (20/250) with blurriness. Vertical and horizontal binocular diplopia was present. Right extraocular movements were significantly limited in all directions and painful, and right-sided facial sensation was diminished to pinprick in all cranial nerve (CN) V distributions. Her speech was slightly slurred. Left-sided extraocular movements were intact. Her left facial sensation was intact to pinprick, and her strength was without deficit. There were no other neurological abnormalities. Initial magnetic resonance images (MRIs) were unremarkable. A biopsy of CN VII was nondiagnostic. Hemoglobin A1c was 6.8%. Tests for infection and autoimmune disease had negative results. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies showed mildly elevated protein values. Figure 1 shows the MRI at presentation.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Perineural spread of cutaneous malignancy,"1. **Bell's Palsy**: Initially considered due to right-sided facial weakness and numbness, typical of peripheral facial nerve palsy.
2. **Trigeminal Neuralgia**: Considered due to right-sided facial numbness and pain, though not classically presenting with motor features.
3. **Myasthenia Gravis**: Considered due to ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and speech difficulties without positive Tensilon test or response to steroids.
4. **Multiple Sclerosis**: Considered due to progressive neurological symptoms affecting multiple cranial nerves with unremarkable initial MRI.
5. **Diabetic Neuropathy**: Considered given diabetes history, though presentation is atypical for cranial nerve involvement.
6. **Brainstem Glioma**: Considered due to involvement of multiple cranial nerves with eventual MRI showing pathology.
7. **Cavernous Sinus Syndrome**: Considered due to involvement of cranial nerves III, IV, VI, V (ophthalmic/maxillary), and oculosympathetic fibers.
8. **Sarcoidosis**: Considered for possible neurosarcoidosis; unremarkable MRI makes less likely.
9. **Melanoma Metastasis**: Considered due to history of melanoma, with possible metastasis involving cranial nerves.
10. **Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)**: Considered due to elevated CSF protein and progressive symptoms.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Cavernous Sinus Syndrome**: Best matches the diverse range of cranial nerve dysfunctions and symptomatology experienced.
2. **Brainstem Glioma**: MRI hints and symptom progression fit potential glioma affecting cranial nerves.
3. **Melanoma Metastasis**: Due to previous history of melanoma, potential for metastatic spread affecting cranial nerves.
4. **Diabetic Neuropathy**: Secondary to diabetes, although atypical, consideration for microvascular complications.
5. **Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)**: Due to elevated protein in CSF and multifocal symptoms.
6. **Bell's Palsy**: Initial presenting sign but unlikely given progressive and multifaceted nature of symptoms over time.
7. **Multiple Sclerosis**: Although MRI was initially unremarkable, the possibility of initial presentation with several cranial nerve defects exists.
8. **Myasthenia Gravis**: Atypical presentation and negative response to steroids make this less likely.
9. **Trigeminal Neuralgia**: While part of symptoms aligns, the multifocal involvement suggests other diagnoses.
10. **Sarcoidosis**: Possible but less likely due to lack of supporting systemic findings.","['Facial Nerve', 'Facial Plastic Surgery', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Neurology', 'Dermatology']",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,68.0,M

### INPUT:
A 31-year-old woman presented with left cervical and left inguinal masses. She reported intermittent itching and night sweats for 2 years. She denied fever, weight loss, shortness of breath, rashes, diarrhea, and neurological symptoms. On a preemployment evaluation, the patient was told she had a high white blood cell count 2 years ago. On examination, there was left cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy and no other organomegaly. Complete blood cell count and peripheral blood smear showed marked leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 22 340/μL, an absolute neutrophil count of 5360/μL, and 55% eosinophils with an absolute eosinophil count of 12 290/μL (to convert all to cells ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). Vitamin B12 was markedly elevated at more than 4000 pg/mL (to convert to pmol/L, multiply by 0.7378). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 5 mm/h. Lactate dehydrogenase was 180 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase was 81 U/L (to convert both to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167). Evaluations for HIV and hepatitis B and C were all negative. Serum creatinine was 0.76 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4); alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were 11 U/L and 9.9 U/L, respectively (to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167); and total bilirubin was 0.35 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 17.104). Bone marrow biopsy showed hypercellular marrow (cellularity of 100%), myeloid hyperplasia, increased eosinophils with some dysplasia, and a blast count of 2%. Positron emission tomographic–computed tomographic scan showed a left upper cervical lymph node of 2.6 cm and a left inguinal lymph node of 3.1 × 2.3 cm with an standardized uptake value max of 5.7 (Figure, A). Left inguinal lymph node biopsy showed partial involvement by atypical cells with high proliferation index (Ki-67 >95%) that were positive for CD3, CD4, CD8, BCL2, and TDT, suggestive of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (Figure, B).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions,"### Differential Diagnoses:

1. **T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia**: Based on the lymph node biopsy findings showing partial involvement by atypical cells with a high proliferation index and immunophenotype, suggestive of this disease.

2. **Hypereosinophilic syndrome**: Given the marked eosinophilia and elevated Vitamin B12, this condition should be considered.

3. **Chronic eosinophilic leukemia**: Consider this due to the persistent and marked eosinophilia with dysplastic eosinophils and hypercellular marrow showing myeloid hyperplasia.

4. **Primary eosinophilic disorder**: Such as idiopathic eosinophilia, due to the lack of any identifiable secondary causes of eosinophilia.

5. **Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)**: Although less likely due to the abnormal eosinophils, CML should be considered in the differential due to leukocytosis and myeloid hyperplasia.

6. **Systemic mastocytosis**: Consider due to high Vitamin B12 levels and eosinophilia, although other symptoms are not apparent.

7. **Allergic reaction or parasitic infection**: Usually considered with eosinophilia but not likely with absence of related symptoms and chronicity.

8. **Lymphoma (other subtypes)**: The lymphadenopathy and leukocytosis suggest a possible lymphoproliferative disorder, although the biopsy supports T-cell lineage.

9. **Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome**: Due to lymphadenopathy and elevated immune markers, though typically younger onset.

10. **Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)**: Given the pancytopenia in some forms and dysplastic features, but less likely due to predominant eosinophilia.

### Reranked Diagnoses:

1. **T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia**: Strongly supported by biopsy findings.
2. **Chronic eosinophilic leukemia**: Due to persistent eosinophilia with dysplastic features.
3. **Hypereosinophilic syndrome**: Second only to T-cell lineage development due to eosinophilia.
4. **Primary eosinophilic disorder**: Considered due to the lack of secondary cause, but lower due to specific biopsy findings.
5. **Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)**: Possible, but less supportive evidence than above leukemias.
6. **Systemic mastocytosis**: Vitamin B12 level support this, but lacks other clinical features.
7. **Lymphoma (other subtypes)**: Considered less likely due to specific T-cell identification.
8. **Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome**: Unlikely given the age and presentation.
9. **Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)**: Considered unlikely due to lack of typical features of MDS.
10. **Allergic reaction or parasitic infection**: Less likely given the chronic nature and associated findings.","['Allergy and Clinical Immunology', 'Dermatology', 'Oncology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,31.0,M

### INPUT:
An 80-year-old woman with stage II bladder carcinoma (T2NXM0) and atrial fibrillation treated with apixaban presented to the emergency department with 1 week of fatigue and 2 days of dyspnea on exertion. One week prior to presentation, she received a fourth cycle of carboplatin/gemcitabine for bladder carcinoma with 6 mg of pegylated granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). The patient reported no anorexia, fever, melena, hematemesis, hematuria, cough, orthopnea, or peripheral edema. Her vital signs were normal except for a heart rate of 103/min. Her white blood cell count was 22 × 103/μL (reference, 4-11 × 103/μL), increased from 4.8 × 103/μL 8 days prior. Her manual differential, which was previously normal, showed 18% bands (0%-10%), 2% metamyelocytes, 7% myelocytes, 7% promyelocytes, and 6% blasts. Her hemoglobin level was 5.2 g/dL (reference, 13-17 g/dL), decreased from 7.4 g/dL, and platelets were 25 × 103/μL (reference, 150-420 × 103/μL), decreased from 268 × 103/μL 8 days prior. Ferritin was 1423 ng/mL (reference, 300-400 ng/mL). Mean corpuscular volume, prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, haptoglobin, vitamin B12, and methylmalonic acid values were normal, and results of a direct antiglobulin test were negative. A computed tomography (CT) scan of her abdomen and pelvis was normal. She received 2 units of packed red blood cells and was admitted to the hospital. Flow cytometry identified a small population of CD34+/CD117+ cells (Figure).

### INPUT:
An 81-year-old White man noted decreased vision in his left eye for 6 months. He was referred to the Ocular Oncology Service, Wills Eye Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for suspected choroidal melanoma. He disclosed a history of macular degeneration in both eyes and retinal detachment in the left eye that was treated 35 years previously. Medical history revealed cutaneous basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, both treated surgically. On examination, visual acuity was 20/50 OD and 20/400 OS. External examination showed posterior-chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes and conjunctival scarring in the left eye from circumferential scleral buckle surgery with no visible extraocular tumor. Fundus evaluation showed macular drusen in the right eye and a pale optic disc with geographic macular atrophy in the left eye, explaining his visual acuity of 20/400 OS. In addition, a shallow circumferential buckle effect and an inferotemporal mass measuring 15.0 × 10.0 mm in basal dimension and 9.1 mm in thickness (Figure, A) were seen in the left eye. The mass appeared elevated, amelanotic with overlying retinal vasculature, and with chorioretinal atrophy. No retinal detachment or breaks were seen. By ultrasonography the mass was echolucent (Figure, A inset). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a T1, T2-hypointense shallow circumferential band in the left eye. In addition, there was an inferotemporal nodular mass in the left eye showing T1 (gadolinium) hypointense, T2-hyperintense features, underlying the encircling buckle, and with adjacent subtle delineation. There was no enhancement with gadolinium (Figure, B).

Reranking with available data shows:

1. **Choroidal Hemangioma**: The echolucent nature, T1, T2 characteristics on MRI, and amelanotic properties are most consistent with this diagnosis.
2. **Choroidal Melanoma**: The suspicious nature and large size of the mass necessitate high consideration, although its hypointense signal on T1 with gadolinium reduces likelihood compared to hemangioma.
3. **Choroidal Osteoma**: The mass's appearance and MRI results match some osteoma presentations, but the lack of calcification signals reduces likelihood.
4. **Lymphoma**: Its presentation can vary; thus, it cannot be excluded without further testing.
5. **Metastatic Cancer**: Considering the patient's history of cutaneous carcinomas, this is possible, though the imaging characteristics make it less probable.
6. **Choroidal Nevus**: Typically smaller and less symptomatic but still considered due to similar presentations.
7. **Retinal Arteriovenous Malformation**: Rare, with consistent characteristics, but less likely due to location and presentation.
8. **Uveal Effusion Syndrome**: Less likely since no detachment or significant fluid accumulation noted.
9. **Peripheral Exudative Hemorrhagic Chorioretinopathy**: Retinal presentation does not match typical findings.

A 13-year-old girl with a history of sports-related blunt trauma to the left eye was referred for evaluation of an asymptomatic, pigmented iris lesion in the left eye. On examination, her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU, and intraocular pressures were normal in both eyes. Results of slitlamp examination of the right eye were unremarkable. Slitlamp examination of the left eye revealed a round, pigmented lesion measuring 3 × 3 mm in basal dimension and with gravitational shifting within the anterior chamber fluid with patient head tilt (Video). There was no corneal guttatae or edema. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography depicted the lesion in the anterior chamber angle abutting the corneal endothelium and resting on the iris stroma with no internal fluid level and no solid component. Ultrasound biomicroscopy confirmed the lesion to be cystic with a thickness of 1.6 mm. Dilated fundus examination revealed normal findings in both eyes.

### INPUT:
A male patient in his early 50s presented with multiple (approximately 10) bluish, partially keratotic papules and nodules on the lower legs (Figure, A). Since the age of 24 years, the lesions had been growing very slowly in number and size and had been bleeding occasionally after a trauma. The patient used a wheelchair due to a right-sided hemiparesis and hemianopsia caused by an intracranial hemorrhage. At the age of 4 years, recurrent seizures had led to the diagnosis of cerebral venous malformations. Clinical examination also demonstrated a lipolymphedema of the lower legs that had been attributed to a functional venous insufficiency with insufficient venous pump activity. The patient had been wearing compression stockings for years. The family history was positive for cerebral venous malformations involving the patient’s father and uncle, the father having died of an intracranial hemorrhage in his early 70s.

2. Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) - Given the recurrent cerebral hemorrhages in family history, albeit mucocutaneous telangiectasias are not classic in this case.
3. Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome - Considers the presence of lymphedema and vascular malformations, although typically includes capillary malformations.
4. Maffucci Syndrome - Characterized by multiple enchondromas and vascular anomalies, but usually involves bone deformities.
5. Proteus Syndrome - Though it includes vascular anomalies and overgrowth, the pattern here may not be typical.

### INPUT:
A 33-year-old woman with no prior ocular problems presented to the emergency department in central Florida with a chief complaint of a “pulling and popping” sensation in her left eye that had occurred the previous night. Ophthalmology was consulted to evaluate for a conjunctival foreign body of the left eye. At the time of the examination, her symptoms had resolved; however, she had a photograph from a cellular phone taken during the episode (Figure 1). The photograph shows an irregular, serpiginous extension from beneath the plica semilunaris toward the corneal limbus with localized conjunctival hyperemia. She reported a similar sensation of movement in her left eye that occurred for 1 night about 5 years ago for which she visited an urgent care center where she was diagnosed with allergic conjunctivitis. She also reported recent swelling of the left side of her face with associated numbness and occasional swelling of her left hand, all of which resolved after a few days. She had immigrated from Nigeria 10 years prior, had not returned since, and was working as a traveling nurse. A slitlamp examination did not reveal any conjunctival hyperemia, foreign bodies, or other abnormalities like those shown in the photograph. Her uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20, extraocular movements were full and without pain or abnormal sensation, and intraocular pressure was normal. Her dilated fundus examination was unremarkable. A comprehensive blood cell count revealed mild elevation in the relative (but not absolute) eosinophil count (6.9% reference; 6.0% of white blood cells).

**Explanation**: 

- The patient’s ocular symptoms, history of transient swellings, and past residence in Nigeria strongly suggest Loiasis as a top differential. Loiasis or African eye worm can present with the migration of the worm across the subconjunctival space, matching the patient's description. 
- Dirofilariasis, another condition involving ocular symptoms after migration of larvae, is considered but is less common.
- Onchocerciasis (river blindness) could cause ocular symptoms and has endemic areas overlapping with the patient's origins.
- Toxocariasis is a parasitic infection that can sometimes cause ophthalmological presentations.
- Given the facial and hand swelling, Angioedema is considered, although it does not directly relate to the eye symptoms.
- Superior Vena Cava Syndrome was hypothesized due to facial swelling but not prioritized after discounting related symptoms.
- Trigeminal Neuralgia was originally considered for facial numbness but lacks connection with ocular symptoms.
- Anisakiasis and Migratory Arthritis were considered later due to their less likely and nonspecific nature regarding the eye symptomatology.
- Infectious Conjunctivitis is included due to its commonality but de-prioritized due to lack of typical signs in examination and patient's history.","['Emergency Medicine', 'Global Health', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Ophthalmology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,33.0,M

### INPUT:
A 42-year-old man with asthma, seasonal allergies, and invasive ductal breast carcinoma presented to the dermatology clinic for rash and poor wound healing 2 weeks after bilateral mastectomy. Five days after surgery, the patient noted erythema, edema, pain, pruritus, and serous fluid drainage at the mastectomy incision sites (Figure 1). Two days later, he developed an erythematous papulovesicular rash on his trunk and upper and lower extremities. A skin swab was sent for bacterial culture, and he was prescribed cefadroxil (500 mg twice daily for 1 week). The skin swab bacterial culture result was negative, and his skin findings did not improve with antibiotics. The patient reported having a similar episode of rash and delayed wound healing after laparoscopy 1 year prior to presentation.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Allergic contact dermatitis due to use of surgical skin glue,"1. **Contact Dermatitis** - Considering the erythema, edema, pruritus, and rash after surgery, a contact dermatitis due to surgical adhesives or dressings can be considered. 

2. **Drug Reaction** - The rash and poor healing could be a reaction to medications used perioperatively, such as antibiotics or anesthesia agents.

3. **Nummular Eczema** - The rash's description could also be consistent with this form of eczema, which can flare based on environmental triggers.

4. **Infection-Related Dermatitis** - Although bacterial culture was negative, a viral or fungal infection causing dermatitis should be ruled out.

5. **Immunologic Reaction or Hypersensitivity Vasculitis** - An underlying vasculitis, leading to rash and poor wound healing, especially after surgeries, must be considered.

6. **Cutaneous Mastocytosis** - This involves an abnormal accumulation of mast cells in the skin, leading to itching and a rash-like appearance.

7. **Psoriasis** - Known for being exacerbated by trauma (Koebner phenomenon), psoriasis can present with an erythematous rash.

8. **Erythema Multiforme** - This hypersensitivity reaction often follows medications or infections and presents as a papulovesicular rash.

9. **Autoimmune Disease** - Diseases such as lupus or dermatomyositis could lead to rashes and poor healing due to an immune system dysfunction.

10. **Paraneoplastic Pemphigus** - Given the history of ductal breast carcinoma, this rare condition associated with cancer presents as a vesicular rash.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Autoimmune Disease** - Considering the patient's medical history and symptoms, an autoimmune process could explain the rash and delayed healing.
2. **Contact Dermatitis** - Possible given the surgical procedure and likelihood of exposure to allergens.
3. **Paraneoplastic Pemphigus** - The correlation with underlying carcinoma makes this a strong suspect.
4. **Erythema Multiforme** - Drug exposure and characteristics of the rash could align with this diagnosis.
5. **Drug Reaction** - An adverse reaction to medications remains plausible.
6. **Cutaneous Mastocytosis** - The symptoms align with mast cells release manifestations.
7. **Immunologic Reaction or Hypersensitivity Vasculitis** - Recurrent episodes post-surgery are indicative of an underlying hypersensitivity reaction.
8. **Psoriasis** - Could be triggered by postoperative stress.
9. **Nummular Eczema** - Less likely, based on the location and evolution of the rash.
10. **Infection-Related Dermatitis** - With negative bacterial culture, this remains a less likely but possible contender.","['Dermatology', 'Allergy and Clinical Immunology', ""Women's Health"", 'Breast Cancer', 'Oncology']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,42.0,F

A man in his 60s with long-standing thickening and induration of the legs presented with 1 week of left leg pain. The patient had previously been diagnosed with elephantiasis nostras verrucosa, and he was advised to elevate and compress the leg but was unavailable for follow-up. His medical history was notable for morbid obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and stroke. He reported no fever, fatigue, weight changes, gastrointestinal symptoms, difficulty concentrating, anxiety, or hyperhidrosis. Physical examination results revealed multiple firm skin-colored papules and nodules coalescing to form a large plaque on the anterior aspect of the left lower leg, whereas the right lower leg had diffuse induration and hyperpigmentation (Figure 1). There was no palpable lymphadenopathy. Laboratory analysis revealed normal complete blood cell count, thyroid function, serum protein electrophoresis, and serum immunofixation. A biopsy of a left leg nodule was performed.

    ",Euthyroid pretibial mucinosis,"To develop a differential diagnosis for this patient, we will consider various conditions that can cause thickening and induration of the legs, as well as the acute pain in the left leg. Here is a step-by-step differential diagnosis list:

1. **Lymphedema**: Considering the long-standing thickening and induration of the legs, lymphedema is a prominent possibility.

2. **Chronic Venous Insufficiency**: The hyperpigmentation and induration of the right leg suggest possible chronic venous changes.

3. **Lipodermatosclerosis**: Known to cause leg induration, often associated with obesity and venous issues.

4. **Cellulitis**: Sudden onset of pain in the left leg raises the suspicion of an infectious process like cellulitis.

5. **Diabetic Dermopathy**: Given the history of diabetes, skin changes, and nodules could align with this condition.

6. **Dermatofibroma**: Firm skin-colored papules and nodules are characteristic of dermatofibromas.

7. **Scleroderma**: This autoimmune condition can cause skin thickening and induration.

8. **Lipoma**: Though benign, lipomas could account for palpable nodules under the skin.

9. **Panniculitis**: Inflammatory processes affecting the subcutaneous fat could present similarly.

10. **Cutaneous Sarcoidosis**: This systemic condition could potentially cause skin nodules and systemic symptoms, though not all are present here.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:

After considering all the available patient information and test results, and performing a biopsy, let's rerank the differential diagnosis:

1. **Lymphedema**: Still the leading diagnosis given the patient's history and skin findings.
   
2. **Elephantiasis Nostras Verrucosa**: This is consistent with the history of long-standing leg changes and biopsy results.

3. **Chronic Venous Insufficiency**: The presence of hyperpigmentation and induration supports this diagnosis.

4. **Lipodermatosclerosis**: Likely consistent with the overall presentation and risk factors.

5. **Cellulitis**: Needs to be considered given the acute pain, though less likely without signs of infection.

6. **Diabetic Dermopathy**: A possibility, but no biopsy findings or characteristic lesions described would support this primarily.

7. **Dermatofibroma**: Unlikely given widespread nature of nodules and acute symptoms.

8. **Scleroderma**: Lower on the list as systemic signs are absent.

9. **Panniculitis**: Unlikely without associated systemic or inflammatory signs.

10. **Cutaneous Sarcoidosis**: Less likely considering the lack of systemic involvement and specific biopsy findings.

### INPUT:
A previously healthy 16-year-old boy presented to our department with a red tumor on his right upper arm that enlarged over 6 months. The lesion initially started as a small cutaneous nodule without obvious triggers that gradually developed and enlarged to form a red-colored tumor with a hard nodule inside. There was no history of local trauma or insect bite. His personal, past, and family histories were unremarkable. On physical examination, there was a 6 × 6-cm protuberant, thick-walled, and well-defined red bullalike tumor on the right upper arm, which extended 1 to 3 cm from the epidermal surface (Figure, A). Inside the tumor, a nontender, firm-to-hard nodule was palpated. There was no regional lymphadenopathy, and results of the rest of the physical and systemic examinations were normal. Laboratory examinations of hematologic, biochemical, and urinalysis tests were normal. The tumor was excised completely under local anesthesia, and part of the tissue was sent for pathological examination.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Bullous pilomatricoma,"1. **Pyogenic Granuloma**: A rapidly growing vascular lesion, often appearing as a red bump on the skin, which can develop after minor injury but not always.
   
2. **Dermatofibroma**: A common benign skin growth that may appear after minor trauma, usually firm and nontender, but not typically red in color.

3. **Keloid**: Overgrowth of scar tissue that develops around a wound, but less likely without preceding trauma.

4. **Lipoma**: A benign tumor composed of fat tissue, typically soft and not red, unlikely given the lesion's characteristics.

5. **Hemangioma**: A benign tumor of blood vessels that can appear as a red lump on the skin, common in children but usually identified earlier.

6. **Granuloma Annulare**: A chronic skin condition with ring-like lesions, generally not presenting as a solitary red tumor.

7. **Fibrosarcoma**: A malignant tumor that involves fibroblasts, more common in adults, but can present as a firm nodule under the skin.

8. **Epidermoid Cyst**: A benign, often movable lump beneath the skin, but typically with a more skin-colored appearance.

9. **Nodular Fasciitis**: A benign reactive process that presents as a rapid-growing subcutaneous tumor, usually firm.

10. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans**: A rare, slow-growing tumor that arises from the dermis and is firm, potentially very similar in presentation.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans**: Due to the firm nature, nodular feel, and dermatological characteristics without preceding trauma.
2. **Nodular Fasciitis**: Consistent with a rapid-growing nodule, firm and lacking systemic symptoms.
3. **Pyogenic Granuloma**: Red, vascular appearance is characteristic, though typically more vascular than hard.
4. **Fibrosarcoma**: Although rare in this age group, the firm nodule warrants consideration.
5. **Hemangioma**: Doesn't fit perfectly due to the age and presentation, but the red appearance links it.
6. **Granuloma Annulare**: Less likely due to presentation, but considered for subcutaneous nature.
7. **Dermatofibroma**: Commonly benign and firm, but less likely due to lack of preceding trauma.
8. **Keloid**: Unlikely due to lack of trauma history, but included due to firm, protuberant characteristics.
9. **Epidermoid Cyst**: Unlikely due to red coloration and solid tumor presentation.
10. **Lipoma**: Least likely due to hardness and redness of the lesion.","['Pediatrics', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Dermatology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,F

### INPUT:
A 73-year-old woman with a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and Raynaud disease but no history of cigarette smoking presented to the emergency department with 4 weeks of dysphagia and a 4.54-kg (10-lb) weight loss over 3 months. She had no nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, melena, or hematochezia but reported a cough productive of yellow sputum, dyspnea on exertion, and fatigue. The patient had been treated for presumed pneumonia with 3 courses of azithromycin over the prior 3 months due to infiltrates on a chest radiograph. She reported no known ill contacts or recent travel outside the US. At presentation, her heart rate and blood pressure were normal, and oxygen saturation was 95% on room air. Physical examination revealed a maculopapular rash over her neck and chest (Figure, left panel) and bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation. Laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 14.3 × 103/μL (reference, 4.2-9.1 × 103/μL); creatine kinase level, 2060 U/L (34.40 μkat/L) (reference, 44-196 U/L [0.73-3.27 μkat/L]), aldolase level, 18 U/L (0.30 μkat/L) (reference, <8 U/L [<0.13 μkat/L]), C-reactive protein level, 30 mg/L (reference, <8 mg/L), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 35 mm/h (reference, <20 mm/h). Antinuclear antibody immunofluorescent assay findings were positive. Results from testing for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C were negative. A barium swallow study showed no visualized aspiration. Endoscopy revealed clean-based esophageal and duodenal ulcers and nonspecific gastritis. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed bibasilar pulmonary consolidations and ground glass opacities (Figure, right panel).

### INPUT:
A 15-year-old boy presented with a 2-month history of decreased vision and a dark spot in the central vision in his right eye. He had a history of optometric examinations with no known ocular disease. Visual acuity with correction was 20/40 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. Anterior segment examination of both eyes was unremarkable, and the retina in the left eye appeared normal. In the right eye, there was an area of superior macular whitening with associated intraretinal hemorrhages and exudates. Fluorescein angiography showed abnormally dilated and tortuous retinal vessels, irregular capillary branching patterns, and bulblike telangiectasis with late leakage in the superior macula. Optical coherence tomography showed disorganized and hyperreflective inner retinal thickening (Figure, A) and intraretinal and subretinal fluid in the central macula. On review of systems, the patient noted a long-standing growth on his cheek, which on examination was a 4 × 3-mm exophytic, brownish-red vascular papule (Figure, B), as well as a history of lightly pigmented patches of skin and multiple subungual fibromas on his toes. Systemic blood pressure was normal.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 80s presented to the dermatology clinic with a 3-month history of a violaceous plaque with blackish papules and nodules on her left cheek, neck, and chest. She reported that the lesion had been asymptomatic but was increasing in size, with progression from her face to anterior chest. She received a diagnosis of primary salivary duct carcinoma of the hard palate 1 year prior and had been receiving treatment with oral bicalutamide and radiotherapy. A partially regressive change of the palatal tumor was noted radiographically during regular follow-up 3 months previously. On clinical examination, a hemorrhagic and erythematous plaque with multiple purpuric-to-blackish infiltrative papules and nodules extending from cheek, lateral neck, to the interclavicular area was found (Figure 1). An incisional biopsy from the infiltrative nodule on cheek was performed and submitted for histopathologic analysis.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Carcinoma hemorrhagiectoides,"1. **Cutaneous Metastasis:** Given the patient's history of primary salivary duct carcinoma and the presentation of violaceous plaques with blackish papules rapidly progressing, cutaneous metastasis from the salivary duct carcinoma is a strong possibility.

2. **Kaposi's Sarcoma:** The presence of violaceous and purpuric nodules may also be indicative of Kaposi's Sarcoma, although this is less likely due to the patient's cancer history.

3. **Angiosarcoma:** Considering the hemorrhagic nature of the plaque and nodules, an angiosarcoma could be part of the differential, especially as it often presents with purpuric lesions.

4. **Lymphoma Cutis:** Given the nodular presentation, lymphoma cutis is another possibility, although less likely in the context of the patient's known carcinoma.

5. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (Pigmented):** Basal cell carcinoma could explain pigmented lesions, albeit less so given the rapid progression and previous cancer history.

6. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (Pigmented):** Another possibility for rapidly evolving pigmented plaques and nodules, squamous cell carcinoma cannot be entirely ruled out.

7. **Melanoma (Metastatic or Primary):** Melanoma should also be considered given the blackish nature of the lesion, either as a new primary or metastatic disease.

8. **Reactive Angioendotheliomatosis:** A rare possibility, characterized by purpuric plaques and nodules, and associated with underlying malignancy.

9. **Cutaneous Neuroendocrine Carcinoma:** Although less likely, the aggressive features and nodular presentations require consideration.

10. **Leukemia Cutis:** This refers to leukemia presenting with skin involvement and would show similar presenting features, though less likely given the patient history.

### Reranking after Clinical and Histopathologic analysis:
1. **Cutaneous Metastasis:** The most likely diagnosis given the patient's history of salivary duct carcinoma and the nature of the lesions.
2. **Kaposi's Sarcoma:** Remains a consideration due to the violaceous appearance.
3. **Angiosarcoma:** Due to the hemorrhagic and rapid progression characteristics.
4. **Lymphoma Cutis:** Possible, though less likely in this context.
5. **Melanoma:** Needs careful consideration due to pigmentation of the lesions.
6. **Reactive Angioendotheliomatosis:** Rare, but relevant to the context of malignancy.
7. **Cutaneous Neuroendocrine Carcinoma:** Included given the aggressive nature of spread.
8. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (Pigmented):** Less likely but considered.
9. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (Pigmented):** Unlikely in rapid progression context.
10. **Leukemia Cutis:** Unlikely, given lack of systemic leukemia symptoms.","['Oncology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Salivary Gland Disorders', 'Dermatology', 'Geriatrics']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,80.0,M

### INPUT:
A 56-year-old man with a history of multiple myeloma complicated by therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia was admitted for myeloablative conditioning in preparation for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant. His course was complicated by severe mucositis, acute kidney injury, and neutropenic fever. During his admission, the patient also developed painful necrotic skin lesions, a nonproductive cough, and altered mental status. Physical examination findings demonstrated dusky, purpuric, and pink papulonodules, some with overlying eschar, scattered on the scalp, neck, trunk, and extremities (Figure, A). Laboratory study results revealed a white blood cell count of 150/μL (reference range, 3500/μL to 10 500/μL), an absolute neutrophil count of 130/μL (reference range, 1500/μL to 7400/μL), and a platelet count of 19 ×103/μL (reference range, 150 ×103/μL to 400 ×103/μL). (To convert the white blood cell and neutrophil counts to cells ×109/L, multiply by 0.001; conversion of the platelet count to cells ×109/L is 1:1.) Blood culture results were negative. The results of a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage, territorial infarction, or mass effect. The results of a CT scan of the chest demonstrated multifocal bilateral ground-glass patchy opacities, scattered solid bilateral pulmonary nodules, and a moderately sized pericardial effusion. A biopsy specimen from a skin nodule on the left lateral thigh was obtained for histopathologic examination and tissue culture, and wet mount preparation of a tissue culture colony was performed (Figure, B).

### INPUT:
A 67-year-old woman with thoracolumbar scoliosis, poor mobility, and history of frequent falls presented to the emergency department with 2 months of left shoulder pain, stiffness and reduced range of motion, and numbness and paresthesias in her left upper extremity. Ten years prior to presentation, she underwent surgical decompression for syringomyelia. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of her cervical and thoracic spine performed 2 years prior to presentation revealed a recurrent syrinx extending from C1 to T11, which was not resected because it did not cause symptoms at that time. On physical examination, she had mild tenderness to palpation and reduced range of motion of the left shoulder with abduction and flexion limited to 120° (normal range of motion, 180°). The left scapular muscles were atrophic, and pain and temperature sensation were reduced in her proximal left arm, and dorsal aspect of her left shoulder. Her complete blood cell count, serum glucose levels, C-reactive protein levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal. Results of tests for rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody were negative. Left shoulder radiograph showed complete absence of the left humeral head and a well-demarcated smooth osseous margin of the proximal humerus with associated soft tissue swelling and periarticular calcification (Figure 1). A chest radiograph taken 2 years prior revealed a normal left shoulder joint. The patient was hospitalized for further evaluation and treatment.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Neuropathic arthropathy of the shoulder (Charcot shoulder),"To create a differential diagnosis for this patient's condition, we will consider various potential causes of her symptoms step by step:

1. **Syringobulbia**: Given the history of syringomyelia extending into the cervical spine and current neurological symptoms.

2. **Neuropathic Arthropathy (Charcot Joint)**: Due to the complete absence of the humeral head and smooth osseous margins, consistent with joint neuropathy.

3. **Osteomyelitis**: Although rare without systemic symptoms, it's important to consider infectious causes.

4. **Primary Bone Tumor (Chondrosarcoma or Osteosarcoma)**: Given the bone changes observed.

5. **Metastatic Bone Disease**: Common in older patients with significant bone changes, though no primary tumor is noted.

6. **Osteonecrosis of the Humeral Head**: Could cause bone collapse, especially with limited blood supply.

7. **Rheumatoid Arthritis**: Despite negative markers, sero-negative rheumatoid arthritis is possible.

8. **Rotator Cuff Arthropathy**: Could explain shoulder joint destruction, especially in older adults.

9. **Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)**: Given the pain, sensory changes, and history of falls.

10. **Polymyalgia Rheumatica**: Typically presents with stiffness and pain but less likely given the negative ESR and CRP.

After evaluating all patient information and test results, here is the reranked differential diagnosis:

1. **Neuropathic Arthropathy (Charcot Joint)**: High index of suspicion due to sensory changes and characteristic radiographic findings.
2. **Syringobulbia**: Due to recurrent syrinx with related neurological sensory changes.
3. **Osteonecrosis of the Humeral Head**: A potential differential cause considering her symptoms and bone changes.
4. **Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)**: Pain and sensory changes align with CRPS symptoms.
5. **Osteomyelitis**: Still possible, but less likely without systemic signs.
6. **Rotator Cuff Arthropathy**: Could exhibit similar radiological findings, though less probable.
7. **Metastatic Bone Disease**: Possible but lower suspicion without evidence of primary cancer.
8. **Rheumatoid Arthritis**: Less likely due to negative serology but not impossible.
9. **Primary Bone Tumor**: Less probable but considered due to unusual bone changes.
10. **Polymyalgia Rheumatica**: Least likely given normal ESR and CRP levels.

### INPUT:
A 68-year-old woman with a remote history of B-cell lymphoma and active renal cell carcinoma (RCC), receiving cabozantinib therapy, was referred for worsening hazy vision in the right eye after recent outside retinal detachment (RD) repair of the left eye, with pars plana vitrectomy and gas. The patient noted blurry vision started around the time of cabozantinib therapy initiation. Cabozantinib therapy was discontinued for surgery and resumed 3 days later. The referring retina specialist noted vitritis and vasculitis intraoperatively, but the result of vitreous biopsy cytology was negative for malignant cells. At presentation to our institution, the patient was taking oral prednisone, 40 mg/d. Her visual acuity was 20/500 OD and hand motions OS, with an intraocular pressure of 18 mm Hg in both eyes. Right eye slitlamp examination results showed pigmented cells in the anterior chamber and lens capsule; the left eye showed prolapsed pigmented vitreous at the pupillary margin. Right eye fundus examination results revealed sheets of pigmented cell and vascular sheathing with optic nerve pallor. The left eye had a poor view, with 90% gas fill. Fluorescein angiography illustrated disc and vessel leakage (predominantly arteriole), capillary dropout, and peripheral nonperfusion in the right eye (Figure 1A) with no view in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography revealed debris at the vitreoretinal interface (Figure 1B).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Renal cell carcinoma bilateral ocular metastasis,"To develop a differential diagnosis list for this patient, consider the presented symptoms, medical history, and recent treatments.

1. **Drug-Induced Uveitis**: Given the temporal relationship between the onset of vision problems and the initiation of cabozantinib therapy, drug-induced uveitis should be considered.

2. **Paraneoplastic Retinopathy**: The patient's history of B-cell lymphoma and active RCC could suggest a paraneoplastic autoimmune condition affecting the retina.

3. **Infectious Uveitis**: Although less likely due to negative cytology for malignant cells, previous surgery and immunosuppression with prednisone might predispose to infection.

4. **Non-infectious Inflammatory Uveitis**: The presence of vitritis, vasculitis, and vascular sheathing suggests a potential inflammatory uveitis.

5. **Ischemic Optic Neuropathy**: Given the optic nerve pallor and episodes of vascular nonperfusion, ischemic optic neuropathy should be considered.

6. **Retinal Vasculitis**: The observed vascular sheathing and arteriole leakage suggest active retinal vasculitis.

7. **Radiation Retinopathy**: If the patient received radiotherapy for cancer treatment, this could present similarly with capillary dropout and vessel leakage.

8. **Vitreoretinal Traction**: Given the history of retinal detachment repair, postoperative complications such as vitreoretinal traction could be considered.

9. **Pigment Dispersion Syndrome**: The presence of pigmented cells in the anterior chamber might suggest pigment dispersion syndrome, especially in the context of recent surgery.

10. **Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)**: Although less likely without sudden vision loss, CRAO could contribute to vessel leakage and disc changes.

### INPUT:
A Chinese man in his late 20s presented with a 20-year history of progressive skin laxity. In early childhood, he had developed asymptomatic yellowish coalesced papules confined to flexural areas. Subsequently, severe skin sagging occurred on his abdomen with loss of elasticity, then spread extensively with developmental growth. The results of a physical examination showed thick and leathery skinfolds on the neck, axillae, inguinal regions, abdomen, and limbs (Figure, A), with yellowish papules scattered on the dorsal neck. The patient had no extracutaneous involvement and was born to healthy nonconsanguineous parents. However, his younger sister had developed the same skin symptoms. Coagulation-related tests indicated a low clotting activity of factor X (52.2%; reference range, 77%-131%) and a prolonged prothrombin time (12.8 seconds; reference range, 10.4-12.6 seconds). The results of other laboratory investigations were unremarkable. Echocardiographic and fundoscopic examination results were normal. A skin biopsy specimen was obtained from his neck for histopathologic examination (Figure, B).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like disorder with coagulation deficiency,"1. **Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum (PXE):** Given the history of progressive skin laxity and characteristic yellowish papules in flexural areas, along with a familial pattern involving a sibling, PXE is a strong consideration.

2. **Cutis Laxa:** This condition is characterized by loose, sagging skin and has both inherited and acquired forms, which could explain the progressive skin laxity.

3. **Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS):** Although typically associated with joint hypermobility, some types involve skin changes, including skin that is saggy and elastic.

4. **Marfan Syndrome:** Known for connective tissue problems, Marfan syndrome can involve skin issues and shares some overlap with the symptoms initially described.

5. **Dermatofibrosis Lenticularis Disseminata (Buschke-Ollendorff Syndrome):** Typically involves connective tissue nevi and is associated with skin presentation similar to described.

6. **Familial Cutaneous Collagenoma:** A rare disorder that can also present with collagen-related changes in the skin's texture and firmness.

7. **Acrogeria (Gottron-Type):** Characterized by premature skin aging and elasticity, typically presenting in childhood or adolescence.

8. **Lipoid Proteinosis (Urbach-Wiethe Disease):** Rare skin condition known for a unique skin texture and changes, including waxy papules.

9. **Elastic Recoil Syndrome:** Rare alterations in the skin's elastic fibers, leading to changes in skin texture and laxity.

10. **Annular Elastolytic Giant Cell Granuloma:** Characterized by skin laxity and alterations in elastin, with a possible genetic component.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Integrated with All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum (PXE):** Most likely due to characteristic papules, skin laxity, and familial occurrence, retaining its leading position after considering the skin biopsy and clotting abnormality.

2. **Cutis Laxa:** Retains a high differential due to progressive and widespread skin laxity without extracutaneous symptoms.

3. **Acrogeria (Gottron-Type):** Moves up given the early onset of the skin issues without systemic involvement.

4. **Familial Cutaneous Collagenoma:** Elevated due to similar connective tissue involvement but remains less clear without specific collagen findings in biopsy.

5. **Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS):** Moves down due to the specific nature of skin presentation and absence of typically associated joint symptoms.

6. **Lipoid Proteinosis (Urbach-Wiethe Disease):** Lower probability as skin biopsy did not show thickened or waxy deposits and is uncommon without mucosal involvement.

7. **Dermatofibrosis Lenticularis Disseminata (Buschke-Ollendorff Syndrome):** Less likely without the presence of connective tissue nevi.

8. **Annular Elastolytic Giant Cell Granuloma:** Low differential given rarity and lack of classic presentation in biopsy.

9. **Marfan Syndrome:** Continues to drop as it lacks specific skin manifestations and the absence of physical or systemic indicators typical of Marfan.

10. **Elastic Recoil Syndrome:** Remains low given the lack of documentation in the functional elastic fiber abnormality typically seen in diagnostics.","['Coagulation Disorders', 'Dermatology', 'Hematology', 'Rheumatology', 'Connective Tissue Disease of the Skin']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,29.0,F

### INPUT:
A 15-year-old female presented to the pediatric otolaryngology clinic with dysphagia to solid foods, and dyspnea when lying on the right side that was progressive during 8 months. She denied pain, aspiration, noisy breathing, obstructive episodes, dysphonia, and weight loss. A physical examination revealed fullness in the left oropharynx and left level 3 of the neck. Findings of flexible laryngoscopy showed a submucosal mass in the left oropharynx extending inferiorly into the hypopharynx, obliterating the left pyriform sinus, abutting the base of tongue with hooding over the epiglottis. The supraglottis and glottis were unremarkable. Computed tomography imaging with contrast of the neck revealed a 4.6 × 4.0 × 8.0-cm heterogeneously enhancing mass in the left oropharynx and hypopharynx with cystic components and clear planes separating the mass from the spinal musculature and carotid sheath (Figure 1).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pediatric fibromyxoid soft tissue tumor,"**Step 1:** Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma  
Given the patient’s age, sex, and the location of the mass, juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma is considered. These tumors are highly vascular and typically occur in adolescent males but can rarely present in females.

**Step 2:** Lymphatic Malformation  
The presence of a cystic mass in the neck region raises the possibility of a lymphatic malformation, often referred to as a cystic hygroma.

**Step 3:** Branchial Cleft Cyst  
The mass’s appearance and location can also suggest a branchial cleft cyst, a congenital lesion that typically appears as a cystic mass in the neck.

**Step 4:** Thyroglossal Duct Cyst  
Although less common in this position, thyroglossal duct cysts can occasionally present with anomalies typical of oropharyngeal masses.

**Step 5:** Teratoma  
The mass could also be a teratoma, which is a type of germ cell tumor that can contain multiple types of tissue and may present as a heterogeneous mass.

**Step 6:** Paraganglioma  
Though more commonly located at the carotid bifurcation, a paraganglioma could potentially present with a neck mass and would typically show vascular components.

**Step 7:** Rhabdomyosarcoma  
In this patient’s age group, an oropharyngeal mass could suggest rhabdomyosarcoma, a malignant tumor of muscle tissue origin.

**Step 8:** Neurofibroma  
A neurofibroma could present as a submucosal mass, though it may typically exhibit less cystic features and more fibrous components.

**Step 9:** Lymphoma  
A presentation involving fullness and mass could suggest lymphoma, particularly given lymphoid tissue involvement in the oropharynx.

**Step 10:** Infectious Abscess  
Although less likely given the chronicity and imaging features showing cystic components, an infectious abscess could be considered given the mass’s location and distortion.

### Reranking All Hypotheses:
1. **Lymphatic Malformation**  
Fits the cystic nature and location.

2. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**  
Congenital cystic neck masses are frequently found in this location.

3. **Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma**  
Despite the sex of the patient, possibility remains due to similar presentation.

4. **Lymphoma**  
Fullness in the oropharynx and neck mass are somewhat consistent with lymphoma.

5. **Rhabdomyosarcoma**  
Important to consider malignant potential in adolescent age group.

6. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst**  
Plausible but less usual presentation.

7. **Paraganglioma**  
Although classically located differently, vascular component could offer a clue.

8. **Teratoma**  
Presence of diversity in tissue types could match heterogeneous masses.

9. **Neurofibroma**  
Less likely given the imaging not showing fibrous components prominently.

10. **Infectious Abscess**  
Less fitting due to chronicity and clear-plane separation suggestive of a non-inflammatory process.","['Otolaryngology', 'Swallowing and Dysphagia', 'Pediatrics', 'Adolescent Medicine']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.0,M

### INPUT:
A woman in her 60s presented to our clinic with a 5-year history of diffuse erythematous, edematous annular plaques (Figure 1); low-grade fevers; and mild leukopenia. The result of a skin biopsy performed 4 years prior was interpreted as subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE). Treatments included hydroxychloroquine, 400 mg/d, for 4 years; mycophenolate mofetil, 1000 mg/d, for 6 months; and oral prednisone tapers, starting at 40 mg/d. Of these, only prednisone appeared to elicit a response. Review of symptoms was negative for fatigue, weight loss, cough, shortness of breath, joint pain, ocular symptoms, mucosal ulcerations, history of blood clots, photosensitivity, pleurisy, urine changes, and diarrhea. Medical history included hypertension, for which she took losartan, and seasonal allergies, for which she used fexofenadine and fluticasone. Laboratory evaluation revealed mild neutropenia and lymphopenia with normal hemoglobin and platelet counts. Antinuclear antibody screening results were negative. The results of a comprehensive metabolic panel, C3, C4, serum protein electrophoresis, serum free light chains, methylmalonic acid, homocysteine, ferritin, copper, zinc, haptoglobin, HIV, hepatitis B and C serologic tests, and rapid plasma reagin were negative. Lactate dehydrogenase was mildly elevated. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated at 41 mm/h. Routine cancer screening was up to date. Therapeutic trials of dapsone and dapsone in combination with colchicine were not effective.
### OUTPUT:
    ","VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, and somatic) syndrome","1. **Chronic Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (CCLE)**
   - Given the patient's history of diffuse erythematous plaques and initial interpretation of the biopsy as subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE), chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus is a possibility. However, the lack of ANA positivity makes systemic lupus less likely.

2. **Dermatomyositis**
   - Considered due to the cutaneous manifestations and mild muscle enzyme elevation, although muscle weakness is not reported, making this less likely.

3. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Presents with erythematous skin plaques and systemic symptoms like mild fevers and leukopenia. Negative biopsy for granulomas makes this less favored.

4. **Drug-Induced Lupus Erythematosus**
   - Considering her medication history and the response to prednisone, this is possible, though ANA typically should be positive, which is a limiting factor here.

5. **Adult-onset Still's Disease**
   - Characterized by persistent fevers, rash, and arthralgias, accompanied by elevated inflammatory markers like ESR. The lack of arthralgias in this patient decreases likelihood.

6. **Erythrodermic Psoriasis**
   - The diffuse erythematous plaques and systemic symptoms might suggest this. However, specific histological signs on skin biopsy are usually definitive.

7. **Systemic Sclerosis (Limited)**
   - Generally not fitting due to lack of cutaneous thickening or raynaud's and ANA negativity.

8. **Hypocomplementemic Urticarial Vasculitis Syndrome (HUVS)**
   - Presents with urticarial rash, low-grade fever, and leukopenia, with usually a positive ANA and low complement levels, which are not present here.

9. **Mycosis Fungoides (Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma)**
   - Persistent erythematous plaques suggest this possibility, but biopsy didn’t favor malignancy, yet still considered due to refractory nature of symptoms.

10. **Relapsing Polychondritis**
    - This autoimmune disease can cause systemic inflammatory symptoms and skin involvement, though specific auricular/nasal symptoms are lacking here.

### INPUT:
A man in his early 40s, with a history of migraines and recurrent health issues, presented with acute pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, and nausea that started several hours after a flight from Florida to New York City. He was noted to have tachycardia (110 beats/min) and hypoxemia (90% receiving room air) with a blood pressure of 106/81 mm Hg. Cardiac, respiratory, and pulse examination results were unremarkable. He denied any clear physical or emotional triggers preceding presentation. Before presentation, the patient reported good health with satisfactory employment-mandated routine physical examinations. He denied a history of smoking, alcohol, or illicit drug use. He was not taking hormonal birth control or hormone therapy. Laboratory values demonstrated a normal complete blood cell count and metabolic panel. Chest radiograph results were unremarkable. A computed tomographic chest scan excluded pulmonary embolism but suggested pulmonary and interstitial edema. Results of an electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with premature ventricular contractions, subcentimeter ST-segment elevation in leads I and aVL and 1-mm ST-segment depression in leads II, III, aVF, and V5 through V6. Initial high-sensitivity troponin was 110 000 ng/mL (to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1). Results of cardiac point-of-care ultrasonography demonstrated a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 40%, with hypokinesis of the anterolateral and posterior walls. Emergent cardiac catheterization revealed spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) of the left main coronary artery (Figure 1 and Video).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Spontaneous coronary artery dissection of the left main coronary artery,"1. *Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD)* - This is confirmed as the diagnosis based on the cardiac catheterization findings.

2. *Acute Myocardial Infarction* - Initially considered due to elevated troponin levels and ECG changes suggestive of ischemia, though SCAD is the direct cause.

3. *Pulmonary Embolism* - Ruled out by the computed tomographic chest scan, initially considered due to pleuritic chest pain, tachycardia, and hypoxemia.

4. *Pericarditis* - Possible due to ST-segment elevation, but the lack of classic friction rub and the context of SCAD makes this unlikely.

5. *Myocarditis* - Considered because of elevated troponins and sinus tachycardia, without coronary artery disease, although ruled out mainly due to SCAD.

6. *Pneumothorax* - Ruled out after the chest radiograph but initially considered due to acute shortness of breath and chest pain post-flight.

7. *Aortic Dissection* - Ruled out via imaging studies; initially considered due to chest pain and the need to exclude life-threatening causes.

8. *Anxiety Attack* - Sometimes considered when chest pain triggers are absent, but unlikely given objective findings like hypoxemia, and high troponin levels.

9. *Heart Failure* - Considered in light of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and findings of pulmonary and interstitial edema.

10. *Costochondritis* - Initially considered as a cause of pleuritic chest pain, though symptoms and test results were inconsistent.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Conclusion

1. **Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD)** - Confirmed as the definitive diagnosis.
   
2. **Acute Myocardial Infarction** - Was considered strongly due to elevated troponin and ECG changes but is a consequence of SCAD.
   
3. **Myocarditis** - Kept in differentials due to troponin and reduced ejection fraction, but less likely given SCAD presence.
   
4. **Heart Failure** - Secondary to cardiomyopathy or infarction (reduced EF), though SCAD is underlying.
   
5. **Pericarditis** - Possible with pleuritic pain and ECG findings but unlikely in this case with SCAD.
   
6. **Aortic Dissection** - Ruled out but initially important to consider given symptoms' severity.
   
7. **Pulmonary Embolism** - Subsidiary but excluded by imaging.
   
8. **Pneumothorax** - Ruled out early through imaging, but flown in consideration.
   
9. **Anxiety Attack** - Considered due to atypical presentation but unlikely with objective cardiac findings.
   
10. **Costochondritis** - Least likely given lack of physical exam findings and imaging without suggestion.","['Acute Coronary Syndromes', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Pregnancy', 'Obstetrics', 'Obstetrics and Gynecology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,40.0,F

### INPUT:
A 60-year-old Black patient presented to the emergency department with a 2-month history of chest pain and shortness of breath with exertion, 3 months of toe numbness, and unintended weight loss of 8 kg over 6 months. The patient also had a history of lumbar spinal stenosis. On presentation, blood pressure was 104/73 mm Hg; heart rate, 91/min; respiratory rate, 16/min; and oxygen saturation, 96% on room air. Physical examination revealed edema to the mid-calf bilaterally, hypoesthesia below the knees, and ankle plantar flexion strength of 3 of 5 based on the Medical Research Council Scale for muscle strength. Laboratory testing revealed a high-sensitivity troponin level of 52 ng/L (reference, <34 ng/L); brain-type natriuretic peptide, 112 pmol/L (reference, <30 pmol/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 51 U/L (0.85 μkat/L) (reference, 0-35 U/L [0-0.58 μkat/L]); and alanine aminotransferase, 76 U/L (1.27 μkat/L) (reference, 0-45 U/L [0-0.75 μkat/L]). A chest radiograph showed cardiomegaly without pulmonary vascular redistribution or pulmonary edema. An electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm, left anterior fascicular block, and down-sloping anterolateral ST segments. The patient was admitted to the hospital, where electromyography results included reduced amplitude of peroneal nerve action potentials, consistent with axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy of the bilateral lower extremities. Coronary angiography showed no coronary atherosclerosis, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Results of serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and serum free light chain testing were normal. A bone scintigraphy scan using technetium Tc 99m–labeled hydroxymethylene diphosphonate demonstrated increased cardiac uptake (Figure).

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. Cardiac Amyloidosis - The increased cardiac uptake on bone scintigraphy, asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, neuropathy, and weight loss are highly suggestive.
2. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy - Presenting with asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, but less likely due to normal coronary angiography and cardiac uptake findings.
3. Peripheral Neuropathy due to Diabetes Mellitus - Neuropathy present but lack of other major signs such as hyperglycemia.
4. Chronic Heart Failure - Cardiomegaly and elevated BNP present, though less likely given the structural findings specific to amyloidosis.
5. Chronic Kidney Disease - Possible explanation for neuropathy and edema but lacks definitive supportive evidence in this case.
6. Multiple Myeloma - Considered due to weight loss and possible amyloid-related cardiac findings, but normal SPEP and light chains made this less likely.
7. Sarcoidosis - Cardiomyopathy and systemic involvement are possible but other systemic signs are missing.
8. Liver Cirrhosis - Elevated liver enzymes are present, but other classical signs and lab indicators are missing.
9. Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) - Neuropathy present, but less likely without supportive typical immune findings.

### INPUT:
A 70-year-old woman presented to the dermatology clinic for evaluation of a pruritic exanthem that began on her scalp and face and spread across most of her body over a 2-month period. The patient had no fever, night sweats, fatigue, recent unintentional weight loss, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. She reported no new prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or herbal supplements prior to the onset of the exanthem. She had no history of psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, or other skin disorder, and no recent viral or bacterial infection. On presentation, her temperature was 37.1 °C (98.7 °F); blood pressure, 128/86 mm Hg; heart rate, 110/min; and respiratory rate, 30/min. Physical examination revealed confluent salmon-colored plaques composed of folliculocentric scaly papules across her body with several patches of unaffected skin on her trunk. The patient had waxy, exfoliative scale on the volar aspect of her hands and feet and thickened, onycholytic nails. Severe ectropion prevented complete eyelid closure (Figure). She was referred to the emergency department, where laboratory testing revealed a normal complete blood cell count and normal lactate dehydrogenase level. The patient was admitted to the hospital and was treated with intravenous fluids and daily wet-wrap therapy with topical triamcinolone ointment (0.1%) applied to her trunk, arms, and legs, followed by a layer of warm, damp gauze and dry, cotton pajamas.

2. **Erythrodermic Psoriasis** - Consideration given the extensive skin involvement and nail changes.
3. **Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides)** - Given the chronicity and similar presentation.
4. **Seborrheic Dermatitis** - Common, but less likely given extent and areas involved.
5. **Ichthyosis** - Possible given scaling, though generally begins earlier in life.
6. **Psoriasis** - Possible, not typical given the sparing noted and incomplete eye closure.
7. **Contact Dermatitis** - Less likely without a known trigger and the chronic development over 2 months.
8. **Pemphigus Foliaceus** - Rare and unlikely but possible given the involvement of desquamation.

### INPUT:
A woman in her late 60s was referred to the dermatologic clinic with a 10-day history of fever up to 38.5 °C and tender lesions on the neck and trunk. In the previous month, she had received the first cycle of a chemotherapeutic regimen of ixazomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone to treat a recurrence of IgG-κ multiple myeloma with a 10-year history. Physical examination showed annular erythematous plaques of up to 2 cm in diameter, with violaceous and crusted centers on the neck and trunk. On the right chest, an annular erythematous lesion with 2 zones of color—a central area of purpura and an outer erythematous and edematous ring—was present (Figure, A). Laboratory investigations found pancytopenia: a white blood cell count of 2.3 × 103/μL (reference range, 3.5-9.8 × 103/μL), hemoglobin levels of 12.1 g/dL (reference range, 13.5-17.6 g/dL), platelet count of 29 × 103/μL (reference range, 130-400 × 103μL), and elevated serum C-reactive protein levels of 3.31 mg/dL (reference range, <0.30 mg/dL). Blood culture results were negative. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor analogs had not been prescribed to the patient. Skin biopsy from a lesion on the left chest was performed for histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses (Figure, B-D).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome,"1. **Erythema Multiforme**  
The annular erythematous plaques with violaceous centers suggest erythema multiforme, potentially triggered by the chemotherapy.

2. **Sweet's Syndrome (Acute Febrile Neutrophilic Dermatosis)**  
The presence of fever, tender skin lesions, and neutropenia raise the suspicion of Sweet's syndrome.

3. **Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenic Dermatosis**  
Given the patient's recent chemotherapy and resultant neutropenia, this might be a dermatologic manifestation of myelosuppression.

4. **Vasculitis**  
The description of purpura and pancytopenia may indicate an underlying vasculitis, possibly secondary to her medication or malignancy.

5. **Infectious Etiology (Viral Exanthem)**  
Considering the fever and rash, a viral exanthem due to suppresed immune system is considered, although blood cultures are negative.

6. **Paraneoplastic Pemphigus**  
The unusual skin presentation in a patient with cancer could suggest a paraneoplastic autoimmune blistering disorder.

7. **Leukocytoclastic Vasculitis**  
This form of small vessel vasculitis, presenting with palpable purpura, could be due to drug exposure.

8. **Dermatomyositis**  
An immune-mediated condition that can sometimes present paraneoplastically with lesions and underlying myopathy.

9. **Erythroderma**  
The extensive skin involvement may indicate erythroderma, although this is usually more generalized.

10. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum**  
Uncommon but can present with painful skin lesions, particularly in association with blood dyscrasias.

A 63-year-old woman with no ocular history and a history of stage 3 cutaneous melanoma of the scalp and chronic lymphocytic leukemia was referred for kaleidoscope vision. She received nivolumab (anti–programmed cell death 1 checkpoint inhibitor) 9 months prior, obinutuzumab (B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibitor) 3 months later, and 5-mg oral prednisone daily. On presentation, nivolumab and obinutuzumab treatment was complete. Her visual acuity was 20/125 OD and 20/50 OS. Ophthalmoscopy revealed bilateral panuveitis with diffuse pigmentary abnormalities. Fluorescein angiography showed diffuse retinal pigment epithelium loss and late staining of the retinal lesions. She received 60 mg of oral prednisone daily for 2 weeks with a planned 10-week taper. However, prednisone was discontinued due to positive Lyme disease exposure 6 weeks later. At this time, the active anterior and vitreous cells had resolved. However, 2 weeks later, visual acuity decreased to count fingers in her right eye and hand motions in the left eye. The anterior and vitreous chambers had grade +0.5 pigmented cells. The ophthalmoscopic examination showed a leopard-spot pattern (Figure 1), and optical coherence tomography showed substantial retinal pigment epithelium and outer retinal layer loss. Repeat testing for Treponema pallidum, Lyme disease, and HIV was negative. Results of magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbit were negative for leukemic infiltration.

### INPUT:
Final diagnosis: Iris retraction syndrome.
Case report: A 53-year-old man presenting with a unilateral mild cortical and nuclear cataract associated with 20/32 visual acuity in his left eye was planning to undergo phacoemulsification. A few days before surgery, he noticed a sudden decrease in his left visual acuity measured at 20/80. His eye specialist then observed a reverse pupillary block in his left eye and referred the patient to our department. At presentation, no other remarkable medical history was recorded and no precipitating factors identified. Slitlamp examination showed a unilateral deepening of the anterior chamber associated with signs of anterior uveitis (ie, keratic precipitates and severe aqueous flare, 3+) and posterior synechiae between the iris and the lens. In addition, fundus examination revealed an inferior retinal detachment without any associated visible tear. Intraocular pressure was 15 mm Hg in the right eye and 9 mm Hg in the left eye. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography images and fundus photographs of both eyes are shown in Figure 1.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Iris retraction syndrome,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Anterior Uveitis**: Given the signs of anterior uveitis such as keratic precipitates and severe aqueous flare.

2. **Cataract Complication**: Considering the presence of mild cortical and nuclear cataract with planned phacoemulsification and subsequent vision changes.

3. **Retinal Detachment**: Noted as inferior retinal detachment without a visible tear in the affected eye.

4. **Pupillary Block**: The observation of reverse pupillary block could indicate acute or chronic angle-closure glaucoma or related syndrome.

5. **Posterior Synechiae**: The presence of posterior synechiae between the iris and lens usually due to inflammatory processes.

6. **Hypotony**: Lower intraocular pressure in the left eye compared to the right could suggest the complication of a retinal detachment or inflammation.

7. **Iris Atrophy**: Possible iris changes due to glaucoma or inflammation leading to structural changes.

8. **Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome**: Although typically important for intraoperative scenarios, the iris behavior prior might underline other syndromic developments.

9. **Ciliary Body Effusion Syndrome**: Could be proposed due to profound changes in the anterior chamber depth.

10. **Vitreous Detachment**: Although not visibly linked, could be part of the vision change and retinal issues observed.

### Re-Ranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Iris Retraction Syndrome**: Based on the unique set of symptoms, including reverse pupillary block and anterior chamber deepening.
2. **Retinal Detachment**: Significant finding influencing visual acuity and pressure differential.
3. **Anterior Uveitis**: Due to direct observation of inflammatory signs.
4. **Posterior Synechiae**: Significant due to inflammation and structural implications.
5. **Hypotony**: A potential consequence of retinal and inflammatory changes.
6. **Ciliary Body Effusion Syndrome**: Indicates possible fluid dynamics issues affecting chamber depth.
7. **Iris Atrophy**: Structural changes in the iris that could contribute to visual changes.
8. **Cataract Complication**: Pre-existing condition exacerbated by new findings.
9. **Vitreous Detachment**: Secondary consideration due to other more significant findings.
10. **Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome**: Deprioritized as it's more relevant in surgical settings, not preoperative symptoms.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 80s presented to the emergency department with a 4-week history of progressive weakness and fatigue, with associated development of purple bruiselike lesions on her head. She denied any history of trauma, falls, or occlusive headgear use. Her medical history was significant for atrial fibrillation, receiving anticoagulation medication, and heart failure. On physical examination, numerous nontender violaceous plaques were seen on the forehead and scalp of the patient (Figure, A). On full skin examination, nonspecific skin-colored plaques were noted on the chest, and a 1.8 × 2.5-cm erythematous plaque was noted on the left lower back. There was no appreciable lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Peripheral blood test results revealed a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, a platelet count of 68 × 103/μL, a white blood cell count of 2800/μL, and an absolute neutrophil count of 1.0/μL. Lactate dehydrogenase level was 202 U/L. (To convert hemoglobin to g/L, multiply by 10.0; platelets to ×109/L, by 1; white blood cell and neutrophil counts to ×109/L, by 0.001; and lactate dehydrogenase to μkat/L, by 0.0167.) A 4-mm punch biopsy was performed on the erythematous plaque on the left lower back (Figure, B and C).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm,"1. **Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)** - Given the patient's cytopenias, bruising, and age, AML should be considered.
2. **Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)** - Considering the patient's age and blood count abnormalities, MDS is a differential.
3. **Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)** - Possible due to abnormal blood counts and age, though unusual with skin plaques.
4. **Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)** - Low platelet count and bruising suggest ITP as a differential.
5. **Anticoagulation-Related Bleeding** - Given anticoagulant use and bruises, bleeding due to medication is a possibility.
6. **Cutaneous Leukemia** - Presence of skin lesions suggests leukemia with skin involvement may be a differential.
7. **Aplastic Anemia** - Presenting cytopenias and absence of organomegaly can indicate aplastic anemia.
8. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - Weakness, bruising, and skin changes could be paraneoplastic manifestations.
9. **Essential Thrombocythemia** - Less likely due to low platelets, but still an option with blood abnormalities.
10. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** - Less common at this age, but can cause cytopenias and skin changes.

### INPUT:
A 47-year-old man was seen with left-sided facial weakness and swelling for 2 months. He was diagnosed as having recurrent high-grade serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary and developed these symptoms after cycle 4 of chemotherapy. He was receiving oral antidiabetic agents, and his blood glucose level was 110 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555). Physical examination findings were consistent with left lower-motor-neuron type of facial nerve palsy. He was conscious and well oriented, with no other relevant clinical signs or focal neurological deficits. There was no history of prior COVID-19 infection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was requested, with clinical suspicion of metastasis in view of mildly elevated CA125 levels. The results of MRI of the brain did not reveal any neuroparenchymal or meningeal lesions. However, both maxillary sinuses showed mucosal thickening, which was intermediate to hypointense on T2-weighted imaging and hypointense on T1-weighted imaging with postcontrast enhancement. Computed tomography sections confirmed bony destruction with foci of remodeling involving the walls of the maxillary sinuses (Figure 1).

### INPUT:
A 64-year-old man presented with diminution of vision, progressive redness, and dull aching pain in the right eye for 8 months. There was no history of trauma. His medical history was unremarkable. On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity measured 20/60 OD and 20/25 OS. The anterior segment showed dilated corkscrew conjunctival vessels (Figure 1), a shallow anterior chamber in the right eye, and nuclear cataract in both eyes. Pupillary reaction and color vision were normal in both eyes. Intraocular pressure was 16 mm Hg by Goldman applanation tonometry in both eyes. Gonioscopy revealed an occludable angle in the right eye without evidence of blood in the Schlemm canal. Both eyes’ extraocular movements were full and free in all directions of gaze. Dilated fundus examination showed a clear vitreous cavity in the right eye, 360° serous choroidal detachment partly obscuring the optic disc nasally (Figure 1), and the fundus in the left eye was unremarkable.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Low-flow carotid cavernous fistula,"1. **Carotid-Cavernous Fistula**: The dilated corkscrew conjunctival vessels and serous choroidal detachment suggest the possibility of this vascular abnormality.

2. **Scleritis**: Persistent redness, pain, and ocular involvement could point to an inflammatory condition.

3. **Angle-Closure Glaucoma**: The shallow anterior chamber and occludable angle might indicate intermittent angle-closure episodes.

4. **Uveal Effusion Syndrome**: Serous choroidal detachment may indicate this condition attributed to abnormal uveal fluid dynamics.

5. **Choroidal Tumor**: The presence of a serous choroidal detachment could be secondary to an underlying ocular mass.

6. **Orbital Varix**: Compute possibility of mass effect on orbital structures causing external ocular changes.

7. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)**: Assess speculative circulation issues possibly leading to similar fundoscopic findings.

8. **Vortex Vein Varix**: Given the dilated corkscrew vessels, a variation in orbital drainage through vortex veins is considered.

9. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension**: Evaluate for possible disc edema/other neural changes due to similar fundoscopic changes.

10. **Harada's Disease**: Multi-system involvement often leading to similar retinal presentations; check systemic symptoms despite inadequate support.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:

1. **Carotid-Cavernous Fistula**: Strong vascular and choroidal manifestations remain a leading diagnosis.
2. **Uveal Effusion Syndrome**: Anomalies in eye structure or fluid transport align with the findings.
3. **Angle-Closure Glaucoma**: Ocular anatomical considerations require further investigation.
4. **Scleritis**: Chronic eye pain and redness may still hint at this condition.
5. **Orbital Varix**: External ocular changes and symptoms pose a concern.
6. **Vortex Vein Varix**: Alternative venous drainage remains plausible.
7. **Choroidal Tumor**: Isolated choroidal detachments sustain concern about growth presence.
8. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)**: Circulatory disruption is possible albeit lower significance.
9. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension**: Retained peripheral concern absent comprehensive supportive evidence.

### INPUT:
A man in his late 60s presented to the emergency department after an episode of syncope. He described several other episodes occurring at rest over the past several weeks. He denied palpitations, chest pain, and shortness of breath. He was otherwise in excellent health and not taking any medications. He had no family history of syncope or sudden death. His vital signs and physical examination were unremarkable. The initial electrocardiogram (ECG) results were normal, but premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) were noted on telemetry. Shortly thereafter, 2 episodes of fast polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT), 30 minutes apart, were recorded, both lasting less than 4 seconds (Figure 1A). A repeat ECG showed PVCs (Figure 1B). Laboratory test results including serum potassium and magnesium as well as 3 serial troponin levels were normal. Echocardiography showed normal left ventricular systolic function without wall motion abnormalities or valvular abnormalities. Coronary angiography showed a 50% stenosis of the left circumflex artery. Instant wave-free ratio across the stenosis was 1.0.

7. Early Repolarization Syndrome
8. Congenital Heart Block
9. Coronary Artery Disease-induced Ventricular Tachycardia

### Reranked differential diagnosis:
1. Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT)
   - Justification: Recurrent episodes of polymorphic VT especially at rest, PVCs present, normal cardiac structure, and normal electrolytes strongly suggest CPVT.
2. Brugada Syndrome
   - Justification: Occurrence of polymorphic VT in the absence of structural heart disease raises suspicion for Brugada Syndrome, even with a normal ECG.
3. Long QT Syndrome
   - Justification: Given that the patient has normal electrolytes and there's no clear QT prolongation seen, it's considered less likely.
4. Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)
   - Justification: Could explain VT and PVCs in a structurally normal appearing heart, though some common diagnostic features are missing.
5. Early Repolarization Syndrome
   - Justification: While typically benign, could rarely cause arrhythmias.
6. Idiopathic Ventricular Tachycardia
   - Justification: PVCs and nonsustained VT episodes especially with a structurally normal heart may suggest idiopathic VT.
7. Coronary Artery Disease-induced Ventricular Tachycardia
   - Justification: Though coronary stenosis is mild and likely not ischemic, cannot completely rule out cardiac arrhythmias due to CAD.
8. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
   - Justification: Considered here due to unexplained VT, but absence of hypertrophy on echocardiogram makes it unlikely.
9. Electrolyte Imbalances
   - Justification: Normal lab results make this unlikely.
10. Congenital Heart Block
    - Justification: Would typically manifest differently, presence of PVCs and VT makes it the least likely in this presentation.","['Cardiology', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Rhythm Disorders']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,60.0,F

### INPUT:
An 80-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 5-day history of fever and right shoulder pain. Her temperature was 37.9 °C (100.2 °F); heart rate, 74/min; and blood pressure, 90/49 mm Hg. She had tenderness to palpation and decreased range of motion of her right shoulder. Laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 9.6 ×  109/L (reference, 4.0-9.0 × 109/L); C-reactive protein level, 35.6 mg/dL (reference, <0.3 mg/dL), and creatine kinase level, 1036 U/L (17.30 μkat/L) (reference, 60-270 U/L [1.00-4.51 μkat/L]). Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an effusion and synovial thickening with enhancement in the right shoulder joint and inflammation in the right subscapularis muscle. Gram stain of the synovial fluid revealed gram-positive cocci in clusters. Intravenous cefazolin therapy was initiated, and she underwent right shoulder joint arthroscopic irrigation, synovectomy, and surgical drainage for subscapularis pyomyositis. Blood and synovial fluid cultures grew methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and intravenous cefazolin was continued. One week after hospitalization, the patient developed asymptomatic black discoloration of the dorsal surface of her tongue (Figure). She reported no prior lingual discoloration and did not smoke cigarettes, use chewing tobacco or illicit drugs, or drink alcohol.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Black hairy tongue (lingua villosa nigra),"1. **Septic Arthritis**  
   Initial presentation of fever, shoulder pain, and imaging findings suggest joint infection.

2. **Pyomyositis**  
   Inflammation in the subscapularis muscle and laboratory findings indicate muscle infection.

3. **Staphylococcus Aureus Infection**  
   Gram stain reveals gram-positive cocci in clusters, and cultures confirm methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus.

4. **Aspiration Pneumonia**  
   Evaluation for possible aspiration leading to pneumonia due to altered mental status or swallowing difficulties commonly considered with infectious presentations in elderly.

5. **Rheumatoid Arthritis with Superimposed Infection**  
   Tenderness and joint effusion could suggest an underlying rheumatoid arthritis exacerbated by infection.

6. **Osteomyelitis**  
   Consideration for bone involvement in chronic infections, particularly in elderly individuals.

7. **Gout**  
   Acute joint pain and inflammation could mimic gout, though infection is more likely with fever and radiological findings.

   Common in elderly with proximal muscle pain and stiffness, although usually lacks fever and high CRP.

9. **Neisseria Gonorrhoeae Infection**  
   Less common at this age, but would be considered in joint infections, ruled out after culture results.

10. **Tongue Discoloration (Black Hairy Tongue)**  
   Unrelated but developed after antibiotic treatment; common benign condition due to elongation of papillae on the tongue.

4. **Tongue Discoloration (Black Hairy Tongue)**  
   Documentation of post-antibiotic therapy tongue discoloration, unrelated to primary infection.

5. **Rheumatoid Arthritis with Superimposed Infection**  
   Considered for differential but not supported by additional diagnostic criteria.

6. **Polymyalgia Rheumatica**  
   Included due to age-related risk but ruled out due to more acute presentation and infection confirmation.

7. **Aspiration Pneumonia**

### INPUT:
A 72-year-old man was referred for an eye examination because of visual changes in the left eye. His medical history was notable for end-stage kidney disease requiring a kidney transplant at age 50 years and a second transplant at age 65 years. He had received his medical care at outside facilities, the records of which were not available. He could not recall being given any precise diagnosis but reported having proteinuria since age 7 years. His other medical conditions included hyperlipidemia, arterial hypertension, and pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex infection. He was taking tacrolimus, amlodipine, atorvastatin, ethambutol, rifampin, and clarithromycin. His family history was unremarkable. He had 2 healthy adult children. One year after the first kidney transplant, he noted an inferior visual field defect in the left eye and was diagnosed with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Several years later, he underwent uncomplicated bilateral cataract procedures. Visual acuity with distance correction was 20/25 OD and 20/30 OS. Color vision was 14/14 plates for each eye. There was a left relative afferent pupillary defect. Confrontation visual field was full for the right eye and demonstrated an inferior defect for the left eye. External and slitlamp examinations were notable only for bilateral pseudophakia. Both optic discs were anomalous in appearance, with central excavation in the left eye greater than the right eye (Figure). The remainder of the posterior pole examination, including the retinal vessels, appeared normal in both eyes.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Papillorenal syndrome due to a PAX2 gene variant,"1. **Nonarteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION):** The patient has a history of NAION in the left eye, which can cause inferior visual field defects and a relative afferent pupillary defect, consistent with the clinical findings.

2. **Glaucoma:** The presence of central excavation of the optic discs bilaterally and a relative afferent pupillary defect in the left eye could suggest glaucomatous optic neuropathy.

3. **Optic Disc Drusen:** The appearance of anomalous optic discs with central excavation might be associated with optic disc drusen, which can lead to visual field defects.

4. **Optic Neuritis:** Although less likely given the patient’s age and history, optic neuritis could present with visual field defects and an afferent pupillary defect.

5. **Compressive Optic Neuropathy:** A space-occupying lesion could cause optic nerve compression, leading to visual field defects and central excavation of the disc.

6. **Ocular Ischemic Syndrome:** Given his history of hypertension and vascular risk factors, there could be ischemia affecting the retinal circulation.

7. **Inherited Optic Neuropathy:** Although the patient’s family history is unremarkable, conditions like Leber hereditary optic neuropathy could cause bilateral optic disc anomalies.

8. **Drug-induced Optic Neuropathy:** Long-term use of certain medications like ethambutol can lead to optic neuropathy.

9. **Diabetic Retinopathy (Silent)**: The patient’s medical history does not explicitly note diabetes, but given vascular and renal disease, undiagnosed diabetes could have resulted in early retinopathy changes affecting vision.

10. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO):** Though not a classic presentation, CRVO can cause disc excavation and visual field defects due to resultant retinal ischemia.

### Final Differential Diagnosis List (Re-Ranked):

1. **Nonarteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION)**
2. **Glaucoma**
3. **Optic Disc Drusen**

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy male patient in his late 20s was seen with a 2-year history of multiple, slowly growing, infiltrated erythematous-violaceous patches and plaques, with occasional slight pain extending from his left upper arm to the left side of his chest. No triggers, such as local infection, insect bite, or trauma, occurred before the appearance of the lesions. He denied fever, weight loss, or fatigue. Physical examination showed multiple firm, nonscaly, purple erythematous patches and plaques with irregular borders on his left axilla, medial upper arm, and lateral thoracic region (Figure, A). No extracutaneous involvement was observed. A skin biopsy specimen was obtained from the left side of his chest for histopathological examination (Figure, B and C).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Microvenular hemangioma,"1. **Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL)** - Given the presentation of erythematous-violaceous patches and plaques, CTCL should be considered as it can present with similar skin lesions.

2. **Sarcoidosis** - This is characterized by granulomatous inflammation that can present as erythematous or violaceous skin plaques and patches.

3. **Lupus erythematosus** - Specifically, discoid lupus erythematosus which can present with similar skin manifestations.

4. **Lichen planus** - Known for violaceous, flat-topped papules and plaques, although typically pruritic, lichen planus should be considered.

5. **Granuloma annulare** - Presents with annular erythematous plaques which could be mistaken for similar skin lesions.

6. **Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP)** - A rare soft tissue sarcoma that begins in the dermis and presents with firm skin nodules or plaques.

7. **Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (PLEVA)** - Causes erythematous papules that can transform into necrotic lesions, potentially resembling the described presentation.

8. **Morphea (localized scleroderma)** - Presents with sclerotic, often violaceous skin changes primarily involving the dermis.

9. **Necrobiosis lipoidica** - Typically associated with diabetes and characterized by shiny, atrophic, erythematous, and violaceous plaques.

10. **Fixed drug eruption** - Persistent or recurrent erythematous to violaceous plaques in response to medication.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL)** - Highest suspicion based on the clinical presentation of patches and plaques and age group.
2. **Sarcoidosis** - Due to the chronic nature of the lesions and similar skin findings.
3. **Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP)** - Nonscaly, firm nature of lesions.
4. **Lupus erythematosus** - Plausible due to similar erythematous-violaceous patches.
5. **Lichen planus** - Although less likely due to the absence of pruritus and typical presentation.
6. **Morphea (localized scleroderma)** - Consistent with the appearance, but absence of sclerosis de-emphasizes this option.
7. **Granuloma annulare** - Lesions don't form in annular patterns typically seen in granuloma annulare.
8. **Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (PLEVA)** - Acute course less compatible with the 2-year history.

His medical history included esophageal atresia, small bowel obstruction, mild cognitive impairment, low tone, and increased reflexes. Prenatal history was complicated by insulin-controlled gestational diabetes and polyhydramnios. His ocular history was notable for eye movement abnormalities since birth. He had no family history of ocular disease. On examination, his visual acuity was 20/150 OU and did not improve with correction (right eye, −1.50 [2.00] × 180; left eye, −1.00 [1.50] × 180). Pupillary responses were normal. Alternating vertical and torsional nystagmus was noted (Figure 1). Specifically, 1 eye was noted to rise and intort while the other would fall and extort, followed by reversal of the vertical and torsional components in the opposite eye (Video). The optic nerve and foveal reflexes were normal in both eyes. Flash visual evoked potential (VEP) demonstrated strong ipsilateral activity of the occipital lobe.

2. Lawrence Moon Biedl Syndrome - Considered due to mixed developmental and systemic findings, though lacks polydactyly or obesity.
3. Möbius Syndrome - Due to the ocular movement disorder, although typically involves facial nerve palsy.
4. Ataxia-Telangiectasia - Due to eye movement disorders and cognitive impairment, although teleangiectasia and immunodeficiency are missing.
5. Oculocutaneous Albinism - Based on nystagmus, although skin and hair depigmentation were not noted.
6. Congenital Fibrosis of the Extraocular Muscles - Due to abnormal nystagmus pattern.
7. Duane Retraction Syndrome - Because of atypical eye movement but differs in nystagmus description.
8. Angelman Syndrome - Due to behavioral and cognitive symptoms with potential motor issues, lacks classic happy demeanor.
9. Spasmus Nutans - Rare for age and nystagmus resolution pattern is different.

### INPUT:
A 28-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 5-day history of bilateral blurry vision, eye redness, discharge, photophobia, and pain. He also reported rhinorrhea and lethargy. His medical history included Leber congenital amaurosis treated with voretigene neparvovec (Luxturna; Spark Therapeutics) 8 years ago, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) diagnosed 6 months prior to presentation treated with cytarabine and idarubicin. His latest chemotherapy was 3 weeks before presentation, and a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) was removed 2 weeks ago. A complete blood cell count was ordered, revealing anemia, neutropenia, lymphocytopenia, and monocytopenia in the setting of recent chemotherapy. Blood cultures were drawn, and results were pending at the time of presentation. His ophthalmic examination showed visual acuity of 20/800 OD and 20/400 OS, decreased from his baseline of 20/200 OU. Intraocular pressures were 37 mm Hg OD and 31 mm Hg OS. Slitlamp examination revealed chemosis, conjunctival hyperemia, and microcystic corneal edema bilaterally. There were more than 20 cells per high-power field of 1 mm × 1 mm beam, with fibrin bilaterally and 2.5-mm hypopyon in the right eye and 2.7-mm hypopyon in the left eye (Figure 1). Posterior segment examination was limited because of corneal edema and anterior inflammation, but there were no vitreous opacities on B-scan ultrasonography.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Bilateral anterior uveitis with pseudohypopyon in the setting of AML infiltration,"1. **Endophthalmitis** - Considering the recent chemotherapy and PICC line, and presence of hypopyon with severe anterior chamber inflammation suggestive of possible infectious origin.
   
2. **Uveitis** - Given photophobia, pain, and anterior chamber inflammation with hypopyon but needs further evaluation to exclude infectious causes first.

3. **Toxic anterior segment syndrome (TASS)** - Possible contamination or immune reaction post-chemotherapy can cause inflammation similar to uveitis but non-infectious.

4. **Acute glaucoma** - Due to extremely elevated intraocular pressures, which could be secondary to inflammatory processes affecting the eye such as angle closure or neovascularization.

5. **Mycotic (fungal) keratitis** - Could result from immunocompromised state and presents with corneal edema and discharge, but typically more localized lesion than diffuse anterior chamber inflammation.

6. **Herpes simplex keratouveitis** - Past medical history of ocular involvement due to viral infection could have predisposed to secondary uveitis, though viral keratitis lesions would be more focal.

7. **Hematopoietic malignancy-related ocular manifestations** - Rarely, AML can have direct ocular involvement manifesting as anterior segment inflammation.

8. **Cytomegalovirus retinitis** - Unlikely given lack of posterior segment opacities but potential in severely immunocompromised patients could warrant consideration.

9. **Bacterial conjunctivitis with keratitis** - While symptoms point to a more severe infectious process, simple bacterial conjunctivitis could escalate in neutropenic patients.

10. **Drug-induced ocular toxicity** - Though typically dose-dependent and less acute, chemotherapeutic agents could cause direct ocular toxicity leading to inflammation and visual disturbances.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Endophthalmitis** - High suspicion given recent PICC line, neutropenia, and profound inflammatory signs in the anterior chamber.
2. **Toxic anterior segment syndrome (TASS)** - Non-infectious inflammation post chemotherapy or instrument contamination.
3. **Uveitis** - Needs to be considered if no infectious cause is found, autoimmune or para-inflammatory.
4. **Acute glaucoma** - Important consideration due to high intraocular pressure.
5. **Mycotic (fungal) keratitis** - Use of immunosuppressant treatment increases risk, warrants closer inspection.
6. **Herpes simplex keratouveitis** - Persistent differential when infectious etiology is considered.
7. **Hematopoietic malignancy-related ocular manifestations** - Direct involvement of AML as a systemic disease.
8. **Bacterial conjunctivitis with keratitis** - Rule this out early by culture results and further examinations.
9. **Cytomegalovirus retinitis** - Less likely but possible in severe immune suppression cases.
10. **Drug-induced ocular toxicity** - Lower in list due to acute presentation and severity of symptoms.","['Hematology', 'Oncology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Leukemias']",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,28.0,F

### INPUT:
A 95-year-old man presented to the emergency department with 24 hours of abdominal pain, 2 weeks of diarrhea, and 3 months of intermittent abdominal bloating and anorexia. He was a farmer in rural Japan who did not drink alcohol and had been diagnosed with bullous pemphigoid 8 months prior, initially treated with prednisolone (15 mg daily). His medications at presentation were prednisolone (8 mg daily) and lansoprazole. He had experienced 1 episode of dyspnea on exertion 2 weeks before presentation but reported no fevers, cough, wheeze, nausea or vomiting, hematochezia, or melena. In the emergency department, his temperature was 37.7 °C (99.9 °F); blood pressure, 110/56 mm Hg; heart rate, 125/min; and oxygen saturation, 95% on room air. On physical examination his lungs were clear to auscultation, and his abdomen was diffusely tender to palpation without rebound. Skin examination revealed purpuric macules and small thumbprint-like patches on the upper abdomen and central chest (Figure 1).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Disseminated strongyloidiasis,"Step 1: **Pseudomembranous Colitis (C. difficile Infection)** - Considering the recent diarrhea and the use of corticosteroids, which could predispose to infections including C. difficile.

Step 2: **Small Bowel Obstruction** - Intermittent abdominal bloating and anorexia over months suggest possible bowel obstruction causes, like adhesions or hernias.

Step 3: **Ischemic Colitis** - Given the patient's age and the presentation of abdominal pain with diarrhea, ischemic colitis is a plausible hypothesis.

Step 4: **Infective Gastroenteritis** - Diarrhea and abdominal pain could be symptoms of an infectious cause, possibly exacerbated by the patient's older age and immunosuppressed state.

Step 5: **Adrenal Insufficiency (Secondary to Long-term Steroid Use)** - Chronic steroid use, alongside symptoms of anorexia and abdominal pain, suggest possible adrenal insufficiency.

Step 6: **Diverticulitis** - Diffuse tenderness and diarrhea could be symptomatic of diverticulitis, common in older adults.

Step 7: **Peptic Ulcer Disease** - Previous medication includes lansoprazole, suggesting treatment for gastric conditions like peptic ulcers.

Step 8: **Mesenteric Ischemia** - Severe abdominal pain and anorexia are key symptomatic matches for mesenteric ischemia, especially in the elderly.

Step 9: **Systemic Vasculitis** - The patient's history of bullous pemphigoid and skin findings could suggest a systemic vasculitis involving the gastrointestinal tract.

Step 10: **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - Unexplained chronic symptoms such as abdominal bloating, diarrhea, and skin changes raise suspicion for a paraneoplastic process.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Mesenteric Ischemia** - Due to advanced age and severe symptoms.
2. **Ischemic Colitis** - Fits the symptom profile and age group.
3. **Pseudomembranous Colitis (C. difficile Infection)** - Recent corticosteroid use and diarrhea suggest risk.
4. **Systemic Vasculitis** - Given skin findings and history of autoimmune disease.
5. **Diverticulitis** - Common in this age group with the presentation.
6. **Small Bowel Obstruction** - Fits the symptom of bloating and chronicity.
7. **Adrenal Insufficiency (Secondary to Long-term Steroid Use)** - Possible due to long-term steroid therapy.
8. **Peptic Ulcer Disease** - Presence of lansoprazole suggests consideration.
9. **Infective Gastroenteritis** - Though less likely given symptom duration and context.
10. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - Considered due to unexplained chronic symptoms, but less likely without more specific signs.","['Global Health', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Dermatology', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,95.0,F

### INPUT:
A 7-year-old boy was referred to the otolaryngology clinic by his pediatrician for a left pharyngeal lesion. His parents noted the lesion 18 months prior. It remained stable in size and was asymptomatic. He denied sore throat, dysphagia, and dyspnea. He was otherwise healthy with no history of recurrent pharyngitis. On examination, his vital signs were within normal limits. He was comfortable with no noted stridor and tolerated his oral secretions. His oropharyngeal examination was notable for size 2+ palatine tonsils without exudate and a white mass on the posterior tonsillar pillar. He did not tolerate palpation of the lesion. There was no palpable cervical adenopathy, and his lungs were clear to auscultation. No laboratory work or imaging were performed. The patient was taken to the operating room for an excisional biopsy. There, a more thorough gross examination of the lesion was notable for a pedunculated, white rubbery mass arising from the left posterior tonsillar pillar with a narrow mucosal stalk (Figure, A).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Hairy pharyngeal polyp,"1. **Squamous papilloma** - Given the presentation of a white mass that is stable and asymptomatic, a squamous papilloma is a potential benign cause of such lesions.

2. **Fibroma** - Considering the rubbery texture and pedunculated nature, a fibroma which is a benign fibrous tumor is another differential.

3. **Epidermoid cyst** - A well-circumscribed, pedunculated lesion such as described could also suggest an epidermoid cyst, a benign and common lesion in this region.

4. **Tonsillar retention cyst** - A retention cyst might present as a white lesion possible in the oropharyngeal area without symptoms.

5. **Mucocele** - Another possibility is a mucocele, although more common in oral mucosa, it can occur in other oral structures.

6. **Lymphangioma** - This could present as a benign, asymptomatic mass with a rubbery feel upon examination.

7. **Teratoma** - While less common, an oropharyngeal teratoma could manifest as a stable mass in this age group.

8. **Hemangioma** - Although often more red or blue, hemangiomas can sometimes appear white and asymptomatic in nature.

9. **Rhabdomyoma** - This benign soft tissue tumor could possibly occur in this location and present as a white, rubbery mass.

10. **Lipoma** - A lipoma can also present as a pedunculated mass and could appear white if superficial.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
After considering the benign nature, asymptomatic presentation, and characteristics of the mass, the differential diagnoses should be reassessed as follows:

1. Squamous papilloma
2. Fibroma
3. Epidermoid cyst
4. Tonsillar retention cyst
5. Mucocele
6. Lymphangioma
7. Rhabdomyoma

### INPUT:
A 74-year-old woman with a history of multiple squamous cell carcinomas that were treated with Mohs micrographic surgery presented with a tender, enlarging scalp lesion of 6 months’ duration. Skin examination revealed a 5-mm bright pink, dome-shaped papule with overlying vessels located at the crown of the scalp (Figure, A). There was no purulent discharge or overlying skin changes. A shave skin biopsy was performed and submitted for histopathologic analysis (Figure, B-D).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Malignant myopericytoma,"1. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC):** Given the patient's age, history of skin cancers, and the described appearance of the scalp lesion, BCC is a possible diagnosis.

2. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC):** Although previously treated, recurrence or a new SCC could present similarly on the scalp.

3. **Keratoacanthoma:** This presents as a rapidly growing dome-shaped papule which can look similar to SCC.

4. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma:** A rare but aggressive skin cancer that could present as an enlarging, dome-shaped papule.

5. **Amelanotic Melanoma:** Although less common, it's important to consider melanoma, particularly given the patient's age and lesion characteristics.

6. **Dermatofibroma:** Typically benign, could present as a firm papule but less likely given the tenderness and rapid growth.

7. **Pyogenic Granuloma:** Often presents as a small, red, rapidly growing lesion, though tenderness may vary.

8. **Sebaceous Hyperplasia:** While usually not tender or rapidly enlarging, it is a potential benign condition that should be considered.

9. **Angiosarcoma:** A rare malignant vascular tumor that could present as a dome-shaped papule with overlying vessels.

10. **Lichen Planus-like Keratosis:** A benign lesion that might mimic other more serious conditions, though typically less tender.

### Final Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC):** Given the patient's history and lesion characteristics.
2. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC):** Common and fits the description of the lesion.
3. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma:** Due to the aggressive nature, it's crucial to rule out.
4. **Keratoacanthoma:** Considered due to its presentation, though usually not tender.
5. **Amelanotic Melanoma:** The potential seriousness warrants high consideration.
6. **Angiosarcoma:** Due to the vascular characteristics and patient's age.
7. **Pyogenic Granuloma:** Less likely but possible given rapid enlargement.
8. **Sebaceous Hyperplasia:** Unlikely considering the described presentation.

### INPUT:
A woman in her late 50s was released from a tertiary hospital with an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock with onset 6 days before admission. On admission, vital signs showed blood pressure as 98/66 mm Hg while receiving dobutamine and norepinephrine from the referral hospital, a regular heart rate of 90 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, peripheral oxygen saturation 96% nasal oxygen at 3 L per minute, and a temperature of 36.7° C. Echocardiography showed reduced left ventricle systolic function (estimated ejection fraction, 34%) and hypokinesia of the anteroseptal, anterior, anterolateral, and septal walls. Lung ultrasound demonstrated multiple B-lines in both lung fields. Diagnostic coronary angiography revealed a total occlusion in the left main coronary artery. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was successful in opening the osteal left main and drug-eluting stents were placed in the left main and left anterior descending arteries. Following PCI, the patient had episodes of supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Electrical cardioversion was performed and a loading dose of amiodarone was administered. Chest radiography during the loading dose of amiodarone showed infiltrates in both lung fields (Figure 1A). While in the intensive cardiovascular care unit, maintenance doses of amiodarone were continued because of episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, and torsades de pointes. On the third day of hospitalization, despite adequate diuresis, the chest radiography showed persistent pulmonary edema. Chest computed tomography showed a reticular pattern predominantly in the perihilar area with consolidation and diffuse ground-glass opacity in both lung fields (Figure 1B). In addition, hemodynamic evaluation and lung ultrasound showed no congestion and laboratory markers, including a procalcitonin level of 0.01 ng/mL, and ruled out an infectious etiology.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Acute amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity,"1. **Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS):** Given the diffuse ground-glass opacities in both lung fields and lack of infectious cause, ARDS is a potential diagnosis.

2. **Amiodarone-induced Pulmonary Toxicity:** The patient was on a loading and maintenance dose of amiodarone with infiltrates developing during this period, suggesting drug-induced pulmonary toxicity.

3. **Pulmonary Edema secondary to Heart Failure:** The chest radiography showed persistent pulmonary edema, and heart failure post-myocardial infarction may contribute to this clinical picture.

4. **Pulmonary Embolism:** While less likely due to low oxygen requirement and absence of right heart strain, it remains a consideration in post-MI patients.

5. **Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage:** The reticular pattern and opacities could be suggestive of alveolar hemorrhage, which requires further investigation.

6. **Interstitial Lung Disease exacerbation:** Pre-existing interstitial lung disease exacerbated by recent cardiac events or medication can present similarly.

7. **Cardiac Sarcoidosis:** Considering new-onset arrhythmias and pulmonary infiltrates, cardiac sarcoidosis is a differential.

8. **Toxic Lingitis:** Due to airway irritants or systemic drug reactions, lingitis as a side effect of medication could present with pulmonary changes.

9. **Pulmonary Vasculitis:** Autoimmune etiology could present with lung infiltrates and cardiac involvement.

10. **Aspiration Pneumonitis:** Though less likely given the clinical setting, aspiration could cause similar pulmonary findings.

### INPUT:
A patient in their mid-30s with a medical history of deceased donor kidney transplant, cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis, and CMV viremia with documented resistance to foscarnet and ganciclovir (UL97 and UL54 gene mutations) presented with new-onset floaters in both eyes. The patient was taking systemic immunosuppression but recently stopped taking maribavir because of concerns about resistance and was transitioned to cidofovir and CMV immune globulin. On clinical examination, the visual acuity measured 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. Motility, visual fields, and anterior segment examination were normal. Dilated fundus examination revealed tortuous vasculature, multiple cotton wool spots along the arcades and periphery, and granular, hypopigmented retinal lesions without hemorrhage in the macula and temporal periphery in both eyes (Figure 1A). Optical coherence tomography showed localized areas of full-thickness retinitis (Figure 1B). CMV titers indicated viremia at 2.24 million IU/mL. Despite the patient’s documented UL97 and UL54 mutations, a series of 5 biweekly intravitreal injections of foscarnet and ganciclovir were performed given their vision-threatening lesions. Retinal pathology failed to improve, and the patient eventually refused additional intravitreal therapy because of pain and transiently decreased vision after each injection.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. Cytomegalovirus Retinitis: The presentation aligns with CMV retinitis, especially considering the patient's history of CMV viremia, resistance to multiple antivirals, and the retinal findings.

2. Progressive Outer Retinal Necrosis (PORN): Could be considered given immunosuppression status and retinal involvement without much inflammation.

3. Acute Retinal Necrosis (ARN): Less likely without significant inflammation or eye pain, but still considered due to retinal necrosis.

4. Intraocular Lymphoma: This is on the differential due to the full-thickness retinal lesions and lack of response to antiviral treatment.

5. Toxoplasmosis Retinochoroiditis: Unlikely given medical history and lesion appearance, but included due to ocular involvement.

6. Syphilitic Uveitis: Possible due to systemic involvement but would expect more uveitis symptoms and serologic evidence.

7. Behçet’s Disease: Considered due to possible ocular and systemic findings, though presentation is atypical.

8. Sarcoidosis: Uncommon but considered due to ocular presentation, though systemic sarcoid symptoms are not evident.

9. Multiple Sclerosis-associated Uveitis: Less likely given age and presentation, but possible if MS diagnosis was new.

10. Birdshot Chorioretinopathy: Usually older onset and different appearance, but considered due to bilateral involvement.","['Ophthalmology', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Surgery', 'Transplantation', 'Renal Replacement']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,35.0,U

A 42-year-old woman with hypertension, type 2 diabetes diagnosed at age 25 years, and gastroparesis presented to the emergency department with right lower extremity blisters that had developed spontaneously over the prior 36 hours. She reported a tingling sensation in the affected area but no pruritus or pain. She had no history of leg trauma and no chemical or extreme temperature exposure. Medications included insulin lispro (sliding scale 3 times daily) and insulin glargine (20 units nightly). On physical examination, she was afebrile and had normal vital signs. Her extremities were warm with palpable distal pulses. Hyperpigmented macules were present on the anterior lower legs below the knees, and tense bullae were present on the anterior aspect of the right lower extremity, dorsal foot surface, and toes (Figure). There was no surrounding erythema or edema, and findings on the remainder of the skin and mucocutaneous examination were unremarkable. Laboratory testing revealed a blood glucose level of 375 mg/dL (20.81 mmol/L) and hemoglobin A1c level of 9.8%. Results of a basic metabolic panel and complete blood cell count were within reference range except for mild anemia (hemoglobin level, 10.9 g/dL).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Bullosis diabeticorum,"1. **Bullous Diabetic Dermopathy** - Considering the patient's long-standing history of diabetes, the spontaneous development of tense bullae is suggestive of diabetic bullae.

2. **Bullous Pemphigoid** - An autoimmune blistering disorder that can present with tense bullae, although it is more commonly associated with pruritus.

3. **Epidermolysis Bullosa** - A group of genetic conditions causing skin fragility, resulting in blister formation from minor trauma or friction.

4. **Porphyria Cutanea Tarda** - Characterized by blistering in sun-exposed areas, often associated with liver disease and may manifest in diabetes.

5. **Pemphigus Vulgaris** - While this condition presents with flaccid rather than tense bullae, it is a differential to consider for blistering disorders.

6. **Venous Stasis Dermatitis** - Chronic venous insufficiency can result in skin changes and blister formation, typically accompanied by edema.

7. **Contact Dermatitis** - Generally associated with erythema and pruritus, but occasionally severe reactions can cause bullae.

8. **Fixed Drug Eruption** - Recurrent and localized reactions to medications can result in bullous lesions.

9. **Erythema Multiforme** - A hypersensitivity reaction noted for its target lesions and, in severe cases, blistering.

10. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis** - Severe mucocutaneous reactions primarily due to drugs or infections, presenting with widespread blistering often following systemic symptoms.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Bullous Diabetic Dermopathy** - Given the patient's uncontrolled diabetes, characteristic lesion presentation, and absence of pain or pruritus.
2. **Porphyria Cutanea Tarda** - Due to the presence of blistering in typical areas and the association with diabetes.
3. **Bullous Pemphigoid** - Despite the lack of pruritus, tense bullae warrant consideration of this autoimmune disorder.
4. **Venous Stasis Dermatitis** - Skin changes without significant edema might still suggest venous involvement.
5. **Epidermolysis Bullosa** - While less likely given the age of onset, it remains a genetic consideration.
6. **Pemphigus Vulgaris** - Unlikely due to the tension of bullae, but not impossible.
7. **Contact Dermatitis** - Unlikely due to absence of distinct exposure history and typical erythema/pruritus.
8. **Fixed Drug Eruption** - Less likely given the patient's consistent medication routine with no recent introductions.
9. **Erythema Multiforme** - Low likelihood due to presenting features not matching classic lesions.
10. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/TEN** - Highly unlikely due to mild presentation and lack of systemic symptoms.","['Dermatology', 'Diabetes', 'Diabetes and Endocrinology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,42.0,M

She had undergone laser retinopexy for retinal tears in her right eye and a scleral buckle and vitrectomy for a retinal detachment in her left eye 1 year earlier. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/40 OD and counting fingers OS. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 14 mm Hg in the right eye and 44 mm Hg in the left eye. Anterior segment examination of the right eye was unremarkable, while ophthalmoscopic examination showed vascular attenuation and treated retinal breaks. In the left eye, microcystic corneal edema and Descemet membrane folds limited examination, but no residual lenticular fragments or neovascularization of the iris or angle were seen. The patient was discharged taking timolol, dorzolamide, brimonidine, and prednisolone. Twelve days later, the cornea had cleared and IOP in the left eye improved to 32 mm Hg. Gonioscopy revealed 360° of anterior synechiae and complete angle closure, which was documented on ultrasound biomicroscopy (Figure 1).

2. **Thyroglossal duct cyst:** Another congenital neck mass, but typically midline rather than supraclavicular.

3. **Lymphatic malformation (e.g., cystic hygroma):** Usually presents as a soft, compressible mass, often in the posterior triangle of the neck.

4. **Dermoid cyst:** Typically presents as a midline mass but can occur laterally. Often has a firmer consistency.

5. **Fibromatosis colli:** A rare condition associated with torticollis, usually noted in infants.

6. **Neurofibroma:** A peripheral nerve tumor that is firm, well-circumscribed, and can present as a palpable mass.

7. **Rhabdomyosarcoma:** A malignant tumor of mesenchymal origin found in children, presenting as a painless mass.

8. **Lymphoma:** While typically associated with lymphadenopathy, a primary neck mass could occur.

9. **Lipoma:** Although usually soft, a fibrous lipoma variant can present as a firm, well-circumscribed mass.

10. **Ectopic thyroid tissue:** Rare, but can present as a neck mass outside the usual gland location.

### Reranking after further analysis:
1. **Branchial cleft cyst:** Due to location and presentation, still likely.
2. **Lymphatic malformation (e.g., cystic hygroma):** Firm, slowly enlarging mass can fit this presentation.
3. **Neurofibroma:** Firm, well-circumscribed nature aligns with presentation.
4. **Dermoid cyst:** Generally less likely due to lateral position.
5. **Rhabdomyosarcoma:** Given nonspecific presentation, should remain in differential.
6. **Lymphoma:** Given the rare presentation, unlikely but considered.
7. **Lipoma:** Unlikely due to firmness but not impossible.
8. **Ectopic thyroid tissue:** Less common, but location may fit.
9. **Thyroglossal duct cyst:** Location makes this less likely.
10. **Fibromatosis colli:** Unlikely due to age and lack of torticollis.","['Oncology', 'Pediatrics', 'Soft-Tissue Tumors']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,F

### INPUT:
A 72-year-old female patient presented with 2 days of conjunctival injection in the right eye, chemosis, eyelid edema, and pain with eye movements. Her medical history included hypothyroidism, psoriasis, and recent diagnosis of multiple myeloma, and she was taking daratumumab and zoledronic acid. She denied eye trauma, dental surgery, or sinus disease. Examination of the right eye was notable for visual acuity of 20/50, reduced ocular motility in all gazes, proptosis, and chemosis. There was no afferent pupillary defect. Examination of the left eye was unremarkable. Computed tomography of the orbits with contrast demonstrated right preseptal edema and intraorbital fat stranding of the extraconal and intraconal fat without sinus disease. Nasal endoscopy performed by the otolaryngology service showed no evidence of invasive fungal sinusitis. The patient received a single dose of intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone, then was transitioned to ampicillin-sulbactam for presumed orbital cellulitis. After 48 hours, motility, proptosis, and chemosis worsened (Figure 1A).

Step 9: Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis)

Step 10: Metastatic Disease to the Orbit

Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation (Orbital Pseudotumor) - due to worsening symptoms despite antibiotics, no sinus disease, and lack of improvement.
2. Orbital Cellulitis - initial presumed diagnosis but less likely due to worsening condition on appropriate antibiotics.
3. Thyroid Eye Disease - although less common with normal thyroid status, the presence of proptosis warrants consideration.
4. Orbital Myositis - inflammation of the muscles could explain motility issues and pain.
5. Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis - the worsening condition requires consideration of a potential vascular cause.
6. Lymphoma involving the Orbit - the patient's history of multiple myeloma suggests possible secondary neoplastic involvement.
7. Malignant Orbital Tumor - could be primary or secondary but less likely given acute presentation.
8. Metastatic Disease to the Orbit - multiple myeloma history makes metastasis possible but less acute.
9. Orbital Hemorrhage - less likely without trauma or anticoagulation.
10. Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis) - rare and no systemic symptoms.","['Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology', 'Orbit', 'Adverse Drug Events', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Myeloma']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,72.0,M

### INPUT:
A 7-year-old girl presented with a slowly growing, asymptomatic lump on her left lower neck since birth. Her parents denied any medical history of trauma, infection, or surgery. Physical examination showed a 1.3 × 0.7 × 0.6 cm, yellowish, hump-like mass with hairy surface and cartilage-like consistency on the anterior border of the lower third of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) (Figure, A). No other anomalies were observed. Ultrasonography revealed a 1.2 × 1.0 × 0.9 cm, hypoechoic, avascular, bulging nodule with an anechoic tubular structure extending to the subcutaneous fat and reaching the surface of the muscular layer. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a protuberant nodule with diffuse, slight hyperintensity on T1WI; and 2 mild hyperintense foci surrounded by hypointense tissue on fat-suppressed T2WI (Figure, B). The neck mass was completely excised under general anesthesia in the department of pediatric surgery. Intraoperatively, the mass extended into the anteromedial fascia of the left SCM and did not involve the deeper neck structures. Postoperative histopathologic analysis showed normal-appearing epidermis, multiple pilosebaceous follicles, abundant adipose tissue, and 2 centrally circumscribed segments of cartilage in the subcutis (Figure, C).

### INPUT:
A man in his late 40s was admitted to the hospital with a 40-year history of multiple hard nodules on the scalp. At 5 years of age, the patient had developed multiple subcutaneous masses in the occipital and bilateral temporal regions. At age 10, he was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis and underwent surgical resection of the tumors at a local hospital. Tumors recurred 5 years after surgery, with their size and number gradually increasing with age. Physical examination revealed scalp masses from 4 to 6 cm in diameter, with hard textures and smooth surfaces (Figure, A), and subcutaneous nodules of 1 × 1 cm to 2 × 2 cm with hard textures on the hands (Figure, B), feet, trunk, and lower extremities. The patient had no tenderness, swelling, or other skin manifestations. The patient had consanguineous parents, but no other family member, including his children, had the disease.

### Reranking using all patient information and test results:

1. Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1): Based on the patient's childhood diagnosis and recurrence of the tumors consistent with neurofibromatosis.
2. Gardner Syndrome: Due to the presence of multiple osteoma and familial tendency although not seen in the patient’s family.
3. Multiple Osteoma: Considered due to the hard nodules over the scalp.
4. Hereditary Multiple Exostosis: Possible due to subcutaneous nodules but less likely without bone involvement described.
5. Pachydermoperiostosis: Possible due to skin manifestations but less likely without clubbing or other features.
6. Proteus Syndrome: Rare condition that may present similarly but unlikely due to lack of overgrowth syndromes involved.
7. Tuberous Sclerosis Complex: Considered due to nodular skin lesions but unlikely as classic features are not described.
8. Steatocystoma Multiplex: Presents with subcutaneous nodules but these are typically softer.
9. Dermoid Cyst: Consistent with the presence but texture and location less typical.
10. Lipomatosis: Generally presents with softer nodules.

### INPUT:
A man in his mid-20s was evaluated for a history of dyspnea on exertion for 2 years. On physical examination, his pulse was 70 beats per minute, and blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg. The cardiovascular examination showed a loud S1, normal S2, and an opening snap along with a mid-diastolic, soft, rumbling murmur at the apex of the heart. The electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with left atrial enlargement. The echocardiogram showed severe mitral stenosis with a mitral valve area of 0.9 cm2 with a mean (SD) gradient of 20 (4) mm Hg. There was no evidence of any subvalvular thickening, leaflet calcification, or mitral regurgitation. The patient was taken for balloon mitral valvotomy (BMV). A 6F pigtail catheter was placed in the left ventricle via the right femoral artery. The interatrial septum was punctured using a Mullins sheath and Brockenbrough needle via the right femoral vein. Entry into the left atrium was made and confirmed with a dye injection. However, suddenly, the patient developed acute onset of dyspnea along with retrosternal chest pain. His blood pressure at the time of the event was 100/60 mm Hg, pulse was 70 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation was 96%. The catheter was pulled back into the right atrium, and chest fluoroscopy was performed (Figure; Video).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Air embolism in main pulmonary,"1. **Atrial Septal Tear** - The sudden onset of dyspnea and chest pain immediately after septal puncture could be indicative of an atrial septal tear.

2. **Pericardial Effusion with Tamponade** - A complication like pericardial effusion, potentially with tamponade, can occur following invasive cardiac procedures. 

3. **Pulmonary Embolism** - The acute dyspnea and chest pain could suggest a pulmonary embolism as a post-procedural complication.

4. **Coronary Artery Dissection** - Retropercussion injury or misguidance during catheterization could lead to coronary artery dissection.

5. **Aortic Dissection** - Though less likely in this context, manipulation of catheters might contribute to an aortic dissection.

6. **Pneumothorax** - The respiratory symptoms could be due to a pneumothorax, particularly in relation to the procedural setup.

7. **Contrast-Induced Anaphylaxis** - Immediate reactions to contrast dye used during procedures can cause acute respiratory and cardiac symptoms.

8. **Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) Creation** - Inadvertent creation of a VSD during the septal puncture could explain post-procedural symptoms.

9. **Hemothorax** - Injury leading to bleeding into the thoracic cavity can manifest similar acute symptoms.

10. **Myocardial Infarction** - While other causes are more related to the procedure, myocardial infarction must be ruled out as cardiac catheters can lead to plaque rupture.

### Reranking Differentials with Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Atrial Septal Tear** - High likelihood due to recent septal puncture and sudden symptom onset.
   
2. **Pericardial Effusion with Tamponade** - Consistent with a rapid cardiovascular complication after procedure. 

3. **Pulmonary Embolism** - Plausible due to sudden dyspnea and chest pain immediately post-procedure.

4. **Ventricular Septal Defect** - Possible inadvertent consequence of septal manipulation causing acute hemodynamic changes.

5. **Pneumothorax** - Considered due to potential procedural complications, though lower priority given acute onset without expected decrease in saturation/respiratory compromise severity.

6. **Coronary Artery Dissection** - Retropercussion presents possible, albeit less probable risk, given the procedure nature.

7. **Contrast-Induced Anaphylaxis** - Unlikely due to the lack of rapid hemodynamic instability or allergic symptomatology.

8. **Aortic Dissection** - Though potential is there, there's insufficient direct procedural risk evidence.

9. **Myocardial Infarction** - While serious, initial symptoms and clinical context suggest alternative diagnoses.

10. **Hemothorax** - Unlikely as primary cause but should still be considered in comprehensive assessment.","['Valvular Heart Disease', 'Cardiology', 'Health Care Safety']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,25.0,F

### INPUT:
A man in his 80s initially presented with numerous, primarily photodistributed, crusted, and ulcerated plaques of the trunk and extremities. He had a medical history of essential thrombocytosis (ET), which was treated with hydroxyurea for 14 years, with a total cumulative dose of approximately 2500 g. He was otherwise reasonably well and denied any other constitutional symptoms. The ulcerations had slowly increased in number and size over several years and were quite painful (Figure, A-C). He did have a medical history of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSCa), which had previously been treated surgically. Several tangential shave biopsies were performed to help clarify the patient’s diagnosis.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Hydroxyurea-induced squamous dysplasia,"1. **Hydroxyurea-induced dermopathy**  
   - Hydroxyurea is associated with various dermatological side effects, including ulcerations and skin changes, particularly in sun-exposed areas.

2. **Nodular basal cell carcinoma (NBCC)**  
   - Considering his history of nonmelanoma skin cancer, recurrence or development of new basal cell carcinomas could be considered.

3. **Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)**  
   - History of skin cancer and extensive sun exposure warrant this differential with skin ulcers.

4. **Cutaneous vasculopathy**  
   - Drug-related vasculopathy, often linked to hydroxyurea use, can cause skin ulcers and patches.

5. **Psoriasis exacerbation**  
   - Rarely, hydroxyurea can lead to exacerbation of psoriasis-like conditions in photodistributed areas.

6. **Actinic keratosis**  
   - Chronic sun exposure can cause actinic keratosis, which can present as crusted or ulcerated plaques.

7. **Leukocytoclastic vasculitis**  
   - A small vessel vasculitis presenting with palpable purpura or ulcerations is a possibility in an older adult.

8. **Chronic radiation dermatitis**  
   - Given past treatments potentially involving radiation, these lesions can appear years later in photodistributed regions.

9. **Lichen planus**  
   - Presents as purplish, itchy, flat-topped papules that may have slowly ulcerated over time due to Koebner phenomenon.

10. **Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL)**  
    - Rare, but given prolonged ulceration history, CTCL could present with similar skin lesions in elderly patients.

### INPUT:
A 56-year-old man presented at the clinic for follow-up of metastatic hormone receptor–positive, ERBB2-negative breast cancer. He had locally advanced disease that was invading the skin overlying his right breast and metastatic disease to the thoracic and lumbar spine, liver, and mediastinal, axillary, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. His disease had progressed after receiving first-line therapy with palbociclib and anastrozole. Subsequent treatments with fulvestrant and paclitaxel were also followed by progressive disease. He received treatment with capecitabine; after 6 weeks of treatment, he developed some redness on his hands and feet that resolved on its own. He then presented to the clinic with pruritic, erythematous, scaly macules and papules on his forearms, face, chest, and upper back (Figure). The rash had been present for 3 weeks and had recently worsened. His palms and soles were spared. The rash did not respond to treatment with topical clindamycin, oral solumedrol, or doxycycline. He had a history of substantial sun exposure but no history of skin cancer.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Inflammation of actinic keratoses,"Based on the patient's presentation, history, and symptoms, here is a step-by-step differential diagnosis process:

1. **Drug-Induced Rash:** Given the recent introduction of capecitabine and the symptom history, a drug-induced rash could be a primary consideration.
   
2. **Seborrheic Dermatitis:** The rash's location on the face, chest, and upper back, combined with the patient's history of skin conditions, may suggest seborrheic dermatitis.

3. **Psoriasis:** Psoriatic lesions can appear erythematous and scaly, consistent with the described rash.

4. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides):** This presents with pruritic, scaly macules and plaques, aligning with the skin symptoms.

5. **Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis):** Chronic, itchy, and scaly patches can be characteristics of eczema, particularly if exacerbated by stress or allergens.

6. **Rosacea:** Though less common on the chest and back, rosacea can present with facial redness and inflammation.

7. **Subacute Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (SCLE):** This can present with non-scarring, erythematous, scaly plaques often found on sun-exposed areas.

8. **Dermatomyositis:** Presents with a similar rash, often accompanying muscle weakness, though muscle symptoms were not described here.

9. **Pityriasis Rosea:** Characterized by a ""herald patch"" followed by a generalized rash; fits some of the described qualities but usually spares the face.

10. **Lichen Planus:** Presents as pruritic, purple, polygonal plaques and may need consideration in the differential. 

After further patient assessment and test results, the differential diagnoses are reranked as follows:

1. **Drug-Induced Rash:** Strongest initial hypothesis due to recent capecitabine treatment.
2. **Subacute Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (SCLE):** Due to history of sun exposure and characteristics of rash.
3. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides):** Considering severe pruritis and lack of response to treatment.
4. **Psoriasis:** Because of erythematous and scaly appearance.
5. **Dermatomyositis:** Even in absence of muscle weakness, it's a serious consideration.
6. **Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis):** Due to common presentation and high prevalence.
7. **Seborrheic Dermatitis:** As it matches rash distribution and characteristics.
8. **Pityriasis Rosea:** Less likely due to the sparseness of the face and description.
9. **Lichen Planus:** Due to its typical skin presentation.
10. **Rosacea:** Least likely given typical distribution and patient demographics.

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy man in his 30s presented with a painful bruise on his hand that initially appeared a few days after he sustained a twisting injury to the affected hand while participating in acroyoga 2 years before. Since the initial onset, the bruise and pain had persisted despite icing and resting the area. He denied any personal or family history of bleeding disorders. On examination, an ill-defined indurated blue-green plaque was noted on the dorsum of the left hand (Figure 1). Radiography results showed soft tissue swelling but were otherwise unremarkable. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging showed a heterogeneously fluid hyperintense and T1 heterogeneously hyperintense lesion measuring approximately 1.6 × 0.5 × 2.9 cm that was centered within the dorsal subcutaneous soft tissue of the hand. An excision was performed.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor,"1. **Hematoma**: Initial presentation of a bruise and the history of injury suggests a hematoma, especially with the persistent discoloration and pain.

2. **Ganglion cyst**: Could present as a soft tissue swelling, although typically not painful or discolored.

3. **Hemangioma**: A vascular lesion that might manifest as a discoloration on the skin, matching the blue-green plaque description.

4. **Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS)**: A condition that affects joints, possibly presenting with discoloring due to hemosiderin deposits.

5. **Foreign body granuloma**: If the twisting injury introduced a foreign material, it could explain a persistent, indurated lesion.

6. **Nodular fasciitis**: A benign condition that can appear rapidly and cause a swollen, occasionally discolored mass.

7. **Venous malformation**: Could cause persistent swelling and blue discoloration due to pooled blood.

8. **Myositis ossificans**: Though less common in the hand, it can follow trauma and lead to induration and pain.

9. **Lichen planus pigmentosus**: More typically causes skin discoloration, though not related directly to trauma.

10. **Epidermal inclusion cyst**: While usually non-discolored, trauma account for a slowly growing mass.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

Based on the detailed evaluation, including imaging and excision:

1. **Hematoma**: Persistent pain and discoloration post-trauma, consistent with the chronicity and appearance.
2. **Venous malformation**: Characteristically presents with discoloration and corresponds with MRI findings.
3. **Hemangioma**: Could present similarly with skin changes and fits MRI characteristics.
4. **Ganglion cyst**: Swelling present, but typically less discoloration.
5. **Foreign body granuloma**: Due to traumatic history and unsuspected discoloration.
6. **Nodular fasciitis**: Can develop post-injury with induration and swelling, less common discoloration.
7. **Pigmented villonodular synovitis**: Uncommon in this location but explains chronic presentation.
8. **Myositis ossificans**: Potential induration and pain post-injury.
9. **Epidermal inclusion cyst**: Unlikely due to discoloration aspect and unusual location.
10. **Lichen planus pigmentosus**: Unlikely given the trauma context and clinical characteristics.","['Dermatology', 'Soft-Tissue Tumors']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,30.0,F

    ",Immunotherapy-related inflammation,"1. **Tumor Necrosis**: The immediate onset of redness and swelling followed by drainage suggests necrosis of the tumor tissue as an initial response to immunotherapy.

2. **Immune-related Adverse Event (irAE)**: The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors can cause local inflammation and tissue changes resembling irAEs.

3. **Sterile Abscess Formation**: The formation of a white head with subsequent drainage could indicate a localized sterile abscess secondary to the inflammatory response incited by immunotherapy.

4. **Pseudoinfection**: Inflammation without evidence of infection or microbial growth can mimic infection characteristics.

5. **Pyogenic Granuloma**: Consider benign vascular lesion reaction in response to trauma or immunotherapy, although less likely given the presentation.

6. **Rapid Tumor Regression**: Swift changes in the tumor's physical characteristics might be a result of rapid tumor cell death.

7. **Lymphatic Obstruction and Inflammatory Reaction**: Swelling due to blockade or irritation of lymphatic pathways by the tumor or treatment effect.

8. **Chemical Burn Reaction**: A possible irritant reaction from topically applied medications, although the absence of related recent topical medication use makes this less likely.

9. **Carcinoma Erysipelatoides**: Cutaneous spread of carcinoma could cause similar symptoms but is not consistent with resolving spontaneous drainage without systemic symptoms.

10. **Mucositis or Radiation Recall**: Although more common with radiation, severe local immune-mediated reactions following treatment could present similarly.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Tumor Necrosis**: Most consistent with treatment effect and timeline; common with immune responses.
2. **Sterile Abscess Formation**: Likely given inflammatory response characteristics without infection.
3. **Rapid Tumor Regression**: Considered due to treatment dynamics.
4. **Immune-related Adverse Event (irAE)**: Consistent with immunotherapy side effects.
5. **Pseudoinfection**: Inflammation mimicry without infection aligns with findings.
6. **Lymphatic Obstruction and Inflammatory Reaction**: Possible but less likely without persistent swelling or systemic signs.
7. **Pyogenic Granuloma**: Less likely given pathology and timeline.
8. **Mucositis or Radiation Recall**: Possible but less pertinent due to lack of radiation.
9. **Chemical Burn Reaction**: Unlikely given the absence of recent topical agents.

### INPUT:
A school-aged girl presented with occasionally pruritic, generalized hyperkeratotic papules with central white spicules and comedo-like plugs that were in a linear distribution on her face, trunk, and extremities since birth. Some of the eruptions on her trunk had spontaneously resolved with developmental growth. There was nonconsanguineous marriage of her parents, and no family members had similar lesions. The patient was otherwise in good general health and without developmental delay. Physical examination showed generalized, linear hyperkeratotic papules with numerous central small filiform keratotic white spicules and brown plugs on the head, face, neck, trunk, and bilateral upper and lower extremities (Figure, A and B), including her palms and soles along Blaschko lines, accompanied with alopecia of the scalp and eyebrows. The examination of nails, mucosae, and teeth was unremarkable. No extracutaneous involvement was observed. Dermoscopic examination showed many central white spines on the face (Figure, C) and brown cores surrounded by yellow crater-like rings on the right palm. A skin biopsy specimen was taken from the hyperkeratotic papules with white spicules on her right thigh (Figure, D).

4. **Lichen Planus Linearis**: Considering a linear distribution of dermatologic manifestations, although the spicules and keratotic lesions are less typical.

5. **Incontinentia Pigmenti**: Although unlikely due to the absence of systemic involvement and developmental delays, its Blaschko line distribution could be worth considering.

6. **Porokeratosis of Mibelli**: Given the central white spicules, resembling cornoid lamellae, which might appear in dermoscopic findings.

7. **Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris**: Often associated with hyperkeratotic lesions, palmoplantar involvement might correlate with described dermatological features.

8. **Darier's Disease**: Noted for hyperkeratotic papules and some degree of alopecia, although often involves nail changes, worth exploring due to some fitting features.

9. **Keratosis Pilaris Atrophicans**: Involves follicular hyperkeratosis and can lead to hair loss similar to observed alopecia.

### INPUT:
A 51-year-old previously healthy woman was admitted with severe neck pain for 6 days. In the past month, she felt neck stiffness, accompanied by swelling and persistent dull pain of the upper anterior chest wall, which could be transiently relieved by taking oral ibuprofen. Six days before admission, the patient’s neck stiffness transited to an endurable dull ache. When turning her head, there was severe burning pain in the posterior neck and occiput, followed immediately by an electric shocklike numbness on ipsilateral side tongue, which led to a forced head position. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine with gadolinium on admission revealed signal abnormality in C1/C2 vertebrae (Figure 1A). In the past 3 days, with the intensification of neck pain, the patient found pustules on both hands, which gradually increased. She had no history of tobacco, alcohol, or drug misuse. On examination, she was afebrile. There was tenderness in the right sternoclavicular articulation, upper neck, post aurem, and occiput. Multiple pustules were seen in the palm and back of both hands (Figure 1B). Complete blood cell count and liver and kidney function yielded normal results, except for elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 93 mm/h and C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 5.5 mg/dL (to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10). Results of workup for rheumatic and infectious disease, including antinuclear, antineutrophil cytoplasmic and anticardiolipin antibodies, human leukocyte antigen B27, repeated blood cultures, rapid plasma reagin test, Aspergillus galactomannan antigen, brucella, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and rickettsial antibodies, were all negative. Cell count, protein, and glucose in cerebrospinal fluid were normal. Cultures of cerebrospinal fluid revealed no organisms. Whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography/computed tomography revealed no malignancy.

A 55-year-old female jazz musician with a medical history that was significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease, and obstructive sleep apnea presented with an enlarging right more than left-sided neck mass of more than 2 years’ duration. The patient was seen and evaluated by a local surgical oncologist with a working diagnosis of possible lymphoma. The growing neck mass was causing solid food dysphagia and difficulty breathing at night. She did not have any neurological deficits. On further questioning, she had a similar mass that was treated with liposuction 10 years prior. Her family history was negative for any head and neck benign or malignant disease. Her social history was negative for tobacco or alcohol use. This patient was not taking any steroid medications. Physical examination showed an enlarged right more than left-sided neck mass. It was tense but compressible to palpation. Flexible fiber-optic laryngoscopy showed a crowded oropharynx with lingual tonsil hypertrophy and narrow oropharynx and hypopharynx. An outside computed tomography scan showed diffuse symmetric fatty infiltration of the pharynx, larynx, trachea, and esophagus. A magnetic resonance imaging scan with and without contrast (Figure, A) showed extensive areas of fat deposition within the neck that bilaterally extended from the level of C1 in the retropharyngeal space to the level of the sternal notch. Given that the patient was symptomatic, surgical intervention was recommended.

A 54-year-old White man with a history of lobular breast carcinoma in situ treated with lumpectomy as well as chromophobe kidney cell carcinoma treated with partial nephrectomy was referred for evaluation of an asymptomatic, amelanotic choroidal mass in his left eye, suspicious for metastatic disease. On examination, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU and intraocular pressures were normal in both eyes at 10 mm Hg. Slitlamp biomicroscopy of the anterior chamber was within normal limits in both eyes. Dilated fundus examination revealed normal findings in the right eye and clear vitreous with a subretinal mass in the left eye inferior to the optic disc and measuring 3 × 2 mm in base. Color fundus photography of the left eye (Figure, A) showed an amelanotic lesion under the retina inferior to the optic disc and 3 mm from the foveola surrounded by a subtle orange halo. Fundus autofluorescence (Figure, B) showed the lesion to be hyperautofluorescent.

### INPUT:
A 72-year-old woman presented with mild proximal weakness developing into progressive camptocormia, head drop, and prominent dysphagia over a 2-year period. She reported a 20-kg weight loss and numbness to the ankles. Her medical history was significant for thyroid cancer treated with total thyroidectomy resulting in a chronic left accessory nerve injury, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and gout. Her medications were metformin, allopurinol, perindopril, thyroxine, and rabeprazole. She had no history of smoking and drank 3 glasses of wine per week. Her family history was unremarkable. Examination revealed significant wasting of proximal and paraspinal muscles with a flexed spine posture in the upright position (Figure 1A). She had symmetric Medical Research Council grade 4/5 weakness of neck flexion, shoulder abduction, elbow flexion and extension, and hip flexion and extension bilaterally. She had weakness of left shoulder elevation and winging of the left scapula secondary to the accessory nerve injury. Her deep tendon reflexes were normal and symmetric. Pinprick sensation was reduced in both feet.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Sporadic late-onset nemaline rod myopathy,"### Initial Differential Diagnosis (Step by Step Process)

1. **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS):** Considering the patient's age and the progressive muscle weakness with wasting, ALS is initially considered. Proximal weakness, camptocormia, head drop, and dysphagia fit this diagnosis.

2. **Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM):** Given the age, slowly progressive muscle weakness, and atrophy, especially of proximal muscles, IBM is considered.

3. **Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN):** Considering symmetric weakness and muscle wasting, with preserved reflexes and the absence of sensory loss, MMN could be a possibility.

4. **Myasthenia Gravis (MG):** Proximal muscle weakness, including neck and bulbar muscles, leans towards MG, although reflex abnormalities and sensory loss are typically absent.

5. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome:** Given the history of thyroid cancer, a paraneoplastic neurological syndrome could manifest with muscle weakness and wasting.

6. **Muscle Disorders due to Metabolic Abnormalities:** Diabetes can lead to metabolic myopathy, causing muscle weakness, but severe atrophy is less common.

7. **Spinal Muscular Atrophy late-onset (SMA):** Characterized by muscle weakness and atrophy, although less common in this age group, cannot be ruled out immediately.

8. **Cervical Spinal Cord Disease:** Could explain proximal muscle weakness and wasting, although typically involves more sensory symptoms.

9. **Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP):** Weakness, even if symmetrical, with a basis in diabetes history, potentially involving sensory changes.

10. **Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy (LGMD):** Though less common in this age group, progressive proximal muscle weakness still prompts consideration.

### Final Rerolled Differential Diagnosis

1. **Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM):** With age, proximal muscle involvement, and the slow progression pattern.
  
2. **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS):** Progressive muscle weakness and wasting given significant paraspinal muscle involvement.
  
3. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome:** Consideration with a past thyroid cancer history and progressive neurological symptoms.
   
4. **Myasthenia Gravis (MG):** Bulbar and proximal muscle involvement, though sensory loss is atypical.
  
5. **Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP):** Diabetes and sensory changes provide some basis.
  
6. **Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN):** Pure motor symptoms and sparing of reflexes might initially suggest MMN.
  
7. **Spinal Muscular Atrophy late-onset (SMA):** Despite being less common, it remains within consideration.
  
8. **Metabolic Myopathy due to Diabetes:** Accounts for weakness but sensory loss is less typical.
  
9. **Cervical Spinal Cord Disease:** Symptoms are less consistent with a central origin, but still within purview.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 80s with a history of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, permanent atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery bypass graft 10 years ago presented with recurrent presyncope and bradycardia. Review of prior physician encounters revealed reports of lightheadedness and electrocardiograms (ECGs) with atrial fibrillation with ventricular rates of 40 to 50 beats per minute. Current medications included carvedilol, 25 mg, twice daily and apixaban, 5 mg, twice daily. An ECG (Figure, A) showed atrial fibrillation with an irregular ventricular rate of around 60 beats per minute, right bundle branch block (RBBB), and left posterior fascicular block (LPFB).
### OUTPUT:
    ",RBBB with left posterior hemiblock and left arm–left leg lead reversal mimicking alternating left anterior fascicular block and LPFB (trifascicular block or Rosenbaum syndrome),"Step 1: Sick Sinus Syndrome

Given the patient's recurrent presyncope, bradycardia, and atrial fibrillation, sick sinus syndrome may be suspected due to potential dysfunction of the sinus node leading to inappropriate atrial rate and compensatory bradycardia.

Step 2: Atrioventricular (AV) Block

The combination of recurrent presyncope and bradycardia with a history of conduction disease (RBBB, LPFB) suggests the possibility of an AV block causing inappropriate heart rate response.

Step 3: Medication-Induced Bradycardia

The patient is on carvedilol, a beta-blocker that can contribute to bradycardia. In an elderly patient, drug sensitivity could lead to symptomatic bradycardia.

Step 4: Structural Heart Disease

The history of coronary artery bypass graft and heart failure indicates the potential for structural cardiac abnormalities that might cause arrhythmias or conduction disturbances contributing to bradycardia and presyncope.

Step 5: Multifactorial

An interaction of multiple factors such as medication effects, age-related degeneration, and underlying heart conditions causing the symptoms.

Step 6: Bundle Branch Block Progression

The presence of both RBBB and LPFB may suggest progression to more advanced conduction system disease that affects heart rhythm and rate, leading to presyncope and bradycardia.

Step 7: Tachy-Brady Syndrome

This condition is characterized by the alternation between fast and slow heart rates, associated with atrial fibrillation and symptomatic bradycardia.

Step 8: Coronary Artery Disease Progression

New ischemic changes or progression in pre-existing disease may be contributing to symptoms, although previously managed with bypass grafting.

Step 9: Electrolyte Imbalance

Electrolyte disturbances, particularly those affecting potassium and magnesium levels, can lead to arrhythmias and conduction issues manifesting as bradycardia.

Step 10: Autonomic Dysfunction

Changes in autonomic regulation, possibly exacerbated by age or comorbid conditions, may cause significant bradycardia and episodes of presyncope.

A 15-year-old adolescent boy who was taking an oral contraceptive presented to the emergency department with left lower quadrant abdominal pain that had developed gradually over a 3-day period. He had no associated nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hematochezia, bloating, or anorexia. He reported no precipitating factors for the pain and had no history of pregnancy, abdominal surgery, or abdominal trauma. Over the previous 2 years, the patient had experienced similar intermittent episodes of abdominal pain lasting approximately 1 week. Results from laboratory tests, upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, and an abdominal computed tomography scan performed 1 year prior to presentation were normal. In the emergency department, his vital signs were normal and his body mass index was 20.4 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters). Abdominal examination revealed no rigidity or guarding; however, a 1-cm point of maximal tenderness was identified in the left lower abdominal quadrant (Figure). During palpation of this 1-cm area, the pain increased when he lifted his head and tensed his abdominal muscles. He experienced cold hypoesthesia when an alcohol gauze pad was applied to this area and severe pain when the skin was pinched.

### INPUT:
A school-aged boy presented to the dermatology clinic with a 6-year history of hair loss and short hair. His scalp hair was relatively normal in terms of density and length at birth. Since the age of 1 year, the boy had begun to have frequent hair loss without pulling. His mother also found that his hair grew to approximately the same maximum length down to the upper neck without trimming. On clinical examination, diffuse, short, sparse, lanugolike, black hair over the scalp was found (Figure, A and B). The surface of the scalp was smooth without inflammatory changes or focal alopecic patches. No involvement of eyebrows, eyelashes, nails, teeth, or body hair was found. His intellectual performance was normal at presentation and no developmental delay had ever been noted. He denied experiencing a stressful event recently, and no habitual pulling of hair was observed by his family. Family history regarding hair loss was unremarkable.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Hypotrichosis simplex of the scalp,"Step 1: **Loose Anagen Syndrome**  
Evaluation of non-inflammatory scalp and chronic hair loss patterns in children directs towards this condition.

Step 2: **Short Anagen Syndrome**  
Consideration due to terminal hair that grows only to a certain length before shedding.

Step 3: **Congenital Hypotrichosis**  
A possibility due to early onset yet stable abnormal hair growth patterns without systemic involvement.

Step 4: **Trichorrhexis Nodosa**  
Rarely seen in children this young, but the brittle hair could result from structural weaknesses.

Step 5: **Alopecia Areata**  
Although less likely due to the lack of bald patches or inflammation, it's a potential cause of diffuse hair loss.

Step 6: **Telogen Effluvium**  
Typically following stress or systemic change, not fitting perfectly due to lack of stress history and gradual onset.

Step 7: **Traction Alopecia**  
Habitual in some ethnicities with specific hair styling practices even undetected by parents.

Step 8: **Netherton Syndrome**  
Unlikely due to no skin involvement or characteristic ichthyosis, but considered for long-standing hair issues in children.

Step 9: **Monilethrix**  
A rare, genetic hair shaft disorder noted by brittle hair and possible previous unnoticed issues.

Step 10: **Hypothyroidism**  
Systemic conditions like this can affect hair growth but are unsupported without further metabolic symptoms.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis
1. **Short Anagen Syndrome** - Best fits the hair’s inability to grow beyond a certain length without inflammatory or systemic issues.
2. **Loose Anagen Syndrome** - Common in children presenting with non-scarring hair loss.
3. **Congenital Hypotrichosis** - Consideration due to onset age with no other systemic signs.
4. **Alopecia Areata** - Unlikely due to presentation but merits contemplation.
5. **Trichorrhexis Nodosa** - Consider if structural hair problems are diagnosed.
6. **Telogen Effluvium** - Less likely but could match if minor systemic changes were overlooked.
7. **Traction Alopecia** - Consider if habitual hair styling practices are discovered upon further inquiry.
8. **Monilethrix** - Could be revealed through genetic testing or detailed hair analysis.
9. **Netherton Syndrome** - Least likely without systemic or skin symptoms.
10. **Hypothyroidism** - Requires additional information or testing to support this hypothesis.","['Dermatology', 'Genetics and Genomics', 'Hair Disorders', 'Pediatrics']",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,-1.0,F

### INPUT:
A previously healthy 6-year-old girl taking no regular medications presented to the emergency department with persistent fever and cough for 15 days. Six days prior to presentation, multiple vesiculobullous lesions appeared on her palms and soles. Three days later, she developed erythema; vesicles and erosions on her face, trunk, and limbs; erosions on her lips and oral mucosa; eyelid swelling; and blisters on her anal mucosa. On presentation, her temperature was 38.7 °C (101.7 °F); heart rate, 125/min; blood pressure, 98/50 mm Hg; and oxygen saturation, 98% on room air. Physical examination revealed bilateral exudative conjunctivitis and white exudates on her tongue, posterior pharynx, and buccal mucosa. Erosions with overlying dried blood were noted around her eyes, lips, and anal mucosa. She had targetoid erythematous papules on her face and vesiculobullous lesions on her torso and extremities (Figure). Auscultation of her lungs revealed bilateral crackles. Laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 15 000/μL (82% neutrophils); erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 39 mm/h; and C-reactive protein level, 57.1 mg/L. A computed tomography scan of the chest revealed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates. Azithromycin (10 mg/kg daily, intravenously) was started.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption (RIME),"1. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS):** The mucosal involvement, targetoid lesions, and systemic symptoms such as fever and conjunctivitis lead to a suspicion of SJS.
2. **Kawasaki Disease:** The presentation of bilateral conjunctivitis, oral mucosal changes, and rash could suggest Kawasaki disease, although typically involves coronary artery changes.
3. **Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD):** Vesiculobullous lesions on palms and soles initially suggest HFMD, but widespread distribution is less typical.
4. **Varicella (Chickenpox):** Due to the vesicular nature of the rash and systemic symptoms, varicella is considered until ruled out by absence of successive crops of lesions.
5. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection (Disseminated):** Mucocutaneous vesicular outbreaks could indicate disseminated HSV, particularly with noticeable oral and mucosal erosions.
6. **Erythema Multiforme Major:** Given the target-like lesions and mucosal involvement, EM Major becomes a possibility; however, systemic symptoms guide towards SJS.
7. **Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSSS):** The exfoliative nature of lesions could resemble SSSS, though the mucosal involvement is atypical.
8. **Mycoplasma Pneumoniae-associated rash and mucositis (MIRM):** The respiratory involvement and mucosal lesions, associated with maculopapular rash align with MIRM.
9. **Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN):** A more severe progression of SJS may be considered, but typically involves greater surface area of denudation.
10. **Viral-induced Rash (e.g., Measles):** Though less typical given the presentation, viral etiologies like measles might be considered with conjunctivitis and rash.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:

1. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS):** Consistent with widespread mucosal involvement, target lesions, and acute systemic symptoms, it remains the top differential.
2. **Mycoplasma Pneumoniae-associated rash and mucositis (MIRM):** Respiratory symptoms and mucositis make it a strong contender.
3. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection (Disseminated):** The significant mucocutaneous involvement should keep this high in consideration.
4. **Erythema Multiforme Major:** Overlaps with SJS symptomatically, despite lower systemic involvement.
5. **Varicella (Chickenpox):** Considering the vesicular component and fever, remains possible though less systemic severity noted.
6. **Kawasaki Disease:** While the presentation overlaps, lack of coronary artery involvement or typical lymphadenopathy characteristics lessen likelihood.
7. **Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSSS):** Unlikely due to prominent mucosal involvement and lack of characteristic skin peeling.
8. **Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD):** Reduced likelihood with more generalized rash not aligning perfectly with HFMD pattern.
9. **Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN):** Considered less likely due to the lesser extent of skin involvement noted.
10. **Viral-induced Rash (e.g., Measles):** Least likely due to the presence of atypical vesicular lesions.","['Dermatology', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Otolaryngology', 'Pediatrics']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,6.0,M

### INPUT:
A 16-year-old female patient developed acute-onset right-sided periorbital swelling several days after being hit in that area by a snowball. The swelling worsened over the following 3 weeks despite use of warm compresses and a course of doxycycline prescribed by her outside eye care professionals. She had progressive binocular diplopia and right periorbital pain, swelling, and redness. Blurriness of the right eye that started the week before presentation eventually caused enough concern that the patient presented to her local emergency department where magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits revealed an intraconal mass (Figure, A). She then came to our institution’s emergency department for urgent ophthalmology consultation.

### INPUT:
A South Asian female individual in her early 40s with a strong family history (FHx) of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) including premature cardiovascular events in multiple family members presented to establish care for cardiovascular risk stratification. She had no traditional risk factors for ASCVD and no cardiac symptoms or limitations. She had never smoked, was physically active, and did not take any medications. Her 10-year ASCVD risk was estimated at 1.6% (low risk) based on the pooled cohort equations (PCEs); however, she had 2 risk-enhancing factors: South Asian ancestry and a FHx of premature ASCVD. Her father had a myocardial infarction at age 39 years, and, importantly, her older brother had angioplasty with multiple stents at age 43 years. Additionally, multiple male cousins on her father’s side had coronary artery disease, the details of which were unspecified. Owing to her striking FHx of premature ASCVD, she underwent screening for elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and obtained a coronary calcium score. Her Lp(a) level was elevated at 136 nmol/L and her coronary calcium score of 137 Agatston units was notable and placed her in the 94th percentile for her age (Figure 1). She returned to the office for further counseling on what to do next about these findings.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Elevated Lp(a) in the setting of strongly positive FHx and high coronary artery calcium score for the patient’s age,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH)**  
   Given the strong family history of premature ASCVD and elevated lipoprotein(a) levels, FH should be considered as a possible inherited lipid disorder.

2. **Elevated Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] as a Primary Disorder**  
   Isolated elevated Lp(a) levels can be a genetic condition contributing to her cardiovascular risk.

3. **Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)**  
   Elevated coronary calcium score indicates subclinical atherosclerosis, suggesting the presence of coronary artery disease.

4. **Hyperlipoproteinemia Type IIa**  
   This condition, characterized by elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, could contribute to her risk given her family history.

5. **Metabolic Syndrome**  
   Although lacking traditional risk factors, underlying metabolic derangements contributing to ASCVD must be considered.

6. **Monogenic Coronary Artery Disease**  
   Given the premature nature of ASCVD events in her family, a monogenic form of coronary artery disease is a potential diagnosis.

7. **Polygenic Hypercholesterolemia**  
   A polygenic basis for her elevated atherosclerosis risk considering her background and family history.

8. **Inflammatory Vascular Disease**  
   Non-traditional vascular inflammation or autoimmune conditions enhancing ASCVD risk.

9. **Apolipoprotein A-1 Deficiency**  
   This rare genetic disorder might reduce HDL levels and increase ASCVD risk in the absence of usual risk factors.

10. **Hormonal Imbalance or Endocrine Disorder**  
   Undiagnosed endocrine disorders, such as subclinical hypothyroidism, could contribute to heart disease risk.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on All Information:

1. **Elevated Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] as a Primary Disorder**  
   Given her markedly elevated Lp(a) and the familial pattern, primary Lp(a) elevation remains a top priority.

2. **Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH)**  
   Strong familial history of ASCVD makes this a likely contributor despite low traditional risk factors.

3. **Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)**  
   Supported by her increased coronary calcium score and family history.

4. **Monogenic Coronary Artery Disease**  
   The genetic propensity due to premature ASCVD in family calls for evaluating monogenic factors.

5. **Polygenic Hypercholesterolemia**  
   There's a possibility of genetic predisposition pooling from multiple alleles contributing to the cholesterol profile.

6. **Hyperlipoproteinemia Type IIa**  
   Must be investigated with lipid panel detailing.

7. **Inflammatory Vascular Disease**  
   Less likely without traditional inflammatory symptomatology but deserves consideration in atypical presentations.

8. **Apolipoprotein A-1 Deficiency**  
   Rare but should be considered if lipid profiles suggest low HDL not explained by lifestyle.

9. **Metabolic Syndrome**  
   Currently a lower priority given the absence of characteristics typically associated with the syndrome.

10. **Hormonal Imbalance or Endocrine Disorder**  
   Least likely without accompanying clinical symptoms indicative of an underlying endocrine issue.","['Cardiac Imaging', 'Cardiovascular Risk Factors', 'Ischemic Heart Disease', 'Cardiology', 'Dyslipidemia']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,40.0,M

A 52-year-old woman with a history of severe primary open-angle glaucoma in both eyes and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in response to topical corticosteroids presented with an IOP above target of 19 to 23 mm Hg OS. She also had mild chronic macular edema in both eyes after remote cataract surgery and vitrectomy with membrane peel in both eyes. Two years prior, she underwent Baerveldt tube shunt in her left eye, and her IOP since surgery had been 8 to 14 mm Hg. Ophthalmic medications on presentation were timolol eye drops twice daily, brinzolamide-brimonidine eye drops 3 times daily, bimatoprost eye drops every night at bedtime, bromfenac eye drops once daily, and fluorometholone eye drops twice daily in both eyes. During her visit, the patient complained of severe physical exhaustion, syncopal episodes, dysphagia, and sinus congestion. On external examination, she had diffuse facial edema and erythema without proptosis. Slitlamp examination showed mild chemosis and hyperemia in both eyes and a patent Baerveldt tube ostium in the midanterior chamber with normal bleb morphology without a tense capsule. A 24-2 Humphrey visual field showed new glaucoma progression in the left eye (Figure 1).

### INPUT:
A woman in her 70s presented with a 6-month history of a rash on the left forearm, which gradually increased in severity. The patient developed a rash on the dorsal aspect of her hand half a year ago without any pain or itching discomfort and denied any history of injury or exposure to suspected pathogens prior to onset. After self-medication with topical herbal medicine, the lesions gradually spread to the forearm and fused into plaques, and ulcers often recurred on the surface. She denied any systemic symptoms and concerns. Physical examination revealed large, firm, mildly swollen erythematous plaques on the back of the left forearm with purulent discharge and crusting (Figure, A). Results of routine laboratory investigations, including complete blood cell count, biochemical profile, and chest radiography, were normal. A biopsy specimen was taken for pathological examination (Figure, B-D).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cutaneous protothecosis,"To develop a differential diagnosis for the described case, we will undertake a systematic approach step by step, considering each relevant possibility while basing decisions on patient information and any available test results.

1. **Chronic Dermatitis** - A chronic skin condition characterized by inflammation and rashes.
   
2. **Psoriasis** - A condition that presents as scaly, erythematous plaques, commonly found on the extensor surfaces and dorsal hands.
   
3. **Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - A type of skin cancer that can present with ulcerated plaques that aren't typically painful or itchy.
   
4. **Nummular Eczema** - A condition characterized by coin-shaped spots, which could fuse into plaques, though often itchy.
   
5. **Lupus Erythematosus** - An autoimmune disease that can affect the skin, typically causing erythematous rashes.
   
6. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica** - Typically occurs in individuals with diabetes, presenting as plaques which can ulcerate.
   
7. **Actinic Keratosis** - Precursor to skin cancer, it may present with crusting and ulcerative plaques.
   
8. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum** - A rare inflammatory condition characterized by painful ulcers, generally accompanied by systemic symptoms, which are denied in this case.
   
9. **Leprosy (Hansen's Disease)** - A chronic infection causing skin lesions and potentially nerve involvement, less likely due to geographical incidence.
   
10. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** - A common skin cancer, often not present with symptoms but can ulcerate.

After compiling the list, we need to use all patient information and test results for final ranking:

1. **Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - Given the age, duration, nature of ulceration, and presentation, skin cancer remains a high differential, necessitating ruling out via biopsy.
   
2. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** - Although occurring commonly, it follows closely as an ulcerated skin lesion without itching or systemic involvement.
   
3. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica** - Less common and typically associated with diabetes; still, the clinical presentation could fit with biopsy confirmation.
   
4. **Psoriasis** - Common presentation with plaques, but recurrence of ulcers decreases its likelihood.
   
5. **Chronic Dermatitis** - Chronic nature could apply, but the ulceration is atypical without itching.
   
6. **Lupus Erythematosus** - Given the possible presentation and demographics, though systemic involvement is absent.
   
7. **Actinic Keratosis** - Pre-cancerous nature fits, but ulcerations are more common as a precursor warning sign.
   
8. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum** - Considered due to ulceration but without typical systemic inflammatory signs.
   
9. **Nummular Eczema** - Usually itchy lesions; however, in rare circumstances, might necessitate biopsy confirmation.
   
10. **Leprosy (Hansen's Disease)** - Maintains low likelihood due to rarity and lack of neuropathic features. 

The differential diagnosis list prioritizes based on severity, frequency, clinical correlation with the presented symptoms and biopsy results pending.

3. Esophageal spasm - Chest pain that resolves spontaneously and mimics angina.
4. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) - Common cause of chest pain relieved without specific treatment.
5. Pericarditis - Could cause atypical chest pain, but lack of specific EKG changes and normal biomarkers lessen likelihood.
6. Aortic dissection - Sudden severe pain possible, but other symptoms like blood pressure variance not present.
7. Costochondritis - Pain lasting for a short duration at rest may not typically fit, but considered given presentation.
8. Panic attack - Stress or anxiety can cause chest pain, however recurring episodes without evident stress lessen likelihood.
9. Musculoskeletal pain - Less likely due to absence of physical examination findings pointing to musculoskeletal origin.
10. Pneumothorax - Less likely due to normal oxygen saturation and respiratory examination on room air.","['Acute Coronary Syndromes', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiothoracic Surgery', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Ischemic Heart Disease']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,46.0,M

### INPUT:
A patient in their mid-60s was referred for evaluation of a left iris pigmented lesion. The mass had been present for decades and multiple prior office visits with referring ophthalmologists, most recently 4 years prior, showed the mass remained stable in size. The patient’s ocular history included cataract extraction with intraocular lens placement and retinal tear of the right eye and cataract of the left eye. Review of systems was negative for any recent changes in health, weight loss, fever, or night sweats. Visual acuity without correction was 20/20 OD and 20/25+ OS. Intraocular pressures were normal. Slitlamp examination of the right eye was unremarkable, and the left eye had a raised pigmented iris lesion without prominent internal vasculature and with mammillations on the surface (multiple small smooth dome-shaped protuberances on the surface of the tumor). There were large pigment granules on the surface of the tumor and on the adjacent iris surrounding the mass (Figure 1A). There was no ectropion uvea or iris neovascularization. There were mild nuclear sclerotic changes across the lens in the left eye. Ultrasound biomicroscopy showed a homogeneous intrinsic iris solid tumor with a height of 1.4 mm and basal diameter of 4.1 mm, without angle or ciliary body involvement (Figure 1B).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Iris melanocytoma,"1. _Benign Iris Nevus_
   - Reasoning: Pigmented lesion stable over decades, common presentation for iris nevus.

2. _Iris Melanoma_
   - Reasoning: Considered due to the pigmented lesion with mammillations, although stability suggests lower likelihood.

3. _Iris Pigment Epithelium Cyst_
   - Reasoning: A cyst could present as a pigmented lesion, although presence of mammillations less typical.

4. _Ciliary Body Melanoma_
   - Reasoning: Despite no direct involvement, large iris lesions could occasionally arise from the ciliary body.

5. _Lisch Nodule (Neurofibromatosis Type 1)_
   - Reasoning: Usually multiple nodules, but considered due to pigmented nodules.

6. _Secondary Iris Pigmentation_
   - Reasoning: Iris pigmentation changes secondary to trauma or surgery, but not typically lesion-like.

7. _Conjunctival Melanoma with Invasion to Iris_
   - Reasoning: Hypothetical scenario given negative clinical signs for extension.

8. _Iris Metastasis_
   - Reasoning: Unlikely without systemic symptoms or history of primary malignancy.

9. _Oculodermal Melanocytosis_
   - Reasoning: Involves diffuse pigmentation and presents risk of melanoma, rarity in older onset.

10. _Iris Leiomyoma_
    - Reasoning: Rare benign muscular tumor, considered for completeness with differential pigmentation.

### Final Ranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. Benign Iris Nevus
   - Most probable given lesion stability and characteristics.

2. Iris Melanoma
   - Important to rule out due to potential severity and specific features of raised lesion.

3. Iris Pigment Epithelium Cyst
   - Possible due to location on the iris and relation to pigmentation.

   - Low likelihood given no recent trauma and specific stable lesion.

7. Ciliary Body Melanoma
   - Uncommon presentation due to lack of involvement.

8. Oculodermal Melanocytosis
   - Uncommon in age but potential precursor to melanoma.

9. Conjunctival Melanoma with Invasion to Iris

### INPUT:
A 61-year-old woman presented to our clinic with a 3-month history of rapidly growing and itchy cutaneous nodules all over the body. She denied systemic complaints such as weakness, fever, night sweats, or weight loss. Oral glucocorticoids did not show any therapeutic effect. Her medical history was remarkable for mild anemia because of untreated hemorrhoids. Physical examination revealed numerous symmetrically distributed, well-defined, erythematous skin nodules on her back, buttocks, and limb extensors (Figure, A). Prominent lymphadenopathies on bilateral cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes were noted, with the largest lymph node measuring approximately 5 × 2 cm. Laboratory tests were significant for atypical lymphocytes in the peripheral blood (count up to 6%), an elevated CD4+/CD8+ lymphocyte ratio (9.21; normal range, 0.7-3.1), moderate anemia (hemoglobin level, 8.7 g/dL; normal range, 11.5-15.0 g/dL [to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0]), a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (35 mm/h; normal range, 0-25 mm/h), and cryoglobulins composed of mixed polyclonal immunoglobulins. The platelet count (161 × 103/μL; normal range, 125-350 × 103/μL [to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 1.0]) and lactate dehydrogenase (217 U/L; normal range, 100-240 U/L [to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167]) were normal. Quantification of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA showed high loads of virus in the peripheral blood (846 copies/mL in serum, 27 700 copies/mL in lymphocytes; normal range, <500 copies/mL). A biopsy specimen from a skin nodule was sent for histopathologic examination (Figure, B).

### INPUT:
A 68-year-old woman with a medical history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and obesity had undergone C5 anterior corpectomy and fusion (C4-6) with expandable cage, autograft, and anterior instrumentation and posterior spinal decompression and fusion (C4-7) for cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Five months after surgery, she presented to the otolaryngology clinic with 3 weeks of mild odynophagia and dysphagia. It was noted that the patient had a prominent posterior pharyngeal wall, subtle asymmetry of vocal fold motion, and pooling of secretions in the left pyriform (Video 1). During the next 6 months, she gradually developed shortness of breath and stridor, and eventually presented to the emergency department in respiratory distress requiring intubation for 2 days. Shortly after extubation, laryngeal examination showed fullness of the posterior pharyngeal wall and severely limited vocal fold abduction bilaterally (Figure 1A; Video 1). A modified barium swallow study showed intermittent laryngeal penetration without aspiration (Video 2). Although the patient was unable to tolerate magnetic resonance imaging, a soft tissue computed tomography scan of the neck with contrast revealed a well-positioned plate with no evidence of fluid collection in the setting of a normal leukocyte count. One month later, a neuromuscular specialist investigated potential underlying neurological causes; however, results of nerve conduction, antiacetylcholine receptor, antimuscle-specific kinase, methylmalonic acid, HIV, rapid plasma reagin, vitamin B-12, thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroxine, copper, creatine kinase, and immunofixation studies were all unremarkable.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Delayed iatrogenic bilateral vocal fold paralysis (BVFP),"1. **Bilateral Vocal Cord Paralysis** - Considering the limited vocal fold abduction and history of neck surgery, vocal cord paralysis could explain the stridor and respiratory distress.
   
2. **Granulomatous Disease** - Conditions such as tuberculosis or sarcoidosis could cause posterior pharyngeal wall fullness and vocal cord motion asymmetry, although typically other systemic symptoms would be present.

3. **Laryngeal Edema** - Post-surgical laryngeal edema might account for the stridor, odynophagia, and vocal fold changes, especially since imaging shows no fluid collection or infection.

4. **Cervical Hardware Complications** - Though the CT shows a well-positioned plate, there could still be subtle mechanical effects causing these symptoms.

5. **Vocal Cord Tumor** - A tumor could lead to vocal fold motion asymmetry and fullness in the posterior pharyngeal wall.

6. **Pseudobulbar Palsy** - This neurological condition can cause dysphagia and vocal issues but doesn't usually account for the specific respiratory problems unless very advanced.

7. **Achalasia or Cricopharyngeal Spasm** - These motility disorders might explain dysphagia but are less likely to cause the severe respiratory symptoms.

8. **Laryngopharyngeal Reflux** - Chronic irritation from reflux could contribute to vocal fold issues and odynophagia.

9. **Anterior Cervical Osteophyte** - Abnormal bony growths following surgery might not have been overtly visible on CT but could impinge on the pharyngeal space.

10. **Cervical Spine Deformity** - Post-surgical changes like kyphosis could subtly alter the mechanics of the airway and pharyngeal structures.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Bilateral Vocal Cord Paralysis** - The bilateral limitation in vocal fold abduction aligns well with the respiratory distress.
   
2. **Cervical Hardware Complications** - Despite CT imaging, mechanical issues from hardware are plausible given the surgical history.

3. **Laryngeal Edema** - Post-surgical edema is a common complication after neck surgeries.

4. **Anterior Cervical Osteophyte** - Potential osseous growth affecting pharyngeal and airway mechanics should be considered.

5. **Granulomatous Disease** - Although unlikely given normal systemic investigation results, it remains a possibility.

6. **Pseudobulbar Palsy** - Requires more neurological symptoms but aligns with dysphagia.

7. **Laryngopharyngeal Reflux** - Chronic airway irritation from reflux is common.

8. **Vocal Cord Tumor** - Less likely due to lack of mass on imaging but remains a possibility.

9. **Achalasia or Cricopharyngeal Spasm** - Primarily considered for dysphagia without explaining respiratory issues.

10. **Cervical Spine Deformity** - Secondary changes post-surgery could impact pharyngeal volume/function.","['Laryngology', 'Neurosurgery', 'Otolaryngology', 'Health Care Safety', 'Surgery']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,68.0,M

### INPUT:
A 75-year-old man presenting with decreased visual acuity and metamorphopsia in the right eye was referred for further evaluation of a pigmented epiretinal membrane. He had a history of cutaneous nodular melanoma in the right arm. Tumor staging was classified as T3N0M0 in August 2017, at the time of diagnosis and excision. In April 2018, axillary lymphadenectomy was performed for local recurrence and the patient started treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) pembrolizumab, without further local or metastatic evidence of the tumor. Ocular history was positive for cataract surgery bilaterally. After cataract surgery in the right eye, an asymptomatic vision loss was noted and the cause was attributed to the presence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), for which the patient underwent intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections. Examination showed a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/60 OD and 20/20 OS, unremarkable anterior segment findings, and intraocular pressures of 12 mm Hg OU. A fundus examination in the right eye revealed scarce pigmented cells in the anterior vitreous, a dark-pigmented epiretinal membrane, and an area of retinal hyperpigmentation in the inferior temporal arcade corresponding to the CNV (Figure 1). Optical coherence tomography imaging revealed a hyperreflective structure on the surface of the inner retina with increased macular thickness, compatible with the described epiretinal membrane (Figure 1).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cutaneous melanoma metastatic to the vitreous cavity and deposition of melanoma cells over the epiretinal membrane,"1. **Choroidal Melanoma**: Given history of cutaneous melanoma, potential for metastasis to the eye should be considered in evaluation of pigmented ocular lesion.

2. **Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR)**: Can present with changes such as epiretinal membranes and neovascularization that could resemble presentation.

3. **Idiopathic Epiretinal Membrane**: Common cause for metamorphopsia and changes in visual acuity among elderly, which could be a benign etiology underlying symptoms.

4. **Uveal Effusion Syndrome**: Characterized by retinal detachment and may present with visual disturbances similar to those experienced by the patient.

5. **Vitreomacular Traction Syndrome**: Can cause metamorphopsia and visual acuity changes due to tractional changes to the retina.

6. **Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**: Affects central visual acuity and may present with epiretinal changes and pigmentation due to CNV.

7. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR)**: Known to cause visual distortion and may result in epiretinal membrane formation.

8. **Ocular Melanocytosis/Ocular Melanoma**: Other pigmentation-related ocular conditions, not common but possible differential considering melanoma history.

9. **Sarcoidosis Ocular Manifestation**: Can cause granulomatous inflammation that could present with retinal abnormalities and epiretinal membranes.

10. **Immune-Related Adverse Effects (irAE) from Pembrolizumab**: Pembrolizumab has potential for various adverse ocular effects due to its action as an immune checkpoint inhibitor.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Choroidal Melanoma**: Considering the history of cutaneous melanoma, metastasis to the eye should be closely monitored.
2. **Immune-Related Adverse Effects (irAE) from Pembrolizumab**: Due to treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, ocular side effects could manifest in several ways.
3. **Idiopathic Epiretinal Membrane**: Common in elderly patients, fitting the phenotype observed.
4. **Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**: Matches the age and some clinical findings.
5. **Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR)**: Less likely without history of diabetes but still considered for retinal presentation.
6. **Ocular Melanocytosis/Ocular Melanoma**: Secondary concerns due to pigmentation and previous melanoma history.
7. **Vitreomacular Traction Syndrome**: Possible explanation for metamorphopsia given symptomatic presentation.
8. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR)**: Presents with similar visual disturbance but less likely in absence of evident fluid accumulation.
9. **Uveal Effusion Syndrome**: Uncommon but still a consideration among possible causes of retinal findings.
10. **Sarcoidosis Ocular Manifestation**: Unlikely without systemic implications but still considered for granulomatous change potential.","['Dermatology', 'Intraocular Tumors', 'Oncology', 'Skin Cancer', 'Retinal Disorders']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,75.0,F

### INPUT:
A 3-month-old girl was referred for evaluation of multiple cutaneous red papules. The guardian reported first noticing the papules at birth. During the following months, the papules grew in number and size, involving the head and neck, trunk, extremities, right palm, mons pubis, and buttocks. At the height of severity, the patient had 39 lesions, some of which were associated with ulceration and bleeding. The patient was born at full term via spontaneous vaginal delivery; the birth mother had not received prenatal care. Neither the birth mother nor the infant had any known history of environmental or occupational exposure to hazardous substances. The paternal family medical history was unremarkable; maternal family medical history was unknown. Physical examination revealed numerous bright red macules, papules, and plaques ranging in size from 1.0 × 1.0 mm to 2.2 × 2.3 cm, many of which had hemorrhagic crust and dark scale (Figure, A and B). Additional examination findings included retrognathia, thickened maxillary frenulum, and anterior ankyloglossia.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Congenital disseminated pyogenic granuloma,"1. **Infantile Hemangioma**: Given the age of the patient and the characteristics of the red papules, infantile hemangioma is a common and likely consideration.

2. **Congenital Hemangiomatosis**: These are vascular lesions present at birth, often involving multiple sites, and could match the progression observed.

3. **Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome**: This syndrome involves port-wine stains and vascular malformations, occurring with limb overgrowth, though less likely due to distribution.

4. **Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus Syndrome**: Characterized by venous malformations that are often painful, but may be considered due to multiple cutaneous lesions.

5. **Nevus Flammeus Neonatorum**: Also known as a ""salmon patch"" or ""stork bite,"" typically fades over time, but congenital multiple presentations may lead to consideration.

6. **PHACE Syndrome**: Involves large segmental facial hemangiomas, posterior fossa anomalies, cardiac anomalies, and eye abnormalities.

7. **Maffucci Syndrome**: Primarily involves sporadic enchondromas and hemangiomas, focusing on cutaneous and visceral presentation.

8. **Kasabach-Merritt Phenomenon**: This is a complication seen with certain vascular tumors, which can present with hemorrhagic issues.

9. **Rendu-Osler-Weber Syndrome**: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, leading to mucocutaneous lesions that may cause bleeding but usually presents later.

10. **Disseminated Neonatal Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis**: Characterized by skin rashes, lytic bone lesions, although less likely matches the rash described.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Infantile Hemangioma**: The characteristics of the lesions (bright red, increasing in size and number, ulceration) are most consistent with this diagnosis.
2. **Congenital Hemangiomatosis**: The presence of multiple vascular lesions at birth makes this a close contender.
3. **PHACE Syndrome**: Consideration due to cutaneous lesion presentation and potential systemic involvement.
4. **Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus Syndrome**: While typically venous, the multiple involved sites match this diagnosis.
5. **Nevus Flammeus Neonatorum**: Presents congenitally, but benign and fading nature suggests less likelihood given ulceration.
6. **Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome**: Based on cutaneous involvement, albeit lacking limb hypertrophy.
7. **Maffucci Syndrome**: Less likely without bone involvement but considered with multiple skin presentations.
8. **Rendu-Osler-Weber Syndrome**: Less likely given the patient's age and nature of the symptoms.
9. **Kasabach-Merritt Phenomenon**: Relevant given bleeding, but more complication than primary diagnosis.
10. **Disseminated Neonatal Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis**: Less probable due to lack of systemic symptoms strongly suggestive of histiocytosis.","['Pediatrics', 'Dermatology', 'Neonatology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.25,M

### INPUT:
A 28-year-old White man with no remarkable medical history presented with difficulty phonating and singing for the past 15 months. He also reported odynophonia, globus sensation, and mild dysphagia to solids. The patient had been treated previously with steroids and amoxicillin for the presumptive diagnosis of chronic laryngitis but reported no improvement in symptoms. Laboratory workup was positive for elevated antinuclear antibodies and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and was consequently referred to our institution. On presentation, the patient had only minimal dysphonia. He underwent a transnasal flexible laryngoscopy that demonstrated a severely edematous epiglottis, posterior pharyngeal wall, aryepiglottic folds, and arytenoids (Figure, A). The vocal folds were difficult to visualize but seemed normal in appearance and mobility. Stroboscopy could not be performed because of obstruction from the prolapsing arytenoids. Interestingly, the patient denied any shortness of breath. Results of laboratory testing revealed normal levels of all components of a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and angiotensin-converting enzyme. The patient’s erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated to 75 mm/h (reference range, 0-15 mm/h). Findings of chest radiography were normal. An esophagram showed no evidence of reflux esophagitis and a computed tomography of the neck showed edema of the supraglottis with some edema in the posterior hypopharyngeal wall.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Laryngeal sarcoidosis,"1. **Reinke's Edema** - Considering the severely edematous presentation of the epiglottis and related structures, this condition might present with similar symptoms.
   
2. **Sarcoidosis** - Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and possible involvement of connective tissues could suggest sarcoidosis, although no pulmonary involvement was noted.

3. **Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (LPR)** - Chronic inflammatory symptoms and edema could suggest LPR, but esophagram showed no reflux evidence.

4. **Autoimmune Thyroid Disease** - Thyroid function tests were normal, but elevated antinuclear antibodies could point towards autoimmune processes.

5. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)** - A systemic vasculitis resulting in granuloma formations, could cause airway symptoms.

6. **IgG4-related Disease** - Yet another systemic condition known for causing tumefactive lesions and swelling in various organs, including the larynx.

7. **Angioedema** - Presentation of significant edema without respiratory distress may suggest angioedema, though spontaneous chronic occurrence is unusual.

8. **Laryngeal Cancer** - Although mostly suspected with voiced changes, the edema could point towards a significant pathology in the larynx region.

9. **Amyloidosis** - Deposits in tissues could mimic edema and cause functional impairments in various organs.

10. **Sjogren’s Syndrome** - Often associated with elevated antinuclear antibodies, Sjogren’s could potentially affect laryngeal dynamics.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **IgG4-related Disease** - Fits the clinical pattern of extensive laryngeal edema with elevated inflammatory markers and an autoimmune background.
2. **Reinke's Edema** - Edema-focused systemic involvement makes this a strong contender given the clinical presentation.
3. **Sarcoidosis** - Although commonly associated with pulmonary symptoms, a presentation without is plausible.
4. **Amyloidosis** - Given the structural and functional disruptions with elevated inflammatory markers, it matches several clinical suspicions.
5. **Sjogren’s Syndrome** - Presence of antinuclear antibodies and chronic mucosal involvement aligns with Sjogren’s.
6. **Angioedema** - Sudden unexplained edema aligns, but chronic presentation weakens its position.
7. **Laryngeal Cancer** - Lack of direct evidence but chronic and progressive symptoms suggest ruling out.
8. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)** - Fits systemic inflammatory picture, though rare and more associated with upper respiratory tract.
9. **Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (LPR)** - Less likely as esophagram did not show reflux, clinical picture more advanced.
10. **Autoimmune Thyroid Disease** - Thyroid-normal findings make it less likely despite presence of antibodies.","['Laryngology', 'Otolaryngology']",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,28.0,F

### INPUT:
A 72-year-old homeless woman was referred for management of a recurrent cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the right temple and brow. On review of history, maxillofacial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without contrast done 5 months prior to presentation showed a 5.9 × 5.3 × 3.7-cm mass centered at the right temple that tracked along the right lateral orbital wall as well as an enhancing right intraparotid lymph node. The patient was lost to follow-up and re-presented 5 months later with an enlarged crusting and ulcerating lesion of the right temple/brow (Figure 1A). On ocular examination, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/100 OD and 20/125 OS due to cataracts, pupils reacted normally without afferent pupillary defect, and ocular motility was full. She had mild proptosis in the right eye and right lower eyelid retraction. Orbicularis strength was intact and symmetric in both eyes. MRI of the orbits, face, and neck with and without contrast showed a 6.1 × 5.7 × 4.0-cm mass with erosion through the right sphenoid wing, involvement of the lacrimal gland, and abutment of the lateral rectus (Figure 1B). In discussing treatment strategies for the orbital component of the disease, the patient was strongly against an orbital exenteration.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Stage T3N1M0 recurrent cutaneous SCC of the face,"**Step 1 Differential Diagnosis:**
1. Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) - recurrent and enlarging mass in right temple/brow region.

**Step 2 Differential Diagnosis:**
2. Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) - common in elderly with possible ulceration but usually less aggressive.

**Step 3 Differential Diagnosis:**
3. Melanoma - possible history of skin lesion with aggressive spread.

**Step 4 Differential Diagnosis:**
4. Merkel Cell Carcinoma - aggressive skin cancer, rare, with potential lymph node involvement.

**Step 5 Differential Diagnosis:**
5. Cutaneous Sarcoma - sarcomas can present as enlarging soft tissue masses.

**Step 6 Differential Diagnosis:**
6. Lymphoma - could present as an enlarging mass, but would be less likely to cause ulceration.

**Step 7 Differential Diagnosis:**
7. Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma - a less common tumor that can invade surrounding tissues.

**Step 8 Differential Diagnosis:**
8. Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma - typically less common in this location but possible due to potential glandular involvement.

**Step 9 Differential Diagnosis:**
9. Chondrosarcoma - possible due to erosion of bone structures.

**Step 10 Differential Diagnosis:**
10. Metastatic Cancer - another primary tumor elsewhere could metastasize to the parotid area.

### Final Reranked Diagnosis List:
Based on the clinical presentation, MRI findings, and history:

1. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)** - overwhelmingly likely given history.
2. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)** - unlikely to match pattern but still possible.
3. **Lymphoma** - can present with similar lymph node involvement.
4. **Metastatic Cancer** - possible but less likely without an identified primary.
5. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma** - aligns with aggressive behavior.
6. **Melanoma** - possible if previous skin lesion was undiagnosed or misdiagnosed.
7. **Cutaneous Sarcoma** - aligns with mass characteristics.
8. **Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma** - potential due to involvement pattern.
9. **Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma** - less common, considering location.
10. **Chondrosarcoma** - least likely, but possible with bone erosion.","['Dermatology', 'Facial Plastic Surgery', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Oncology', 'Ophthalmology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,72.0,M

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy woman in her 60s presented to our department with an 8-month history of widespread pruritic papulonodular skin lesions on her extremities and trunk. The patient had been initially diagnosed with nodular prurigo at a local hospital and treated with various topical steroids and oral antihistamines for 2 months, without significant improvement. The skin lesions continued to progress and worsened after scratching. Physical examinations revealed disseminated erythematous papules, hypertrophic plaques approximately 1 to 2 cm in diameter, and dome-shaped nodules with excoriated whitish or pink centers on the scalp, chest, abdomen, back, waist, and extremities (Figure, A and B). Subsequent examinations of the mucosal membranes appeared normal. Other physical examinations as well as her medical and family histories were unremarkable. Peripheral eosinophils, serum total immunoglobulin E level, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test for HIV, and results of other routine laboratory tests were within normal ranges or negative. A biopsy specimen was taken from one of the skin lesions on her right forearm for histopathological examination and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) testing (Figure, C and D).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pemphigoid nodularis,"1. **Prurigo Nodularis**  
   Initial consideration based on nodular pruritic skin lesions and worsening after scratching.

2. **Lichen Simplex Chronicus**  
   Possible diagnosis given the chronicity and hypertrophic plaques with pruritis.

3. **Bullous Pemphigoid**  
   Consideration due to erythematous papules and plaques and nodules, though absence of mucosal involvement and negative DIF are against it.

4. **Dermatitic presentation of Drug Reaction**  
   Although patient has no noted medication usage, drug reactions can sometimes present with pruritic lesions.

5. **Dermatofibroma**  
   A possibility with dome-shaped nodules; however, this typically is non-pruritic.

6. **Cutaneous Lichen Planus**  
   Due to pruritic papules, though histological evidence would clarify this.

7. **Sjögren-Larsson Syndrome**  
   Rare consideration for pruritus and lichenified plaques; absence of neurological symptoms is not supportive.

8. **Scabies**  
   Albeit lesions are more widespread than typical cases, reconsidered if other infections ruled out.

9. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**

### INPUT:
A 37-year-old Asian nonsmoking woman with no known medical or drug history presented with an insidious onset of left-eye ptosis (only brought to attention by her friends on review of recent photographs) and subsequent painless vertical diplopia for 1 year. She did not complain of headaches, facial numbness, dysarthria, facial droop, dysphagia, or limb weakness or numbness. There was no history of joint pain or constitutional symptoms. Neurological examination revealed a nonfatigable partial left-eyelid ptosis, left-eye hypotropia at primary position, and impaired left eye supraduction (Figure 1) with a nonreactive left pupil on direct and consensual light reflexes. There were no other cranial nerve deficits. Limb reflexes, motor testing, and sensory testing results were normal, and the plantar responses were flexor.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Neurovascular conflict of the oculomotor nerve,"1. **Myasthenia Gravis**: Although ptosis and diplopia are classic symptoms of myasthenia gravis, the nonfatigable nature of the ptosis makes it less likely.

2. **Thyroid Eye Disease**: This can cause diplopia and ptosis but usually features eye protrusion and other systemic signs which are not present.

3. **Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)**: A possible consideration due to the progressive nature of the ophthalmoplegia, but it is often bilateral and associated with systemic features that are absent here.

4. **Horner's Syndrome**: Involves ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis, but the significant finding here is a non-reactive pupil, which is inconsistent with Horner's.

5. **Cavernous Sinus Syndrome**: This can cause multiple cranial nerve dysfunctions, but the lack of other cranial nerve involvement and normal sensation makes this less likely.

6. **Intracranial Neoplasm (e.g., Meningioma)**: Considered due to potential for causing cranial nerve compression, but lack of other symptoms like headache or systemic signs does not support this initially.

7. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome**: Idiopathic inflammation involving the cavernous sinus can cause ophthalmoplegia, but pain and systemic signs are usually present, which they are not in this case.

8. **Orbital Apex Syndrome**: Includes ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and vision loss, typically presents with more cranial nerve involvement in the context of a mass, lesion, or inflammation.

9. **Oculomotor Nerve Palsy**: The nonreactive pupil and the ocular movement limitations point towards potential involvement but usually context of aneurysm or diabetes, which are not indicated.

10. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**: Though rare, can present with unexplained neurological syndromes, warranting consideration when systemic malignancy might be suspected.

### Final ranked differential diagnosis list based on current information:

### INPUT:
A 15-year-old boy presented to the otorhinolaryngologic department for a right-side postauricular mass. The mass had been present since birth but had slowly grown larger in the previous 2 years. On physical examination, a 2.5 × 1.5-cm, nontender, blue, soft, cystic mass was observed in the right postauricular area. There were no fistular openings around the auricle or in the external auditory canal (EAC), and there were no additional cysts, sinuses, or fistulas at the right neck from the hyoid bone and chin to the EAC. On temporal bone computed tomography, a 2.5 × 1.5-cm, hypodense, oval-shaped cystic mass was revealed at the subcutaneous fat layer superoposterior to the right auricle. On temporal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an oval cystic mass was revealed at the same location, with high signal intensity on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images and low signal intensity on enhanced T1-weighted fat suppression and T2-weighted short T1 inversion recovery images (Figure, A-D). In surgery, the well-demarcated cystic mass was completely excised. Yellowish fluid leaked out of the cyst during excision. On histopathologic examination, the cyst was lined by keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium with hair follicles and sebaceous glands. The cyst contained keratinous debris (Figure, E). There was no recurrence 6 months after surgery.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Type 1 first branchial cleft cyst,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Epidermoid Cyst**: The cyst's characteristics, such as the keratinous debris and lining of keratinizing squamous epithelium, suggest this condition.

2. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**: Typically presents with a cystic mass in the neck region and is lined by a squamous epithelium, but the lack of fistular openings makes this less likely.

3. **Dermoid Cyst**: Contains elements such as hair follicles and sebaceous glands, which fits the histopathological findings.

4. **Hemangioma**: A blue, soft, and potentially compressible mass is consistent with a hemangioma, although the histology does not support this.

5. **Lymphatic Malformation (Lymphangioma)**: Can present as a cystic mass, but usually lacks keratin debris and hair follicles.

6. **Pilonidal Cyst**: Typically occurs in the sacrococcygeal region but could rarely present elsewhere and contain similar histological features.

7. **Sebaceous Cyst**: While histologically similar to an epidermoid cyst, the presence of sebaceous glands suggests it might be considered.

8. **Teratoma**: While it can contain diverse tissue elements, it's typically more complex than observed here.

9. **Parotid Gland Cyst**: Could present with a cyst in a nearby location but not consistent with histological findings.

10. **Cholesteatoma**: A possibility due to squamous epithelium but unlikely given the postauricular location without ear canal involvement.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Epidermoid Cyst**: Based on the histological finding of keratinizing squamous epithelium and keratinous debris, this is the most fitting diagnosis.
   
2. **Dermoid Cyst**: The presence of sebaceous glands and hair follicles aligns closely with this diagnosis.

3. **Sebaceous Cyst**: Similar to an epidermoid cyst but considered due to sebaceous gland involvement.

4. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**: Less likely given the specific postauricular location and no fistula formation.

5. **Pilonidal Cyst**: Considered for its histological features but unlikely due to typical location differences.

6. **Lymphatic Malformation (Lymphangioma)**: Considered due to cystic nature but lacks typical histological features observed here.

7. **Parotid Gland Cyst**: Unlikely given the specific histopathology not matching glandular structures.

8. **Cholesteatoma**: Unlikely due to lack of ear-related involvement.

9. **Teratoma**: Considered due to variety in tissue types but more complex than this presentation.

10. **Hemangioma**: Least likely due to mismatch between expected histology and observed evidence.","['Otolaryngology', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine', 'Pediatrics']",0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,15.0,F

### INPUT:
A 6-month-old boy presented to the emergency department for evaluation of fever and was noted to have mild inspiratory stridor. His parents stated that his stridor began acutely at 4 months of age without any inciting illness or event. The stridor was worse with agitation but was without positional exacerbation. The family reported that the stridor had remained stable since onset. His parents noted mild dysphagia but denied shortness of breath, cyanosis, or apnea. Laboratory test results revealed acute COVID-19 infection. Physical examination was unremarkable other than mild inspiratory stridor. Findings from bedside flexible laryngoscopy revealed intact vocal fold motion bilaterally with glottic competence. No supraglottic or glottic masses were identified. Anterior-posterior neck and chest radiography demonstrated narrowing and tortuosity of the trachea with displacement to the right proximal to the thoracic inlet and diffuse patchy heterogenous airspace opacities (Figure, A). Subsequent neck ultrasonography and computed tomography scan demonstrated a 3.2 × 2.0-cm low-density lesion abutting the trachea and hypopharynx at the level of thoracic inlet, with rightward displacement of the trachea and larynx (Figure, B-D). Operative laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, and esophagoscopy revealed extrinsic compression of the trachea, right mainstem bronchus, and esophagus with rightward deviation of the trachea and esophagus. No mucosal tract was identified.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Foregut duplication cyst,"1. **Congenital Laryngeal Stridor (Laryngomalacia)**  
   - The age of onset, inspiratory stridor that worsens with agitation, and absence of positional exacerbation are consistent with laryngomalacia.

2. **Double Aortic Arch**  
   - The presence of rightward tracheal deviation and extrinsic compression of the trachea and esophagus raises the possibility of a vascular ring like a double aortic arch.

3. **Tracheomalacia**  
   - The mild stridor and tracheal narrowing could be due to a structural issue such as tracheomalacia, which causes collapse of the trachea.

4. **Subglottic Stenosis**  
   - While less likely due to the extrinsic compression observed, subglottic stenosis can cause inspiratory stridor and respiratory distress in infants.

5. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst**  
   - These can occur near the trachea and cause displacement, potentially leading to stridor due to external compression.

6. **Lymphatic Malformation**  
   - The low-density lesion that displaces the trachea in the imaging could be consistent with a cystic hygroma or other lymphatic malformation.

7. **Bronchogenic Cyst**  
   - These can appear as low-density lesions and have the capacity to displace tracheal structures, leading to symptoms like stridor.

8. **Teratoma**  
   - A possibility given the lesion description and potential for mass effect on local structures, causing tracheal compression and dysphagia.

9. **Esophageal Atresia or Tracheoesophageal Fistula**  
   - These conditions are typically diagnosed earlier but could explain extrinsic tracheal compression if overlooked.

10. **Mediastinal Neuroblastoma**  
   - Although rare, neuroblastomas can present as masses in the mediastinum with compression of the esophagus and trachea.

### INPUT:
A 66-year-old man with chronic hepatitis B infection and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) presented with subacute epigastric pain. Three years prior, he was diagnosed with a solitary HCC and underwent surgical resection with curative intent. Pathology revealed poorly differentiated HCC, 16 cm in largest dimension, with large vein involvement (T3bNXM0, R0 resection). The patient underwent expectant observation. One and a half years prior to the current presentation, laboratory results revealed an elevated α-fetoprotein (AFP), and cross-sectional imaging revealed multiple lung nodules consistent with metastases. He was treated with nivolumab every other week and attained a biochemical (baseline, 212.2 ng/dL; best response, 3.3 ng/dL) and radiographic complete response. In the current presentation, the patient reported nonradiating epigastric pain of moderate intensity for 1 month. Associated symptoms included nausea, anorexia, and water brash without emesis. Review of systems was positive for unchanged chronic abdominal bloating and negative for other constitutional or gastrointestinal symptoms. Laboratory results, including liver function tests, amylase, lipase, and AFP, were within normal limits, and hepatitis B virus polymerase chain reaction was undetectable. Computed tomography with multiphasic liver protocol showed new enlarged mesenteric nodes and diffuse thickening of the gastric body (Figure, A). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) identified diffuse inflammation and ulcerations in the gastric body and antrum (Figure, B). Biopsy specimens showed chronic and active mixed inflammatory infiltrate, including intraepithelial lymphocytosis (Figure, C). No overt viral cytopathic effects were observed, and immunostaining results for Helicobacter pylori, cytomegalovirus, and adenovirus were negative.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Immunotherapy-related gastritis,"To approach this case, let's establish a differential diagnosis list step-by-step based on the history, clinical presentation, and investigation findings:

1. **Gastric lymphoma** - Considered due to the diffuse gastric inflammation and ulcerations noted on EGD along with intraepithelial lymphocytosis, which can be associated with lymphoid proliferative disorders.

2. **Immune-related gastritis** - Given the patient’s history of nivolumab treatment, an immune-related gastritis could be considered, as nivolumab is known to cause immune-mediated toxicities affecting various organs, including the gastrointestinal tract.

3. **Metastatic gastric involvement by HCC** - Although liver function tests and AFP are normal, considering his history of metastatic HCC, metastatic involvement of the stomach should be considered.

4. **Gastric eosinophilic gastritis** - This potential diagnosis arises due to the chronic mixed inflammatory infiltrate seen in biopsies; however, eosinophils weren't specifically mentioned, thus why it's lower on the differential.

5. **Peptic ulcer disease** - The presentation of epigastric pain and EGD findings could point to peptic ulcer disease, though the infiltration pattern might not be typical.

6. **Primary gastric adenocarcinoma** - New gastric wall thickening and inflammation could represent a primary gastric cancer, independent of the liver primary.

7. **Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)** - GISTs can cause chronic gastric symptoms and may not show specific viral imprinting, making it another differential to consider.

8. **Infectious gastritis (e.g., fungal, TB)** - The negative immunostaining for common viruses could allow considering less common infectious agents, like fungi or tuberculosis, especially in immune-compromised states.

9. **Drug-induced gastritis** - Certain medications can incite gastritis, though there is no mention of drug use history apart from nivolumab.

10. **Celiac disease** - Unlikely given the patient’s age and presentation, but intraepithelial lymphocytosis is often associated with celiac disease, so it merits inclusion as a low-probability consideration.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Immune-related gastritis**
2. **Gastric lymphoma**
3. **Metastatic gastric involvement by HCC**
4. **Primary gastric adenocarcinoma**
5. **Peptic ulcer disease**
6. **Drug-induced gastritis**
7. **Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)**
8. **Infectious gastritis (e.g., fungal, TB)**
9. **Gastric eosinophilic gastritis**
10. **Celiac disease**

### INPUT:
A 65-year-old patient was referred to the ear, nose, and throat department with left-sided hearing loss during the past 6 months without evident cause. She had a medical history of myocardial infarction, sleep apnea, Ménière disease, and congenital cataract. Furthermore, she did not report otalgia, otorrhea, a recent episode of Ménière disease, or other ear, nose, and throat or systemic symptoms. The patient used atorvastatin and acetylsalicylic acid, did not smoke, and reported drinking 2 glasses of wine daily. Otoscopy of the left ear revealed a yellow-whitish calcareous lobular mass located in the mesotympanum anterior to the malleus with an intact tympanic membrane. The lesion was hard and painful during palpation (Figure 1A). Otoscopy results for the right side were normal.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Tophaceous gout,"1. **Cholesteatoma**: A middle ear growth that is often visible on examination and can cause conductive hearing loss.

2. **Tympanosclerosis**: Characterized by calcified plaques in the tympanic membrane, which matches the description of a calcareous mass.

3. **Glomus Tumor**: A vascular tumor that might present as a visible mass in the middle ear space.

4. **Otosclerosis**: Though it usually causes bilateral symptoms, unilateral presentations are possible and can cause conductive hearing loss.

5. **Ceruminous Gland Tumor**: These are benign or malignant tumors of the external auditory canal, presenting with a visible mass.

6. **Acoustic Neuroma**: Although typically associated with sensorineural hearing loss, could present with conductive if affecting middle ear bones indirectly.

7. **Fibrous Dysplasia**: A bone disorder that could potentially affect the temporal bone area causing mass effect.

8. **Exostosis**: Multiple bony growths in the ear canal, but could seldom cause isolated conductive hearing loss.

9. **Middle Ear Adenoma**: A rare benign growth that presents as a mass in the middle ear.

### INPUT:
A 59-year-old man with a 5-year history of intermittent bilateral uveitis and scleritis presented with painful left uveitis and an episcleral nodule (Figure 1). Ultrasound biomicroscopy revealed an elevated and tender uveal-episcleral lesion. Visual acuity was 20/30 in the left eye and 20/25 in the right eye. He had been taking 60 mg of oral prednisone; topical prednisolone acetate, 1%; and oral ibuprofen for 10 days without relief. He was suspected of being a steroid responder due to elevated intraocular pressure bilaterally. Three years prior, sinus pressure symptoms led to magnetic resonance imaging that revealed a nasal sinus mass. Biopsy demonstrated a histiocytic infiltrate with emperipolesis, consistent with Rosai-Dorfman-Destombes (RDD) disease. Timolol-dorzolamide topical drops were initiated. Staging evaluations showed no other sites of RDD disease.

2. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis: Due to the combination of sinus mass and eye disease, this remains a strong differential.

3. Sarcoidosis: Common systemic disease with similar eye involvement probabilities.

4. Behçet's disease: Could account for the recurrent nature and pattern of eye inflammation.

5. Lymphoma: Possible due to mass-like appearance and persistent inflammation.
   
6. Tuberculosis: Considered less likely but still possible given systemic possibility of masses.

7. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease: Possible given ocular and other systemic presentations but less likely due to lack of skin or neurological findings.

8. Idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome: Generalized inflammation and nodule could suggest this if idiopathic.

9. Syphilis: Possible in differential but less likely based on systemic presentation and history.

### INPUT:
A woman in her mid-50s with a history of mitral valve repair presented to the emergency department with complaints of recent-onset palpitation within the last hour. On physical examination, the patient showed a rhythmic tachycardia with a rate of 178 beats/min and blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg. The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a regular tachycardia with a rate of 178 beats/min; no obvious P waves were recognizable (Figure 1A). The QRS complexes displayed 2 different morphologies occurring with a definite allorhythmic distribution: pairs of beats exhibiting complete right bundle branch block (RBBB) and QRS duration of 140 milliseconds followed by a third beat with normal configuration and QRS duration of 70 milliseconds. This trigeminal variation in intraventricular conduction occurred without any change in cycle length and was maintained. Adenosine administration quickly slowed the ventricular rate allowing recognition of an atrial tachycardia with a rate of 178/min and a 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) ratio (Figure 1B).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Atypical atrial flutter with RBBB aberration and conduction improvement every third beat resulting from concealed type I (Wenckebach) second-degree block in the right bundle branch with 3:2 ratio,"1. Atrial Tachycardia: Based on the ECG findings and response to adenosine, atrial tachycardia should be strongly considered.

2. Atrial Flutter: Although unlikely due to the noted 2:1 AV conduction, atrial flutter with variable block may still be considered.

3. Atrioventricular Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia (AVNRT): Although the presence of visible atrial activity weakens this possibility, AVNRT remains a possibility for regular narrow complex tachycardia.

4. Atrioventricular Reentrant Tachycardia (AVRT): Another supraventricular tachycardia that can present with regular rhythm and rate similar to AVNRT.

5. Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: Despite the ECG showing a distinct regular atrial activity, variable intraventricular conduction could partly be consistent with multifocal atrial tachycardia.

6. Ventricular Tachycardia: The right bundle branch block morphology observed intermittently may suggest the potential for a ventricular origin.

7. Ectopic Atrial Rhythm: Although least likely compared to atrial tachycardia, could consider ectopic atrial rhythms that may cause irregular conduction.

8. Sinus Tachycardia: Although less likely given the sudden onset and high ventricular rate without preceding trigger like exercise, should be ruled out.

9. Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW): A pre-excitation syndrome could theoretically create an unusual conduction pattern although typical ECG modifications are absent.

10. Junctional Tachycardia: Considered less likely due to regular atrial activity but remains a differential diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A 21-year-old woman was referred to our tertiary care hospital with a congenital left hemifacial weakness and a chronic unilateral left-sided hearing loss that evolved since birth. On audiometry, normal hearing sensitivity in the right ear and a severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss with poor word recognition score in the left ear were noted. On physical examination, the patient presented a grade VI peripheral left facial paralysis. Findings from the rest of the clinical examination were within normal limits. Results of cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and temporal bone computed tomography (CT) revealed a left internal auditory canal mass, measuring 13×12 mm, developed at the expense of nerve VII, with a dilation of the various portions of the facial nerve with extension to its distal branches. It presented a hypointensity on T2, isointensity on T1, and was strongly enhanced after the injection of gadolinium. This mass was responsible for the enlargement of the internal auditory canal and was in close contact with the left middle cerebral fossa, without intraparenchymal extension (Figure 1A and B).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Neuromuscular choristoma,"1. **Schwannoma (Vestibular Schwannoma/Acoustic Neuroma)** - Due to the presence of the internal auditory canal mass and the symptoms related to cranial nerve VIII and VII impairment.

3. **Facial Nerve Hemangioma** - Given the dilation and enhancement pattern noted in imaging studies.

4. **Congenital Cholesteatoma** - Although rare in this location, it can present with bone erosion and nerve involvement.

5. **Neurofibromatosis Type II** - Considering bilateral vestibular schwannomas are common, but can incidentally be unilateral.

6. **Glomus Tumor (Paraganglioma)** - Such a tumor can be found at the jugular foramen or manifest with cranial nerve deficits.

7. **Lipoma** - Occasionally can occur in the cerebellopontine angle, though would typically have a different imaging intensity profile.

8. **Granulomatous Disease (e.g., Sarcoidosis)** - Though it would present with more systemic symptoms, it could produce similar imaging findings.

9. **Metastasis** - Unlikely given the young age of the patient, but not impossible if there was a primary cancer.

10. **Intracanalicular Epidermoid Cyst** - Can be found within the CPA, though would present differently on imaging.

### INPUT:
An 18-year-old man presented to the dermatology clinic for evaluation of recurrent skin, nail, and oral mucosal abnormalities. At age 4 years, he developed white oral plaques that resolved with oral nystatin. Approximately 6 months later, the oral plaques recurred, his toenails became thickened and yellowed, and red plaques appeared on both feet and lower legs. After 3 months of daily oral itraconazole, his skin, nail, and oral mucosal abnormalities resolved for approximately 1 year. Over the following years, he received intermittent 3- to 6-month courses of daily itraconazole for recurrent skin, nail, and oral mucosal abnormalities, which typically recurred within 6 to 12 months of discontinuing itraconazole. His last dose of itraconazole was approximately 2 years prior to presentation. On physical examination, the patient had white, moist, nonadherent plaques in the oral mucosa and moist red fissures at bilateral oral commissures (Figure, left panel). He also had thickened, yellowed toenails and scaly erythematous plaques on his lower legs and feet bilaterally (Figure, right panel). Results of complete blood cell count with differential were normal, as were results of measurement of serum IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE levels and analysis of CD3, CD4, and CD8 T-cell subsets. Potassium hydroxide wet mount preparation of skin scrapings from the lower extremities demonstrated fungal elements. Fungal culture of the skin scrapings grew Candida albicans.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC),"1. **Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis** - Due to recurrent fungal infections involving skin, nails, and oral mucosa, and Candida albicans identified from cultures.

2. **Onychomycosis** - Given thickened and yellowed toenails, consistent with fungal nail infection.

3. **Pityriasis Versicolor** - Considered due to scaly erythematous plaques on the lower legs and feet, though less common with the current presentation.

4. **Psoriasis** - Possible due to red scaly plaques, but oral involvement favors a fungal cause.

5. **Seborrheic Dermatitis** - Considered for scaly erythematous plaques, yet oral and nail involvement do not match.

6. **Contact Dermatitis** - Possible cause of red plaques, although persistent oral and nail problems are atypical.

7. **Immunodeficiency-associated Candidiasis** - Given recurrent infections, though normal immune workup makes primary immunodeficiency less likely.

8. **Nummular Dermatitis** - Considers the red plaques, but nail and oral issues aren't typical.

9. **Eczema Herpeticum** - Considers recurrent red plaques, but oral thrush and nail involvement point away from viral etiology.

10. **Lichen Planus** - Considers involvement of skin, mucosal surfaces, and potential nail changes, but fungal predominance leads away from this diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 60s with anti-RNA polymerase III antibody–positive systemic sclerosis complicated by scleroderma kidney crisis, heart failure, interstitial lung disease, sclerodactyly, and Raynaud phenomenon while receiving mycophenolate mofetil, 1 g twice daily, presented with a pruritic rash that had been present for 3 months. The patient denied any known preceding triggers or trauma to the area of the rash. She had tried treating with topical aloe, without improvement. Review of systems was negative for any new or worsening constitutional, respiratory, or gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient’s medical history was otherwise unremarkable. Examination findings were notable for firm, red-brown plaques without overlying scale on the proximal upper extremities and anterior trunk (Figure, A and B). There was no appreciable skin tightening in the affected areas. Complete blood cell count with differential was unremarkable. Lesional punch biopsy specimens were obtained (Figure, C and D).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Keloidal scleroderma,"1. **Lichen Planus** - The pruritic rash with firm red-brown plaques on the upper extremities and trunk could indicate lichen planus, a chronic inflammatory condition of the skin.

2. **Drug Eruption** - Considering the patient is on mycophenolate mofetil, a possible adverse drug reaction should be considered particularly given the chronicity of the rash and lack of improvement with topical treatment.

3. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus** - Red-brown plaques could suggest discoid lupus, especially in a patient with an autoimmune background and absence of systemic symptoms suggesting other lupus involvement.

4. **Sarcoidosis** - The presence of firm plaques might also suggest cutaneous sarcoidosis, which can present without systemic manifestations initially.

5. **Granuloma Annulare** - May present as erythematous plaques that are smooth and shiny, typically seen on distal extremities but can occur in other areas.

6. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica** - Predominantly occurs in diabetic patients, but red-brown shiny plaques can also suggest this condition, despite the less common upper extremity distribution.

7. **Dermatomyositis** - Given associated with systemic sclerosis, could present with skin lesions even without muscle weakness, though the plaque's appearance may not be classic.

8. **Morphea (localized scleroderma)** - This condition can present with plaques and is related to the patient’s systemic sclerotic condition but has distinct lack of scale in these affected areas.

9. **Pemphigus Erythematosus** - Though rare, red-brown plaque formations without scale can occur in cases associated with systemic sclerosis type diseases.

10. **Panniculitis** - Though less common in presentation on upper extremities, subcutaneous inflammation can present with red-brown plaques.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on Available Information:

1. **Drug Eruption** - The timing and nature of the rash align with a possible adverse drug reaction, especially considering the use of immunosuppressants.

2. **Lichen Planus** - Common autoimmune-related skin condition embedded in a well-recognized pattern of rash but less likely due to drug involvement.

3. **Cutaneous Sarcoidosis** - Plaques might align with sarcoidosis and should be considered given their long-term nature.

4. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus** - Fits the profile given patient's autoimmune history, though less classical without facial involvement.

5. **Granuloma Annulare** - A differential largely to be excluded with histopathology considering lesion distribution.

6. **Morphea** - Would fit patient's pre-existing systemic sclerosis diagnosis but typically has tighter plaques with scale.

7. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica** - Would be lower on the list due to uncommon presentation in a non-diabetic patient and location difference.

8. **Dermatomyositis** - Less likely without accompanying systematic symptoms or classic rash.

9. **Panniculitis** - Largely excluded due to primary presentation and symptoms not matching typical behavior.

10. **Pemphigus Erythematosus** - Historically rare occurrence might put this much further down in potential options without classic accompanying systemic symptoms.

### INPUT:
A patient in their 70s presented to the emergency department (ED) with a unilateral painless right proptosis, first noticed 3 days prior. There was no contributory medical history, recent trauma, or surgery. Visual acuity (VA) was 20/32 OD and 20/20 OS. Anterior-segment and fundus examination results were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits revealed a right retro-orbital hemorrhage. No etiology could be identified on the image. Systemic corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone, 1 mg/kg per day) was prescribed for 48 hours. The proptosis decreased, and the patient was discharged. After 6 months, complete ophthalmologic examination was performed again; VA was 20/20 OU, and there was no remaining proptosis. Two weeks later, the patient presented to the ED for another episode of acute, painless, right proptosis, and the VA had decreased to 20/40 OD. MRI showed a right retrobulbar hemorrhage. Systemic corticosteroid therapy was again prescribed for 48 hours with rapid resolution of the visual impairment but incomplete resolution of the proptosis. One month later, the patient presented to our ophthalmology department. The VA was 20/20 OU, with a persistent, mild, nonreducible, nonpulsatile proptosis unrelated to Valsalva maneuver but associated with extraocular movement limitation in upgaze. A repeated MRI was performed, which showed the following images (Figure 1).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Recurrent retrobulbar hemorrhage owing to an orbital tumor: a primary orbital melanoma.,"1. **Orbital Varix** - Considered due to intermittent nature and resolution of proptosis and hemorrhage.
   
2. **Carotid-Cavernous Fistula** - Proptosis associated with neurological impact, though likely excluded without pulsatile proptosis and auscultation findings.

3. **Thyroid Eye Disease** - Evaluated as a common cause of proptosis but less likely with the episodic presentation and lack of other systemic signs.

4. **Orbital Lymphangioma** - Due to proptosis and history of hemorrhage, this vascular lesion is considered.

5. **Orbital Vascular Malformation** - Evaluated given recurrent symptoms and radiologic appearance.

6. **Cavernous Hemangioma** - Capable of causing proptosis, though less likely with episodic hemorrhagic events.

7. **Orbital Hemorrhage Post-trauma** - Trauma-related hemorrhage considered but ruled out with lack of incident history.

8. **Metastatic Disease** - While possible in this demographic, lacks systemic indicators typical of metastasis.

9. **Orbital Fracture** - The suspicion of fracture is low due to lack of history and characteristic imaging findings.

10. **Scleritis** - Presents with similar ocular symptoms, though unlikely given the absence of pain and inflammatory signs.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Orbital Lymphangioma** - Strongest likelihood due to recurrent hemorrhagic episodes and proptosis.
2. **Orbital Varix** - Considered next plausible due to episodic nature and Valsalva irrelevance.
3. **Orbital Vascular Malformation** - Potential based on structural findings on MRI.
4. **Cavernous Hemangioma** - Vintage suggests vascular lesion but episodic bleeding less characteristic.
5. **Thyroid Eye Disease** - Possible distant contender due to general features; systemic indicators against.
6. **Metastatic Disease** - Less likely without hallmark systemic involvement.
7. **Carotid-Cavernous Fistula** - Uncharacteristic sign pattern lower likelihood.
8. **Orbital Hemorrhage Post-trauma** - Ruled out without history of trauma.
9. **Orbital Fracture** - Unlikely in absence of supportive clinical history/findings.
10. **Scleritis** - Conclusively improbable without pain or inflammatory signs.","['Melanoma', 'Intraocular Tumors', 'Ophthalmology', 'Orbit']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,70.0,U

### INPUT:
A 74-year-old man was referred for evaluation of retinal lesions in his left eye. His ocular history was notable for recent cataract surgery 5 weeks prior to presentation that was complicated by endophthalmitis. A normal funduscopic examination was documented prior to cataract surgery. At the time of initial presentation to his local retina specialist 1 week following his cataract surgery, the patient had severe pain and redness. His visual acuity was light perception. An examination revealed a 2-mm hypopyon and dense vitreous haze with no view of the retina. He was treated for presumed endophthalmitis with a vitreous tap and intravitreal injections of vancomycin (1 mg/0.1 mL), ceftazidime (2.2 mg/0.1 mL), and dexamethasone (0.4 mg/0.1 mL). The vitreous sample obtained at the time of treatment grew Staphylococcus caprae susceptible to vancomycin. At time of examination in our clinic 4 weeks following treatment, the patient was receiving topical steroid and cycloplegic drops. His best-corrected visual acuity had improved to 20/70. Examination showed a deep and quiet anterior chamber with a well-positioned intraocular lens without any plaques or deposits on the lens capsule. Dilated ophthalmoscopic examination demonstrated improvement in the vitreous debris with 1+ vitritis and numerous superficial, round, white lesions spread throughout the fundus in all 4 quadrants and in the macula (Figure 1A). Optical coherence tomography verified the preretinal location of the lesions (Figure 1B).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Vancomycin and ceftazidime deposits,"1. **Postoperative Infectious Endophthalmitis:** The patient's symptoms immediately following cataract surgery, including severe pain, redness, hypopyon, and dense vitreous haze, along with the positive culture for Staphylococcus caprae, strongly suggest this condition, which was treated initially.

2. **Candida Endophthalmitis:** The presence of white retinal lesions could suggest this fungal infection, particularly in a post-surgical setting, despite previous bacterial endophthalmitis treatment.

3. **Retinal Vasculitis:** Inflammatory retinal conditions can manifest similar retinal lesions and vitritis, considered given the improvement and the presence of vitritis.

4. **Retinal Detachment with Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy:** Though less likely given the posterior evidence on OCT, vitritis can obscure or be associated with such conditions post-surgery.

5. **Toxocariasis:** A parasitic infection that can lead to similar vitreous and retinal findings, more common in prior systemic infection exposure but considered for lesion appearance.

6. **Sarcoidosis-associated Uveitis:** Could present with vitritis and similar fundoscopic findings, particularly considering the age and symptom improvement pattern once inflammation is controlled.

7. **Cytomegalovirus Retinitis:** More common in immunocompromised patients but considered because of lesions presenting in the fundus.

8. **Primary Intraocular Lymphoma:** Uncommon but can present with vitreous and retinal lesions, particularly if not resolving as expected after infectious treatment.

9. **White Dot Syndromes:** Such as Acute Posterior Multifocal Placoid Pigment Epitheliopathy or Serpiginous Choroidopathy, fall in differential due to the characteristic lesions although typical patient profile may differ.

10. **Tuberculous Uveitis:** Although rarer in postoperative settings, certain tuberculous manifestations might lead to similar lesion formations.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Postoperative Infectious Endophthalmitis:** Treated but important as a primary issue and the starting point of complications.
   
2. **Candida Endophthalmitis:** High suspicion due to unresolved retinal lesions after initial treatment which likely points towards fungal etiology in post-surgical settings.

3. **Retinal Vasculitis:** Plausible due to systemic inflammation and ongoing retinal findings.

4. **Sarcoidosis-associated Uveitis:** Differential fitting systemic autoimmune background and retinal involvement.

5. **Toxocariasis:** Given persistent lesions, inclusion in workup should infections align geographically or by history.

6. **Primary Intraocular Lymphoma:** Considered due to unresolved inflammatory response despite bacterial treatment.

7. **Cytomegalovirus Retinitis:** Unlikely without systemic immunocompromise, but included due to retinal lesion presentation.

8. **Retinal Detachment with Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy:** Mainly due to historical surgical relation, less due to present evidence.

9. **White Dot Syndromes:** The atypical demographic profile makes them less likely but considered for lesion assessment.

10. **Tuberculous Uveitis:** Least likely unless specific systemic TB indicators are found.

An otherwise healthy 54-year-old man presented with an erythematous right lower eyelid lesion with a vermiform appearance, accompanied by pruritus and pain (Figure 1A). The lesion resolved after 1 month, but he developed redness and swelling of the inner part of his right conjunctiva the next day (Figure 1B). He denied any vision changes, eye pain, eye discharge, or systemic symptoms, such as fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss, or diarrhea. The patient had recently immigrated from rural Moldova 1 month prior to presentation, where he had exposure to farm animals, including dogs and cats. He had not traveled to any other countries.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Ocular dirofilariasis,"Let's approach this by considering the patient's history, symptoms, and possible causes for the manifestations observed.

1. **Cutaneous Larva Migrans**: Given the patient's rural background with exposure to farm animals and presentation of an erythematous lesion with a vermiform appearance.
2. **Toxocariasis**: The patient's exposure to dogs and cats could lead to worm infection, which could cause ocular manifestations.
3. **Ocular Dirofilariasis**: Dirofilaria species are known to cause migrating lesions and can be associated with exposure to infected animals.
4. **Loiasis**: Loa loa worms can cause migrating subcutaneous swellings and ocular presentations.
5. **Onchocerciasis**: Known for causing skin and ocular lesions; however, this is more common in Africa.
6. **Eyelid Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus**: A viral infection that could explain the unilateral eyelid lesion with pain and pruritus.
7. **Cellulitis or Preseptal cellulitis**: A bacterial infection could present with erythema and edema of the eyelid.
8. **Chalazion or Hordeolum**: These can cause eyelid erythema and pain but are less likely given the patient's history and lesion appearance.
9. **Conjunctival Cyst or foreign body granuloma**: Swelling and redness of the conjunctiva could arise from a cyst formation or foreign body response.
10. **Allergic Conjunctivitis**: Although this is less consistent with the migratory lesion, it could explain subsequent conjunctival symptoms.

### Reranking after considering all information and testing:

1. **Ocular Dirofilariasis**: Combines the migratory aspect, erythema, pain, and conclusive exposure history with animals.
2. **Cutaneous Larva Migrans**: Common with rural exposures and can still align well with transient lesion description.
3. **Toxocariasis**: Plausible with the region and animal exposure, presenting ocular symptoms.
4. **Loiasis**: Less common given the geography but could be considered due to migratory lesion characteristic.
5. **Cellulitis or Preseptal Cellulitis**: Due to its direct relevance for eyelid presentation and pain.
6. **Eyelid Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus**: Though less likely due to a lack of systemic symptoms.
7. **Chalazion or Hordeolum**: Although less probable, they are still considered for localized pain.
8. **Onchocerciasis**: Unlikely due to geographical consistency with Africa, but possible in transmigration.
9. **Conjunctival Cyst or foreign body granuloma**: Less likely, given the patient's symptoms and exposure.
10. **Allergic Conjunctivitis**: Least probable based on the migratory and vermiform description of the lesion.

### INPUT:
A 79-year-old male patient presented with a 2-year history of asymptomatic erythematous-infiltrated patches and plaques on the right side of his scalp and face. The lesions gradually enlarged and coalesced into large plaques and nodules. Mild erosions occurred occasionally on the surface of the lesions. He denied having fever, fatigue, chills, night sweats, or weight loss. Physical examination demonstrated ill-defined, indurated erythematous-violaceous patches, nodules, and plaques involving the surface of his head and face with sporadic erosion and brownish crusts (Figure, A). The findings of systemic reviews were unremarkable, and there was no lymphadenopathy. The complete blood cell count revealed normal white blood cell count. The biopsy from an erythematous nodule displayed sheets of medium to large mononuclear cells infiltrated in the dermis, some of which filled and expanded apparent dermal blood vessels and had large, irregular, pleomorphic nuclei (Figure, B). In addition, some neoplastic cells formed a balloon appearance. No epidermotrophism was found. The initial immunohistochemical stain revealed the tumor cells were positive for CD3 and negative for CD20, AE1/AE3, CK20, chromogranin A, and melan-A. The Ki-67 labeling index was 70%.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Intravascular anaplastic large cell lymphoma,"To arrive at a differential diagnosis for this patient, let's consider each step and evaluate the findings.

Step 1: **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL)**  
This is suggested by the presence of indurated erythematous-violaceous patches and plaques, the infiltrative nature of the lesions, and immunohistochemical positivity for CD3.

Step 2: **Primary Cutaneous Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (PC-ALCL)**  
Characterized by CD3 positivity, the presence of large pleomorphic cells in the dermis and high Ki-67 index are supportive features.

Step 3: **Angiocentric Lymphoma (Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma, Nasal type)**  
Although rare on the head and face, this subtype should be considered given the vascular involvement.

Step 4: **Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma, Not Otherwise Specified (PTCL-NOS)**  
This diagnosis is included due to its aggressive nature and CD3 positivity.

Step 5: **Lymphomatoid Papulosis (LyP)**  
Despite being an indolent condition usually, the presentation of nodules and plaques fits, though less likely here.

Step 6: **Kaposi Sarcoma**  
Considered due to the nodular, violaceous nature of some lesions, though CD3 positivity and immunohistochemical profile argue against.

Step 7: **Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (ATLL)**  
Has a varied skin presentation and should be included, especially with positive CD3 staining.

Step 8: **Subcutaneous Panniculitis-like T-cell Lymphoma (SPTCL)**  
Unlikely without more typical deep subcutaneous involvement and clinical manifestations, included for consideration of other CD3 positive entities.

Step 9: **Follicular Mucinosis**  
Usually presents with patches and plaques on the head and neck area, can precede mycosis fungoides.

Step 10: **Granulomatous Slack Skin**  
Typically presents differently, with lax skin, but bears consideration due to atypical presentations and CD3 positivity.

Based on the descriptions, negative markers for other entities, and high Ki-67 index, a re-ranking prioritizes aggressive and likely conditions:

1. **Primary Cutaneous Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (PC-ALCL)**
2. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL)**
3. **Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma, Not Otherwise Specified (PTCL-NOS)**
4. **Angiocentric Lymphoma (Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma, Nasal type)**
5. **Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (ATLL)**
6. **Lymphomatoid Papulosis (LyP)**
7. **Subcutaneous Panniculitis-like T-cell Lymphoma (SPTCL)**
8. **Follicular Mucinosis**
9. **Kaposi Sarcoma**
10. **Granulomatous Slack Skin**

### INPUT:
An 11-year-old girl was referred to assess a retinal mass in the left eye found on her first routine ophthalmic evaluation. She reported no present or past ocular symptoms and had negative findings on a review of systems. Her history included full-term birth by cesarean delivery from an uncomplicated pregnancy. She had healthy, nonconsanguineous parents. The ocular examination showed a visual acuity of 20/20 OU with no anterior segment abnormalities. Findings of dilated fundus examination of the right eye were within normal limits. In the left eye, a white, translucent solid lesion with calcification was noticeable in the inferonasal quadrant (Figure, A). The lesion measured approximately 1.6 mm in height, exhibited mild underlying chorioretinal changes, and had associated 3 vitreous seeds (Figure, A). There were no signs of internal vascularization or vitritis. Optical coherence tomography confirmed an intraretinal location and calcified deposits within the lesion (Figure, B).

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. Retinoblastoma
   - Most consistent with age, presentation of a calcified retinal mass, and appearance of vitreous seeding.
2. Retinal Astrocytic Hamartoma
   - Known to present with calcified lesions and is considered a differential in pediatric patients, although less frequent than retinoblastoma.
3. Coats' Disease
   - Typically presents with subretinal exudation rather than calcification, but can have some overlapping clinical features.
4. Intraocular Medulloepithelioma
   - Rare in children, but should be considered due to the presence of an intraocular mass.
5. Retinal Hemangioblastoma
   - Could present with a retinal mass but lacks typical calcification.
6. Persistent Fetal Vasculature
   - Often associated with an elongated ciliary process rather than a discrete calcified retinal mass.
7. Toxoplasmosis 
   - Characterized more by inflammatory lesions rather than a solid calcified mass in a child without systemic symptoms.
8. Congenital Hypertrophy of the Retinal Pigment Epithelium (CHRPE)
   - Usually a flat pigmented lesion, inconsistent with the appearance of a calcified mass.
9. Retinal Detachment with calcified subretinal lesions
   - Less likely due to absence of retinal detachment and vitreous seeding would typically not be present.
10. Idiopathic Vitreous Seeds
    - Least likely due to lack of defined retinal mass origin in idiopathic cases.","['Ophthalmology', 'Pediatrics', 'Retinal Disorders']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,M

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy woman in her early 70s presented to the Department of Dermatology with a 2-year history of a mildly pruritic, erythematous, and gradually enlarging lesion on the proximal portion of her left calf. The lesion had appeared without an identifiable cause, and for the previous 2 months, the patient had applied topical corticosteroids and antifungals with no improvement. Physical examination revealed an ill-defined, nonindurated, erythematous-violaceous plaque that was slightly raised but with an atrophic appearance (Figure, A). A skin biopsy was obtained for histopathology examination (Figure, B-D).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Poikilodermatous plaque–like hemangioma,"1. **Nummular Eczema**: Given the chronic nature of the pruritic, erythematous lesion, this condition characterized by well-demarcated, coin-shaped plaques can be considered.

2. **Tinea Corporis**: Although previous antifungal treatments were ineffective, the presentation can sometimes mimic inflammatory dermatoses.

3. **Psoriasis**: A common dermatosis with erythematous, scaly plaques, although usually present in other typical locations like elbows and knees.

4. **Lichen Planus**: A pruritic, violaceous plaque could be suggestive of this condition, which often has a chronic course.

5. **Granuloma Annulare**: Characterized by annular plaques, this often self-resolving condition could match the described lesion.

6. **Bowen's Disease**: This form of squamous cell carcinoma in situ may present as a chronic, erythematous plaque.

7. **Sarcoidosis**: A multisystem granulomatous disease that can present with skin lesions resembling erythematous plaques.

8. **Lupus Erythematosus**: Chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus can present as erythematous, atrophic plaques.

9. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica**: Although commonly associated with diabetes, it may occur independently and presents as plaques on the shins.

10. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides)**: A potential diagnosis for chronic, resistant plaques, especially given the lack of response to typical treatments.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Bowen's Disease**: Given the chronicity, lack of response to treatment, and specific skin presentation, this should be carefully considered.
2. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides)**: High suspicion due to non-response to typical treatments and biopsy requirement for diagnosis.
3. **Lupus Erythematosus**: Autoimmune consideration given the atrophic, erythematous nature of the plaque.
4. **Sarcoidosis**: Remains a potential differential due to the presentation of skin plaques and the systemic nature of the disease.
5. **Lichen Planus**: Its chronic nature and similarity in lesion appearance support this ranking.
6. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica**: Less common but still fitting due to the anatomic location and lesion characteristics.
7. **Granuloma Annulare**: Though typically resolving, the chronic course aligns with the patient’s presentation.
8. **Psoriasis**: Lower likelihood due to the lack of typical scale and other common sites of involvement.
9. **Nummular Eczema**: Adequately considered, but less supported with the raised atrophic plaque description.
10. **Tinea Corporis**: Least likely given the antifungal resistance and the characteristic atypical appearance.","['Geriatrics', 'Cutaneous Vascular Malformations', 'Dermatology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,70.0,M

### INPUT:
A 59-year-old woman with history of cutaneous melanoma of the trunk was referred for evaluation of a pigmented angle lesion in the right eye. She denied any changes in vision, flashes, floaters, eye pain, or eye redness. She denied a history of trauma, intraocular surgery, or inflammation in the eyes. She had a history of stage 3B melanoma treated with ipilimumab complicated by grade 3 colitis refractory to high-dose corticosteroids and infliximab requiring colectomy and stomal hernia after hernia repair. Serial positron emission tomography/computed tomography scans showed no evidence of metabolically active disease. Her medical history was notable for hypertension controlled with metoprolol. Her mother had a history of breast cancer but otherwise family history was unremarkable. Visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/25 OS. Intraocular pressure was 16 mm Hg OD and 15 mm Hg OS. Anterior segment examination showed inferior corneal endothelial pigmentation in the right eye (Figure, A) and trace nuclear sclerotic cataracts in both eyes. She did not have ectropion uvea, corectopia, or feeder vessels. Dilated ophthalmoscopy was unremarkable. Four-mirror gonioscopy in the right eye showed an open angle, normally pigmented trabecular meshwork, and a well-demarcated pigmented brown lesion without extension into the angle (Figure, B). Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) in the right eye was unremarkable and did not show any masses.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Peripheral pigmented placoid corneal endotheliopathy,"1. **Melanocytoma**  
   - Melanocytomas are benign pigmented lesions of the uveal tract or optic nerve and could present as pigmented lesions in the angle.

2. **Primary Acquired Melanosis (PAM)**  
   - PAM may present as a flat pigmented lesion in the conjunctiva, but if mistaken for intraocular lesion could be included in differential considerations.

3. **Nevus**  
   - A nevus is a benign pigmented lesion that can occur within the eye and mimic other more aggressive pigmented lesions.

4. **Uveal Melanoma**  
   - Despite being more common in the choroid, suspicion should remain due to patient's melanoma history, even if PET/CT is unremarkable.

5. **Pigment Dispersion Syndrome**  
   - This condition involves release of pigment granules and can cause pigmented lesions in the angle.

6. **Ciliary Body Melanoma**  
   - A rare possibility but considered due to potential for pigmented lesion formation.

7. **Lisch Nodules (Iris Nevus)**  
   - Typically associated with neurofibromatosis, but may also present on the iris or angle as pigmented lesions.

8. **Ocular Melanocytosis**  
   - Congenital condition leading to increased pigmentation that could include angle pigmentation.

9. **Iris Pigment Epithelium Cyst**  
   - Can present as small pigmented lesions and detected on gonioscopy, although less likely as no masses on UBM.

10. **Post-inflammatory Pigment Deposition**  
   - Could result from prior inflammation, although denied in history; however an incidental finding on examination.

Ultimately, upon review of all patient information and exam findings, the most likely diagnosis is **Melanocytoma** as it presents as a benign intraocular pigmented lesion, is consistent with clinical findings, and aligns with the absence of activity on PET/CT scans.","['Dermatology', 'Oncology', 'Skin Cancer', 'Melanoma', 'Ophthalmology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,59.0,M

### INPUT:
A 58-year-old man with a history of intravenous heroin use and chronic inactive hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection with a low serum HBV DNA value, normal liver enzyme values, and no evidence of cirrhosis presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of painless jaundice and 8 days of malaise. His last intravenous heroin use occurred 9 days prior to presentation. He was not taking any prescription or herbal medications and had not been prescribed suppressive antiviral medication for chronic HBV infection. He reported no history of travel outside the US and no raw meat ingestion. His vital signs, mentation, and physical examination were normal except for scleral icterus (Figure). Results of blood testing were negative for hepatitis C virus RNA, anti–hepatitis A IgM, and HIV antibody. Other selected laboratory values are shown in the Table. A liver ultrasound performed 6 months prior to presentation and a repeat liver ultrasound with Doppler revealed no abnormalities.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Hepatitis D superinfection,"To establish a differential diagnosis for this patient presenting with sudden onset of painless jaundice and malaise with the given background, we will follow a systematic approach. Here are 10 possible differential diagnoses:

1. **Acute Hepatitis B Flare:** Despite previously inactive HBV infection, an acute flare could lead to sudden jaundice.
2. **Autoimmune Hepatitis:** Presents similarly with jaundice and would not be due to a viral cause.
3. **Drug-induced Liver Injury (DILI):** Though he reports no medication use, unintentional exposure or substances could be considered.
4. **Wilsons Disease (acute presentation):** Though rare at this age, acute liver symptoms in Wilson's Disease are a possibility.
5. **Primary Biliary Cholangitis:** Typically presents with jaundice and other similar symptoms in undiagnosed patients.
6. **Biliary Obstruction (e.g., choledocholithiasis):** Despite normal ultrasound, could cause jaundice if stones were intermittent.
7. **Acute Alcoholic Hepatitis:** Though history doesn't show obvious alcohol use, could occur post-binge.
8. **Hemolytic Anemia leading to jaundice:** Would be less likely with normal bilirubin fractions but still worth considering.
9. **Intrahepatic Cholestasis:** Various causes leading to altered bile flow and jaundice.
10. **Incidental hepatitis E:** Even without travel, sporadic cases could happen.

### Reranking Based on All Information and Test Results:

1. **Acute Hepatitis B Flare:** Most consistent with a painless jaundice presentation and chronic HBV history.
2. **Autoimmune Hepatitis:** A plausible cause of jaundice given negative viral markers and chronic liver condition.
3. **Drug-induced Liver Injury (DILI):** Misreported or unknown exposure despite no medication intake.
4. **Intrahepatic Cholestasis:** Fits the sudden painless jaundice but less specific given test results.
5. **Hemolytic Anemia:** Less likely due to normal routine labs but needs a specific test to rule out.
6. **Wilson’s Disease:** Potential but rare for the age; other diagnostics would be needed.
7. **Primary Biliary Cholangitis:** No prior diagnosis, but possible due to symptomatology.
8. **Biliary Obstruction (e.g., choledocholithiasis):** Less likely given repeat ultrasound absence of obstruction.
9. **Acute Alcoholic Hepatitis:** Unlikely due to no reported use but needs consideration given its rapid onset.
10. **Incidental hepatitis E:** Rare given the lack of travel or exposure history, yet possible.

Final diagnosis would require further laboratory investigations, such as liver biopsy, specific autoantibody panels, or genetic testing for conclusive decision-making.","['Infectious Diseases', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatobiliary Disease', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology', 'Viral Hepatitis']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,58.0,F

### INPUT:
A 2-month-old, full-term male presented with a left upper neck mass that was first noted at birth. His parents reported no fevers, constitutional symptoms, or enlargement of the mass. On physical examination, there was a nontender 4-cm mass in the left submandibular region with no overlying skin changes. Ultrasonography results showed an avascular cystic structure with internal debris and a single thin septation. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the neck soft tissue revealed a 3-cm low attenuation, nonenhancing, cystic-appearing mass that elevated the submandibular gland to the level of the parapharyngeal fat space with medial extension of the lesion into the tongue musculature. The walls were thin except for mildly thickened capsule along the posterior aspect of the lesion (Figure, A and B). Fluid that aspirated from the cyst was serous, and cytology showed mature and anucleate squamous cells with acute inflammation. The mass returned after 3 weeks. Further analysis 8 months after the initial CT via contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a large, multiseptated cystic structure (Figure, C); the capsule of the wall was mildly thickened and was contrast enhancing. At age 12 months, the mass was excised via neck dissection. A lateral component at the level of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was completely excised. An intraoperative rupture of the thin capsule caused some spillage of cystic contents that were milky white in some areas and mucinous in others.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Foregut duplication cyst,"1. **Congenital Neck Mass/Branchial Cleft Cyst** - Based on the presentation of a neck mass that was noticed at birth and its location, a branchial cleft cyst is considered.

2. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst** - Given the cystic nature of the mass and its midline territory extending to the tongue musculature, a thyroglossal duct cyst should be considered.

3. **Dermoid Cyst** - The presence of mature squamous cells in the aspirate cytology suggests possible dermoid cyst formation.

4. **Lymphatic Malformation (Lymphangioma)** - Presentation with a cystic, avascular lesion with the recurrence could point towards a lymphatic malformation.

5. **Cystic Hygroma** - Given the large, cystic structure and its presentations, cystic hygroma should be explored as a possibility.

6. **Ranula** - With the extension into the tongue musculature and cystic nature, ranula could be a candidate.

7. **Teratoma** - Considering the presence of different tissue components in the aspirate, a teratoma should be included in the differential diagnosis.

8. **Epidermoid Cyst** - The recurrence and serous aspirate might lead to an assessment of an epidermoid cyst.

9. **Infantile Hemangioma (Cystic Component)** - Although rare, an infantile hemangioma with atypical cystic presentation might be considered due to its recurrence pattern.

10. **Plunging Ranula** - Extending from the oral cavity downward with recurrence confirms a plunging ranula should be near top differential.

Now, all the information and test results taken into consideration with this patient leads to the following reordered differential diagnosis:

1. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**
2. **Dermoid Cyst**
3. **Cystic Hygroma**
4. **Lymphatic Malformation (Lymphangioma)**

### INPUT:
A 32-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital for fever, flulike symptoms, and altered mental status developed sudden-onset blurry vision in his right eye. His history was notable for phthisis in his left eye due to a left orbit clear cell sarcoma with metastatic disease, after surgical excision and radiation, with recent enrollment in a palliative immunotherapy research protocol. After completing 2 days of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics and antivirals for presumed septic meningitis, his laboratory and imaging results returned negative and he was transitioned to intravenous methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg). One day later, his mental status improved, and he reported central blurry vision in his right eye. On examination, his visual acuity was 20/40 in this eye, he had normal intraocular pressure, and there was no evidence of anterior chamber or vitreous cells. Dilated fundus examination revealed segmental areas of venous sheathing (Figure 1A) in the right eye and was not possible in the left eye owing to phthisis. An optical coherence tomography scan of the right eye revealed hyperreflective changes along the outer plexiform and outer nuclear layers, small intraretinal cysts, and disruption of the ellipsoid and especially the interdigitation zone (Figure 1B).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Atezolizumab-associated retinopathy,"To develop a differential diagnosis for this patient's sudden-onset blurry vision and ocular findings, we will go through a step-by-step process, presenting a new possible diagnosis at each step without repeating previous suggestions. After gathering all patient information and test results, we will rerank these differentials based on likelihood. 

1. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)** - MS can present with optic neuritis, which might explain the sudden blurred vision and some retinal changes.

2. **Vasculitis-Induced Retinopathy** - Conditions like Behçet's disease or systemic lupus erythematosus can cause retinal vasculitis leading to segmental venous sheathing.

3. **Paraneoplastic Retinopathy** - His history of metastatic disease and recent symptoms might suggest a paraneoplastic syndrome affecting the retina.

4. **Acute Zonal Occult Outer Retinopathy (AZOOR)** - Describes sudden vision loss with retinal findings similar to this case.

5. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC)** - Though typically presenting with detachment, the stress from his condition and corticosteroids can lead to CSC.

6. **Drug-Induced Retinopathy** - The patient's involvement in a research protocol might expose him to experimental drugs, which can have ocular side effects.

7. **Cryptococcal Meningoencephalitis** - Although tests returned negative, immunocompromise may lead to atypical presentations affecting the eye.

8. **Viral Retinitis (such as CMV retinitis)** - While being treated with antivirals, immunocompromised patients can still develop viral related retinal conditions.

9. **Retinal Vein Occlusion** - Though without hypertension, this can cause sudden vision changes and venous sheathing.

10. **Retinal Migraine** - May cause transient vision loss or disturbances, although less commonly associated with persistent findings.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Paraneoplastic Retinopathy** - Given his history of metastatic cancer and enrollment in immunotherapy, this rises to a primary consideration.

2. **Vasculitis-Induced Retinopathy** - The segmental venous sheathing points towards a vasculitis component, possibly triggered or unmasked by recent treatments.

3. **Drug-Induced Retinopathy** - Consideration given recent experimental drug exposure in his immunotherapy protocol.

4. **Acute Zonal Occult Outer Retinopathy (AZOOR)** - Fits the specific pattern of some of the segmental and retinal layer findings.

5. **Viral Retinitis (such as CMV retinitis)** - Despite antiviral treatment, immunocompromise could lead to atypical presentation.

6. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)** - Less likely unless further neurological symptoms develop, but optic neuritis is a common initial sign.

7. **Cryptococcal Meningoencephalitis** - Seems less likely due to negative test results but shouldn’t be completely ruled out with immune status considerations.

8. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC)** - Less common with segmental venous changes but possible due to stress or steroid use.

9. **Retinal Vein Occlusion** - A possibility, though lower on the list due to lack of common associated risks.

10. **Retinal Migraine** - Unlikely given the sustained visual abnormalities and retinal findings.

A woman in her 40s with a long-standing history of poorly controlled HIV (multiple treatment lapses, viral load of 22 871 copies/mL 8 months prior to presentation but now undetectable with use of highly active antiretroviral therapy, with a CD4 count of 40 cells/mm3) presented to the emergency department with nausea, abdominal pain, bloody stools, odynophagia, and recurrent oral and perianal ulcers and was found to have pancytopenia and septic shock. During admission in the intensive care unit, treatment with broad-spectrum oral antibiotics for presumed infection and oral fluconazole for thrush led to improvement in the patient’s medical condition, but the ulcers persisted. Dermatology was consulted for input on the cause of the ulcers, which had been ongoing for approximately 6 months prior; individual lesions lasted 1 to 3 weeks before self-resolving. Biopsy of an oral mucosal lesion performed 1 month earlier had shown nonspecific inflammation. Examination revealed exquisitely tender, ovoid, punched-out ulcerations of the inferior lip and scrapeable white plaques on the tongue (Figure, A), right buccal mucosa, and external anal mucosa (Figure, B). A punch biopsy from 1 of the perianal ulcers was performed (Figure, C and D).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Epstein-Barr virus–positive mucocutaneous ulcers,"1. **Candida infection (Thrush)** - Common in immunocompromised patients such as those with HIV/AIDS and can cause oral and esophageal lesions.
   
2. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection** - Can cause ulcers especially in immunocompromised states, and when patients present with bloody stools and gastrointestinal involvement.

3. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection** - Known to cause recurrent, painful ulcerations in oral and genital areas, particularly in immunosuppressed individuals.

4. **Kaposi's Sarcoma** - A vascular tumor associated with HIV, presenting with lesions that can appear ulcerative, often found in the skin and mucous membranes.

5. **Cryptococcal infection** - Could potentially cause oral lesions in patients with HIV/AIDS, though more frequently associated with central nervous system symptoms.

6. **Histoplasmosis** - Can cause mucocutaneous lesions in severely immunocompromised patients and is common in those with HIV/AIDS.

7. **Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection** - Often causes mucocutaneous lesions or ulcers, especially in individuals with compromised immune systems.

8. **Syphilis** - Secondary syphilis can lead to mucous patches and ulcers in the oral cavity and other mucosal surfaces.

9. **Oral lichen planus** - An inflammatory condition that can cause painful oral lesions, though more typical in immunocompetent individuals.

10. **Behçet's disease** - Multi-system inflammatory disorder known for causing recurrent oral, genital ulcers, and other systemic symptoms.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection** - Consideration for recurrent and painful ulcerations persistently occurring in the oral and genital areas consistent with patient presentation.
   
2. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection** - Given the bloody stools and extensive immunocompromise, CMV constitutes an important differential.

3. **Candida infection (Thrush)** - Even with improvement under fluconazole, persistent issues might indicate resistant strains or other conditions.

4. **Kaposi's Sarcoma** - Consistent with the possibility of atypical ulcerative presentation in an individual with HIV/AIDS.

5. **Cryptococcal infection** - Unlikely but should be considered due to severity of immunocompromise.

6. **Histoplasmosis** - Low probability but possible in terms of causing ulcerative mucocutaneous lesions.

7. **Syphilis** - Despite being lower due to lack of additional systemic signs, should not be entirely ruled out without serology.

8. **Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection** - Less likely primary cause given typical presentation but can coexist, influencing ulcer persistence due to immunocompromise.

9. **Behçet's disease** - Less typical due to localized presentation and lack of systemic features.

10. **Oral lichen planus** - Unlikely given the systemic nature of the patient's symptoms and condition.","['Dermatology', 'Emergency Medicine', 'HIV', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Critical Care Medicine']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,40.0,M

### INPUT:
A woman in her early 20s presented with suspected syncope and shaking with no significant medical history. The patient fell asleep and her boyfriend tried to wake her, but she started shaking and slumped over on the ground. She denied confusion afterward but did not feel well with nausea, flushing, chest tightness, and a rapid heart rate. About 10 minutes later, she had a second syncopal episode for 2 to 3 minutes with more than 20 muscle jerks. On presentation at the emergency department, she was afebrile, blood pressure was 120/59 mm Hg, heart rate was 85 beats per min, respiratory rate was 16 breaths per min, and oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. Her cardiac examination revealed normal heart sounds with no murmurs. The electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed early on arrival in the emergency department (Figure). Transthoracic echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction of 54%, mild right ventricular (RV) dilation (RV diameter, 4.1 cm), and no significant valvular abnormalities. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed no RV abnormalities and qualitatively normal RV function. Neurology consultation was obtained with concern for an epileptic seizure event surrounding the recurrent syncopal episodes. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalogram were obtained, both of which results were normal. On further questioning, patient reported having a second cousin with sudden cardiac death of uncertain etiology in her early 20s.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Brugada type 1 syndrome with unexplained syncope,"1. Vasovagal Syncope: This is the most common cause of syncope and involves the vagus nerve leading to a drop in heart rate and/or blood pressure.

2. Cardiac Arrhythmia: Abnormal heart rhythms can lead to syncope, with or without accompanying muscle jerks. The family history increases concern for an inherited arrhythmia.

3. Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures (PNES): These can mimic epileptic seizures but are not associated with the abnormal electrical activity seen in epilepsy.

4. Long QT Syndrome: This genetic condition affects the heart's electrical activity, which could explain the syncope, shaking, and family history of sudden cardiac death.

5. Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS): This condition causes an abnormal increase in heart rate upon standing, but usually without muscle jerks.

6. Brugada Syndrome: A genetic disorder that affects the heart rhythm and can result in syncope, especially with a family history of sudden death.

7. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: Although less likely given normal echocardiography results, this condition can cause sudden cardiac events.

8. Conversion Disorder: This involves neurological symptoms, like syncope and shaking, that cannot be explained by medical conditions.

9. Seizure Disorder: This is unlikely given the normal EEG and MRI but remains in the differential given the initial clinical concern.

10. Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT): This genetic condition can cause syncope and sudden death in response to physical activity or emotional stress.

### INPUT:
A 32-year-old Black man presented with a 1-year history of facial swelling, predominantly in the right preauricular and left submandibular regions. His symptoms began after relocation to California and occurred more frequently at his home. However, he could not discern any environmental or dietary triggers. He reported pruritus and swelling, which were usually moderate but occasionally severe, prompting several emergency department visits. During an emergency department visit, he was diagnosed with acute parotitis based on clinical and radiographic findings of diffuse gland edema, without salivary stones or masses. His symptoms responded to oral prednisone bursts and diphenhydramine, but not to second-generation antihistamines or montelukast. His workup included immune serology and total immunoglobulin (Ig) E measurements, all of which were within normal limits. A differential blood cell count revealed 10% eosinophils (normal, <6%) and an absolute eosinophil count 500/µL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). Titers for antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, anti-Ro (SS-A), and anti-La (SS-B) were negative. Sialendoscopy of his right parotid and left submandibular glands found no obstructing stones or strictures. Concurrent steroid irrigation did not provide any substantial benefit. An open biopsy of the right parotid tail revealed nonspecific inflammatory changes and otherwise normal parenchyma. Given the frequency and severity of his symptoms along with multiple treatment failures, he opted to undergo a right superficial parotidectomy, which proceeded without complications. Further histologic examination of the surgical specimen revealed substantial periductal inflammatory infiltrate with eosinophils, as seen in the Figure.

### INPUT:
Final diagnosis: Late-onset postoperative capsular bag distension syndrome.  
Case report: A 78-year-old White woman was referred to our clinic for evaluation of an unexplained subjective decrease in vision for more than 6 months, more pronounced in the right eye, and insufficiently controlled intraocular pressure (IOP). Local antiglaucoma therapy with a fixed-combination prostaglandin and β-blocker was used regularly in both eyes owing to long-standing primary open-angle glaucoma. Uneventful cataract surgery with phacoemulsification and in-the-bag insertion of an intraocular lens was performed 10 years earlier in both eyes. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 1.0 and 0.5 (Snellen equivalent, 20/20 and 20/40) OD and OS, respectively. Her manifest refraction revealed a difference of −0.75 D sphere compared with her own preexisting glasses in the right eye. IOP was 24 mm Hg in the right eye and 18 mm Hg in the left eye. Slitlamp examination revealed a milky substance in the retrolental space, more pronounced in the right eye (Figure) but evident in both. The rest of the slitlamp examination was unremarkable with moderate superficial punctate keratitis owing to ocular surface disease, an anterior chamber depth of Van Herick grade 4 (peripheral anterior chamber depth >1 corneal thickness), an absence of anterior chamber inflammation, and a moderate amount of Elschnig pearls in both eyes.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Late-onset postoperative capsular bag distension syndrome,"1. **Postoperative Capsular Bag Distension Syndrome**  
   - Considering the patient's history of cataract surgery and the presence of a milky substance in the retrolental space, capsular bag distension following intraocular lens implantation is a potential differential.

2. **Intraocular Lens Decentration or Dislocation**  
   - This can affect visual acuity and could be related to the patient's history of cataract surgery, which might explain the milky substance visual disturbance.

3. **Posterior Capsule Opacification**  
   - Common after cataract surgery, this condition can contribute to decreased visual acuity and could initially mimic the findings.

4. **Ocular Hypertension**  
   - The increased intraocular pressure could contribute to visual disturbances, although it needs to be differentiated as an underlying or concurrent issue.

5. **Chronic Uveitis**  
   - Chronic or subclinical uveitis could present with similar changes within the eye post-surgery, though it typically involves inflammation.

6. **Cystoid Macular Edema**  
   - Following cataract surgery, this can lead to decreased vision and may coexist without obvious anterior segment findings.

7. **Pseudophakic Bullous Keratopathy**  
   - Though less likely given the clear cornea, it remains a consideration due to the surgical history.

8. **Secondary Glaucoma**  
   - Caused by pigment dispersion, pseudoexfoliation syndrome, or other mechanisms, this remains a possibility considering the IOP issues.

9. **Vitreous Hemorrhage or Inflammation**  
   - Can cause visual disturbances and the appearance of opacification in the retrolental space.

10. **Retained Lens Fragments**  
    - These could cause chronic issues post-surgery leading to symptoms like decreased vision and increased intraocular pressure.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Postoperative Capsular Bag Distension Syndrome**  
   - Best fits the patient's history and clinical presentation with the presence of a milky substance and the previous cataract surgery.

2. **Posterior Capsule Opacification**  
   - A common issue post-cataract surgery that can cause visual problems.

3. **Intraocular Lens Decentration or Dislocation**  
   - Possible given the surgical history although less likely with minimal visible changes during slitlamp examination.

4. **Ocular Hypertension**  
   - Associated with symptoms moderately but less likely given the absence of glaucomatous damage findings.

5. **Cystoid Macular Edema**  
   - Should be considered though typically evaluated with additional fundoscopic results.

6. **Vitreous Hemorrhage or Inflammation**  
   - Slight possibility due to lack of posterior segment examination findings.

7. **Secondary Glaucoma**  
   - Possible interaction with existing glaucoma treatment rather than a primary cause.

8. **Chronic Uveitis**  
   - Less likely without concurrent signs of inflammation or anterior chamber involvement.

9. **Pseudophakic Bullous Keratopathy**  
   - Unlikely due to the clear corneal finding during examination.

10. **Retained Lens Fragments**  
    - Unlikely after this many years post-operatively without prior similar episodes.","['Cataract and Other Lens Disorders', 'Glaucoma', 'Ophthalmology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,78.0,M

### INPUT:
A 55-year-old US-born woman with a history of cataract surgery in both eyes 3 years ago presented with worsening blurriness, photopsia, floaters, and intermittent eye redness for the past year, worse in the left eye. She was otherwise well. The referring physician was treating her with prednisolone eye drops for cystoid macular edema after recent left Nd:YAG capsulotomy. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/30 OS with intraocular pressures of 20 mm Hg OD and 26 mm Hg OS. The anterior segments showed well-positioned posterior chamber intraocular lens implants with open posterior capsules. Dilated fundus examination revealed a small peripheral hypoautofluorescent chorioretinal scar in the right eye. In the left eye, there was trace vitreous haze and 2+ anterior vitreous cell. Multifocal chorioretinal scars extended from the left optic nerve into the macula in each quadrant (Figure 1). These lesions showed variable hypoautofluorescence and hyperautofluorescence. On indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), the confluent hypoautofluorescent lesions showed loss of the choriocapillaris and prominent large choroidal vessels, whereas the mottled hypoautofluorescence and hyperautofluorescent lesions appeared to block the underlying fluorescence. Routine laboratory testing was unremarkable except for a positive interferon-gamma release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A chest radiograph was normal.

### INPUT:
A 47-year-old man with a history of metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoid tumor (NET) status in remission after liver transplant was hospitalized for workup of a new pancreatic mass concerning for recurrence. Several days into his hospital course, he developed acute-onset severe bilateral periorbital swelling, chemosis, and ophthalmoplegia as well as occasional flushing and palpitations. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/70 in both eyes. Pupils, intraocular pressure, and color vision were normal. He had bilateral proptosis to 20/21 mm by Hertel exophthalmometer, −3 restriction of extraocular movements in all directions of gaze, diffuse punctate epithelial erosions, and mechanical lower lid entropion secondary to severe chemosis in both eyes (Figure 1A). Anterior segment examination and dilated ophthalmoscopy results were otherwise unremarkable.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Recurrent NET metastatic to the EOMs,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Metastatic Disease Recurrence**  
   - Considering the patient's history of metastatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET), the new pancreatic mass could indicate a recurrence of the disease.

2. **Orbital Cellulitis**  
   - The acute onset of bilateral periorbital swelling, chemosis, and ophthalmoplegia suggests the possibility of an infectious process such as orbital cellulitis.

3. **Thyroid Eye Disease**  
   - Bilateral proptosis with restriction of extraocular movements could be seen in thyroid eye disease (Graves' disease).

4. **Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis**  
   - Acute bilateral eye symptoms, including chemosis and ophthalmoplegia, raise suspicion for cavernous sinus thrombosis.

5. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**  
   - The history of neuroendocrine tumor and the acute symptoms could suggest a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with cancer.

6. **Systemic Anaphylaxis or Allergic Reaction**  
   - Bilateral periorbital swelling and flushing might result from an allergic reaction or systemic anaphylaxis, despite lacking a typical trigger.

7. **Neuroendocrine Tumor Metastasis to Orbit**  
   - Neuroendocrine tumors can produce various symptoms if metastasizing to different sites, including the orbit.

8. **Carcinoid Syndrome**  
   - The history of neuroendocrine tumor accompanied by flushing and palpitations raises concern for carcinoid syndrome.

9. **Vascular Malformation or Hemangioma**  
   - Vascular lesions can cause sudden proptosis and chemosis by influencing blood flow or causing mechanical obstruction.

10. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Disease (Orbital Pseudotumor)**  
    - This condition can present with the sudden onset of proptosis, inflammation, and restriction of eye movements.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Metastatic Disease Recurrence**  
   - Given the patient's history and new pancreatic mass, recurrence of NET is highly plausible.

2. **Carcinoid Syndrome**  
   - The combination of flushing and palpitations with concurrent disease history indicates carcinoid syndrome.

3. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**  
   - Potential paraneoplastic phenomenon associated with tumor history causing ophthalmic symptoms.

4. **Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis**  
   - The pattern of acute bilateral ocular symptoms is serious and warrants high suspicion.

5. **Neuroendocrine Tumor Metastasis to Orbit**  
   - Direct metastasis of NET to the orbit could explain the opthalmic findings.

6. **Orbital Cellulitis**  
   - Infectious etiology could fit due to the presentation but less likely without signs of systemic infection.

7. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Disease (Orbital Pseudotumor)**  
   - The inflammation affecting the orbit could account for symptoms absent any neoplastic recurrence.

8. **Thyroid Eye Disease**  
   - Although considered, lacks associated systemic thyroid symptoms in history.

9. **Systemic Anaphylaxis or Allergic Reaction**  
   - An allergy could explain the symptoms though lacking evidence of exposure.

10. **Vascular Malformation or Hemangioma**  
    - Less likelihood without direct imaging evidence showing vascular abnormality or mass influence.","['Ophthalmology', 'Oncology', 'Surgery', 'Surgical Oncology', 'External Eye Disease']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,47.0,F

3. **Leukemia cutis**  
   - Persistent concern due to specific skin involvement and systemic symptoms.

4. **Pyoderma gangrenosum**  
   - Consideration remains due to the dramatic nature of skin lesions and possible associated systemic symptoms.

5. **Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's Granulomatosis)**  
   - Remains a contender given systemic involvement.

6. **Infective endocarditis with Janeway lesions**

A 6-year-old girl with severe autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was brought to the hospital by her mother for whitening in the right eye. The patient was nonverbal at baseline and exhibited restrictive and repetitive behaviors. Her diet consisted exclusively of cookies, apples, potato chips, and Gatorade. Her mother noticed her frequently rubbing her eyes for several weeks, which she initially attributed to new-onset allergies. She did not describe any reduction in visual function or ability to perform low-luminance tasks. The patient was admitted and ophthalmology was consulted. She required an examination under sedation. Her visual acuity could not be determined. There was no relative afferent pupillary defect in either eye. The eyelids were mildly erythematous with bilateral eyelash hypertrichosis. The conjunctiva and cornea appeared dry and leathery bilaterally. The right cornea was diffusely hazy with a 3-mm paracentral epithelial defect with 60% stromal thinning and a 1-mm infiltrate. There was a small crescentic fibrin deposit nasally in the right anterior chamber. The left cornea was diffusely hazy with a 1-mm epithelial defect without stromal thinning (Figure). Dilated examination showed bilateral grade 3 optic nerve head edema and otherwise normal retinal findings. Fortified vancomycin eye drops, 25 mg/mL, and tobramycin eye drops, 15 mg/mL, were initiated. Results of magnetic resonance imaging of the brain were normal.

5. **Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye syndrome)** - Indicated by dry and leathery corneal appearance.

6. **Blepharitis** - Potential cause of eyelash hypertrichosis and mild erythema of eyelids.

7. **Optic disc edema secondary to increased intracranial pressure or inflammation** - Though MRI was normal, could be considered due to bilateral optic nerve findings.

He had not experienced adverse effects after the first 2 vaccine doses on January 17 and February 5, 2021. Twelve days after the booster vaccination, he developed pruritic wheals on his face and bilateral, transient eyelid swelling. Over the next week, a pruritic rash spread over his neck, chest, trunk, and arms; each lesion faded without scarring within 24 hours. He did not experience lip, tongue, or neck swelling; shortness of breath; wheezing; chest pain; or palpitations. Application of pressure to his forearm in a circular motion using a pen cap elicited wheal and flare lesions (Figure, left panel). On physical examination, performed 17 days after the onset of rash, his vital signs were normal. He had no tongue, lip, or throat swelling, and his lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Wheal and flare lesions developed on his upper eyelids during the examination and resolved after approximately 30 minutes (Figure, right panel). Light pressure applied to his skin with a tongue depressor elicited wheal and flare lesions within 3 to 5 minutes.

### INPUT:
Final diagnosis: Intraocular lens implant subluxation and extrascleral extension secondary to ciliochoroidal melanoma.
Case report: A middle-aged patient with a remote history of bilateral juvenile cataracts after posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL) placement presented with decreased vision in the right eye for several months. There was no recent ocular trauma or intraocular surgery. At the time of the initial examination, visual acuity was 20/50 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye, with a refraction of −1.50 diopters (D) sphere in both eyes. Examination was notable for a superonasal area of pigmentation with elevation of the conjunctiva and an inferotemporally subluxed PCIOL in the right eye. Results of the fundus examination were reported to be normal in both eyes and the anterior examination of the left eye was notable for only a well-positioned PCIOL. The patient was referred to a cornea specialist for further evaluation and treatment. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, specialty evaluation occurred 10 weeks later at which time the patient complained of progressive vision loss in the right eye. Visual acuity measured hand motion in the right eye with normal intraocular pressure. The PCIOL was subluxed inferotemporally with vitreous prolapse into the anterior chamber (Figure 1A). A 4 mm × 3.1-mm superonasal pigmented scleral lesion was also noted (Figure 1B). The examination of the left eye was remarkable only for a well-centered PCIOL and iris transillumination defects.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Intraocular lens implant subluxation and extrascleral extension secondary to ciliochoroidal melanoma,"1. **Cataract-associated complications** – Due to the patient's history of juvenile cataracts and intraocular lens placement, it is plausible to first consider complications related to cataract surgery such as lens displacement or subluxation.

2. **Intraocular lens dislocation** – Considering the finding of an inferotemporally subluxed PCIOL, the possibility of lens dislocation or subluxation should be considered.

3. **Vitreous prolapse** – The examination reveals vitreous prolapse into the anterior chamber, which suggests complications involving the vitreous body may be contributing to visual disturbances.

4. **Scleral Mass** – The identified superonasal pigmented scleral lesion raises the possibility of a neoplastic process such as melanoma.

5. **Choroidal melanoma** – Given the pigmented nature and location of the lesion, along with progressive vision loss, a choroidal melanoma should be considered as a potential cause.

6. **Retinal detachment** – Though fundus examination was reported as normal, the severe vision reduction and vitreous prolapse necessitate consideration for retinal detachment or impending detachment.

7. **Ocular metastasis** – The pigmented lesion warrants consideration of possible metastatic disease affecting ocular structures.

8. **Uveal tumors other than melanoma** – Other uveal lesions, like nevi or non-melanoma uveal tumors, could present similarly with ocular changes and should be part of the differential.

9. **Inflammatory ocular disease** – Although less likely given the absence of pain or redness, an inflammatory etiology such as uveitis could potentially explain some of the findings.

10. **Benign scleral lesion** – While a benign lesion is less likely given the acuity of symptoms, it remains a differential to consider for a scleral lesion.

The palmar surfaces of his hands revealed livedo racemosa, erythema, and retiform purpura; ulcers overlying his phalangeal joint creases and fingertips; and scale and fissures on several digits (Figure). On the dorsal surfaces there was a large ulcer on the right second metacarpophalangeal joint and erythematous papules over several metacarpophalangeal joints. Ulcers were also noted on his elbows. Laboratory testing showed a hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL and normal creatine kinase level. The patient was admitted to the hospital for pain management and expedited workup of his progressive finger ulcerations.

### Final Reranked Differential Diagnosis
1. Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) - Considering the digital ulcers, livedo racemosa, and dyspnea on exertion which could indicate pulmonary involvement associated with scleroderma.
2. Mixed connective tissue disease - Given the presence of erythematous papules and fingertip ulcers, common in mixed connective tissue diseases.
3. Wegener's granulomatosis (GPA) - Due to the combination of pulmonary symptoms and systemic signs.
4. Cryoglobulinemia - Because of the retiform purpura and palpable purpura presentation.
5. Polyarteritis nodosa - Considering systemic vascular involvement and skin manifestations.
6. Peripheral vascular disease - Given digital ischemia but less likely as primary without other cardiovascular disease symptoms.
7. Buerger's disease (thromboangiitis obliterans) - Unlikely due to patient age and absence of smoking history typically associated with presenting symptoms.
8. Infective endocarditis - Less likely given the chronicity and lack of acute systemic infection signs.
9. Lupus erythematosus - While plausible, less likely due to the lack of other systemic lupus criteria.
10. Erythromelalgia - Unlikely due to the specific nature of livedo and ulcerations being pronounced with a vascular cause.","['Pulmonary Medicine', 'Rheumatology', 'Connective Tissue Disease of the Skin', 'Dermatology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,66.0,F

### INPUT:
A 63-year-old woman presented with a history of previous left superficial parotidectomy 10 years before for a Warthin tumor. Her histology results showed a 5-cm Warthin tumor, with a focus of nodular oncocytic hyperplasia in the adjacent parenchyma and reactive intraparotid lymph nodes. She presented to the ear, nose, and throat clinic and complained of pain in the operative site of 6 months duration. This occurred intermittently once a week and lasted for a few minutes each time. It was associated with a small lump over the left neck, and the pain was worse on touch and head turning. On examination, there was a 3-mm nodularity palpated deep to the neck wound along the mid sternocleidomastoid muscle. It was associated with focal tenderness. Her facial nerve function was otherwise normal, and sensation in the ear lobe was intact. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was performed, and the results showed no focal lesion in either parotid glands or at the area of interest over the left sternocleidomastoid muscle. The patient was counseled for an excisional biopsy of the left neck nodule. The intraoperative photograph of the neck and the excised specimen is shown in Figure 1.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Greater auricular nerve neuroma,"To approach this case, we will proceed with a differential diagnosis considering the patient's history, presenting symptoms, physical examination findings, and MRI results.

1. **Recurrent Warthin tumor**: Given the patient's history of Warthin tumor, a recurrent tumor is a reasonable consideration despite the MRI not showing a focal lesion.

2. **Scar neuroma**: The focal tenderness and intermittent pain may suggest the development of a neuroma post-surgery.

3. **Sialolithiasis (salivary stone disease)**: Although MRI didn't show stones, the previous parotid area involvement and pain could suggest obstruction or residual stones not visible on MRI.

4. **Granulomatous inflammation**: A foreign body reaction or granulomatous inflammation from previous surgery is plausible.

5. **Infectious etiology**: Chronic low-grade infection or an atypical bacterial infection like mycobacterial infection could present in this manner.

6. **Metastatic lymphadenopathy**: Unlikely given the benign nature of initial tumor, but considered due to new neck lump.

7. **Fibromatosis (Desmoid tumor)**: A benign yet locally aggressive tumor that might arise post-surgery, though rare.

8. **Lipoma**: A benign fatty tumor could explain the lump, tenderness less typical but possible if it presses on nearby structures.

9. **Fibroadenoma**: Though uncommon in the neck, fibroadenomas can sometimes present as painless or slightly painful lumps.

10. **Cervical rib anomaly**: While structural and MRI imaging is generally clear of such findings, a congenital anomaly or variation might present with new growths or lumps.

### Reranking using all patient information and test results:

1. **Scar neuroma**: Fits well with postoperative history and symptomatology of tenderness and intermittent pain.
2. **Recurrent Warthin tumor**: Given the initial tumor type and same site recurrence possibility.
3. **Granulomatous inflammation**: Previously surgical area makes this plausible.
4. **Lipoma**: Although tenderness is less typical, it remains a possibility.
5. **Fibromatosis (Desmoid tumor)**: Could be a postoperative growth despite MRI findings.
6. **Metastatic lymphadenopathy**: The additional lump, albeit benign primary, needs to be considered.
7. **Infectious etiology**: Appropriate for intermittent symptoms, though less supported by imaging.
8. **Sialolithiasis**: Less likely given MRI findings, but not impossible.
9. **Fibroadenoma**: Less likely based on location and presentation.
10. **Cervical rib anomaly**: Least likely considering the age and MRI results.

### INPUT:
A man in his 60s with a history of hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and chronic migraines presented with 9 months of progressively worsening left-sided ptosis, which was more notable at night and with fatigue. He denied experiencing pain, diplopia, muscle weakness, dysarthria, dysphagia, difficulty breathing, or other neurologic deficits. On examination, corrected visual acuity was 20/20 bilaterally, with normal color vision, visual fields, intraocular pressure, extraocular movements, alignment, and pupils. External examination was notable for left upper eyelid ptosis (Figure 1), with a margin-to-reflex distance 1 of 3.5 mm on the right and 0.5 mm on the left, intact levator function, and no fatiguability on sustained upgaze. There was no evidence of eyelid edema, erythema, or tenderness to palpation. There were no palpable adnexal masses or orbital rim deformities, but there was mild fullness in the left superior sulcus and mildly increased left-sided resistance to retropulsion. However, Hertel exophthalmometry did not reveal any relative proptosis. No lacrimal gland abnormalities or conjunctival masses were seen with upper eyelid eversion. There was no palpable preauricular or cervical lymphadenopathy. Slitlamp and fundus examination findings were normal. Serological testing results for antiacetylcholine receptor antibody were negative.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Unilateral ptosis secondary to mantle cell lymphoma of the left lacrimal gland,"1. **Myasthenia Gravis** - Despite negative antiacetylcholine receptor antibodies, seronegative myasthenia gravis should be considered, given the ptosis and typical presentation.
   
2. **Horner's Syndrome** - Ptosis can be due to sympathetic denervation. Although no miosis or anhidrosis was noted, a mild presentation needs to be considered.

3. **Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)** - Presents with ptosis bilaterally; however, it could initially appear unilateral.

4. **Levator Palpebrae Superioris Disinsertion** - Ptosis with intact eyelid function could suggest an anatomical disinsertion of the levator muscle.

5. **Orbital Mass** - Possible orbital cause with fullness in the left superior sulcus, despite no palpable masses.

6. **Aponeurotic Ptosis** - Often occurring in aging, this could present without any pain or inflammation.

7. **Mitochondrial Myopathy** - This condition can lead to ptosis due to muscle dysfunction, despite normal laboratory evaluations.

8. **Third Nerve Palsy (pupil sparing)** - Although rare without other neurological symptoms, it should still be considered.

9. **Blepharochalasis** - Repeated episodes of eyelid edema leading to ptosis, though signs of inflammation are lacking.

10. **Graves' Disease** - Uncommon presentation without proptosis or lid retraction, but possible with only subtle signs.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
 
1. **Myasthenia Gravis (Seronegative)** - Due to the classic presenting symptom of ptosis and negative antibody titers, seronegative myasthenia remains highly suspect.
  
2. **Horner's Syndrome** - Given the singular ptosis, sympathetic denervation remains possible.
   
3. **Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)** - Even unilateral presentation fits the patient's symptomatology.
   
4. **Levator Palpebrae Superioris Disinsertion** - Intact levator function suggests an anatomical issue over a neurological one.
   
5. **Orbital Mass** - The fullness in the superior sulcus supports this differential, although imaging studies would be necessary for confirmation.
   
6. **Aponeurotic Ptosis** - Plausible given the patient's age and lack of other symptoms.
   
7. **Mitochondrial Myopathy** - Though less likely, still plausible given the chronic nature and unilateral ptosis.
   
8. **Third Nerve Palsy (pupil sparing)** - Low likelihood without additional concurrent neuroradiological findings.
   
9. **Blepharochalasis** - Unlikely given the lack of inflammatory signs, but might be a red herring.
   
10. **Graves' Disease** - Least likely given absent classical signs of thyroid eye disease; still remotely possible.","['External Eye Disease', 'Neuro-ophthalmology', 'Oncology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Lymphomas']",0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,60.0,F

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy woman in her 20s presented to the dermatology department with thickening and swelling of hands after immersion in water, accompanied by burning pruritus for 3 years. The lesions occurred as symmetrical white and transparent papules, white keratosis, excessive wrinkling on the dorsum of hands after water immersion and worsened in summer, and remitted in winter. She was treated with topical tretinoin ointment intermittently per a diagnosis of chronic eczema at the local clinic with little improvement. The lesions gradually aggravated, and the affected area dispersed to wrists and elbows during the past 1.5 years. She attributed these changes to the need for washing hands frequently in the period of the COVID-19 epidemic. She had no family history of similar skin problems and did not have a history of hyperhidrosis, cystic fibrosis, atopy, or trauma to the hands. Physical examination showed some changes emerged on both hands after water immersion contrasting with any other condition (Figure, A and B). We took a skin biopsy specimen from white papules on the right hand, and representative histopathologic features are shown in the Figure, C and D.

### INPUT:
On the day of giving birth via a normal vaginal delivery, a healthy man in his 20s developed painful swelling on his right thigh, at the site of a methergine injection administered 1 day prior. Despite 3 days of treatment with an oral antibiotic (cefalexin), his thigh pain and swelling did not improve, and he was readmitted to the hospital and intravenous clindamycin was started. Wound cultures and blood cultures obtained during incision and drainage performed on hospital day 1 were negative for bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal organisms. The following day, his temperature was 39.4 °C (102.9 °F), blood pressure was 86/42 mm Hg, and heart rate was 131/min. He was transferred to the intensive care unit for presumed septic shock, and his antibiotics were changed to vancomycin and meropenem. Surgical debridement of the right thigh was performed on hospital day 3. On hospital day 4, a new purple dusky border developed along the wound edge, and the patient underwent a second surgical debridement. After debridement on hospital day 5, his temperature was 39.8 °C (103.6 °F), and he required vasopressor infusion with norepinephrine for shock. His right thigh had a deep 9 × 8–cm ulcer with a dusky violaceous border extending 2 to 5 cm from the wound edge (Figure, left), with many 1- to 2-mm pustules (not visible in Figure). Laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 30 000/μL (88% neutrophils); lactate level, 77.5 mg/dL (8.6 mmol/L); and procalcitonin level, 16.1 ng/mL (reference, <0.1 ng/mL). Histologic examination of the tissue obtained during the second surgical debridement revealed ulceration with extensive neutrophilic inflammation (Figure, right). Stains for microorganisms, and tissue and blood cultures, remained negative.

A 65-year-old man was referred with a 6-week history of blurry vision, ocular pain, and subconjunctival yellow discoloration in the left eye. Suspicious retinal detachment and intraocular mass were identified, which raised concerns for choroidal melanoma. No symptoms or signs were reported in the right eye. His ocular history included bilateral cataract surgery 5 years prior. Review of systems yielded negative results, including for ocular trauma, jaundice, and cutaneous melanoma. He had no history of tobacco use. On examination of the left eye, visual acuity was hand motion, and intraocular pressure was 8 mm Hg. The anterior segment showed diffuse conjunctival chemosis of yellow hue, low-grade aqueous reaction, and pseudophakia (Figure 1A). On the fundus evaluation, large pockets of subretinal fluid suggested choroidal effusion based on marked fluid shifting with head position. B-scan ultrasonography confirmed 4-quadrant choroidal hemorrhage and partially mobile serous retinal detachment. B-scans also exhibited a solid lesion from the 6- to 10-o’clock meridians with irregular shape and variable internal reflectivity, measuring 5.8 mm in height. Magnetic resonance imaging was requested to delineate the mass from the surrounding clot (Figure 1B). In the interim, he received oral steroids aiming to contain the abundant exudation and topical atropine for pain, evolving with minimal clinical improvement on these features.

### INPUT:
A patient in their 60s with a medical history of hypertension was referred for new-onset fluctuating diplopia and worsening right upper eyelid ptosis. The patient underwent right-sided ptosis repair at another hospital less than 1 year earlier without improvement. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/30 OU, and pupil examination revealed no anisocoria or afferent pupillary defect. Color vision was full in both eyes. External examination revealed a margin reflex distance 1 (MRD1) of 0 mm OD, 4 mm OS without fatigability in extended upgaze (Figure 1A). The patient had a small exotropia in primary gaze with a −2 supraduction deficit. No proptosis was observed. An ice pack was applied in the clinic to the ptotic eyelid for 2 minutes, which led to a 1.5-mm improvement (Figure 1B) in ptosis and no appreciable change in strabismus. The patient reported no associated headache, weakness, or difficulty swallowing.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Superior divisional oculomotor nerve palsy due to internal carotid artery aneurysm,"1. **Myasthenia Gravis**: The fluctuating nature of the diplopia and ptosis, as well as the improvement with ice pack test, strongly suggest myasthenia gravis. 

2. **Oculomotor Nerve Palsy**: Considered due to ptosis and exotropia with supraduction deficit, though no pupil involvement is atypical.

3. **Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)**: Ptosis and eye movement abnormalities could be indicative of a mitochondrial disorder.

4. **Thyroid Eye Disease**: Could explain diplopia and muscle involvement, but no proptosis makes it less likely.

5. **Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome**: Include due to fluctuating muscle weakness, but diplopia is less common.

6. **Intracranial Neoplasm affecting cranial nerves**: Could lead to eye movement issues and ptosis.

7. **Diabetic Ophthalmoplegia**: Diabetes can cause cranial neuropathies, though the patient is known to have hypertension.

8. **Orbital Myositis**: Infammatory condition causing eye movement restriction and ptosis.

9. **Horner's Syndrome**: Ptosis without anisocoria makes this less likely.

10. **Botulism**: Can cause sudden, bilateral ptosis and muscle weakness, requires consideration in fluctuating symptoms.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:

1. **Myasthenia Gravis**: Most fitting due to fluctuating symptoms and positive ice pack test.
2. **Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)**: Consistent with ptosis and eye movement restrictions.
3. **Oculomotor Nerve Palsy**: Needs to be considered based on symptoms, but lack of pupil involvement and fluctuation is atypical.

5. **Thyroid Eye Disease**: Possible but less likely due to lack of systemic signs.
6. **Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome**: Fluctuation is consistent, but diplopia is less so.
7. **Intracranial Neoplasm affecting cranial nerves**: Consider location affecting cranial nerve III.
8. **Diabetic Ophthalmoplegia**: Due to patient's age and possible microvascular risk.

### INPUT:
A teenaged girl presented to the outpatient clinic with a 1-year history of asymptomatic cutaneous lesions on the face that had progressively spread to the trunk and extremities. She also had asthenia and mild intermittent arthralgias. Physical examination revealed multiple millimetric erythematous to hyperpigmented monomorphic keratotic papules involving the head, trunk, and extremities. Symmetric annular brown erythematous plaques on the cheeks and temples were also seen. There were no vesicles or pustules (Figure, A and B). Laboratory investigations revealed a normal white blood cell count, mild anemia (hemoglobin level, 11.3 g/dL; normal level 12.50-15.50 g/dL; to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0), hypocomplementemia, and moderate proteinuria. Autoimmune serology results showed raised levels of antinuclear antibodies (>1:160), anti-Smith antibodies, SSA/Ro antibodies, SSB/La antibodies, and anti-U1RNP antibodies. Anti-dsDNA antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, rheumatoid factor, IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibody, and anti-β2 glycoprotein 1 antibody results were negative. A biopsy specimen obtained from an erythematous papule on the trunk and stained with hematoxylin-eosin is shown in the Figure, C and D.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Nonbullous neutrophilic lupus erythematosus,"1. **Subacute Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (SCLE)** - Due to the erythematous plaques on the face, positive SSA/Ro antibodies, and systemic symptoms.

2. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** - Supported by hypocomplementemia, positive ANA, anti-Smith and anti-U1RNP antibodies, mild anemia, and moderate proteinuria.

3. **Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD)** - Presence of anti-U1RNP antibodies and overlapping symptoms like arthralgia.

4. **Dermatomyositis** - Due to skin lesions, though the presence of anti-Smith and anti-U1RNP antibodies makes it less likely.

5. **Sjogren’s Syndrome** - Has SSA/Ro and SSB/La antibodies, despite the less common skin manifestations.

6. **Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS)** - Moderately unlikely due to the absence of antiphospholipid antibodies, but sometimes overlaps with lupus.

7. **Primary Sjogren’s Syndrome with Cutaneous Manifestations** - Supported by the presence of SSA/Ro and SSB/La antibodies.

8. **Cutaneous Sarcoidosis** - Due to systemic involvement, though typically lacks specific antibody profile seen here.

9. **Lichen Planus** - Considered for the papular skin lesions but is less likely with the current serology.

10. **Hypocomplementemic Urticarial Vasculitis** - Due to hypocomplementemia, but does not match well with the full clinical and serological profile.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** - Due to comprehensive symptomatology and serologic profile.
2. **Subacute Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (SCLE)** - Less systemic involvement compared to SLE.
3. **Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD)** - Presence of anti-U1RNP and overlapping symptoms gives it prominence.
4. **Dermatomyositis** - Possible consideration, fitting primarily with skin findings.
5. **Primary Sjogren’s Syndrome with Cutaneous Manifestations** - Antibody presence and arthralgia points towards it.
6. **Cutaneous Sarcoidosis** - System involvement considered but less fitting.
7. **Sjogren’s Syndrome** - Other features do not align as strongly.
8. **Hypocomplementemic Urticarial Vasculitis** - Lower likelihood given the full clinical picture.

### INPUT:
A 20-year-old man presented with complaints of blurred vision in his left eye over several weeks and a growing, bulging left-eye mass. His history was notable for bilateral colobomas involving the iris, optic nerve, and retina; congenital cataracts after lensectomy of the left eye; retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy of the left eye requiring a scleral buckle and silicone oil; and intractable glaucoma in the left eye requiring a superior trabeculectomy, an inferotemporal Ahmed tube implant, and multiple diode cyclophotocoagulation treatments. Because of the high risk of retinal redetachment, the silicone oil was retained throughout the glaucoma procedures. The patient presented 9 months after the last cyclophotocoagulation procedure. At presentation, he was taking dorzolamide-timolol, brimonidine, netarsudil, and latanoprost for his left eye. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/80 OD and light perception OS. Intraocular pressures (IOPs) were 11 mm Hg OD and 20 mm Hg OS. Examination of the left eye revealed a large, firm, pink subconjunctival mass inferotemporally near the Ahmed valve (Figure 1). There was a left hypertropia of more than 45° by Hirschberg test. The anterior chamber was deep with fine silicone oil bubbles superiorly. The aphakic left eye revealed a well-positioned tube. Cup-disc ratios were 0.7 OD and 0.8 OS. The retina was centrally attached under silicone oil with a stable peripheral tractional retinal detachment.
### OUTPUT:

1. **Retinoblastoma** - Considering the age of the patient and the eye mass, a retinoblastoma should be ruled out initially given the ocular history.

2. **Conjunctival Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - Given the subconjunctival mass, and the apparent firmness of the growth, this malignancy needs consideration.

3. **Conjunctival Melanoma** - Especially in eye lesions presenting as growing masses, conjunctival melanoma should be on the differential.

4. **Inflammatory Pseudotumor (Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome)** - Though less common, an inflammatory process could present similarly.

5. **Blebitis with Abscess Formation** - Given the history of glaucoma surgery, infection around the surgical site should be assessed.

6. **Mucocele of the Conjunctiva** - A cystic lesion in the area could mimic a mass-like presentation.

7. **Adherent Leukoma** - Secondary to the previous surgical history, complications could form a fibrous-like tissue mass.

8. **Sarcoidosis** - Systemic diseases like sarcoidosis can cause granulomatous lesions in the eye.

9. **Lymphoma** - Primary ocular lymphoma could present as a firm pink mass; it typically requires biopsy for confirmation.

10. **Metastatic Disease** - Though less likely given the age, metastatic carcinoma should be considered with the presentation of new ocular masses.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Retinoblastoma** - Still prioritizes due to age, ophthalmic presentation, and potential urgency.
2. **Conjunctival Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - Prioritizes due to mass-like characteristics and presentation in adults.
3. **Conjunctival Melanoma** - Must be ruled out given presentation.
4. **Inflammatory Pseudotumor (Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome)** - High on the list due to possible inflammatory signs.
5. **Blebitis with Abscess Formation** - Important to rule out due to history of glaucoma surgery.
6. **Lymphoma** - Keeps importance due to presentation.
7. **Sarcoidosis** - Systemic disease with eye involvement remains potential.
8. **Mucocele of the Conjunctiva** - Locations and symptoms align well enough to still consider.
9. **Adherent Leukoma** - Logical given eye history, lower urgency but possible.
10. **Metastatic Disease** - Keeps its spot for completeness in differential diagnosis.","['Ophthalmology', 'Retinal Disorders']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,F

### INPUT:
A man in his mid-20s presented with cardiogenic shock. On presentation, he was afebrile with cool extremities; his blood pressure was 75/51 mm Hg, heart rate was 147 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 99% on mechanical ventilation. His chest examination revealed bilateral coarse breath sounds and distant heart sounds. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 10% with elevated filling pressures and no significant valvular abnormalities. Owing to hemodynamic instability, the patient was given venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) with the peripheral ventricular assist device (pVAD) Impella CP (Abiomed) and was administered high-dose intravenous corticosteroids. Endomyocardial biopsy showed lymphocytic viral myocarditis. There was significant hemodynamic improvement within 48 hours; transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained and showed impressive recovery of the left ventricular function to an ejection fraction of 45%. As a result, ECMO was decannulated after 72 hours. Left pVAD support was maintained alone for another 24 hours. In the interim, his vitals remained unchanged, but the patient developed hematuria and laboratory parameters suggestive of hemolysis. Chest radiography showed pulmonary edema, and low-flow alarms sounded on the device console. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed severe mitral regurgitation (MR), and a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed to evaluate pVAD positioning (Figure and Video).

### INPUT:
A white woman in her early 80s with history of autoimmune pancreatitis, recurrent colon polyps, and benign prostatic hyperplasia developed rapid, painless vision loss of both eyes over a 2-week period 6 months after cataract surgery. Vision was 20/250 OD and 20/60 OS. The anterior segment was unremarkable in either eye, while the posterior segment examination noted 1+ vitreous cell, asteroid hyalosis, and a multilobulated, serous retinal detachment (RD) in the right eye and trace vitreous cell and a multilobulated, serous RD in the left eye. Imaging included B-scan, optical coherence tomography, and fundus autofluorescence, which revealed diffuse choroidal and ciliary body thickening, multifocal pockets of subretinal fluid, and speckled hyperautofluorescence and hypoautofluorescence in both eyes (Figure 1). No poliosis or skin changes were noted. A review of systems was unremarkable, most notably a lack of any pulmonary symptoms. A focused laboratory evaluation identified a significantly elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level and antinuclear antibody titer, but serum lysozyme, syphilis, and tuberculosis testing had negative results. To better differentiate between Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome, a lymphoproliferative disorder, or sarcoidosis as the underlying cause of the vitreous inflammation and multilobulated, serous RD in both eyes, a computed tomographic scan was performed. It showed marked lymphadenopathy throughout the mediastinum and diffuse scleral thickening in both eyes. The institute’s radiologists believed these computed tomography findings were nonspecific and could be indicative of either sarcoidosis or intraocular lymphoma.

### INPUT:
A patient in their 50s presented with asymptomatic keratotic papules, first noticed on the left middle and ring fingers and left toe web spaces more than 10 years earlier. The papules progressed proximally over the subsequent decade to involve the forearm, arm, scapular area, ankle, shin, and thigh, but only affected the left side of the body. The patient’s face, palms, soles, and entire right side of the body were spared. The patient has a history of rosacea being treated with topical metronidazole gel for flares but was otherwise asymptomatic. The patient did not have any alopecia, night blindness, or dry eyes or skin. There was no history of any exposure to radiation or arsenic, nutritional deficiency, inflammatory skin disease, or malignant neoplasm. There was no family history of a similar condition. Examination revealed multiple, submillimeter, skin-colored to yellowish keratotic spiny projections over the aforementioned areas, only on the left side of the body (Figure, A and B). Punch biopsy from a lesion showed orthokeratosis with parakeratotic columns emerging from an epidermal invagination. The epidermis was mildly acanthotic and with a normal granular layer. There was a sparse superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. Adjacent hair follicles were unaffected (Figure, C).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis,"1. **Lichen Spinulosus** - Due to the described keratotic spiny projections and lack of involvement of palms, soles, or face.

2. **Porokeratosis** - Considered due to the lesion's keratotic nature and the description involving orthokeratosis; however, the unilateral distribution is unusual.

3. **Epidermal Nevus** - Given the chronic and progressive nature of the lesions and its unilateral distribution.

4. **Linear Epidermal Nevus** - Due to the segmental or linear distribution pattern along Blaschko's lines, different from a typical nevus.

5. **Unilateral Lichen Planus** - Accounting for the localized nature and keratotic features despite the absence of classic violaceous, polygonal papules.

6. **Inflammatory Linear Verrucous Epidermal Nevus (ILVEN)** - Considered for its chronic, linear, and unilateral distribution, although often pruritic.

7. **Porokeratotic Eccrine Ostial and Dermal Duct Nevus (PEODDN)** - Suggested by the keratotic nature and uniqueness of distribution.

8. **Biopsy-proven Keratosis Follicularis (Darier’s Disease)** - Despite lack of family history, focused on biopsy findings.

9. **Acrokeratosis Verruciformis of Hopf** - Due to verruciform and keratotic nature of the papules; usually presents bilaterally affecting extensor surfaces.

10. **Unilateral Segmental Darier's Disease** - Unlikely due to the absence of nail and mucosal involvement, but considered because of chronicity and biopsy characteristics.

### Reranked Diagnosis: 

1. **Epidermal Nevus** - Most consistent with the presentation given the unilateral involvement and biopsy findings.
2. **Inflammatory Linear Verrucous Epidermal Nevus (ILVEN)** - Due to its chronic, unilateral presentation.
3. **Porokeratosis** - Based on orthokeratosis and parakeratotic columns findings.
4. **Porokeratotic Eccrine Ostial and Dermal Duct Nevus (PEODDN)** - Fits the description of keratotic lesions.
5. **Lichen Spinulosus** - Despite typically being more widespread, the presentation matches regarding keratotic papules.
6. **Linear Epidermal Nevus** - Similar to epidermal nevus but focusing on linear spread.
7. **Acrokeratosis Verruciformis of Hopf** - Considered further despite bilateral tendency due to keratotic nature.
8. **Biopsy-proven Keratosis Follicularis (Darier’s Disease)** - Falls further down due to lack of common systemic involvement.
9. **Unilateral Lichen Planus** - Uncommon presentation but still within the differential.

### INPUT:
A White man in his 40s was referred to an outside ophthalmologist after developing nausea and a headache following a dilated eye examination. He was found to have narrow angles in both eyes and a laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) was performed in his left eye. Two weeks later he developed flickering photopsias and a temporal scotoma progressing to a “brown tint” of his vision in his left eye. His vision had decreased in his left eye and macular and optic nerve edema were noted and he was subsequently referred to us. In our clinic, his visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/50 OS, and he had normal intraocular pressure, a shallow anterior chamber but open angle in both eyes, a patent LPI in the left eye, and clear crystalline lenses in both eyes. The rest of his anterior segment was unremarkable. The posterior examination was notable for shifting subretinal fluid with choroidal detachments without retinal breaks, inflammation, or optic nerve edema and leopard spotting, while his right eye was unremarkable (Figure, A). Fluorescein angiography was unrevealing, while optical coherence tomography showed shallow subretinal fluid and an irregular and thickened choroid (Figure, B). Ultrasonography showed an axial length of 20.0 mm, thickened sclera, anteriorly rotated ciliary body, and 360° of ciliochoroidal detachments in both eyes but worse in the left eye. Results of a systemic laboratory evaluation for infectious and noninfectious disorders were unremarkable. Systemic corticosteroids failed to resolve the subretinal fluid and his vision declined.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Uveal effusion syndrome,"**Step 1**: **Nanophthalmos**  
Due to the small axial length and thickened sclera detected through ultrasonography.

**Step 2**: **Uveal Effusion Syndrome**  
Based on the presence of ciliochoroidal detachments and leopard spotting of the fundus without inflammation.

**Step 3**: **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy**  
Considered because of shallow subretinal fluid and thickened choroid on optical coherence tomography.

**Step 4**: **Hypotony**  
Given the shallow anterior chamber and history of recent ocular procedure, though less likely due to normal intraocular pressure.

**Step 5**: **Posterior Scleritis**   
Due to the thickened sclera and potential symptoms aligning with scleritis presentations.

**Step 6**: **Primary Angle-Closure Glaucoma**  
Previously undiagnosed, could explain shallow anterior chambers, although angles are open currently.

**Step 7**: **Idiopathic Choroidal Effusion**  
A potential cause when infectious and noninfectious tests return unremarkable results, with no systemic associations found.

**Step 8**: **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease**  
Though typically involves inflammation, choroidal thickening could align, but less likely without systemic autoimmune indicators.

**Step 9**: **Retinal Detachment**  
Ruled out due to lack of retinal breaks, but considered due to symptoms of photopsias and vision changes.

**Step 10**: **Medication-induced Ocular Effects**  
Possible if recent medication changes not presented or known systemic medication with ocular side effects.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on Provided Information:
1. **Uveal Effusion Syndrome** - Fits with leopard spotting, subretinal fluid, and negative lab results.
2. **Nanophthalmos** - Matching with small axial length and scleral thickening.
3. **Idiopathic Choroidal Effusion** - Consistent with unremarkable test results and clinical findings.
4. **Posterior Scleritis** - Possible due to thickened sclera and overall ocular findings.
5. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy** - Subretinal fluid and choroidal features aligning but less likely due to presentation.
6. **Hypotony** - Less likely given normal intraocular pressure but considered due to symptom overlap.
7. **Primary Angle-Closure Glaucoma** - Unlikely with current open angles.
8. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease** - Lower likelihood due to absence of systemic symptoms.
9. **Retinal Detachment** - Unlikely without retinal breaks.
10. **Medication-induced Ocular Effects** - Considered if further information on systemic medications were relevant.","['Glaucoma', 'Ophthalmology', 'Choroidal Disorders', 'Retinal Disorders']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,40.0,F

### INPUT:
A man in his 40s with a medical history of multiple sclerosis consulted for the sudden development of 2 adjacent nodules on the left arm. An excision with 1-cm margins of the left arm demonstrated desmoplastic melanoma with a Breslow thickness of 1 mm, and a left axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) had been performed 3 weeks before under general anesthesia. The patient was also being treated with subcutaneous interferon beta 1a for the multiple sclerosis. Physical examination revealed 2 indurated and mobile subcutaneous nodules on the anterior surface of the arm 5 cm distal to the surgical scar, the larger of them measuring 15 mm in diameter (Figure, A) and the smaller of them measuring 4 mm. When the arm was abducted to 90°, the patient denied pain but described a subtle tightness sensation on the arm. An excisional biopsy from the larger lesion was performed (Figure, B-D).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Axillary web syndrome,"1. Metastatic melanoma - Given the patient's medical history of desmoplastic melanoma and the appearance of new nodules near the surgical site, metastatic spread should be considered.

2. Cutaneous sarcoidosis - Sarcoidosis can present with subcutaneous nodules and should be considered, especially in the setting of systemic symptoms.

3. Lipoma - A benign lipoma could be a possibility given the subcutaneous and mobile nature of the nodules.

4. Lymphoma - Cutaneous lymphomas can present as subcutaneous nodules and are a potential diagnosis in patients with a compromised immune system.

5. Granuloma annulare - This skin condition can present as indurated nodules and should be considered, particularly in the presence of non-specific tightness.

6. Abscess - The recent surgical history could predispose the patient to an abscess, though it typically presents with pain and systemic signs of infection.

7. Dermatofibroma - While typically benign and more common in females, this condition can present as firm nodules in the skin.

8. Hematoma - The recent surgical intervention could cause a hematoma, especially given the history of recent sentinel lymph node biopsy.

9. Neurofibroma - Given a history of neurological conditions, neurofibromas are a consideration, although they are often multiple and associated with neurofibromatosis.

### INPUT:
A 55-year-old woman with advanced primary open-angle glaucoma presented with 1 day of decreased vision and eye pain. She had undergone trabeculectomy and 5-fluorouracil injection 1 month prior. On initial examination, her visual acuity was 20/25. She had diffuse conjunctival hyperemia without bleb purulence or leakage and more than 50 cells per high-power field of a 1 × 1-mm area of light on slitlamp biomicroscopy. She was treated for blebitis with topical fortified antibiotics but subsequently developed vitritis. She underwent vitreous tap and injection of vancomycin and amikacin followed by pars plana vitrectomy with bleb revision. Separate vitreous samples from each procedure were sent for Gram stain and bacterial and fungal culture on chocolate and Sabouraud agar with no growth. Her eye pain worsened significantly, and ultrasound biomicroscopy showed scleral thickening (Figure 1A). Lab workup for autoimmune scleritis including tests for rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies was negative. She was admitted to the hospital and started intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam treatment. Her vision continued to decline to counting fingers because of the development of a dense cataract with retrolenticular plaque (Figure 1B).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Aspergillus fumigatus endophthalmitis and scleritis,"1. **Blebitis** - Initially considered due to the recent history of trabeculectomy and presentation with conjunctival hyperemia and eye pain.

2. **Endophthalmitis** - Suspected following the development of vitritis and worsening eye pain, prompting vitreous tap and vitrectomy.

3. **Sterile Endophthalmitis** - Considered after cultures returned negative for bacterial and fungal growth, suggesting inflammation without infection.

4. **Scleritis** - Suggested by ultrasound showing scleral thickening, although autoimmune workup was negative.

5. **Non-infectious Uveitis** - As inflammation persisted and cultures were negative, a non-infectious inflammatory process like uveitis was considered.

6. **Medication Reaction or Toxicity** - Investigated due to recent surgical interventions and medication use, though specific toxic agents cannot be conclusively identified.

7. **Secondary Glaucoma** - Possible development secondary to severe intraocular inflammation and structural changes post-surgery.

8. **Retained Lens Fragments or Silicon Oil** - Inflammation due to retained material post-vitrectomy or previous surgeries.

9. **Infectious Posterior Uveitis (viral)** - Considered due to ocular inflammation and progression, despite negative bacterial cultures.

A 57-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with 5 months of epigastric pain and a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss. She had no fevers or night sweats. Physical examination was notable for oral thrush and mild epigastric tenderness. Results of a fourth-generation HIV Ab/Ag combination assay were positive, and subsequent testing showed a CD4 cell count of 16/mm3 and an HIV viral load greater than 10 million copies/mL. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis showed thickening of the walls of the stomach, duodenum, and colon as well as multiple masses in the right hepatic lobe measuring up to 6.9 cm in diameter. A core biopsy of one of the liver masses demonstrated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. She started antiretroviral therapy with bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir/alafenamide and chemotherapy with rituximab, etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (R-EPOCH). Four weeks after initiation of chemotherapy, the patient developed sudden onset of bright red blood per rectum, tachycardia, and hypotension. Mesenteric computed tomography angiography demonstrated active extravasation in the jejunum from a branch of the superior mesenteric artery. After unsuccessful coil embolization, she underwent open resection of 40 cm of distal small intestine; pathological examination of a stained section showed acute inflammation of the lamina propria, with crypt epithelial apoptosis and numerous cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusions with an “owl eye” appearance (Figure 1, left panel). Five weeks later, she developed blurred vision, and visual acuity testing revealed 20/50 vision in the left eye and 20/70 in the right eye. A dilated retinal examination revealed extensive macular hemorrhage in the left eye, with peripapillary whitening and perivascular hemorrhage with whitening along the superior vascular arcade (Figure, right panel).

### INPUT:
A 49-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension, intravenous drug abuse, and multiple sexual partners presented to the emergency department with painless vision loss in both eyes for 10 days, left eye worse than right eye, and photophobia in both eyes. Her visual acuity was count fingers OD and 20/70 OS. Intraocular pressure was 20 mm Hg OD and 16 mm Hg OS. There were 1+ (10-12 cells/high-power field) anterior chamber cells in both eyes with very hazy posterior pole details in the right eye and minimal vitreous haze in the left eye. There was a hazy view to the posterior pole in the right eye with disc edema and multiple flame hemorrhages surrounding the nerve. Examination of the posterior pole in the left eye revealed partial obstruction of all vessels and a complete halo on the disc with numerous flame hemorrhages emanating from and surrounding the optic nerve, along with a few dot blot hemorrhages within the macula (Figure). Her blood pressure was 173/137 mm Hg, but the rest of her vital signs were normal.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Syphilitic panuveitis and optic neuritis,"1. **Cytomegalovirus Retinitis** - This is considered due to her history of intravenous drug use and multiple sexual partners, placing her at risk for immunosuppression (e.g., HIV), which is a known risk factor for CMV retinitis presenting with retinal hemorrhages and inflammation.

2. **Bacterial Endophthalmitis** - Considering her history of intravenous drug abuse, there is a potential risk for bacterial seeding causing infection within the eye, which can lead to visual loss and is characterized by inflammation in the anterior and posterior segments of the eye.

3. **Viral Retinitis (Herpes Simplex or Herpes Zoster)** - Given the ocular involvement and her history of multiple risk factors, a viral retinitis owing to herpes viruses is a consideration, particularly for retinal necrosis and inflammation.

4. **Hypertensive Retinopathy** - Her elevated blood pressure could suggest hypertensive retinopathy, which can cause flame hemorrhages and disc edema, contributing to visual impairment.

5. **HIV-Associated Neuroretinal Disorder** - Assuming an underlying HIV infection due to her risk factors, HIV-associated retinal conditions might result in visual dysfunction alongside anterior chamber inflammation.

6. **Drug-Induced Ocular Toxicity** - If she is taking any specific medications or substances either prescribed or unregulated, there might be potential ocular side effects contributing to visual loss.

7. **Syphilitic Uveitis/Retinitis** - In light of multiple sexual partners, syphilis remains a potential cause wherein ocular syphilis can manifest with retinitis and uveitis leading to impaired vision.

8. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion** - The obstruction in vessels and flame hemorrhages points towards a vascular occlusion like CRVO, which is common in hypertensive or diabetic patients.

9. **Non-Infectious Uveitis (e.g., Sarcoidosis)** - Though less likely, non-infectious causes of anterior chamber inflammation such as sarcoidosis could cause similar presentations of eye inflammation and vision problems.

10. **Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)** - Although traditionally presenting younger and without inflammation, hereditary optic neuropathies could be considered as rare possibilities particularly in the setting of optic nerve changes.

### INPUT:
Final diagnosis: Hair follicle nevus.  
Case report: A female in her late teens presented with asymptomatic congenital papules, plaques, and nodules in a linear bilateral distribution following Blaschko lines on the scalp and face region. The papules and nodules appeared to grow as the girl grew, and some pedunculated lesions tended to fall off spontaneously. She had not received any prior treatment. The patient had no other significant medical history and denied having a family history of similar lesions. Clinical examination findings revealed multiple skin-colored, nontender soft papules of varying sizes protruding from the skin surface on the right cheek, forehead, and jaw, as well as on the anterior surface of the scalp, distributed along Blaschko lines, with sparse vellus hairs and multiple hair follicles on the lesions (Figure, A and B). However, no hair was observed on the lesion because the patient had shaved the hair on her face. An incisional biopsy of a pedunculated lesion above the left eyebrow was performed (Figure, B).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Hair follicle nevus,"To arrive at a differential diagnosis for this case, let's proceed step-by-step:

1. **Epidermal Nevus**: Given the presentation of congenital asymptomatic linear lesions distributed along Blaschko lines, an epidermal nevus is a strong initial consideration.

2. **Nevus Sebaceous**: These are often present at birth or early childhood and can follow Blaschko lines, especially in the scalp region where they might involve hair follicles.

3. **Linear Epidermal Nevus Syndrome**: This can cause skin lesions along Blaschko's lines associated with developmental abnormalities and syndromic features, although no systemic symptoms are noted here.

4. **Inflammatory Linear Verrucous Epidermal Nevus (ILVEN)**: Typically pruritic and often appearing in childhood, it follows Blaschko's lines and though more likely to be erythematous, it deserves consideration.

5. **Linear Verrucous Epidermal Nevus**: Similar to ILVEN but typically non-pruritic, which could match this patient's description.

6. **Fox-Fordyce Disease**: Rare and often involves the apocrine sweat glands, lesions can appear along Blaschko's lines but this is generally pruritic, thus less likely.

7. **Nevus Comedonicus**: Presents with comedo-like openings along lines of Blaschko and could resemble these features, although histopathology would likely distinguish this.

8. **Segmental Neurofibromatosis**: Neurofibromas can appear in a linear pattern and with varying growth sizes, though often associated with café-au-lait spots or other systemic findings.

9. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans (DFSP)**: Generally more aggressive and unlikely given the soft nature of the lesions and the histopathology expected from the biopsy.

10. **Linear Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome**: This syndrome could present with multiple basal cell nevi but normally involves other systemic manifestations unlike this case.

Now, reranking the differential diagnosis after analyzing all relevant information:

1. **Hair Follicle Nevus**: Given the description, biopsy results, and absence of other systemic symptoms, this clearly fits the final diagnosis.
2. **Nevus Sebaceous**: Remains closely related based on presentation, although less likely after biopsy results.
3. **Epidermal Nevus**: Common and fits many initial descriptors.
4. **Linear Verrucous Epidermal Nevus**: Nonspecific but possible given lesion appearance.
5. **Inflammatory Linear Verrucous Epidermal Nevus (ILVEN)**: Less likely due to lack of pruritus.
6. **Nevus Comedonicus**: Possible but distanced due to lack of comedone-like lesions.
7. **Segmental Neurofibromatosis**: Less likely without systemic findings.
8. **Linear Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome**: Histopathology would have supported if this were accurate.
9. **Linear Epidermal Nevus Syndrome**: Unlikely without developmental manifestations.
10. **Fox-Fordyce Disease**: Improbable given the clinical presentation and lack of pruritus.

The final differential lends strong support to the confirmed diagnosis of a Hair Follicle Nevus, based on morphological, distributional, and histopathological findings.","['Dermatology', 'Hair Disorders', 'Nevi', 'Pediatrics', 'Adolescent Medicine']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,18.0,M

### INPUT:
A man in his 20s was referred for evaluation of a 4-year history of recurrent pustular eruptions on his face, which initially presented while he was vacationing in Florida. He noted mild associated pruritus but denied burning sensation. The eruptions occurred intermittently, appearing as erythematous papules with prominent pustules, and were exacerbated by sunlight. On average, his lesions would resolve in 3 to 4 days with only mild background erythema by 5 to 7 days. Even mild sun exposure would induce the eruption, leading to frequent recurrences in summer months but long periods of remission in the fall through spring. Trials with various broad-spectrum sunscreens in combination with topical and oral antibiotics and topical ivermectin did not prevent flares or mitigate severity of eruptions when they occurred. He denied joint pain, fever, fatigue, changes in urine color, use of other topical or systemic medications, or presence of rashes elsewhere. He was otherwise healthy without other medical history. On physical examination, he was well appearing with numerous 1- to 2-mm monomorphous pustules over background erythema on the medial cheeks, chin, and nose (Figure, A). No nail fold capillary changes or mucosal lesions were observed. Serum analysis results for antinuclear, anti-SSA/Ro, and anti-SSB/La antibodies were negative. A 4-mm punch biopsy was taken from a representative lesion along the right jawline (Figure, B-D).

### INPUT:
Final diagnosis: Vaccination-associated reactive lymphadenopathy.  
Case report: A 39-year-old healthy man without family history of malignancy found a mass in his right breast at 38 weeks of his partner's pregnancy. Prior to delivery, he underwent diagnostic ultrasound of the right breast, which showed a possible mass in the location of the palpable lesion that was most consistent with a normal island of fibroglandular tissue. Follow-up mammogram and ultrasound of the right breast (without axillary evaluation) were performed 6 months later, which showed an irregular 17-mm mass with associated pleomorphic calcifications in the same area. Ultrasound-guided biopsy was performed. Pathology showed high-grade, estrogen receptor–positive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). On postbiopsy physical examination, the patient had a palpable 2.5-cm right breast mass at the 3-o’clock position without palpable axillary lymphadenopathy. Surgical treatment with lumpectomy was recommended, and breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed prior to surgery to evaluate the extent of disease (Figure). Axial T2-weighted MRI at the level of the axilla revealed edema surrounding 2 enlarged, morphologically abnormal right level-1 axillary lymph nodes; axial postcontrast T1 fat-saturated MRI of the right breast revealed an irregular mass with irregular margins at the site of biopsy-proven DCIS. The patient reported receiving his second dose of COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) in the right arm the day before the breast MRI.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Vaccination-associated reactive lymphadenopathy,"To conduct a systematic differential diagnosis process, we will evaluate the presented case information step by step, arriving at a list of potential diagnoses. In each step, I will present one possible differential diagnosis:

1. **Breast Cancer (Male):** Given the initial presentation of a breast mass, the highly suspicious features on imaging, and an eventual pathologic diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), breast cancer is initially the foremost consideration.

2. **Gynecomastia:** In men, palpable masses in the breast region could suggest gynecomastia, particularly considering other non-cancerous causes such as hormonal imbalance, which may mimic the presentation of a breast mass.

3. **Breast Cyst:** Although less likely due to the irregular appearance on imaging, benign breast cysts could account for a palpable breast mass, prompting further evaluation.

4. **Benign Fibroadenoma:** Rare but possible in males, fibroadenomas can present as palpable breast masses and often require imaging to differentiate from malignant lesions.

5. **Fat Necrosis:** Post-biopsy or trauma-related fat necrosis may appear as irregular masses on imaging, which could be mistaken for cancerous lesions.

6. **Suspicious Male Breast Papilloma:** Intraductal papilloma, although rare in males, can present with symptoms and imaging findings similar to those described.

7. **Pseudogynecomastia:** Adipose tissue prominence can sometimes be interpreted as a mass, especially in the context of ultrasound findings describing fibroglandular tissue.

8. **Inflammatory Breast Lesion:** The presence of edema and enlarged lymph nodes raises differential considerations such as mastitis or similar inflammatory breast conditions.

9. **Vaccination-associated Reactive Lymphadenopathy:** Given the recent COVID-19 vaccination, enlarged lymph nodes could reflect a reactive process rather than malignancy.

10. **Metastatic Disease:** The enlarged axillary lymph nodes could theoretically suggest metastatic spread from another primary site, although much less likely given the context.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses Based on Full Case Information:

1. **Vaccination-associated Reactive Lymphadenopathy:** The timing of recent COVID-19 vaccination and subsequent imaging findings of lymph node enlargement are highly suggestive of this diagnosis.
2. **Breast Cancer (Male, Ductal Carcinoma In Situ):** Confirmed with biopsy, presence on MRI, and consistent with the patient’s symptoms.
3. **Gynecomastia:** Possible, but pathology results confirm DCIS rather than benign conditions.
4. **Fat Necrosis:** Previous biopsies might contribute to non-malignant findings on imaging if not for confirmed pathology.
5. **Inflammatory Breast Lesion:** Imaging could suggest concurrent inflammatory processes, but not supported by pathologic findings.
6. **Benign Fibroadenoma:** Much less common in males and not consistent with current pathological findings.
7. **Suspicious Male Breast Papilloma:** Ruled out by pathology.
8. **Metastatic Disease:** No evidence of primary malignancy elsewhere to suggest metastasis.
9. **Breast Cyst:** Unlikely due to definitive pathologic diagnosis of DCIS.
10. **Pseudogynecomastia:** Not consistent with imaging or pathology findings.","['Breast Cancer', 'Oncology', 'Radiology', ""Women's Health"", 'Vaccination']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,39.0,F

### INPUT:
Final diagnosis: Pediatric neurosarcoidosis.
Case report: A 12-year-old boy presented for assessment of abnormal gait. A year prior, he was found to have bilateral panuveitis with occlusive retinal periphlebitis involving all quadrants of the central and peripheral retina with capillary nonperfusion (Figure 1). His subsequent workup revealed elevated inflammatory markers and subcentimeter chest and abdominal lymph nodes. Given a positive interferon-γ release assay, therapy was initiated with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol (RIPE) and corticosteroids for presumed tuberculosis. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pediatric neurosarcoidosis,"1. Tuberculosis - Initial diagnosis based on positive interferon-γ release assay, leading to RIPE therapy initiation.
2. Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (with uveitis) - Presence of bilateral panuveitis and abnormal gait could be attributed to systemic symptoms.
3. Sarcoidosis - Given the presence of bilateral panuveitis, lymphadenopathy, and elevated inflammatory markers.
4. Behçet's Disease - Considering bilateral panuveitis and systemic inflammation.
5. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus - Could present with multisystem involvement including eye involvement and elevated inflammatory markers.
6. Multiple Sclerosis - As a cause of neurological symptoms and abnormal gait; however, less common in this age group.
7. Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis) - Due to ocular involvement and systemic inflammation.
8. Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension - Considering neurological symptoms presenting as abnormal gait, rare in males.
9. Lymphoma - Given the presence of lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms.
10. Neuro-Behçet's Syndrome - A rare form of Behçet's with neurologic symptoms, explaining the abnormal gait.

Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. Sarcoidosis - The ocular involvement and lymphadenopathy weigh heavily towards sarcoidosis, especially with elevated inflammatory markers.
2. Tuberculosis - Initially presumed due to positive test results, but less likely with lack of classic systemic TB symptoms.
3. Neuro-Behçet's Syndrome - The neurological presentation and ocular findings suggest this rare diagnosis.
4. Behçet's Disease - Multisystem vascular involvement makes this a plausible differential.
5. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus - Due to multisystem involvement potential, though less common at this age.
6. Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (with uveitis) - Because of uveitis and systemic symptoms, though gait involvement is uncommon.
7. Lymphoma - The lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms require consideration.
8. Wegener's Granulomatosis - Includes both ocular and systemic manifestations.
9. Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension - Rare in this demographic, considered due to neurological signs.
10. Multiple Sclerosis - Less likely due to the age and symptom presentation primarily, as well as lack of other classic MS symptoms or findings.","['Adolescent Medicine', 'Neuro-ophthalmology', 'Neurology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Intraocular Inflammation']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,12.0,F

### INPUT:
A 51-year-old man presented with a 1-month history of intense and worsening polyarthralgia and swelling of bilateral fingers and toes. There was no history of alopecia, oral ulcers, rashes, or Raynaud phenomenon. He did not report preceding fever, diarrhea, or dysuria. There was no history of weight loss or anorexia. Medical history included tertiary hyperparathyroidism related to end-stage kidney disease from chronic glomerulonephritis. The patient had successfully received an ABO-incompatible kidney transplant 1 year ago, but this was complicated by invasive fungal (Volvariella volvacea) infection of the central nervous system. Medications included tacrolimus (0.5 mg twice daily), prednisolone (10 mg daily), cinacalcet (12.5 mg daily), and voriconazole (500 mg daily). On examination, his fingers and toes were symmetrically and diffusely swollen and tender. There was no rash, enthesitis, psoriatic nail changes, clubbing, or lower limb edema. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Alkaline phosphatase level was elevated at 640 U/L (10.69 μkat/L) (reference range, 40-130 U/L [0.67-2.17 μkat/L]). Corrected calcium and parathyroid hormone levels were 10.88 mg/dL (2.71 mmol/L) (reference range, 8.6-10.2 mg/dL [2.15-2.55 mmol/L]) and 23.7 pmol/L (reference range, 1.3-9.3), respectively. Serum bilirubin, aspartate transferase, alanine transferase, creatinine, and phosphate levels were within reference ranges. Free thyroxine and thyrotropin levels were normal.

### Rationale:
- Elevated alkaline phosphatase and calcium levels could suggest mixed crystal arthropathy or secondary hyperparathyroidism complications which are consistent with CPPD deposition disease.
- Known history of secondary hyperparathyroidism with elevated parathyroid hormone levels suggests possible skeletal manifestations.
- Gout remains considered given polyarthralgia, but absence of tophi and specific crystal deposition requires further evidence.
- Amyloidosis considered due to renal transplant and potential protein deposition influence on arthralgia.
- Psoriatic arthritis and reactive arthritis considered less likely due to lack of skin/nail changes and preceding infection.
- Sarcoidosis and SLE less likely due to absence of typical systemic symptoms.
- Ankylosing spondylitis and multiple myeloma lower due to lack of spinal involvement/specific lab markers.","['Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology', 'Nephrology', 'Rheumatology', 'Transplantation', 'Adverse Drug Events']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,51.0,F

### INPUT:
A 58-year-old woman was referred for evaluation of a retinal detachment in her left eye. Her visual acuity on presentation was 20/20 in the right eye and hand motion only in the left eye. Examination of the right eye was normal. Anterior segment examination of the left eye revealed around 30 cells per high-power field of a 1 mm × 1 mm light beam and diffuse stellate-appearing keratic precipitates. Posterior examination results showed a vitreous cell that precluded a clear view of the posterior pole and inferior snow banking. Most notable was a large, white, preretinal lesion in the inferior macula and a near-total retinal detachment with no identifiable retinal break and shifting subretinal fluid (Figure).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Ocular and disseminated toxoplasmosis with toxoplasmic myocarditis,"Based on the provided clinical presentation, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis list:

1. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease**: Given the presentation of retinal detachment and vitritis, VKH disease is a possibility due to its association with panuveitis and exudative retinal detachments.

2. **Primary Intraocular Lymphoma**: The age of the patient and vitreous involvement warrant considering intraocular lymphoma, as it can present with vitreous cells and retinal detachment.

3. **Cytomegalovirus Retinitis**: Although rare in immunocompetent individuals, this condition should be considered due to the presence of retinal detachment and vitreous inflammation.

4. **Sarcoidosis**: Non-caseating granulomas can lead to uveitis and retinal detachment, making sarcoidosis a differential diagnosis given vitreous opacities and other systemic signs.

5. **Tuberculosis-Associated Uveitis**: This chronic granulomatous disease can present similarly with posterior segment inflammation and retinal detachment.

6. **Syphilitic Uveitis**: Syphilis in its late stages can cause posterior uveitis, possibly leading to retinal detachment.

7. **Pars Planitis**: Also known as intermediate uveitis, presenting with vitreous cells and snow banking fits well with pars planitis features.

8. **Behçet's Disease**: Since Behçet's disease can cause retinal vasculitis and uveitis, leading to retinal detachment, it should be considered.

9. **Retinal Vasculitis**: Isolated retinal vasculitis could contribute to such presentation, especially with the presence of snow banking and vitreous cells.

10. **Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment Without Break**: Although uncommon, it remains a consideration if the detachment cannot be otherwise explained.

After reviewing results from any available tests or patient history provided, the differential diagnoses can be re-ranked:

1. **Primary Intraocular Lymphoma** - High index of suspicion due to vitreous cell aggregates and unilateral presentation.
2. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease** - Less likely without systemic findings, but still possible.
3. **Sarcoidosis** - Granulomatous uveitis can explain the findings.
4. **Pars Planitis** - Fits the classic snow banking sign.
5. **Retinal Vasculitis** - Could be isolated or secondary to another systemic condition.
6. **Behçet's Disease** - Consider systemic signs if present.
7. **Tuberculosis-Associated Uveitis** - Check for systemic tuberculosis.
8. **Syphilitic Uveitis** - Consider testing if risk factors or serology are suggestive.
9. **Cytomegalovirus Retinitis** - Unlikely without immunosuppression.
10. **Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment Without Break** - Very rare, last consideration if others are ruled out.","['Global Health', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Ophthalmology', 'Retinal Disorders']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,58.0,M

### INPUT:
A 46-year-old woman presented with acute-onset weakness of her bilateral lower limbs for 3 days, accompanied by ascending numbness to just below her nipples. Three weeks prior, she had developed acute urinary retention. Neurological examination revealed weakness in bilateral lower limbs (Medical Research Council grade 4 on the right and grade 3 on the left), extensor plantar responses, and a sensory level at T6. Magnetic resonance imaging of her thoracic spine was performed 10 days after the onset of weakness and did not show any signal abnormalities or restricted diffusion. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis findings were remarkable for elevated protein (0.14 g/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10]) but white cell count (5 cells/mm3) and glucose levels (54.05 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555]) were normal. Cytology and flow cytometry were negative for malignancy. Antibodies to aquaporin 4 and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein were not detected. The patient developed a sudden worsening of weakness in her legs 2 weeks after initial presentation. Repeated thoracic spine imaging showed an area of T2 hyperintensity in the left posterolateral cord at T7, which did not enhance with contrast or show restricted diffusion (Figure 1A). Notably, she had a 4-year history of an asymptomatic papular skin eruption with more lesions developing in the last 4 months. These were distributed on the neck, trunk, and limbs, sparing her face, scalp, and genitalia (Figure 1B). Findings of extensive workup for malignancy, including full-body computed tomography scan, paraneoplastic antibody panel, and systemic autoimmune diseases (antinuclear antibody, antidouble stranded DNA, and myositis antibody panel), were negative. The skin papules were biopsied.

A 46-year-old woman presented with a 2-week history of a persistent blurred area in her right lower visual field of both eyes. She noticed colors surrounding the dark area that lasted 2 to 3 minutes at a time and occurred multiple times per day. Her medical history was significant for dyslipidemia for which she took rosuvastatin. She also reported feeling lethargic, with polydipsia and a dull mild holocephalic headache during this period. Ophthalmological examination revealed a visual acuity of 20/20 OU, pupils were equal and reactive to light with no relative afferent pupillary defect, and color vision was normal. Dilated fundus examination was normal. Humphrey 24-2 Swedish interactive threshold algorithm fast visual field testing revealed a right homonymous hemianopia denser inferiorly (Figure, A). An urgent noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head was obtained and was normal (Figure, B).

### INPUT:
A 63-year-old man was referred by optometry after waking up with cloudy vision in the left eye and an ache around the left brow. Visual acuity was 20/20 OD and light perception OS. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 15 mm Hg OD and 54 mm Hg OS. Anterior segment examination of the left eye was remarkable for a large cystic iris stromal lesion from the 2- to 7-o’clock position with iris-cornea touch. The anterior chamber was shallow in the area of the enlarged cystic lesion with a large amount of pigmented cells. The pupil was irregular with blood at the pupillary margin. His intraocular lens was not visible because of occlusion by a cystic lesion behind the iris (Figure 1). His ocular history was notable for indiscriminate trauma to his left eye, primary open-angle glaucoma in both eyes treated with dorzolamide hydrochloride and brimonidine tartrate, and pseudophakia in both eyes. Four years prior, an inferior cystic iris stromal lesion was discovered in the left eye that measured approximately 5 × 2 mm in basal dimensions at the slitlamp. Fine-needle aspiration was negative for malignancy, and the lesion was managed by close follow-up.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Secondary angle-closure glaucoma due to sudden enlargement of a cystic iris stromal lesion,"1. **Primary Angle-Closure Glaucoma** - The presence of high intraocular pressure and shallow anterior chamber could suggest primary angle-closure glaucoma, particularly in an eye with anatomical predisposition.

2. **Secondary Glaucoma from Iris Cyst** - The large cystic lesion obstructing the pupil and causing increased intraocular pressure suggests secondary glaucoma resulting from mechanical obstruction.

3. **Uveitis-Glaucoma-Hyphema (UGH) Syndrome** - Blood at the pupillary margin and elevated IOP may suggest UGH syndrome, particularly in a pseudophakic eye.

4. **Neovascular Glaucoma** - While there's no mention of retinal ischemia or diabetes, the possibility of neovascularization due to other causes should be considered.

5. **Intraocular Tumor** - The large cystic mass could represent a previously undetected intraocular tumor exerting mass effect and causing secondary glaucoma.

6. **Iris Bombe** - An iris lesion causing a circumferential apposition of the iris to the lens, leading to a shallow anterior chamber.

7. **Lens-Induced Glaucoma** - Although pseudophakic, any remaining lens material or dislocated IOL might rarely contribute to secondary glaucoma.

8. **Trabecular Blockage from Pigment Dispersion** - The presence of pigmented cells in the anterior chamber can indicate pigment dispersion, causing secondary glaucoma.

9. **Iridocorneal Endothelial (ICE) Syndrome** - Presents with abnormalities in the iris and may lead to secondary glaucoma.

10. **Trauma-Induced Glaucoma** - The history of indiscriminate trauma and current findings could suggest a traumatic mechanism contributing to glaucoma.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Secondary Glaucoma from Iris Cyst** - Given the significant size of the cystic lesion and its mechanical obstruction.
   
2. **Primary Angle-Closure Glaucoma** - Considered due to high IOP and shallow anterior chamber.

3. **Trauma-Induced Glaucoma** - Historical trauma may have long-term structural effects contributing to the current pathology.

4. **Intraocular Tumor** - Need for exclusion due to potential mass effect and complex clinical picture.

5. **Uveitis-Glaucoma-Hyphema (UGH) Syndrome** - Consistent with pseudophakia history and symptoms presented.

6. **Iris Bombe** - Anatomical configuration may explain the shallow anterior chamber.

7. **Neovascular Glaucoma** - Although lacking classic cause, should be considered for completeness.

8. **Trabecular Blockage from Pigment Dispersion** - Given the pigmented cells seen in the anterior chamber.

9. **Iridocorneal Endothelial (ICE) Syndrome** - Less likely due to lack of endothelial changes detailed but considered.

10. **Lens-Induced Glaucoma** - Unlikely due to pseudophakia but still within differential due to clinical picture.","['Glaucoma', 'Ophthalmology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,63.0,F

### INPUT:
A 72-year-old man presented with new-onset decreased vision in the right eye. His ocular history included pseudoexfoliation syndrome and glaucomatous optic neuropathy in the right eye. Past ocular surgery included uncomplicated trabeculectomy in the right eye treated with mitomycin C (3 months prior) and no ocular surgery history in the left eye. His medical history included pulmonary Mycobacterium avium infection secondary to hypogammaglobulinemia. Computed tomography scan 2 months prior exhibited reactivation and he started treatment with clarithromycin (1000 mg/d), ethambutol (15 mg/kg/d), and rifabutin (300 mg/d). Best-corrected visual acuity was hand motions OD and 20/20 OS. Intraocular pressures were 4 mm Hg OD and 13 mm Hg OS. Anterior segment examination of the right eye showed substantial conjunctival hyperemia and substantial cellular response in the anterior chamber (2 to 3+) along with a 1-mm hypopyon. There was no leak at the trabeculectomy bleb (negative Seidel test). B-scan ultrasonography showed no retinal detachment or mass. Presumed diagnosis of bleb-related infectious endophthalmitis was made and he was referred for treatment. Pars plana vitrectomy was performed, including vitreous sampling, and showed very light growth of Staphylococcus aureus in 1 colony on 1 plate, which was highly suspicious for contaminant. Intravitreal amikacin and vancomycin were administered after vitreous sampling was performed. Postoperatively, the patient initiated treatment with topical antibiotics and corticosteroids. His visual acuity returned to 20/30. Two months later, he presented again with a similar acute vision loss in the left eye (counting fingers). Anterior segment examination showed conjunctival hyperemia, cellular reaction, and a small hypopyon (Figure).

### INPUT:
A 57-year-old woman with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) refractory to multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ie, imatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib) presented for subacute-onset blurry vision in both eyes. She had been admitted for an upcoming bone marrow transplant. The patient had floaters without flashes and denied any eye pain. A review of symptoms found chronic fatigue and a new, mild headache beginning a few days prior. On examination, her visual acuity was 20/50 OU; intraocular pressures were 15 mm Hg OD and 13 mm Hg OS; and pupils were equal, round, and reactive, without a relative afferent pupillary defect. Extraocular movements, confrontational visual fields, and Ishihara color plates were full. An anterior segment examination had normal results. A fundus examination revealed clinically significant peripapillary intraretinal and preretinal hemorrhages obscuring the optic disc margins of both eyes (Figure 1). A peripheral retinal examination of both eyes had normal results.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Terson syndrome in a patient with CML with central nervous system involvement,"### Differential Diagnosis

1. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)**
   - Given the presence of intraretinal and preretinal hemorrhages, and the context of blurry vision and headache, CRVO is a possible cause of these symptoms.

2. **Leukemic Retinopathy**
   - Considering her underlying condition of CML and the refractory nature of her leukemia, leukemic infiltration or complications in the retina are plausible.

3. **Hypertensive Retinopathy**
   - While no hypertension is currently expressed, chronic management and complications of CML could influence blood pressure control leading to symptoms.

4. **Optic Disc Edema**
   - The examination showing hemorrhages obscuring optic disc margins raises suspicion of optic disc edema.

5. **Vitreous Hemorrhage**
   - Hemorrhages involving different layers of the retinal structure need to be considered for differential analysis of vitreous hemorrhage.

6. **Posterior Uveitis**
   - Inflammatory processes can present similarly with blurriness and retinal changes even without significant anterior signs.

7. **Anemia-related Retinopathy**
   - Given her leukemia and associated chronic fatigue, anemia could cause similar retinal findings.

8. **Papilledema**
   - A new headache and visual changes in the context of optic disc appearance raise concern for increased intracranial pressure.

9. **Diabetic Retinopathy**
   - Without a known history of diabetes, these symptoms overlap, especially with vascular changes despite absence in history.

10. **Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)**
    - This condition can manifest systemic symptoms like headache and also result in similar fundoscopic findings as presented.

### Reranking Based on Complete Evaluation:
1. **Leukemic Retinopathy** - Given CML history and refractory disease.
2. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)** - Consistent with retinal findings.
3. **Papilledema** - New headache and obscured disc margins may suggest elevated ICP.
4. **Optic Disc Edema** - Needs to be considered due to fundus examination findings.
5. **Anemia-related Retinopathy** - Possible due to chronic disease and fatigue symptoms.
6. **Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)** - Systemic overlap could influence differential.
7. **Hypertensive Retinopathy** - Could be underlying systemic element contributing.
8. **Vitreous Hemorrhage** - Specific information needed, less likely.
9. **Posterior Uveitis** - Lack of more significant accompanying symptoms.
10. **Diabetic Retinopathy** - Unlikely given the lack of diabetic history.","['Neuro-oncology', 'Neuro-ophthalmology', 'Neurology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Hematology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,57.0,M

### INPUT:
A 42-year-old man was referred for ophthalmologic evaluation after developing blurry vision in the right eye 30 days prior. He had a history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and migraine headaches. His medications included atorvastatin, carvedilol, and norethindrone. Dilated-fundus examination of the right eye showed a single cotton-wool spot (indicating local retinal ischemia), with intraretinal hemorrhage in the inferotemporal quadrant. Ultrawide-field imaging showed a cotton-wool spot on the left fundus (Figure 1A, right) and a peripheral arterial occlusion in the right eye (Figure 1A, left), and fluorescein angiographic study of the right eye demonstrated an area of blockage corresponding to intraretinal hemorrhage and venous hyperfluorescence (Figure 1B). The patient was afebrile, with pulse 110 beats/min and blood pressure of 188/99 mm Hg. Auscultation over the heart apex revealed a holosystolic ejection murmur (grade 2/6). Laboratory testing showed normal complete blood cell count and thyrotropin level and negative results for autoantibodies against Sm, SSA, SSB, Scl-70, Jo-1, centromere, chromatin, ribonucleoprotein, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was mildly elevated (30 mm/h). Results of testing for antinuclear antibodies were positive at low titer (1:40, homogenous pattern) with positive dsDNA (5.0 IU/mL; negative if <4.0 IU/mL). Blood cultures were negative for bacterial or fungal growth after 5 days. An echocardiogram revealed pedunculated and mobile aortic valve vegetations.

The patient reported having unprotected sexual contact with multiple female partners in the past few years. On examination, her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Intraocular pressure was 12 mm Hg OD and 14 mm Hg OS. Slitlamp examination demonstrated diffuse scleral injection in both eyes without any scleral thinning. The redness did not blanch after administration of phenylephrine, 10% (Figure 1). Both eyes appeared to be moderately tender to touch. The rest of the anterior segment examination was within normal limits without any evidence of intraocular inflammation. Dilated fundus examination was also unremarkable in both eyes.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Bilateral syphilitic scleritis,"Step 1: Episcleritis - Given the eye redness and tenderness without scleral thinning, episcleritis is a common cause of eye redness and pain.

Step 2: Scleritis - The persistent redness and moderate tenderness to touch, coupled with a history of systemic condition (HIV), raise the possibility of scleritis, which can often be more severe and persistent compared to episcleritis.

Step 3: Ocular syphilis - The history of unprotected sexual contact and well-controlled HIV should prompt consideration of ocular syphilis, as it can cause similar ocular symptoms.

Step 4: Dry eye disease exacerbation - Considering the patient's history of dry eyes, exacerbation of her condition could contribute to the redness and discomfort.

Step 5: Uveitis - Although not evident in anterior segment examination, uveitis could still be considered given her systemic condition, as it can sometimes present with atypical features.

Step 6: Autoimmune conjunctivitis - While rare, autoimmune processes can cause chronic eye redness and pain without distinct systemic symptoms.

Step 7: Viral conjunctivitis - Despite the lack of respiratory symptoms, certain viral infections can present primarily with ocular symptoms.

Step 8: Allergic conjunctivitis - Chronic redness and discomfort could also be attributed to allergic conjunctivitis, given the patient’s symptoms.

Step 9: Drug-induced ocular side effects - Though not classic, consider ocular side effects from medications, including antiretrovirals, as a cause of chronic eye symptoms.

Step 10: Idiopathic anterior segment inflammation - In the absence of specific findings, idiopathic inflammation could be a consideration, albeit less common.

### INPUT:
A man in his 50s with a history of nasal-type natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma (diagnosed 2 years prior; treated with pembrolizumab and methotrexate, ifosfamide, etoposide, dexamethasone, and pegaspargase) and chronic pulmonary coccidiomycosis being treated with fluconazole was admitted for fever, hypotension, and rash. Three months prior, pembrolizumab treatment was stopped because of a widespread morbilliform reaction, which had resolved completely 6 to 8 weeks before admission. The new widespread, asymptomatic skin eruption had been ongoing for 1 to 2 weeks and appeared different from his pembrolizumab reaction. A complete blood cell count was notable for a normal white blood cell count of 4100/μL, normal absolute neutrophil count of 2940/μL, chronic normocytic anemia (hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL), and chronic thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 62 ×103/μL). Blood culture results showed no growth at 1 week. Serum β-D-glucan, galactomannan, Coccidioides antibody by complement fixation, and immunodiffusion results were negative. Respiratory viral panel and SARS-CoV-2 test results were negative. Total body skin examination findings were notable for widespread, nontender, erythematous patches and thin plaques, some with prominent overlying telangiectases and hyperpigmentation (Figure, A). A punch biopsy of a representative lesion was performed (Figure, B-D).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Intravascular involvement by NK/T-cell lymphoma,"Given the patient's history, presentation, and the test results, we'll formulate a differential diagnosis:

1. **Graft-versus-host disease**: Although typically in a post-transplant scenario, presents with skin eruptions and symptoms similar to those described.

2. **Drug Reaction/Drug-induced Vasculitis**: History of medications and previous drug reactions makes this a consideration.

3. **Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma**: Given prior NK/T-cell lymphoma history, cutaneous T-cell involvement might be possible.

4. **Viral Exanthem**: Despite negative viral tests, atypical viral exanthems still can occur.

5. **Paraneoplastic Pemphigus**: Especially considering the history of malignancy.

6. **Erythrodermic Psoriasis**: Can present with widespread erythematous rash with plaques.

7. **Dermatomyositis**: Rarely, presents with erythematous patches and plaques, though usually accompanies muscle weakness.

8. **Lichenoid Drug Eruption**: Typically due to chronic drug exposure, presenting with rash and hyperpigmented patches.

9. **Sezary Syndrome**: As this is another form of cutaneous lymphoma, consider due to previous hematologic malignancy.

10. **Chronic Graft Rejection Reaction**: If the patient had recent transfusions or cellular therapies that could instigate such a response.

After considering all available information, including the patient's comprehensive history, current symptoms, and diagnostic test results, we can rank the differential diagnoses:

1. **Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma**
2. **Sezary Syndrome**
3. **Graft-versus-host disease**
4. **Paraneoplastic Pemphigus**
5. **Drug Reaction/Drug-induced Vasculitis**
6. **Lichenoid Drug Eruption**
7. **Chronic Graft Rejection Reaction**
8. **Erythrodermic Psoriasis**
9. **Viral Exanthem**
10. **Dermatomyositis**

### INPUT:
A 59-year-old woman presented with progressive hoarseness and dyspnea over a 2-month period. Fifteen months previously, she had undergone allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) with a matched related donor for treatment of fms-like tyrosine kinase (FLT3) internal tandem duplication–mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The patient had been diagnosed with chronic gastrointestinal graft-vs-host disease after a workup for diarrhea. Results of a restaging bone marrow biopsy 2 weeks prior to presentation showed no evidence of leukemia. Physical examination findings revealed no neck masses or abnormalities, but the patient was noted to be severely dysphonic and stridulous. Flexible laryngoscopy findings demonstrated a right vocal fold neoplasm crossing the posterior commissure with associated bilateral vocal fold motion impairment and obstruction of the glottic airway (Figure, A). Awake tracheostomy was performed for airway protection, and biopsy of the neoplasm was obtained via operative microlaryngoscopy (Figure, B). Histologic findings demonstrated diffuse infiltrate of large cells with irregular nuclear contours, vesicular chromatin, and prominent nucleoli (Figure, C). Immunohistochemical stains showed CD33, CD43, and CD117 positivity, with a subset positive for CD7 and myeloperoxidase. Stains were negative for CD3, CD20, and cytokeratin expression.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Extramedullary myeloid sarcoma of the larynx,"1. **Relapse of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML):** Considering the patient's history of AML and the immunohistochemical profile of the biopsy, a relapse of AML with extramedullary involvement (myeloid sarcoma) could be possible.

2. **Lymphoma:** The histological and immunophenotypic findings, such as the large cells with specific immunohistochemical markers, can suggest a possibility of lymphoma, although specific negative cytokeratin and CD20 stains almost rule out B-cell lymphoma.

3. **Plasmablastic Sarcoma:** While rare, the characteristics of the large nuclei and histological appearance could suggest possible plasmablastic malignancy, despite the immunohistochemistry profile not being typical.

4. **Granulocytic Sarcoma (Chloroma):** Unique extramedullary presentations of leukemia are possible, and the presence of myeloperoxidase positivity aligns with myeloid lineage derivation.

5. **Laryngeal Carcinoma:** While cytokeratin negative finding somewhat excludes epithelial-origin tumors, laryngeal carcinoma should still be considered due to the location and presentation.

6. **Large Cell Transformation of Chronic Graft-vs-Host Disease (GVHD):** Although very rare, GVHD or a transformation thereof might present similarly in the context of a post-transplant patient.

7. **Metastatic Disease from another Primary:** Consider the possibility of metastatic spread from a different primary malignancy, given the unidentified specific tumor origin.

8. **Langerhans Cell Sarcoma:** The variant histological appearance may suggest such rare sarcomas if they express partial markers that relate to the lineage.

9. **Viral-Induced Lymphoproliferative Disorder:** Post-transplant patients can develop viral-induced tumors, such as EBV-related disorders, which may not strictly follow expected immunoprofiles.

10. **Neuroendocrine Tumor:** Even though unusual, small-cell/neuroendocrine tumors must be contemplated due to their broad and sometimes atypical presentations.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Granulocytic Sarcoma (Chloroma):** Most likely considering history of AML with concordant immunohistochemical markers.
2. **Relapse of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML):** Similar to chloroma but generally excluding more typical marrow involvement detected earlier.
3. **Large Cell Transformation of Chronic GVHD:** A potential explanation within the GVHD context with architectural disruption.
4. **Plasmablastic Sarcoma:** Though rare, unique morphological presentation did not completely exclude it.
5. **Lymphoma:** Peripheral T-cell lymphoma with atypical immunoprofiles remains in the conversation.
6. **Metastatic Disease from another Primary:** Remains possible but lacks definitive primary indication.
7. **Viral-Induced Lymphoproliferative Disorder:** Uncommon but a reasonable outcome in the given mode of presentation.
8. **Neuroendocrine Tumor:** Unlikely but a fallback for unaligned results in lymph-node sparing likelihood.
9. **Langerhans Cell Sarcoma:** Uncommon but still conceivable.
10. **Laryngeal Carcinoma:** Placed last due to substantial evidence against epithelial-originary due to negative cytokeratin.","['Laryngology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematology', 'Oncology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,59.0,M

### INPUT:
A 40-year-old woman presented with a large left neck mass in the setting of recently treated mixed nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT) of the right ovary with metastasis to the retroperitoneal and mediastinal lymph nodes. She was treated with a right oophorectomy and 4 cycles of etoposide, ifosfamide, and cisplatin (VIP) chemotherapy with resulting reduction in metastatic tumor burden and normalization of α-fetoprotein and β-human chorionic gonadotropin. The patient’s neck swelling, which initially decreased in size while undergoing chemotherapy, progressively enlarged shortly after concluding treatment. She underwent magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography of the neck that showed a clearly defined, bulky supraclavicular mass confined to left neck levels 3, 4, and 5 (Figure).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Growing teratoma syndrome,"1. **Recurrent germ cell tumor** - Given her history of mixed nonseminomatous germ cell tumor, recurrence is a possible diagnosis.

2. **Thyroid carcinoma** - The location of the neck mass could suggest a thyroid origin, particularly if it involves level 4 lymph nodes.

3. **Lymphoma** - Supraclavicular lymphadenopathy could indicate a hematologic malignancy such as lymphoma.

4. **Metastatic carcinoma** - Considering her history, metastasis from an unidentified primary site should be considered.

5. **Sarcoidosis** - Though less likely given the aggressive nature, sarcoidosis can present with lymphadenopathy.

6. **Reactive lymphadenopathy** - Post-treatment infections or inflammation can cause cervical lymph node enlargement.

7. **Brachial cleft cyst** - Developmental cysts are rare but can appear in the neck.

8. **Tuberculosis** - Mycobacterial infections can cause cervical lymphadenitis.

9. **Lipoma** - A lipomatous lesion could present as a non-aggressive mass in the neck.

10. **Thyroglossal duct cyst** - Although primarily midline, it can sometimes be misidentified based on its cystic nature.

### INPUT:
A 14-year-old girl was referred to us because of ocular and periocular pain with photophobia in her right eye for the last 5 days. Aside from atopic dermatitis, her medical history was unremarkable. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Slitlamp examination of the right eye disclosed conjunctival hyperemia and ciliary congestion, anterior chamber flare 2+, and a few nongranulomatous keratic precipitates; the left anterior segment was quiet. Intraocular pressure was 15 mm Hg OU. Pupillary light responses were normal. Dilated fundus examination revealed 1+ of vitritis (binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy score) in the right eye and swelling of the optic disc in both eyes, to a greater extent in the right eye (Figure, A). Routine blood tests, including full blood cell count, plasma glucose levels, liver function test, and kidney function test, were performed on the same day and showed a serum creatinine level of 1.57 mg/dL (reference range: 0.5-1.0 mg/dL; to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4). Antibodies anti–Treponema pallidum were tested and the results were negative.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome,"1. **Uveitis** - Based on the presence of anterior chamber flare, ciliary congestion, and keratic precipitates, uveitis is considered.
2. **Optic Neuritis** - The swelling of the optic disc and photophobia could suggest optic neuritis.
3. **Sarcoidosis** - Considering non-granulomatous uveitis and neurological involvement, sarcoidosis is a possibility.
4. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease** - The presence of vitritis, disc swelling, and suggestive inflammatory signs can indicate this systemic inflammatory disease.
5. **Behçet’s Disease** - Recurrent uveitis and optic nerve involvement may suggest Behçet's syndrome.
6. **Multiple Sclerosis** - Given the optic neuritis component, multiple sclerosis should be considered.
7. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension** - Given the bilateral optic disc swelling.
8. **Lupus (SLE)** - Systemic Lupus Erythematosus could explain the systemic and ocular findings.
9. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis** - Potential systemic inflammatory vasculitis causing uveitis and optic nerve involvement.
10. **Infectious Endophthalmitis** - Although less likely without a clear source, infectious causes should not be completely ruled out.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
Based on the additional information:

1. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease** - The combination of vitritis, optic disc swelling, and ocular findings aligns with VKH syndrome, especially in a young patient.
2. **Uveitis** - Makes sense given the anterior and posterior segment inflammation.
3. **Sarcoidosis** - The systemic nature of the disease could link to the ocular findings.
4. **Optic Neuritis** - Disc swelling and eye pain are consistent with optic neuritis, likely related to another systemic condition.
5. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension** - The bilateral disc swelling is indicative but other features don’t align as closely.
6. **Behçet’s Disease** - Despite the lack of other systemic symptoms, it remains possible.
7. **Multiple Sclerosis** - Primarily due to optic involvement, but less systemic indication.
8. **Lupus (SLE)** - Possible due to systemic findings but less specific ocular involvement.
9. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis** - Considered if systemic inflammation was more evident.
10. **Infectious Endophthalmitis** - Least likely based on the clinical presentation and test results.","['Nephrology', 'Pediatrics', 'Intraocular Inflammation', 'Ophthalmology']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,14.0,M

### INPUT:
A man in his mid-60s, who was in remission following successful combination chemotherapy for Burkitt lymphoma 8 years previously, presented with dyspnea, fatigue, general malaise, and presyncope. On examination, he was normotensive, afebrile, and clinically euvolemic. Laboratory testing showed a hemoglobin level of 12.1 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10), white blood cell count of 9900/µL (to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001), erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 76 mm/h, lactate dehydrogenase level of 139 U/L (to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167), and normal coagulation profile. Serum immunoglobulin quantitation showed normal immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgA, and IgM levels of 1590 mg/L, 303 mg/L, and 94 mg/L, respectively (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 0.01). Blood culture findings were negative. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography (Figure 1 and Video) showed a large echogenic mass on the inferior aspect of the interatrial septum with infiltration of the coronary sinus, anterior mitral valve annulus, and aortic root. The mass protruded into the left ventricular outflow tract without causing valve obstruction. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a bilobed interatrial mass measuring 5.6 × 3.1 × 3.8 cm with patchy late gadolinium enhancement of the lesion. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a left hilar mass encasing the left upper lobe bronchus with extension into the left main pulmonary artery, a nodular soft tissue lesion along the anterior nasal septum, and no abdominal or pelvic disease. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a left paraclinoid mass lesion consistent with a meningioma and right Meckel cave lesions.

10. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)**  

### Reranking Based on Patient Information and Test Results:
1. **Primary Cardiac Lymphoma** - Given the history of Burkitt lymphoma, the presence of a cardiac mass with infiltration, and associated lesions, a recurrence or primary cardiac involvement is paramount.
2. **Metastatic Lung Cancer** - The observation of a left hilar mass, coupled with cardiac involvement, suggests metastatic lung cancer as a plausible diagnosis.
3. **IgG4-related Disease** - Possible due to multiple organ involvement, such as cardiac mass and nasal lesion, even though normal IgG levels do not support this strongly.
4. **Primary Cardiac Sarcoma** - Considered due to the substantial size and position of the cardiac mass.
5. **Cardiac Myxoma** - A common cardiac tumor, considered less likely due to extensive infiltration and systemic involvement.
6. **Sarcoidosis** - Systemic inflammatory disease affecting multiple organs, but less likely given the patient's history and presentation.
7. **Infective Endocarditis** - Negative blood cultures make this less likely.
8. **Churg-Strauss Syndrome** - Involvement of cardiac tissue with other systemic symptoms, although eosinophilia is not noted here.
9. **Wegener's Granulomatosis** - Due to the presence of nasal lesion and possible sinus involvement but less likely without more definite ENT and vasculitic manifestations.
10. **Tuberculosis with Cardiac Involvement** - Unlikely given the absence of supportive respiratory symptoms or systemic manifestations typical of TB.","['Cardiology', 'Oncology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Lymphomas']",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,65.0,F

### INPUT:
A 47-year-old man, with dyslipidemia, presented to the emergency department with sudden vision loss in the right eye. Visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/20 OS. Anterior segment, tonometry, and pupillary light reflex were unremarkable. Ophthalmoscopy of the right eye showed discretely blurred optic disc margins, tortuous and dilated retinal veins, and intraretinal hemorrhages in all quadrants; the left eye was unremarkable. An optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan showed a cystoid macular edema (CME) in the right eye; the left was unremarkable. Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness was 133 μm OD and 82 μm OS (reference value, 95.4 ± 10.48 μm).1 A fluorescein angiography was scheduled. One week later, the patient returned to our department due to multiple episodes of amaurosis fugax in left eye. By that time, ophthalmoscopy disclosed a mild optic disc swelling, tortuous venous vessels, and retinal hemorrhages bilaterally (Figure 1). The OCT scan showed a CME spontaneous resolution in the right eye while the left eye was unremarkable. Fluorescein angiography revealed a slight delay in venous filling but no capillary nonperfusion areas. These features were compatible with bilateral nonischemic central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), with spontaneous reperfusion in the right eye.
### OUTPUT:

5. Retinal Artery Occlusion
6. Giant Cell Arteritis
7. Optic Neuritis
8. Ischemic Optic Neuropathy
9. Vitreous Hemorrhage
10. Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy

### Final Ranking of Differential Diagnosis:

1. Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO): The presentation of sudden vision loss, tortuous retinal veins, and intraretinal hemorrhages is classical for CRVO. The spontaneous resolution of edema and bilateral involvement fits the diagnosis of nonischemic CRVO with reperfusion.

2. Hypertensive Retinopathy: Given the patient's dyslipidemia, a history of hypertension could contribute to the retinal changes observed. However, the abrupt onset and lack of other typical hypertensive retinopathy features make it less likely.

3. Diabetic Retinopathy: Although diabetes can cause similar retinal findings, the patient's presentation and more acute, unilateral onset followed by bilateral involvement is less typical for diabetic retinopathy.

4. Giant Cell Arteritis: Presents as an acute vision loss, often with jaw claudication and headache, which are absent in this case. However, it must be considered due to the risk of blindness.

5. Retinal Artery Occlusion: Typically presents with a pale retina and a cherry-red spot, not with the observed tortuous veins and hemorrhages.

6. Optic Neuritis: Typically affects younger patients and presents with painful vision loss. The bilateral retinal findings and lack of pain don't fit.

7. Ischemic Optic Neuropathy: Generally presents with sudden vision loss and optic disc swelling but does not account for the hemorrhages seen here.

8. Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO): Usually affects only a sector of the retina and not the entire retina as presented.

9. Vitreous Hemorrhage: Would cause vision loss but is not characterized by the intraretinal hemorrhages and tortuous veins.

10. Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy: Typically affects both eyes over weeks to months and presents differently from the acute presentation seen here.","['Coagulation Disorders', 'Hematology', 'Oncology', 'Retinal Disorders', 'Ophthalmology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,47.0,F

### INPUT:
A 13-year-old female presented to the pediatric otolaryngology clinic with a 2-year history of a right neck mass that had slowly increased in size. She denied any associated symptoms of pain, fevers, chills, malaise, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, prior history of neck masses, recent upper respiratory tract infections, or skin lesions. She was the product of a full-term pregnancy with up-to-date immunizations. Physical examination revealed a 2.5-cm firm, ovoid, mobile, and nontender mass at the apex of the posterior triangle of the right neck without any associated overlying skin changes. The remainder of the head and neck examination was unremarkable. Doppler ultrasonography revealed a 1.9 × 1.8 × 0.9-cm hypoechoic mass, and subsequent fine-needle aspirates demonstrated cells with elongated nuclei and eccentric blue cytoplasm in a background of myxoid stroma. The mass was excised in entirety without issue. At the time of surgery, the deep surface of the mass was found to be adherent to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The lesion was resected with a cuff of muscle and sent for permanent histopathological examination. This revealed proliferation of bland spindle cells with plump nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged as loose fascicles in a background of myxoid stroma (Figure 1). These cells were positive for mucin 4 (MUC4), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and transducing-like enhancer of split 1 (TLE1) immunohistochemical stains. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed a positive FUS (16p11) gene rearrangement.

### INPUT:
A 45-year-old man was referred to the medical retina service for evaluation of bilateral macular atrophy noted by his general ophthalmologist. Medical history was positive for bilateral sensorineural hearing loss with cochlear origin as determined by an otolaryngologist and headache since age 35 years. He had no history of longer-term use of medications. There was no family history of hearing and vision loss in all immediate family members. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/63 OS. His pupils were round and reactive. The anterior segment was unremarkable. Fundus examination confirmed the presence of bilateral macular atrophy. Fundus autofluorescence revealed a fairly symmetric loss of autofluorescence in the macula and in the regions surrounding the optic disc (Figure). In proximity of these areas of reduced autofluorescence, a speckled fundus autofluorescence pattern of alternating spots of increased and decreased autofluorescence was also noted. Optical coherence tomography displayed the presence of a bilateral atrophy of the outer retina and retinal pigment epithelium (Figure). The patient’s family underwent a complete ophthalmologic evaluation, which did not display any alteration.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and strokelike episodes–related syndrome,"### Initial Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Usher Syndrome**  
   - The combination of sensorineural hearing loss and retinal degeneration could suggest Usher Syndrome, though typically associated with retinitis pigmentosa rather than primarily macular atrophy.

2. **Stargardt Disease**  
   - Given the presence of macular atrophy and absence of a family history, Stargardt disease is considered, although typically presents at a younger age. Vision loss often manifests as reduced visual acuity.

3. **Pattern Dystrophies of the Retinal Pigment Epithelium**  
   - The speckled autofluorescence could be indicative of pattern dystrophies which can affect macula and imitate macular degenerations.

4. **Cone-Rod Dystrophy**  
   - Progressive loss of cone function followed by rod degeneration could explain the macular changes and visual acuity differences. However, hearing loss is not typically part of the presentation.

5. **Age-related Macular Degeneration**  
   - Despite his relatively young age, bilateral macular atrophy and visual acuity changes could suggest ARMD as a differential.

6. **Central Areolar Choroidal Dystrophy**  
   - This can cause macular atrophy similar to what is described but is less common and typically does not involve hearing loss.

7. **Batten Disease (Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis)**  
   - Though usually presenting in childhood, it can lead to vision loss and sometimes hearing loss due to neurodegenerative factors affecting the retina and cochlea.

8. **Spinocerebellar Ataxia with Macular Degeneration**  
   - Some forms of this hereditary condition can cause both hearing and vision loss, including retinal degeneration.

9. **Alport Syndrome**  
   - The key features include hearing loss and ocular problems; however, often associated with anterior lenticonus rather than macular atrophy, but still worth considering.

10. **Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS)**  
    - This mitochondrial disorder can cause multiple systemic symptoms, including vision and hearing deficits albeit typically with other symptoms present.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
   
1. **Pattern Dystrophies of the Retinal Pigment Epithelium**  
   - Given the presence of speckled autofluorescence and macular atrophy, pattern dystrophies are strongly indicated.

2. **Usher Syndrome**  
   - Considering the combination of hearing loss and visual symptoms, this remains highly plausible, despite the typical fundus pattern being different.

3. **Cone-Rod Dystrophy**  
   - Aligns with macular disease presentation with outer retinal atrophy, though hearing loss is unusual.

4. **Batten Disease (Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis)**  
   - Neurodegenerative conditions that can cause both hearing and vision loss deserve consideration given the age and symptoms.

5. **Alport Syndrome**  
   - Given the combination of sensorineural hearing loss and ocular manifestations, despite the absence of kidney symptoms typically associated.

6. **Spinocerebellar Ataxia with Macular Degeneration**  
   - Neurodegenerative diseases with ocular manifestations should be considered, although less common.

7. **Stargardt Disease**  
   - Age at symptom onset and lesion patterns are somewhat atypical but can be considered with atypical presentation.

8. **Central Areolar Choroidal Dystrophy**  
   - Accounts for macular atrophy but does not address hearing loss, making it less likely.

9. **Age-related Macular Degeneration**  
   - Typically older age-range but macular changes can sometimes present atypically early.

10. **Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS)**  
    - Although a systemic review does not strongly support this based on pain symptomology and presentation, mitochondrial disorders should always be in the differential for unexplained multi-symptom disorders.","['Dermatology', 'Pediatrics', 'Otolaryngology', 'Audiology and Hearing', 'Retinal Disorders']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,45.0,F

### INPUT:
Final diagnosis: Blau syndrome.  
Case report: A school-aged girl experienced generalized erythematous rashes for 4 years. Skin examination showed ichthyosiform brownish plaques on her lower extremities and multiple erythematous confluent papules and plaques on her trunk and face (Figure, A and B). Topical steroid and pimecrolimus were administered, but their effects were limited. In addition, painful distal and proximal interphalangeal joints were noted for 2 years, and the patient could not clench her fists. Uveitis in both eyes was also diagnosed by an ophthalmologist. Microscopic examination of her hair showed no trichorrhexis invaginata or trichorrhexis nodosa. A skin biopsy specimen was obtained and submitted for further histopathologic analysis (Figure, C and D).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Blau syndrome,"1. **Psoriasis** - Considering the erythematous rashes and plaques, psoriasis is a common condition to consider.
   
2. **Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)** - The presence of joint pain and inability to clench fists suggests an arthritic condition, such as JIA.
   
3. **Sarcoidosis** - Due to the skin lesions, joint involvement, and uveitis, systemic granulomatous conditions like sarcoidosis are suspects.
   
4. **Reactive Arthritis** - With joint involvement and skin changes, reactive arthritis enters the differential list.
   
5. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** - The generalized rash and joint pain can be indicative of SLE.
   
6. **Lichen Planus** - Skin plaques can also suggest lichen planus, particularly if there is distinct morphology.
   
7. **Granulomatous Dermatitis** - Based on histopathology, granulomatous dermatitis might be considered.
   
8. **Erythema Multiforme** - Although less likely, the erythematous rash could hint towards erythema multiforme.
   
9. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis** - Given the systemic symptoms, vasculitis conditions such as Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis may be plausible.
   
10. **Blau Syndrome** - With the congruence of skin findings, arthritis, and uveitis, the rare Blau syndrome could be a top differential.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Blau Syndrome** - Best fits the triad of rash, arthritis, and uveitis based on the clinical features and age of onset.
2. **Sarcoidosis** - Similar systemic findings but less likely due to the patient's age.
3. **Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)** - Joint symptoms are compelling, but skin manifestations less characteristic.
4. **Psoriasis** - Matches skin findings but does not explain uveitis and joint issues comprehensively.
5. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** - Multisystem involvement fits, but specific cutaneous and joint presentation is less typical.
6. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis** - Considered but other symptoms do not match well.
7. **Reactive Arthritis** - Involvement of joints and potentially following infection, but skin rash less typical.
8. **Lichen Planus** - Skin plaques considered but does not match systemic findings.
9. **Granulomatous Dermatitis** - Based on histopathology but less likely due to systemic symptoms.
10. **Erythema Multiforme** - Least likely as it doesn’t explain joint or systemic involvement adequately.","['Dermatology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Rheumatology', 'Pediatrics']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,-1.0,M

### INPUT:
A 70-year-old man with an ocular history of primary open-angle glaucoma on latanoprost, bilateral trabeculectomies, and argon laser trabeculoplasties presented with several months of worsening vision in the left eye. On examination, his best-corrected distance visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/60 OS (baseline 20/40 OU). Pupils were equally round and reactive, without afferent pupillary defect. Findings of Amsler grid testing were notable for a small area of distortion inferiorly in the left eye. Intraocular pressures (IOPs) were 13 mm Hg in both eyes. Findings of anterior segment examination were unremarkable. Findings of dilated fundus examination were notable for cup-disc ratio of 0.9 in the right eye and 0.85 in the left eye with temporal thinning, stable from prior, and new intraretinal thickening in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of the left eye revealed schiticlike separation of the outer plexiform and outer nuclear layers extending from the temporal edge of the optic nerve head to the fovea (Figure 1A), continuous with the peripapillary nerve sheath.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. Vitreomacular traction syndrome – Given the OCT findings displaying schiticlike separation and its continuity with the peripapillary nerve sheath, vitreomacular traction is highly plausible.
2. Macular edema – Due to the new intraretinal thickening observed on examination, macular edema is a strong possibility.
3. Epiretinal membrane – As it can cause distortion and similar OCT findings, it must be considered.
4. Macular hole – Although less likely based on the description, it still could explain some visual phenomena.
5. Central serous chorioretinopathy – Could lead to visual distortion, although OCT findings don't fit perfectly.
6. Age-related macular degeneration – While possible in an elderly patient, OCT findings are atypical.
7. Branch retinal vein occlusion – Potential cause of schitic changes, but retinal hemorrhages not mentioned.
8. Retinal detachment – Unlikely given presentation and fundus findings.
9. Diabetic retinopathy – Not consistent with the patient's history and examination.
10. Retinitis pigmentosa – Unlikely due to specific OCT and clinical findings, and lack of history.","['Macular Diseases', 'Ophthalmology', 'Retinal Disorders', 'Glaucoma', 'Ophthalmic Imaging']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,70.0,F

### INPUT:
A man in his 20s with a history of daily soft contact lens (CL) wear was referred by his local ophthalmologist for a recalcitrant central corneal ulcer in his left eye. He had no history of eye trauma, did not sleep in his CLs, and stopped using CLs at symptom onset. Of note, he had recently been swimming in a freshwater lake prior to the onset of the ulcer. He was initially treated with topical besifloxacin and followed up daily. He appeared to improve clinically with resolution of his epithelial defect after 3 days, and topical loteprednol was added. Results of initial corneal cultures were negative. One week later, he presented with worsening pain and vision, which prompted referral to our cornea clinic where, 2 weeks after his initial presentation, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/150 OS. Left-eye examination demonstrated diffuse microcystic corneal edema and stromal thickening with no Descemet membrane folds (Figure 1A). A 2 × 2-mm stromal opacity was noted paracentrally with no epithelial defects. The anterior chamber demonstrated 1+ cell. Intraocular pressure was 17 mm Hg OS. Corneal cultures for bacteria, fungi, and acanthamoeba were repeated, and in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) was performed on the stromal infiltrate (Figure 1B). After reviewing the IVCM images, what empirical treatment would you recommend while awaiting the results of the repeated corneal cultures?
### OUTPUT:
    ",Purpureocillium lilacinum keratitis confirmed by culture growth 21 days later,"1. **Acanthamoeba Keratitis**: The history of swimming in a freshwater lake and the clinical presentation of the corneal ulcer with negative initial cultures are highly suggestive of acanthamoeba infection.

2. **Fungal Keratitis**: Despite initial negative cultures, fungal keratitis remains a consideration, especially given the ulcer's resistance to initial antibiotic treatment.

3. **Bacterial Keratitis**: Common causes include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, especially in contact lens wearers, though initial cultures were negative.

4. **Herpetic Keratitis**: Could present with similar ocular findings, although the lack of epithelial dendrites makes this less likely.

5. **Noninfectious Keratitis**: Consideration of autoimmune-related keratitis, possibly secondary to systemic disorders.

6. **Microsporidial Keratitis**: Typically presents in immunocompromised patients but should still be considered.

7. **Toxic Keratitis**: Resulting from reaction to contact lens solutions or other environmental agents.

8. **Marginal Ulcer**: Secondary to staphylococcal hypersensitivity, though less likely with the clinical history.

9. **Peripheral Ulcerative Keratitis**: Often associated with systemic vasculitic diseases.

10. **Contact Lens-Associated Hypoxia**: Chronic wear of contact lenses can cause corneal hypoxia leading to ulceration.

**Reranked Differential:**

1. **Acanthamoeba Keratitis**: Based on the freshwater exposure, typical presentation, and resistance to initial treatment.
2. **Fungal Keratitis**: Consideration given persistence and non-responsiveness to antibiotics.
3. **Microsporidial Keratitis**: Due to similar microscopy findings occasionally resembling this infection.
4. **Herpetic Keratitis**: Considering atypical presentation or mixed etiology.
5. **Bacterial Keratitis**: Though less likely given negative initial cultures and treatment response.
6. **Noninfectious Keratitis**: Consideration of systemic disease.
7. **Toxic Keratitis**: Based on contact lens history.
8. **Peripheral Ulcerative Keratitis**: Based on systemic considerations.
9. **Contact Lens-Associated Hypoxia**: Given chronic lens wear history but unlikely given acute presentation.

### INPUT:
A 53-year-old woman received a diagnosis of stage IV melanoma with metastatic disease to the spine and brain 3 months before presentation. Four weeks following receipt of immunotherapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab, she developed acute abdominal pain in the setting of a rapidly rising lactic acid dehydrogenase levels, prompting hospital admission. Imaging results showed mild disease progression (new ascites and periportal metabolic lymph node). Splenic infarct and portal/splenic vein thrombi were identified as etiologies of her acute pain and were presumed to be secondary to hypercoagulable state of malignancy. Over the next 3 days, she had rising serum creatinine (sCr) levels (baseline, approximately 1 mg/dL [to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4]). The initial workup included ultrasonography and urinalysis. Ultrasonography results showed abnormal intraparenchymal flow to both kidneys without evidence of kidney artery stenosis. Urine studies were consistent with prerenal etiology, while the presence of casts suggested acute tubular necrosis. Nephrotoxic medications (omeprazole/pantoprazole) were discontinued. The top differential diagnoses at this juncture included contrast-induced nephropathy or immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)–induced acute interstitial nephritis, and empirical high dose steroids were prescribed. Despite observation and steroid treatment, her sCr levels continued to increase over the next 5 days, peaking at 5.8 mg/dL, and the patient progressed into anuric kidney failure, requiring hemodialysis. This prompted a kidney biopsy for definitive diagnosis (Figure). One week later, she received encorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor. Two weeks later, the patient’s kidney function began to improve, and hemodialysis was discontinued. She continued to show gradual improvement, with a return to near baseline kidney function (sCr level, 1.3 mg/dL) approximately 6 weeks after treatment initiation.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Acute tubular necrosis secondary to kidney melanoma metastasis,"1. **Contrast-Induced Nephropathy (CIN)** - Given her recent hospital admissions and potential use of contrast studies, CIN is a consideration due to rising serum creatinine levels and acute kidney injury.

2. **Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Induced Acute Interstitial Nephritis (ICI-AIN)** - The use of ipilimumab and nivolumab (ICIs) raises the suspicion of drug-induced interstitial nephritis as a cause for her deteriorating renal function.

3. **Nephrotoxic Medication Effect** - The use of proton pump inhibitors like omeprazole/pantoprazole could lead to kidney damage, contributing to her current issues.

4. **Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA)** - Considering her hypercoagulable state from advanced cancer, TMA could cause acute renal failure by damaging renal microvasculature.

5. **Hypercalcemia-Induced Nephropathy** - Metastatic cancer can cause hypercalcemia, which may lead to renal impairment, although this is typically not anuric.

6. **Renal Metastasis** - Though less common, direct metastatic infiltration of the kidneys can lead to renal failure in patients with widespread malignancy.

7. **Lactic Acidosis due to Tumor Lysis Syndrome** - Rising LDH and acute renal failure might suggest tumor lysis syndrome, potentially overlooked in the scenario of widespread metastasis.

8. **Ischemic Acute Tubular Necrosis** - Given the history of splenic infarct and potential episodes of hypotension, renal ischemia leading to tubular necrosis is a plausible diagnosis.

9. **Vasculitis** - A systemic vasculative process, induced or unmasked by immunotherapy, might lead to renal damage and acute kidney injury.

10. **Renal Vein Thrombosis** - Within the context of her malignancy and hypercoagulable state, renal vein thrombosis could cause acute deterioration in renal function.

### Reranking Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Induced Acute Interstitial Nephritis (ICI-AIN)**
2. **Contrast-Induced Nephropathy (CIN)**
3. **Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA)**

### INPUT:
A 71-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis and type 2 diabetes presented to the otolaryngology team with 6 weeks’ history of pain and ulcers in the pharynx. She also complained of nasal regurgitation. She denied having any systemic symptoms. She took linagliptin, valsartan, and 15 mg of methotrexate weekly. She was a nonsmoker and consumed very little alcohol. Clinical examination including flexible nasendoscopy revealed multiple shallow ulcers on the posterior wall of the nasopharynx. There was a large defect involving the entire soft palate on the left. There was no obvious mass or any exophytic lesion. The edges of the soft palate defect were smooth and clean (Figure 1). There were no cranial nerve palsies. There was no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Findings of the remaining head and neck examinations were normal.
### OUTPUT:
    ",EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer,"1. **Wegener’s Granulomatosis**: The presentation of upper airway involvement with ulceration and soft palate destruction raises suspicion for granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis.

2. **Sjögren’s Syndrome**: Given her history of rheumatoid arthritis and type 2 diabetes, the possibility of secondary Sjögren’s syndrome should be considered, which can cause mucosal ulceration due to dryness.

3. **Infectious Mononucleosis**: Although less common, viral infection such as Epstein-Barr virus can cause pharyngeal ulcers and should be considered.

4. **Pemphigus Vulgaris**: This autoimmune condition can cause mucosal ulcerations and might explain the pharyngeal ulcerations seen.

5. **Methotrexate-Induced Mucositis**: Considering her medication, methotrexate-induced mucositis is a possibility due to its effects on rapidly dividing cells in mucosal surfaces.

6. **Mucormycosis**: An opportunistic fungal infection, particularly in patients with diabetes, that can cause tissue necrosis and ulceration in the upper aerodigestive tract.

7. **Syphilis**: Although not mentioned in her history, syphilitic gummas can produce destructive lesions in the mouth and throat.

8. **Tuberculosis**: Although primarily a pulmonary illness, TB can present with extra-pulmonary features such as pharyngeal ulcers.

9. **Lymphoma**: Given the absence of mass but the presence of tissue destruction, a hematologic malignancy should be considered.

10. **Chronic Granulomatous Disease**: While more common in children, CGD can cause persistent immune challenges and result in granuloma formation with tissue breakdown in adults as well.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Wegener’s Granulomatosis**: Strongest suspicion due to the classic presentation of nasal and pharyngeal ulceration, particularly involving palatal destruction without an exophytic mass.

2. **Methotrexate-Induced Mucositis**: High on the list due to current medication use and the nature of ulceration.

3. **Pemphigus Vulgaris**: Relevant given mucosal involvement and autoimmune history.

4. **Mucormycosis**: Important consideration especially in a diabetic patient presenting with necrotic lesions.

5. **Sjögren’s Syndrome**: Given her autoimmune background, this remains a differential but could be secondary.

6. **Infectious Mononucleosis**: Less likely given her age and clinical presentation without systemic symptoms.

7. **Syphilis**: Plausible despite lacking historical clues, must rely on serologic evidence.

8. **Lymphoma**: Unlikely given no lymphadenopathy but on the list due to possible underlying malignancy.

9. **Tuberculosis**: Less common but possible due to extra-pulmonary presentations.

10. **Chronic Granulomatous Disease**: Considered least likely due to uncommon adult onset.","['Diabetes', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Dental Medicine', 'Otolaryngology', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis']",0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,71.0,M

A man in his 70s was referred to the dermatology department by the rheumatology department with concerns for vasculitis of the bilateral lower legs. He had been healthy until 6 years earlier when he had suddenly developed peripheral neuropathy, with subsequent workup revealing a diagnosis of immunoglobulin M (IgM) monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. His symptoms had rapidly progressed during the past few months. In addition to worsening neuropathy, he had developed fatigue, weight loss, and sudden altered mental status. An ischemic stroke was identified. The patient was hospitalized, and extensive diagnostic examinations and procedures were completed. A lymphoproliferative disorder with plasmocytic differentiation was detected in a bone marrow biopsy specimen, which together with the monoclonal IgM paraproteinemia was consistent with Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM). Weeks later, the patient developed an asymptomatic rash of his lower legs. A physical examination revealed several bright red, nonblanchable, pinpoint macules of the bilateral lower legs (Figure, A). An antinuclear antibody test result was positive (titer 1:320, diffuse pattern). Other laboratory testing procedures (ie, complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, anti-Sjogren syndrome [SS]-A and SS-B, anti–double-stranded DNA, complement [C]3 and C4, homocysteine, β-2-glycoprotein, anticardiolipin, lupus anticoagulant, and vitamin C) returned normal.

### INPUT:
Final diagnosis: Anodal capture.
Case report: A woman in her early 70s with a history of permanent atrial fibrillation treated with atrioventricular junction ablation and biventricular pacemaker implantation was hospitalized with decompensated heart failure and acute kidney injury. Her history was notable for nonischemic cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 40% and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, for which she underwent single-lung transplant 9 years prior. Following diuresis and medical optimization, repeated echocardiogram showed a newly depressed ejection fraction (30%). Her electrocardiogram (ECG) was notable for alternating QRS morphologies (Figure 1A). The left ventricular (LV) pacing vector was programmed from LV tip to right ventricular (RV) lead ring. During pacemaker threshold testing, a change in QRS morphology was observed as the output was reduced (Figure 1B). Chest radiography revealed severe right pulmonary fibrosis leading to ipsilateral mediastinal shift and pacemaker lead position unchanged from implantation.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Anodal capture,"1. **Heart Failure Exacerbation**  
   - Initial presentation includes decompensated heart failure, which must be considered first given the patient's symptoms and history.
   
2. **Acute Kidney Injury**  
   - The acute kidney injury is a significant finding and requires acknowledgment as a potential complication or separate condition.

3. **Arrhythmia (Alternating QRS Morphologies)**  
   - Observed alternating QRS morphologies on ECG could indicate an arrhythmia or pacemaker malfunction.

4. **Pacemaker Malfunction**  
   - Considering the history of a biventricular pacemaker, malfunction or lead dislodgment is a plausible diagnosis for ECG changes.

5. **Cardiomyopathy Progression**  
   - Newly depressed ejection fraction may suggest progression of underlying cardiomyopathy.

6. **Pulmonary Fibrosis-Related Complications**  
   - Right pulmonary fibrosis with mediastinal shift could account for respiratory symptoms or contribute to heart failure.

7. **Electrolyte Imbalance**  
   - Diuretics and heart failure management could lead to electrolyte disturbances, exacerbating cardiac issues.

8. **Coronary Artery Disease**  
   - Although not initially suspected given nonischemic history, changes in cardiac status may be unrelated new ischemic events.

9. **Pulmonary Hypertension**  
   - Given history of pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension could exacerbate heart failure symptoms.

10. **Anodal Capture (Final Diagnosis)**  
   - Observed changes in QRS morphology with pacemaker threshold testing specifically point to anodal capture as a key diagnosis.

---

**Reranked Differential Diagnosis:**  
1. **Anodal Capture** - Consistent with the QRS changes upon pacemaker testing, pacemaker lead position.
2. **Pacemaker Malfunction** - ECG findings and symptoms suggest involvement.
3. **Heart Failure Exacerbation** - Initial decompensation having significant clinical impact.
4. **Cardiomyopathy Progression** - Consistent with reduced ejection fraction findings.
5. **Arrhythmia** - Alternating QRS morphologies support arrhythmic event or conduction system involvement.
6. **Pulmonary Fibrosis-Related Complications** - Existing condition may exacerbate cardiac status.
7. **Pulmonary Hypertension** - Potential contributor to heart failure symptoms.
8. **Acute Kidney Injury** - Important, but likely secondary to heart failure and treatment.

### INPUT:
A 47-year-old woman with melanoma and a history of papillary thyroid cancer treated with thyroidectomy presented with 1 week of low-grade fevers, myalgias, and proximal muscle weakness. Three months earlier, she underwent digital amputation of her right third finger and began adjuvant nivolumab treatment for stage IIIC acral-lentiginous melanoma. One week later, she developed fevers, myalgias, dark urine, weakness, and difficulty walking. She had no palpitations, chest pain, or shortness of breath. On examination, her blood pressure was 135/86 mm Hg, pulse 78/min, and she was afebrile. She had reduced strength in bilateral proximal shoulders (3/5), elbow flexors/extensors (3/5), and forearm flexors/extensors (4+/5). No rashes were noted. Laboratory studies demonstrated a creatine kinase (CK) level of 111 859 U/L (reference range, 30-220 U/L), CK-MB of 270 ng/mL (reference, <8 ng/mL), and aldolase above 500 U/L (reference, <7.7 U/L). Aspartate aminotransferase level was 1980 U/L (reference range, 15-41 U/L), alanine aminotransferase was 814 U/L (reference range, 14-54 U/L), creatinine was 4.9 mg/dL (reference range, 0.4-1.0 mg/dL) with a previously normal baseline, and potassium was 6.4 mmol/L (reference range, 3.5-5.0 mmol/L). Urinalysis showed 27 red blood cells (reference range, 0-5) and myoglobin above 5000 µg/L (reference, 0 µg/L). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 67 mm/h (reference, <20 mm/h) and C-reactive protein was 10.2 mg/dL (reference, ≤0.60 mg/dL). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left humerus demonstrated T2 flare most pronounced within the biceps and anterior lateral deltoid muscles (Figure). The patient’s electrocardiogram (ECG) is also shown in the Figure.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Nivolumab-induced myositis with myocarditis,"1. **Rhabdomyolysis**: The extremely high CK level, presence of myoglobin in urine, and acute renal failure are indicative of muscle breakdown, leading to rhabdomyolysis. 

2. **Nivolumab-induced Myositis**: Given the patient's recent nivolumab therapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced myositis is a possibility, especially with myalgias and weakness.

3. **Drug-induced Myopathy**: Other medications could cause myopathy, but in this case, the temporal relation to nivolumab makes it a potential cause.

4. **Polymyositis**: The proximal muscle weakness and elevated muscle enzymes could suggest an inflammatory muscle disease such as polymyositis.

5. **Dermatomyositis**: Although no skin manifestations were noted, dermatomyositis cannot fully be excluded without further dermatological assessment.

6. **Autoimmune Myopathy**: The immune background and treatment might trigger an autoimmune process affecting muscle strength and enzymes.

7. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**: Given the history of melanoma and thyroid cancer, a paraneoplastic syndrome affecting the muscles is a consideration.

8. **Statin-induced Myopathy**: Although no statin use is indicated, it's a known cause of high CK and myopathy in patients.

9. **Viral Myositis**: A viral infection could lead to acute myositis, being considered given the symptoms of fever and muscle aches.

10. **Thyrotoxic Myopathy**: Previous thyroid cancer treatment might alter thyroid hormone levels impacting muscles, although less likely given normal examination findings.

### Final Differential Diagnosis Ranking:
1. **Rhabdomyolysis**
2. **Nivolumab-induced Myositis**
3. **Autoimmune Myopathy**
4. **Polymyositis**
5. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**

### INPUT:
A 58-year-old woman with a history of hypertensive retinopathy presented with acute-onset, painless vision loss in her right eye accompanied by tinnitus and severe intermittent headaches. Her extraocular movements were full, and she had no other neurologic deficits. Her visual acuity was 20/400 OD and 20/30 OS, respectively, and her fundi were notable for bilateral optic nerve edema. Results of recent computed tomography and angiography of the head and neck and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits were reportedly normal, and lumbar puncture revealed an opening pressure of 26 cm H2O (normal range, 6 to 25 cm H2O) with elevated protein. The patient was given acetazolamide and referred to neuro-ophthalmology. On examination by neuro-ophthalmology 4 months later, her visual acuity was 20/50 OD and 20/20 OS. She had an afferent pupillary defect in the right eye, and Humphrey visual fields (24-2) showed binasal inferior defects with a superior defect in the right eye that was considered an artifact of testing. According to the Ishihara color plates test, color vision was full in both eyes. Fundus examination was remarkable for pallor of both optic nerves, more notably in the right eye, without edema (Figure 1). Findings of screening for antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, angiotensin-converting enzyme, Bartonella, HIV, tuberculosis (Quantiferon), Treponema pallidum, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and a complete blood cell count were normal.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Primary angiitis of the central nervous system,"1. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH)**
   - The elevated opening pressure and bilateral optic nerve edema suggest IIH.

2. **Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (AION)**
   - Given the acute vision loss and optic nerve pallor without ongoing edema, AION is a consideration.

3. **Non-arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION)**
   - The patient's age and presentation align with NAION.

4. **Optic Neuritis**
   - Though less likely due to the absence of pain and the presentation suggestive of pallor rather than inflammation, it is a possible differential.

5. **Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)**
   - Sudden painless loss of vision, although typically associated with a cherry-red spot which is not mentioned.

6. **Pseudotumor Cerebri**
   - Related to IIH, but a separate consideration due to similar symptoms and normal imaging findings.

7. **Optic Nerve Head Drusen**
   - May present similarly with vision changes and optic nerve appearance without optic nerve edema.

8. **Giant Cell Arteritis**
   - Sudden vision loss and the patient's age, with normal ESR and CRP reducing likelihood.

9. **Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)**
   - Pallor of optic nerves is a key feature, though usually more gradual onset and younger age group.

10. **Toxic and Nutritional Optic Neuropathy**
    - Considers the optic nerve pallor and history, though less likely with no relevant exposure or nutritional deficiency indicated.

### Reranked Final Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH)**
   - The elevated opening pressure and the pattern of visual field loss strongly suggest this diagnosis.

2. **Non-arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION)**
   - Based on the age, optic nerve pallor, and sudden loss of vision.

3. **Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (AION)**
   - General possibility considering age and presentation.

4. **Pseudotumor Cerebri**
   - Relevant due to similar symptoms with IIH, but separate pathophysiology.

5. **Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)**
   - Included due to optic nerve pallor despite typical presentation differences.

6. **Optic Neuritis**
   - Less likely due to absence of pain and ongoing inflammation indicators.

7. **Optic Nerve Head Drusen**
   - Pallor on fundus examination fits despite typically earlier age presentation.

8. **Toxic and Nutritional Optic Neuropathy**
   - Least likely with lack of exposure or deficiency.

9. **Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)**
   - Unlikely due to lack of classic fundus findings.

10. **Giant Cell Arteritis**
    - Unlikely with normal inflammation markers, but considered due to age and symptom overlap.","['Ophthalmology', 'Retinal Disorders', 'Headache', 'Neurology', 'Neuro-ophthalmology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,58.0,M

### INPUT:
A 36-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with 3 weeks of generalized weakness and a dry cough. She reported hair loss for 1 month. Medical history was significant for opioid and alcohol use disorders, injection drug use, and chronic HIV infection. She discontinued her antiretroviral therapy 2 years prior to presentation. At that time, her CD4+ cell count was 820/μL and her HIV viral load was undetectable. On presentation, her heart rate was 88/min and regular; blood pressure, 90/58 mm Hg; oxygen saturation, 100% on room air; and respiratory rate, 20/min. She was afebrile. Cardiorespiratory auscultation was deferred because a diagnosis of COVID-19 was considered. She had a faint maculopapular rash on her arms and torso and patchy hair loss on her scalp (Figure). There were no genital lesions or mucosal ulcerations.
### OUTPUT:
    ",“Moth-eaten” alopecia caused by secondary syphilis,"1. **HIV-related opportunistic infection**: Given the history of discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy and chronic HIV infection, the patient may be susceptible to opportunistic infections, such as Pneumocystis pneumonia or tuberculosis.

2. **Drug-induced alopecia**: The patient's history of opioid and alcohol use disorders raises the possibility of drug-associated hair loss.

3. **Syphilis**: The faint maculopapular rash and patchy hair loss could be consistent with secondary syphilis, especially considering the history of injection drug use.

4. **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**: The combination of rash, hair loss, and generalized weakness may suggest an autoimmune condition like SLE.

5. **COVID-19**: Despite the lack of fever or hypoxia, the general symptoms could be indicative of atypical COVID-19, especially given a deferred respiratory exam due to potential infection concerns.

6. **Adrenal insufficiency**: The low blood pressure, generalized weakness, and history of stress (drug use) can suggest adrenal insufficiency.

7. **Hypothyroidism**: Hair loss, weakness, and rash may be symptoms of untreated hypothyroidism.

8. **Substance withdrawal syndrome**: The symptoms could be related to withdrawal from opioids or alcohol, leading to cardiovascular instability and weakness.

9. **Iron deficiency anemia**: Hair loss and generalized weakness are common symptoms in iron deficiency anemia, possibly linked to poor nutrition or chronic disease.

10. **Psoriasis**: Patchy hair loss and generalized weakness could be part of psoriasis manifestations, although less likely without typical skin findings.

Final diagnosis: Ossification of the free flap pedicle.  
Case report: A 64-year-old man with a history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, HIV infection, coronary artery disease, and squamous cell carcinoma of the left mandible treated with composite resection, left neck dissection, and fibula free flap (FFF) reconstruction followed by postoperative radiotherapy presented with sharp, shooting left neck pain. Beginning 5 months after his reconstruction, the patient reported point tenderness on the left jaw, facial swelling, and electric pain with severity of 7 out of 10 in the left neck that occurred with talking or eating. His postoperative course was complicated by osteoradionecrosis post-tracheostomy, plate removal, and left segmental mandibulectomy. He received regular physical therapy and lymphedema therapy and was seen by Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, who treated him with onabotulinum toxin A injections; neither provided significant resolution of his symptoms. Review of a computed tomography scan of the head and neck (Figure 1) performed on follow-up 5 years after initial reconstruction demonstrated a long, hyperdense structure in the left submental, submandibular region with accompanying soft-tissue thickening. On further review of prior imaging, this calcification appeared as a new finding in various scans dating back to 5 months after FFF reconstruction compared with preoperative imaging. There was no fluorodeoxyglucose avidity in the area of question on multiple positron emission tomography scans done during this follow-up window.

### INPUT:
A woman in her late 70s with stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung presented with acute onset of redness, pain, and swelling of both lower limbs. The patient had received 4 cycles of chemotherapy with carboplatin, pemetrexed, and pembrolizumab for progressive disease and was currently in maintenance with pemetrexed-pembrolizumab. The edema appeared 5 days after the patient’s 8th cycle of chemotherapy and evolved into sclerotic plaques. Physical examination revealed ill-defined, erythematoedematous plaques symmetrically distributed along the shins, with areas of induration (Figure, A). The patient remained afebrile and systemically well. Results of laboratory tests showed no elevation of inflammatory markers (normal white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level), with kidney, liver, and heart functions within the normal ranges. Results of venous Doppler ultrasonography imaging of the patient’s legs did not show evidence of deep vein thrombosis. A biopsy specimen was obtained for histopathologic analysis (Figure, B and C).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pemetrexed-induced inflammatory and sclerotic edema,"1. **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT):** This is a common cause of leg swelling and was ruled out via Doppler ultrasound imaging.
   
2. **Cellulitis:** Considering the presence of redness, pain, and swelling, especially in a patient with cancer, but the absence of systemic symptoms like fever makes this less likely.

3. **Lymphedema:** Could be secondary to treatment, lymphatic obstruction, or cancer progression, yet often is not associated with inflammation or induration in this context.

4. **Erysipelas:** Another skin infection possibility, but without fever or elevated white blood cell counts, this is unlikely.

5. **Chemotherapy-induced cutaneous toxicity:** Pemetrexed can cause skin reactions, consistent with erythematous plaques, but sclerotic changes are less typical.

6. **Dermal fibrosis/sclerosis:** Could develop as a paraneoplastic syndrome or due to the drugs, particularly pembrolizumab, known for causing immune-mediated side effects.

7. **Inflammatory Dermatosis:** Conditions like erythema nodosum could present similarly, but typically would have systemic signs or elevated inflammatory markers.

8. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome:** A possibility given the underlying malignancy, but specific kinds often have more systemic involvement.

9. **Subcutaneous nodular sclerosis:** Secondary to the adenocarcinoma or its treatment could result in sclerotic plaques.

10. **Peripheral Vascular Disease/Insufficiency:** Chronic vascular conditions could cause changes in the skin, though the acute and symmetrical presentation makes it less likely.

After considering all data, including the biopsy results showing dermal fibrosis with minimal inflammation, the differential diagnosis is reranked as follows:

1. **Chemotherapy-induced cutaneous toxicity**
2. **Dermal fibrosis/sclerosis due to pembrolizumab**
3. **Lymphedema secondary to cancer/treatment**
4. **Paraneoplastic syndrome**
5. **Subcutaneous nodular sclerosis**
6. **Peripheral vascular disease/insufficiency** 
7. **Cellulitis**
8. **Inflammatory dermatosis (e.g., erythema nodosum)**
9. **Erysipelas**
10. **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)**

### INPUT:
A 66-year-old woman presented with multiple progressive ulcers on the right side of her face that had developed over the past 3 months (Figure, A). She had also experienced a burning sensation on the right side of her face, but denied headache, shoulder, or jaw pain and visual disturbance. Neurological examination revealed hypoesthesia of the right side of the face, while cold-warm sensation and motor function were intact. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 82 mm per hour (normal value, less than 15 mm per hour) and the serum C–reactive protein concentration was 107 mg/L (normal value, less than 5 mg/L). Chest radiography showed bilateral perihilar infiltrates consistent with pneumonia. About 2 weeks before the ulcerations developed, the patient had been admitted to the hospital for unstable angina, and coronary angiography was performed. Immediately after the angiography, the patient developed left-sided hemiplegia and hemianopsia.

### INPUT:
A 47-year-old woman presented with gradual onset of blurry vision in both eyes for several months. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/40 OS. Intraocular pressure was 23 mm Hg in both eyes and was more than 21 mm Hg in both eyes on multiple visits. Medical history included hypertension, obesity, left adrenalectomy, and pterygium excision surgery in the left eye. The patient denied previous episodes of blurry vision, history of corticosteroid use, sleep apnea, or type-A personality. Complete review of systems was otherwise negative. Amsler grid testing revealed paracentral metamorphopsia in both eyes. Extraocular motility, pupillary light reactions, and confrontational visual fields were normal. Slitlamp examination and gonioscopy results were normal in both eyes. An external photograph of the patient is shown in Figure 1A. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated multiple areas of late pinpoint leakage and patches of mottled hyperfluorescence in both eyes (Figure 1B).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Bilateral central serous chorioretinopathy secondary to pituitary microadenoma,"To approach the differential diagnosis for this 47-year-old woman with visual symptoms and examination findings, we will consider various potential conditions step-by-step:

1. **Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma (POAG):** Elevated intraocular pressure and visual changes could indicate glaucoma, despite normal visual fields and gonioscopy.

2. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR):** The presence of metamorphopsia and findings on fluorescein angiography such as leakage aligns with CSCR.

3. **Diabetic Retinopathy:** Despite no history of diabetes noted, similar retinal findings could occur in early diabetic retinopathy in an undiagnosed diabetic patient.

4. **Hypertensive Retinopathy:** Hypertension can lead to retinal vascular changes, potentially contributing to visual symptoms and angiographic findings.

5. **Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD):** Metamorphopsia and retinal abnormalities could suggest early AMD, particularly given the patient's age.

6. **Retinal Vein Occlusion:** The angiographic findings may result from venous congestion due to a partial occlusion, though less acute presentation here.

7. **Refractive Error or Anisometropia:** A vision difference may result from refractive issues not yet fully addressed by correction.

8. **Uveitis (subclinical):** While no anterior uveitis signs are evident, posterior uveitis could cause similar imaging findings and visual disturbance.

9. **Choroidal Neovascular Membranes:** This can cause leakage on fluorescein angiography and metamorphopsia, although it often accompanies AMD.

10. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH):** Presents with blurry vision and could cause subtle visual field changes missed on confrontation testing, though unlikely without papilledema.

Final diagnosis: Foveal retinoschisis with epiretinal membrane in the setting of pathologic myopia.
Case report: A man in his 50s with hypertension who was otherwise in good health presented for new ophthalmologic evaluation in the setting of mild, long-standing blurred vision with slight metamorphopsia in the right eye. He had a history of high myopia (approximately 9 diopters [D] OD; 8 D OS). Examination revealed an otherwise normal left eye with 20/20 best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). The right eye demonstrated a BCVA of 20/25 and normal anterior segment, including lenticular examination. Dilated fundus examination showed wrinkling of the neurosensory retina at the fovea (Figure 1A) without posterior vitreous detachment. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography revealed hyperreflective layering on the foveal surface consistent with epiretinal membrane, as well as splitting of the outer plexiform layer with hyporeflective cavities (Figure 1B).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Foveal retinoschisis with epiretinal membrane in the setting of pathologic myopia,"1. **Epiretinal membrane**: Given the finding of wrinkling of the neurosensory retina at the fovea and the presence of hyperreflective layers on the foveal surface.

2. **Myopic macular degeneration**: Considering the patient's history of high myopia and changes in the macular region.

3. **Vitreomacular traction syndrome**: Due to the appearance of the fovea and absence of posterior vitreous detachment.

4. **Central serous chorioretinopathy**: Although less likely due to the chronicity and presentation, should be considered given the age and visual symptoms.

5. **Foveoschisis**: The presence of the splitting of the outer plexiform layer and hyporeflective cavities points towards this condition often associated with high myopia.

6. **Lamellar macular hole**: The structural changes in the macula and slight metamorphopsia warrant consideration of a lamellar macular hole.

7. **Age-related macular degeneration**: Although not classic for this age and presentation, it remains a differential due to blurred vision and metamorphopsia.

8. **Retinal detachment**: Less likely given lack of detachment on examination, but considered due to the myopic history.

9. **Hypertensive retinopathy**: Due to patient's history of hypertension, must be considered despite lack of classical signs.

10. **Optic neuritis**: Although no acute vision loss or pain is noted, the possibility of subtle optic nerve involvement in visual symptoms should not be ignored.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

### INPUT:
A 28-year-old woman with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) presented with a recent bilateral and painless decrease of best-corrected visual acuity to light perception OD and counting fingers OS. Results of a slitlamp examination showed iris neovascularization and posterior subcapsular cataract in the right eye and no anterior segment abnormalities, including no iris neovascularization, in the left eye. Intraocular pressure was 60 mm Hg in the right eye and 14 mm Hg in the left eye. The fundus in the right eye (Figure, A) showed a total retinal detachment with hemorrhagic prepapillary fibrosis reaching up to the posterior capsule; the left eye (Figure, B) showed peripapillary tractional retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy, retinal neovascularization, and vitreous hemorrhage. Fluorescein angiography showed extensive retinal capillary and arteriolar nonperfusion and peripapillary neovascularization in both eyes.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 50s presented with painful palmar and plantar purpura that lasted for 2 months (Figure, A). The lesions first appeared on the volar aspect of the left hand and resolved spontaneously within a few days. However, the purpura soon relapsed on the left plantar area. Oral administration of aspirin and limaprost alfadex was ineffective, and the purpura spread on the palms and feet, followed by onset of left hemiplegia with dysarthria. The patient had no history of arterial or coronary catheterization, hyperlipidemia, hepatitis, nor endocrine neoplasia. The patient’s body temperature and laboratory test results, including inflammatory markers, were slightly elevated. Autoimmune blood tests, including antinuclear antibody, anticardiolipin antibody, and lupus anticoagulant, were not detected. Lentiginosis was not evident. A skin biopsy of the purpura of the left plantar area was conducted (Figure, B).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cutaneous embolization of cardiac myxoma,"1. **Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)** - Considering the presentation of purpura and neurological symptoms like hemiplegia and dysarthria, TTP is a differential diagnosis to consider.
   
2. **Vasculitis** - Given the recurrent nature of purpura and systemic involvement, a form of vasculitis such as polyarteritis nodosa could be considered.

3. **Cryoglobulinemia** - This condition can cause purpura and is associated with elevated inflammatory markers.

4. **Monoclonal Gammopathy** - Often associated with skin manifestations such as purpura, this category includes diseases like Multiple Myeloma.

5. **Amyloidosis** - Can present with purpura and systemic involvement; often affects multiple organ systems.

6. **Infective Endocarditis** - Presents with embolic phenomena causing purpura and can also lead to neurological symptoms.

7. **Antiphospholipid Syndrome** - Could explain thrombotic events and purpuric lesions, even with negative lupus anticoagulant testing, highlighting the possibility of seronegative cases.

8. **Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (IgA Vasculitis)** - Although more common in children, can occur in adults and involves palpable purpura and systemic symptoms.

9. **Cholesterol Embolism Syndrome** - Frequent in older patients, and can follow a history of vascular procedures, though not present here, it remains a possibility due to embolic events and purpura.

10. **Drug-Induced Vasculitis** - A consideration due to the recent medication intake; medication can sometimes trigger vasculitic responses.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)** - The combination of purpura, neurological symptoms, and slight elevation of inflammatory markers keeps TTP as a strong possibility.
2. **Vasculitis** - The presentation with purpura and varied systemic involvement points towards vasculitis as a plausible diagnosis.
3. **Monoclonal Gammopathy** - With systemic involvement and purpura, this still stands out in the differential list.
4. **Cryoglobulinemia** - Given the laboratory hints and systemic symptoms, it remains a possible condition.
5. **Amyloidosis** - As purpura and multi-system involvement is a common presentation.
6. **Antiphospholipid Syndrome** - Despite the negative serologies, it remains possible with the systemic thrombotic presentations.
7. **Infective Endocarditis** - Consideration due to systemic involvement and purpura.
8. **Cholesterol Embolism Syndrome** - The symptoms align but there's no history of vascular procedures.
9. **Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (IgA Vasculitis)** - Less typical of this age group but still a differential diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A previously healthy man in his early 70s was referred to our emergency department with exertional dyspnea. He reported recent physical and emotional stress from work and dizziness 2 days prior to presentation. He denied fever or palpitations. His blood pressure was 84/59 mm Hg. A harmonic, musical systolic murmur was heard at the left third intercostal space. An electrocardiogram (ECG; Figure 1A) showed diffuse ST-segment elevation, most prominently in the anterior precordial leads. Laboratory evaluation revealed elevated levels of troponin (1.33 ng/mL; normal range: ≤0.016 ng/mL [to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1.0]), brain natriuretic peptide (376.5 pg/mL; normal range: ≤18.4 pg/mL [to convert to nanograms per liter, multiply by 1.0]), creatinine phosphokinase (96 U/L; normal range: 41-153 U/L), and D-dimer (0.68 μg/mL; normal range: ≤1.00 μg/mL [to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 5.476]). Echocardiography showed left ventricular (LV) wall-motion abnormalities involving the mid and apical segments and an LV apical mass with protruding features. Noncontrast computed tomography confirmed the high-density LV mass (Figure 1B). Coronary angiography revealed mild to moderate coronary atherosclerosis without obstructive coronary artery disease.

### INPUT:
A 13-year-old girl with an unsteady gait was referred for evaluation. She had been well until 1 month prior, when she developed lower limb weakness after eating a vegetarian diet for 15 days. Her medical and family histories were unremarkable. Her walking had become unsteady, and she was less talkative. On examination, she scored 24 on a Mini-Mental State Examination, with impairments in temporal and spatial orientation, calculation, and short-term memory. Horizontal nystagmus was observed. Her lower limb strength was 4 of 5 proximally and 5− of 5 distally, with increased muscle tone. Patellar reflexes were brisk. Ankle clonus and Babinski signs were present bilaterally. Her gait was spastic (Video). Blood test results indicated normocytic anemia (hemoglobin level, 126 g/L; reference, >130 g/L [to convert to grams per deciliter, multiply by 0.1]), borderline folate elevation (2.15 ng/mL; reference, >2 μg/L [to convert nanomoles per liter, multiply by 2.266]), and an increased homocysteine level (8.85 mg/L; reference, <2.03 mg/L [to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 7.397]). Results of stool analysis; liver and kidney function tests; myocardial enzyme, electrolyte, ammonia, trace element, and B12 levels; thyroid function, arterial blood gas, antinuclear antibodies, and intrinsic factor antibody tests; and an infection panel test were unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging showed mild cerebral atrophy and a hyperintense T2-weighted signal in the cervical spinal cord. Electromyography results were normal. Electroencephalography showed diffuse background slowing with scattered epileptiform discharges. Urine organic acid analysis indicated methylmalonic acidemia. A serum amino acid analysis was nondiagnostic (Figure 1). Cerebrospinal fluid was normal.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cobalamin C deficiency,"1. **Subacute Combined Degeneration** (Vitamin B12 deficiency) - Considered due to neurological symptoms with unsteady gait, cognitive impairment, and methylmalonic acidemia.
2. **Folate Deficiency** - Borderline folate level; neurological involvement could be due to combined B12 and folate metabolism issues.
3. **Neurometabolic Disorder** (e.g., Mitochondrial disorder) - Given diffuse neurological symptoms and background EEG slowing, consider possible neurometabolic issue.
4. **Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia** - Spastic gait, increased tone, and pyramidal tract signs suggest this genetic disorder.
5. **Cerebral Palsy** - Although less likely due to the late presentation, similar symptoms could overlap.
6. **Multiple Sclerosis** - Uncommon in this age group but possible given MRI findings and spasticity.
7. **Adrenomyeloneuropathy** - X-linked disorder associated with similar neurological features.
8. **Friedreich’s Ataxia** - Although the presentation is atypical, symptoms of ataxia and possible neuropathy are suggestive.
9. **Metachromatic Leukodystrophy** - Consider due to signs of central and peripheral nervous system involvement.
10. **Wilson's Disease** - Could present with psychiatric and neurological issues, though liver tests are normal.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:

1. **Subacute Combined Degeneration** - Due to present methylmalonic acidemia and neurological symptoms possibly linked to diet change.
2. **Folate Deficiency** - Given the borderline folate measurements indicating possible metabolic involvement.
3. **Friedreich’s Ataxia** - Symptoms consistent with early onset neurological ataxia.
4. **Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia** - Due to spasticity and gait disturbances.
5. **Neurometabolic Disorder** - Consider unexplained diffuse EEG and MRI changes.
6. **Multiple Sclerosis** - Due to MRI findings although less likely in children.
7. **Adrenomyeloneuropathy** - Due to possible overlapping neuro symptoms and spasticity.
8. **Metachromatic Leukodystrophy** - Similar neurological presentation with potential pyramidal involvement.
9. **Cerebral Palsy** - Less likely due to age of onset but similar spastic symptoms.
10. **Wilson's Disease** - Consider due to neurological presentation despite normal liver function tests.","['Neurology', 'Pediatrics']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,13.0,M

### INPUT:
A 37-year-old woman with no history of vision problems presented with subacute loss of vision in her right eye for 1 week. The patient described a paracentral scotoma that progressed to involve central fixation over the course of 3 days. Two weeks earlier, the patient and her children had developed malaise, low-grade fever, and a rash. She worked in the armed services and denied foreign travel, tick bites, or recent immunization. The patient had been evaluated by her primary care clinician and was referred to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation. On examination, her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/70 OD and 20/20 OS. Test results of intraocular pressures, ocular motility, and pupillary reactions were normal. Confrontation visual fields showed inferonasal and central defects in the right eye. External examination revealed a macular rash of the scalp and all 4 extremities, including the soles and palms (Figure 1A). Anterior segment examination was normal. Posterior segment examination revealed irregular, gray-white pigmentation of the temporal macula of the right eye without vitritis, optic nerve edema, or vasculitis (Figure 1B). Ocular coherence tomography (OCT) revealed focal, heterogenous disruption of the inner segment ellipsoid zone without neurosensory detachment. Fluorescein angiography showed late staining at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) superotemporal to the fovea. Findings from a dilated fundus examination were normal in the left eye.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Unilateral acute idiopathic maculopathy,"1. **Acute Zonal Occult Outer Retinopathy (AZOOR):** Considering the subacute vision loss with scotoma, retinal pigment epithelium changes without significant inflammation.
   
2. **Multiple Evanescent White Dot Syndrome (MEWDS):** The sudden vision change, young age, and presence of a viral prodrome including malaise and fever align with MEWDS, characterized by scattered white dots in the fundus.

3. **Viral Retinitis (e.g., CMV Retinitis):** Given the systemic symptoms prior to vision loss and the retinal pigmentation changes, a viral cause could be plausible.

4. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR):** Although typically presenting with serous detachment which is absent here, vision loss and potential stress factors make this worth consideration at this stage.

5. **Acute Posterior Multifocal Placoid Pigment Epitheliopathy (APMPPE):** This condition often follows a viral prodromal illness and presents with rapid visual loss and retinal changes.

6. **Syphilitic Posterior Uveitis:** Given the characteristic rash on palms and soles, syphilis-associated uveitis should be considered.

7. **Lyme Disease:** Although the patient denied tick bites, Lyme disease can sometimes present with ocular manifestations in endemic areas.

8. **Behçet’s Disease:** Known for causing uveitis and possibly neurological symptoms, though other systemic signs may be absent.

9. **Sarcoidosis:** Uveitis is common with sarcoidosis and can cause retinal changes, though systemic features were not mentioned.

10. **Autoimmune Retinopathy:** Though rare, AI conditions like cancer-associated retinopathy could cause such retinal damage.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Acute Zonal Occult Outer Retinopathy (AZOOR):** Remains the top consideration given the unique imaging findings and clinical course.
2. **Multiple Evanescent White Dot Syndrome (MEWDS):** Symptoms align well; recent viral symptoms provide significant evidence.
3. **Acute Posterior Multifocal Placoid Pigment Epitheliopathy (APMPPE):** Fits with prodromal viral symptoms and focal retinal alterations.
4. **Syphilitic Posterior Uveitis:** Given systemic and cutaneous findings (rash on palms and soles).
5. **Viral Retinitis:** Systemic viral prodrome aligns with this diagnosis.
6. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR):** Less likely without detachment evidence on OCT.
7. **Lyme Disease:** Less likely without a history of tick exposure or geographical prevalence.
8. **Behçet’s Disease:** Less likely given absence of systemic inflammatory signs.
9. **Sarcoidosis:** While plausible, lacks additional systemic involvement or findings.
10. **Autoimmune Retinopathy:** Rare and less consistent with current systemic findings.","['Infectious Diseases', 'Ophthalmology', 'Dermatology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,37.0,M

### INPUT:
A 34-year-old man presented with photophobia in both eyes. Six months earlier while abroad, the patient had bilateral cosmetic iris implants (BrightOcular) placed. The patient had a mild change in refractive error postoperatively and was offered laser in situ keratomileusis surgery for correction. He did not report any other immediate postoperative complications. For 4 weeks before presentation, he had blurred vision of the right eye. His visual acuity was 20/50 OD and 20/25 OS. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 31 mm Hg in the right eye and 17 mm Hg in the left. The pupillary reflex could not be visualized secondary to the iris implants. Slitlamp examination revealed trace anterior chamber cell bilaterally with pigmented keratic precipitates. The implants were overlying the iris structures (Figure 1A). Results of an ultrasonographic biomicroscopy are shown in Figure 1B. Posterior examination was limited by the iris implants, but the optic nerve did not reveal edema or hemorrhages. The peripheral retina could not be visualized in either eye.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Uveitis-glaucoma-hyphema syndrome secondary to cosmetic iris implants,"**Initial Differential Diagnosis Steps:**

1. **Uveitis** - Given the trace anterior chamber cell and photophobia, inflammation such as uveitis is a consideration.

2. **Glaucoma** - The elevated intraocular pressure, especially in the right eye, could indicate secondary glaucoma, possibly related to the cosmetic iris implants.

3. **Pigment Dispersion Syndrome** - Pigmented keratic precipitates could suggest pigment dispersion, particularly given the cosmetic implants.

4. **Endophthalmitis** - Although not mentioned, postoperative infections could lead to photophobia and blurred vision.

5. **Keratitis** - Inflammation of the cornea that would cause photophobia.

6. **Cataract Formation** - Postoperative changes and blurred vision could be due to cataract development.

7. **Lens Subluxation or Dislocation** - Possible after surgical procedures involving the eye, causing visual disturbances.

8. **Corneal Edema** - Can occur post-surgically and lead to photophobia and changes in visual acuity.

9. **Foreign Body Reaction** - Chronic irritation due to the presence of the cosmetic implants can't be ruled out.

10. **Choroidal Effusion or Detachment** - The limitation in posterior exam visibility due to the implants raises concern for further complications involving the choroid or retina.

**Reranked Differential Diagnosis:**

1. **Secondary Glaucoma** - Due to cosmetic iris implants causing increased IOP.
2. **Uveitis** - Persistent inflammation with photophobia and cellular changes.
3. **Pigment Dispersion Syndrome** - Likely with keratic precipitates and previous cosmetic procedure.
4. **Foreign Body Reaction** - Reaction due to cosmetic implants remains a key differential.
5. **Corneal Edema** - Due to surgical interference could lead to symptoms.
6. **Choroidal Effusion or Detachment** - Though not verifiable, a concern given implant coverage.
7. **Endophthalmitis** - Less common to present solely with photophobia.
8. **Keratitis** - With photophobia but less likely without more corneal findings.
9. **Cataract Formation** - Symptoms don't primarily fit cataracts.
10. **Lens Subluxation or Dislocation** - Detected signs don't largely support this.","['Ophthalmology', 'Cosmetic Medicine, Non-Surgical', 'Intraocular Inflammation', 'Glaucoma']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,34.0,F

### INPUT:
A White man in his late 50s with a medical history of osteoporosis, hyperlipidemia, and migraines presented with hematuria. Results of computed tomography (CT) imaging showed an 8×6×5-cm right kidney lesion (Figure 1, A). The patient underwent surgical resection with a right nephrectomy and an apparent diagnosis of angiomyolipoma (AML). One year later, the patient underwent excision of a right iliac wing lesion, and pathologic findings demonstrated xanthoma of bone with sclerosis. Three years after this second surgery, he presented with new abdominal pain. Results of CT imaging revealed a 4.3-cm retrocaval mass at the level of the renal right vein. He underwent surgical resection, and results of pathologic evaluation were consistent with the original tumor. Follow-up CT imaging revealed a 1.2-cm left upper lobe lung nodule and a 0.8-cm right upper lobe lung nodule, as well as a pulmonary embolism and a left 6th rib fracture. These lesions were fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography avid. The patient denied constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, fever, chills, and night sweats. He underwent bilateral video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery wedge resections of the lung lesions, which were also consistent with the primary tumor. Five years later, the patient (now in his late 60s) presented with multiple left pleural-based lung lesions (Figure 1, B). Results of all laboratory testing were within reference ranges. These pleural-based lesions were resected with left video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery partial pleurectomy, and results of pathologic evaluation were positive for HMB45 and Melan-A.

2. Metastatic Melanoma: Highly likely due to positive HMB45 and Melan-A markers.
3. Renal Cell Carcinoma: Initially suspected based on the kidney lesion but less likely due to pathologic evaluations.
4. Translocation Renal Cell Carcinoma: Considered due to nephrectomy case but inconsistent with pleural metastases histology.
5. Liposarcoma: Possible but less consistent with immunohistochemical markers present.
6. Synovial Sarcoma: Consideration given the soft tissue involvement but less consistent with histological findings.
7. Lymphoma: Unlikely due to absence of typical hematologic and constitutional symptoms.
8. Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor: Considered but less likely due to positive staining for melanoma-associated markers.

### INPUT:
A 42-year-old man (height, 160 cm; weight, 50 kg) presented with a 3-month history of a clicking sensation and painful swallowing, mainly on the right side, with a sudden onset. He had consulted other physicians, but the cause could not be identified. The symptoms gradually exacerbated, seriously deteriorating his quality of life and causing a 5-kg weight loss. He also experienced insomnia and depression. Antidepressants and psychotherapy, prescribed under the suspicion of a psychogenic cause, did not alleviate his symptoms. He had no relevant medical history and no smoking or drinking history. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological findings were unremarkable. A careful physical examination, with palpation of the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage region on swallowing, revealed a clear clicking movement and right-sided friction with accompanying pain. However, results of laryngoscopy and other common imaging studies showed no pathology. Hence, to assess the dynamic structural changes during swallowing, we performed swallowing dynamic computed tomography (SD-CT), which can reveal moving structures by creating a dynamic-volume data set during swallowing.1,2 Comparison of the reconstructed SD-CT images at rest (Figure 1A) and on swallowing (Figure 1B) revealed that the superior thyroid notch and the right superior border of the thyroid cartilage contacted the hyoid bone internally during maximum laryngeal elevation on swallowing.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Clicking larynx,"**10-Step Differential Diagnosis:**

1. **Thyrohyoid syndrome** - A condition characterized by painful swallowing due to hyoid bone or thyroid cartilage abnormalities.
2. **Eagle's syndrome** - Elongation of the styloid process or calcification of the stylohyoid ligament causing throat pain and clicking.
3. **Submandibular gland disorder** - Conditions like sialolithiasis that might cause referred pain during swallowing.
4. **Cricopharyngeal spasm** - A spasm of the upper esophageal sphincter causing dysphagia and throat discomfort.
5. **Glossopharyngeal neuralgia** - Severe pain in the throat, ear, and tonsillar regions triggered by swallowing.
6. **Laryngeal cartilage injury** - Trauma or microtrauma to the laryngeal cartilage that might not be visible on standard imaging.
7. **External Mass Effect** - A neoplastic or non-neoplastic mass exerting pressure on the laryngeal region.
8. **Thyroiditis** - Inflammation of the thyroid gland resulting in localized pain exacerbated by swallowing.
9. **Cervical spine misalignment** - Abnormalities or misalignments in cervical vertebrae affecting swallowing mechanics.
10. **Achalasia or Esophageal Motility Disorder** - Disorders affecting esophageal muscle activity, causing varied swallowing symptoms and weight loss.

**Reranked Differential Diagnosis:**

1. **Thyrohyoid syndrome** - Most likely given the specific clicking sensation identified around the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage during swallowing.
2. **Laryngeal cartilage injury** - Given the specific friction and pain reproduced during examination, despite normal imaging.
3. **Eagle's syndrome** - Considered due to the nature of the clicking and painful sensations, although imaging did not reveal styloid process issues.
4. **Glossopharyngeal neuralgia** - Falls lower since direct structural changes were observed which are not typical for this neuralgia.
5. **Cricopharyngeal spasm** - Possible contender though higher suspicion for mechanical contact from SD-CT results.
6. **Submandibular gland disorder** - Reduced likelihood, as typical imaging did not indicate such issues and pain pattern is more consistent with thyroid or laryngeal involvement.
7. **Thyroiditis** - Less likely without accompanying systemic symptoms or imaging confirmation.
8. **External Mass Effect** - Unlikely due to absence of visible external or internal masses on imaging.
9. **Cervical spine misalignment** - Considered lower due to specific findings around thyroid and hyoid movements.
10. **Achalasia or Esophageal Motility Disorder** - Least likely based on specific clicking movement localized to hyoid and thyroid during swallowing. 

In conclusion, given the swallowing dynamics revealed by SD-CT showing internal contact between laryngeal elements, thyrohyoid syndrome is the most compelling diagnosis in this case.","['Otolaryngology', 'Swallowing and Dysphagia']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,42.0,F

A 26-year-old woman presented with reduced visual acuity in both eyes since early childhood. She had short stature (1.52 m [−3.6 SD]) and progeroid appearance. Her parents and brother had normal stature. Her medical history was significant for frequent upper respiratory tract infections since infancy. She had no intellectual disability, neurologic symptoms, or hearing impairment. There was no family history of visual impairment or neurologic disorders. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/80 OD and 20/50 OS. Intraocular pressure was normal. She could not identify any Ishihara color plate. Slitlamp examination was unremarkable. Dilated fundus examination results showed diffuse optic atrophy (OA) and fine pigmentary mottling changes at the fovea in both eyes (Figure 1A). Electroretinography (ERG) showed normal dark-adapted responses and severely reduced light-adapted responses. Optical coherence tomography showed thinning of retinal nerve fiber layers and disruption of outer nuclear layers and the ellipsoid zone at the center of the fovea (Figure 1B). Leber hereditary optic neuropathy sequencing was negative for 3 hot spot mutations.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 50s presented with a history of pruritic lesions of the lower legs over the past 15 years that were unresponsive to topical corticosteroid therapy. On examination, she had multiple lichenified and ulcerated papules and nodules, some of them grouped in plaques located on the medial aspect of both shins (Figure, A). Occasional tense blisters were also seen (Figure, B). The patient’s family history was significant for similar cutaneous lesions in her father, brother, and cousin. Mild toenail dystrophy was also observed. A punch biopsy from the shin for histopathologic examination was performed (Figure, C and D).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pretibial epidermolysis bullosa,"1. **Lichen simplex chronicus** - A chronic localized form of lichenification resulting from repetitive scratching or rubbing.

2. **Prurigo nodularis** - Characterized by pruritic nodules primarily arising from repeated scratching or itching.

3. **Bullous pemphigoid** - An autoimmune blistering disease presenting with tense blisters and pruritic plaques, often in the elderly.

4. **Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita** - A mechanobullous disease that presents with blisters and is associated with trauma-prone areas.

5. **Lichen planus** - An inflammatory condition with pruritic, polygonal, flat-topped papules.

6. **Chronic dermatitis** - Persistent skin inflammation that may result in lichenified plaques.

7. **Nodular amyloidosis** - Deposition of amyloid in the dermis presenting as nodular lesions, frequently pruritic.

8. **Psoriasis** - A chronic inflammatory condition manifesting as scaly plaques and possible nail dystrophy.

9. **Dermatitis herpetiformis** - An autoimmune blistering disorder associated with gluten sensitivity, causing grouped vesicles and intense pruritus.

10. **Lichen amyloidosis** - Localized amyloidosis characterized by lichenoid papules often on shins, associated with familial cases and itch.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Lichen amyloidosis** - Given the chronic pruritic nature, familial history, and distribution of lesions along with nail changes makes this top differential.
2. **Bullous pemphigoid** - Due to the presence of tense blisters alongside plaques.
3. **Prurigo nodularis** - Considering chronicity and nodular nature, but less likely given the blistering and familial aspect.
4. **Lichen simplex chronicus** - Could be considered for chronic scratching but lacks familial history explanation.
5. **Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita** - Possible due to blistering, but histologic confirmation necessary.
6. **Dermatitis herpetiformis** - Given the tense blistering but is less likely due to the familial nature.
7. **Lichen planus** - Consistent with itchy papules but blisters are uncommon.
8. **Nodular amyloidosis** - Could explain nodules and itching, less likely blister formation.
9. **Chronic dermatitis** - Possible but lacks convincing link to blistering and familial history.
10. **Psoriasis** - The nail dystrophy fits, but less consistent with grouped nodules and blister history.",['Dermatology'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50.0,M

### INPUT:
A 65-year-old woman presented with worsening right eye pain and purulent discharge. She reported being hit in the face by a tree branch several days prior. Her medical history was notable for HIV, with a last known CD4 lymphocyte count of 112 cells/mm3 and variable adherence to antiretroviral therapy. At an outside hospital, cultures were obtained, and treatment was initiated with ofloxacin eye drops, 0.3%, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride ointment, 0.3%, and oral moxifloxacin hydrochloride, 400 mg daily. Her symptoms worsened, and she was referred 3 days later for further evaluation. On examination, visual acuity in the right eye was hand motions. The left eye examination results were unremarkable. Slitlamp examination was limited by patient discomfort but revealed purulent discharge, a markedly inflamed conjunctiva, diffuse cornea opacification and thinning, and a flat anterior chamber. Given the history of tree branch trauma, the patient was brought to the operating room. Intraoperatively, a 0.5-mm corneal perforation was identified within an area of thinning (Figure, A). Microbial cultures were repeated, and corneal glue was applied. Gram stain of the purulent discharge demonstrated numerous polymorphonuclear leukocytes only. All subsequent microbiology cultures were negative. Despite treatment with topical fortified vancomycin, 25 mg/mL, tobramycin, 13.3 mg/mL, intravenous levofloxacin, 750 mg daily, and doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily, the purulent conjunctivitis and corneal stromal necrosis did not improve (Figure, B).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Gonococcal keratoconjunctivitis,"1. **Bacterial keratitis** - Given the history of trauma and purulent discharge, bacterial infection is a primary consideration.

2. **Fungal keratitis** - The contact with organic material (tree branch) raises suspicion for a fungal etiology.

3. **Acanthamoeba keratitis** - Considered due to severe pain disproportionate to clinical findings and the patient's immunosuppressed status.

4. **Herpes simplex keratitis** - HSV should be considered due to HIV status and potential for atypical presentations.

5. **Mooren’s ulcer** - Could present as progressive corneal thinning and perforation.

6. **Peripheral ulcerative keratitis (PUK)** - Associated with systemic autoimmune conditions and causes corneal thinning.

7. **Microsporidial keratitis** - Opportunistic infections like microsporidia can occur in immunocompromised hosts.

8. **Corneal ulcer secondary to HIV** - Direct HIV-related ocular pathology.

9. **Sterile inflammatory keratitis** - An inflammatory response without infection, possible in those with autoimmune conditions or following trauma.

10. **Chemical keratitis** - If there was delayed irritation from a chemical previously on the branch.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Fungal keratitis** - Given the organic trauma and lack of bacterial growth in cultures, fungal elements are strongly suspected.
2. **Bacterial keratitis** - Although initial cultures were negative, bacterial involvement still might be contributing, albeit less likely.
3. **Acanthamoeba keratitis** - Severe pain and the immunocompromised state keep this as a strong consideration.
4. **Microsporidial keratitis** - Immunocompromised status increases susceptibility.
5. **Herpes simplex keratitis** - Due to the known history of immune suppression, possible unusual viral presentation.
6. **Sterile inflammatory keratitis** - Especially given lack of culture positivity.
7. **Peripheral ulcerative keratitis (PUK)** - Although less commonly linked directly to trauma, it remains a differential for unexplained thinning.
8. **Mooren’s ulcer** - A rare possibility, unlikely without fitting clinical systemic signs.
9. **Corneal ulcer secondary to HIV** - Could result from immunosuppression and require further exploration.
10. **Chemical keratitis** - Least likely given the presentation and treatment history.","['Cornea', 'Sexually Transmitted Infections', 'External Eye Disease', 'Ophthalmology', 'HIV']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,65.0,M

### INPUT:
A 67-year-old man with fibromyalgia presented with sequential bilateral vision loss. Vision decreased suddenly in the right eye 3 to 4 weeks prior and in the left eye 5 days prior. He reported left-sided scalp tenderness; jaw claudication; neck, shoulder, and low back pain; and a recent 6.8-kilogram weight loss. Visual acuity was 20/200 in the right eye (OD) and hand motion in the left eye (OS). He had a left relative afferent pupillary defect, moderate dry-eye syndrome, and mild cataracts. The right optic nerve had a cup-disc ratio of 0.55 with temporal pallor and mild optic disc edema, and the left nerve had a cup-disc ratio of 0.50 with mild edema without pallor. Bilateral arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy was suspected. Expedited evaluation and treatment of giant cell arteritis (GCA) was pursued. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated at 61 mm/h, whereas C-reactive protein (CRP), hemoglobin, and platelet levels were normal. He was hospitalized for empirical treatment with 1 g of intravenous methylprednisolone sodium succinate daily for 5 days. Results of a left temporal artery biopsy (TAB) were negative for GCA. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits showed abnormal signal and contrast enhancement within the intraorbital midportion of both optic nerves (Figure 1A and B) as well as incidental parotid gland cysts bilaterally (Figure 1C). He was discharged and was taking oral prednisone anhydrous, 60 mg daily. One month later the patient had improvement in visual acuity to 20/50 OD and 20/25 OS.

9. Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome (IOIS)
10. Sjögren's Syndrome

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA):** Despite the negative temporal artery biopsy, clinical suspicion and improvement with steroids make it still a strong candidate.
2. **Optic Neuritis:** MRI findings align well, with improvement on steroid therapy.
3. **Sarcoidosis:** Abnormal MRI findings and systemic symptoms could be consistent with sarcoidosis.
4. **Sjögren's Syndrome:** Presence of parotid gland cysts suggest potential Sjögren's involvement with optic neuropathy.
5. **Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD):** Visual involvement with MRI findings should be considered, especially given the unusual presentation.
6. **Infectious Optic Neuropathy:** Rule out other infections such as syphilis considering optic nerve involvement.
7. **Multiple Sclerosis:** Less likely without characteristic lesions but still possible given the optic nerve findings.
8. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome (IOIS):** Inflammatory nature of the symptoms and MRI findings, without a systemic cause potentially points to IOIS.
9. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE):** Would expect systemic findings, but can't fully discount.

### INPUT:
A 64-year-old man in excellent general health who was not taking any medications was referred for evaluation of an epiretinal membrane of his right eye. He reported no blurry vision, metamorphopsia, photopsias, floaters, or nyctalopia, and he had no history of refractive surgical procedures, ocular surgical procedures, or trauma. His family history was negative for ocular conditions, and there was no consanguinity in his family. His visual acuity was 20/20 OU with correction (plano +0.25 × 153 OD and −0.50 + 0.25 × 009 OS). External and anterior segment examination results were unremarkable except for mild nuclear sclerotic cataracts. Results of a dilated ophthalmoscopic examination showed radial spokelike striae of the fovea, with a central cyst in the right eye and macular edema of the left eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of the right macula showed cystlike changes in the outer retina in the foveal and parafoveal regions and in the inner retina in the temporal macula. Optical coherence tomography imaging of the left macula showed cystlike changes in the outer retina in the inferior macula (Figure). Of note, OCT scans of the optic nerves did not reveal an optic disc pit.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Stellate nonhereditary idiopathic foveomacular retinoschisis,"### Step-by-step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Idiopathic Epiretinal Membrane**: Initial presentation involves the presence of an epiretinal membrane by evaluation.
   
2. **Cystoid Macular Edema**: Due to the presence of macular edema and cystlike changes observed on OCT.
   
3. **Vitelliform Maculopathy**: Characteristic cystlike changes in the outer retina similar to vitelliform lesions.
   
4. **X-linked Retinoschisis**: Cystlike changes and foveal spoking can be indicative of retinoschisis.
   
5. **Macular Telangiectasia Type 2**: Possible due to the cystic macular changes with vascular abnormalities which could be consistent with MacTel 2.
   
6. **Lamellar Macular Hole**: Occurrence of cystlike changes in the outer retina might suggest lamellar hole pathology.
   
7. **Chronic Central Serous Chorioretinopathy**: Central cystic changes could mimic chronic central serous presentations.
   
8. **Vitreomacular Traction Syndrome**: Potential due to traction-related cystic changes in the macula.
   
9. **Diabetic Macular Edema**: Considered unlikely given the health status and absence of systemic conditions but still plausible.
   
10. **Age-related Macular Degeneration**: Due to the possibility of non-typical presentations and mild nuclear sclerotic cataracts that correlate with age.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Idiopathic Epiretinal Membrane**

### INPUT:
A 54-year-old man with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and migraines presented to a tertiary care otolaryngology clinic reporting 3 months of worsening right ear pain and 1 month of pulsatile tinnitus and hearing loss. He denied a history of fever, otorrhea, prior ear infections, vertigo, or otologic surgery. The patient first saw his primary care physician, who visualized a mass in the right ear canal and attempted needle aspiration, which led to self-resolved bleeding. He was given ciprofloxacin ear drops and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, which did not improve his symptoms. On examination, his right external auditory canal (EAC) was completely obstructed by a fleshy, pulsatile mass with a red hue (Figure 1A). Results of Weber tuning fork examination lateralized to the right ear and a Rinne examination suggested a conductive hearing loss. Formal audiogram results confirmed conductive hearing loss in the right ear and type B tympanometry, which was indicative of poor eardrum mobility. Computed tomography (CT) of the temporal bone without contrast showed a well-circumscribed 9-mm lesion in the EAC with bony erosion along the junction of the anterior wall and floor (Figure 1, B and C). Magnetic resonance imaging results showed a well-circumscribed, contrast-enhancing mass that was confined to the EAC (Figure 1D).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Lobular capillary hemangioma of the EAC,"**Step 1:** Glomus Tympanicum  
- Considered due to the presence of pulsatile tinnitus, conductive hearing loss, and a mass with a vascular appearance in the ear canal.

**Step 2:** Cholesteatoma  
- Considered because of the hearing loss and mass in the ear canal, but less likely given the vascular nature and pulsatile tinnitus.

**Step 3:** External Auditory Canal Cancer  
- Considered due to the ear pain, bleeding after needle aspiration, and bony erosion seen on CT.

**Step 4:** Hemangioma of the EAC  
- Considered due to the red hue and vascular nature of the mass.

**Step 5:** Cerumen Impaction with Complication  
- Unlikely given the vascular, pulsatile nature and CT findings but considered due to conductive hearing loss.

**Step 6:** Otitis Externa with Granulation Tissue  
- Considered because the patient was initially treated with ear drops; however, lack of infection signs and vascular mass makes this less likely.

**Step 7:** Acoustic Neuroma  
- Less likely due to conductive rather than sensorineural hearing loss, but considered due to hearing issues and mass presence.

**Step 8:** EAC Polyps  
- Considered due to the presence of a fleshy mass in the ear canal, but palpation causing bleeding points towards a more vascular etiology.

**Step 9:** Osteoma of the EAC  
- Considered due to the presence of bony growth but bony erosion on CT and vascular characteristics suggest otherwise.

**Step 10:** Paraganglioma (Glomus Jugulare)  
- Considered due to pulsatile tinnitus and vascular mass, but location confined to the EAC lowers probability.

### Reranking with All Patient Information:

1. **Glomus Tympanicum**  
2. **External Auditory Canal Cancer**  
3. **Hemangioma of the EAC**  
4. **Cholesteatoma**

9. **Osteoma of the EAC**  
10. **Cerumen Impaction with Complication**

This ranking takes into account the patient's history, symptoms, examination findings, and imaging results.

### INPUT:
A man in his 30s undergoing peritoneal dialysis for kidney failure who was also being investigated for severe hyperparathyroidism presented with multiple skin lesions 1 day after undergoing cervical computed tomography with iodinated contrast. Physical examination revealed a polymorphous cutaneous eruption characterized by nodular vegetating lesions on the lower lip and right nasal ala (Figure 1A); papulovesicular lesions, either umbilicated or with an erosive center, clustered on the left cheek (Figure 1B); and 2 papulovesicular lesions with an erythematous-to-violaceous halo at the cannula insertion sites on the back of the right hand and the inner side of the wrist. The patient reported that the lesions were painful, with the ones in the oral mucosa impairing feeding.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Iododerma,"1. **Iodinated Contrast Reaction** - Considered due to recent exposure to iodinated contrast, which can trigger cutaneous eruptions.
  
2. **Calciphylaxis** - Known for skin lesions in patients with kidney failure, especially those on dialysis with severe hyperparathyroidism.

3. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection** - Given the presence of umbilicated, painful papulovesicular lesions, especially around the lip and face.

4. **Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) Infection** - Clustered vesicular lesions can suggest VZV reactivation, potentially in a dermatomal distribution.

5. **Infection with Staphylococcus Aureus** - Considered for skin infections given the nodular, erythematous, and possibly pustular nature of the lesions.

6. **Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - Possible due to nodular vegetating lesions, though less likely given the acute presentation post-contrast.

7. **Disseminated Fungal Infection** - Especially in the context of immunocompromised individuals with systemic symptoms and cutaneous manifestations.

8. **Erythema Multiforme** - Known for target lesions following drug exposure or infection.

9. **Sweet's Syndrome (Acute Febrile Neutrophilic Dermatosis)** - Painful lesions with neutrophilic infiltration, often related to malignancy or drugs.

10. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (SJS/TEN)** - Considered due to painful mucosal involvement, though typically more systemic and severe.

### INPUT:
A woman in her mid-50s with a medical history significant for pulmonary embolism 10 years prior (previously receiving anticoagulation therapy) presented to the emergency department with 10 days of progressively worsening, sharp, nonradiating chest pain. The pain was present at rest, 7 of 10 in severity, and worse with inspiration. She experienced concomitant exertional shortness of breath, dry cough, and lightheadedness. Her cardiac history was otherwise unremarkable. Family history was notable for breast cancer in her mother and her sister, but no known inherited hypercoagulable disorders. In the emergency department, her vital signs were as follows: temperature 37.0 °C, blood pressure 130/76 mm Hg, heart rate 97/min, respiratory rate 16/min, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. Physical examination results were unremarkable, with no cardiac murmurs, rubs, pulmonary crackles, jugular venous distention, or lower extremity edema. Laboratory test results were remarkable for an elevated D-dimer level, an elevated C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a mildly elevated pro-BNP level, but normal levels of troponin and procalcitonin. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with evidence of right heart strain, and a computed tomography angiogram of the chest demonstrated an occlusive pulmonary embolism of the left main pulmonary artery and several peripheral consolidations in the left lower lung field consistent with infarction. The patient started anticoagulation therapy with intravenous heparin. A subsequent echocardiogram revealed bowing of the interventricular septum into the left ventricle and a very large (6.6 × 4.1-cm), mobile, nonhomogeneous, pedunculated mass straddling the tricuspid valve and moving between the right atrium and right ventricle (Figure 1 and Video).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Right atrial myxoma with partial myxomatous embolism to the pulmonary artery,"1. **Pulmonary Embolism (PE):** Given the patient's history of pulmonary embolism, presence of chest pain worsened by inspiration, elevated D-dimer, and CTA findings, recurrent PE is the primary consideration.

2. **Atrial Myxoma:** The echocardiogram shows a large, mobile, pedunculated mass straddling the tricuspid valve, consistent with a cardiac tumor such as an atrial myxoma.

3. **Lung Infarction:** The CTA showing peripheral consolidations in the left lower lung field indicates possible lung infarction secondary to the embolism.

4. **Right Heart Strain:** The echocardiogram findings indicate right heart strain, possibly due to acute pulmonary hypertension secondary to the massive pulmonary embolism.

5. **Pulmonary Infarct:** The presence of peripheral consolidations in the CTA of the chest may represent areas of infarction due to PE rather than infection (pneumonia is not suspected as procalcitonin is normal).

6. **Tricuspid Valve Mass:** The mass present in the echocardiogram raises suspicion for an intracardiac mass, which could be a primary cardiac tumor or thrombus.

7. **Pulmonary Hypertension:** Secondary pulmonary hypertension due to underlying PE can present with exertional dyspnea and right heart strain, suggested by the echocardiogram findings.

8. **Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH):** Considered due to history of pulmonary embolism and current findings suggesting right heart strain, although acute presentation leans towards PE.

9. **Paradoxical Embolism:** Considering the presence of a right atrial mass, the risk of paradoxical embolism exists if there is an atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale.

10. **Pericardial Disease:** Although no friction rubs are heard, sharp chest pain exacerbated by inspiration warrants consideration for pericarditis, but findings are not strongly suggestive.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Pulmonary Embolism (PE):** Strong evidence from CTA and D-dimer supports PE as the primary diagnosis. 
2. **Atrial Myxoma:** Echo findings of a large mass suggest atrial myxoma, especially given its size and mobility.
3. **Pulmonary Infarct:** Supported by CTA findings of peripheral consolidations.
4. **Right Heart Strain:** Echo and EKG findings indicative of right ventricular pressure overload.
5. **Lung Infarction:** Secondary consideration related to PE.
6. **Tricuspid Valve Mass:** Could be associated with atrial myxoma or represent a separate entity.
7. **Pulmonary Hypertension:** Supported by echo findings but likely secondary to acute PE.
8. **Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH):** Less likely but considered due to history.
9. **Paradoxical Embolism:** Less evidence supporting it, considered due to presence of a mass.
10. **Pericardial Disease:** Least likely given the current findings.",['Cardiology'],0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,55.0,M

### INPUT:
A 55-year-old woman was referred to the eye clinic for unilateral uveitis and 2 days of sudden vision loss in her right eye. She reported experiencing light sensitivity and mild eye pain. She was in otherwise good health without any chronic medical problems. She reported receiving anticoagulation therapy in the past for a mitral valve problem. Her visual acuity was 20/200 OD and 20/20 OS. The examination of the left eye was unremarkable. Slitlamp examination of her right eye revealed 3+ anterior chamber inflammation with vitreous cells. An examination of the dilated fundus showed optic nerve edema with an overlying white infiltrate. In addition, there was inferior retinal whitening consistent with an artery occlusion (Figure 1A). The whitening was attributable to inner retina ischemia, with sparing in the distribution of the cilioretinal artery. An inferior hemicentral retinal artery occlusion was confirmed on intravenous fluorescein angiography (Figure 1B). No embolus was noted at any retinal artery branch points. Notably, a dog bit the patient’s hand 2 months before presentation. Since that time, the patient developed a persistent cough, night sweats, and low-grade fevers that were treated unsuccessfully with 2 courses of oral antibiotics.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Hemicentral retinal artery occlusion secondary to septic embolus,"1. **Cytomegalovirus Retinitis** - Often associated with immunocompromised states, but can present with retinal findings similar to those described, such as retinal whitening and uveitis.
   
2. **Viral Retinitis (Acute Retinal Necrosis)** - Sudden vision loss and retinal necrosis in immunocompetent individuals can be due to viral causes like HSV or VZV.

3. **Giant Cell Arteritis** - Typically presents with arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, and the age and sudden vision loss are suggestive, though less common in females under 60.

4. **Cat Scratch Disease (Bartonella henselae)** - Following a pet's bite or scratch, it can lead to oculoglandular syndrome, optic neuropathy, or neuroretinitis.

5. **Ocular Syphilis** - Known for causing various posterior and anterior segment inflammation, with optic nerve involvement and vascular occlusion.
  
6. **Tuberculous Uveitis** - Given the respiratory symptoms and systemic manifestations, ocular tuberculosis could be a systemic manifestation.

7. **Rickettsial Infection** - Rickettsiosis can present with systemic symptoms and vasculitis involving retinal arteries.

8. **Behçet’s Disease** - Although more atypical given the patient's demographic, Behçet’s can cause uveitis and occlusive vasculitis.

9. **Lyme Disease** - Can present similarly with systemic and ocular manifestations, especially with a history of tick interaction.

10. **Sarcoidosis** - Known for causing granulomatous uveitis and can involve retinal vasculature and optic nerve, as well as systemic symptoms.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis
1. **Cat Scratch Disease (Bartonella henselae)** - Proximity to dog bite and subsequent symptoms align well with infection timeline and ocular presentation.
2. **Tuberculous Uveitis** - Systemic symptoms of cough, night sweats, and fever suggestive of TB.
3. **Ocular Syphilis** - Need to rule out in unexplained retinal occlusions and uveitis.
4. **Viral Retinitis (Acute Retinal Necrosis)** - Sudden vision loss and retinal necrosis in otherwise healthy individual.
5. **Cytomegalovirus Retinitis** - Considered in previous treatments or instances of immunocompromise.
6. **Lyme Disease** - Matches systemic and ocular symptoms; history could suggest environmental exposure.
7. **Sarcoidosis** - Could explain systemic and ocular involvement without direct infection.
8. **Behçet’s Disease** - Unlikely but possible systemic inflammatory condition with eye involvement.
9. **Rickettsial Infection** - Likelihood lower without obvious exposure history.
10. **Giant Cell Arteritis** - Age and sex make it less likely, but sudden vision loss makes it a concern.","['Cardiology', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Trauma and Injury', 'Retinal Disorders']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,55.0,M

### INPUT:
A 72-year-old man with metastatic, well-differentiated, small intestinal neuroendocrine tumor (NET) presented for routine follow-up in September 2020 with worsening fatigue and flushing. He was initially diagnosed with metastatic involvement of the liver, bone, and intra-abdominal lymph nodes in 2015 and received 3 treatments with peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) in 2017. After 2 years of disease stability he was retreated with PRRT in November 2019 because of radiographic progression of disease and worsening symptoms. A third dose of PRRT was given in March 2020; a fourth was deferred owing to persistent thrombocytopenia after treatment. Gallium 68 dotatate positron emission tomography–computed tomography in July 2020 revealed stable disease (Figure, A).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Neuroendocrine tumor infiltration of bone marrow,"1. Carcinoid Syndrome: Given the patient's history of a neuroendocrine tumor and symptoms of flushing and fatigue, carcinoid syndrome could be a plausible cause.

2. Thrombocytopenia-Induced Fatigue: Considering his persistent thrombocytopenia after PRRT, this could contribute to fatigue.

3. Metastatic Neuroendocrine Tumor Progression: Although imaging suggests stable disease, symptoms could still relate to microscopic disease progression not fully captured on imaging.

4. Treatment-Related Fatigue: PRRT and other treatments can lead to cumulative fatigue.

5. Anemia: Chronic illness and treatment could lead to anemia, causing fatigue.

6. Hypothyroidism: New onset or worsened hypothyroidism could exacerbate symptoms.

7. Adrenal Insufficiency: Fatigue could result from either the direct impact of metastatic disease on endocrine function or as a side effect of treatments.

8. Depression: A consideration due to the chronic nature and stress of living with advanced cancer.

9. Chronic Infection: Underlying chronic infections can contribute to fatigue and were not entirely ruled out.

10. Liver Dysfunction: Metastatic liver disease could lead to liver dysfunction contributing to fatigue and systemic symptoms.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 60s presented to our dermatology outpatient department with a 5-year history of pruritic papules on the right side of her lower back. She was otherwise healthy, with no family history of a similar condition. Physical examination results showed multiple dome-shaped, skin-colored, firm papules on her right lower back, arranged in a blaschkoid distribution (Figure 1A). The lesions varied in size, with some coalescing into irregular-shaped, larger papules. Telangiectasis could be seen on some of the lesions. A skin biopsy was performed on her back and submitted for further histopathologic analysis (Figure 1B and C).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Mucinous nevus,"1. **Nevus Comedonicus** - The blaschkoid distribution and lesion appearance raise the possibility of an epidermal nevus, such as nevus comedonicus.

2. **Lichen Striatus** - Given the linear arrangement of the lesions along Blaschko's lines, lichen striatus could be considered.

3. **Inflammatory Linear Verrucous Epidermal Nevus (ILVEN)** - This condition typically presents with pruritic, verrucous papules in a linear distribution along Blaschko's lines.

4. **Blaschkoid Lichen Planus** - Lichen planus can manifest in a pattern following Blaschko's lines, although it is less common.

5. **Linear Verrucous Hemangioma** - The presence of telangiectasis could suggest a vascular lesion such as linear verrucous hemangioma.

6. **Segmental Neurofibromatosis** - Neurofibromas can present as firm papules in a predetermined distribution pattern, although typically not pruritic.

7. **Lymphangioma Circumscriptum** - These vesicular lesions have a predilection for certain anatomic areas and may present grouped in a linear distribution.

8. **Segmental Darier’s Disease** - Darier’s disease features keratotic papules that could assume a linear arrangement, albeit often over seborrheic regions.

9. **Mosaic Tuberous Sclerosis Complex** - Tuberous sclerosis can mimic a Blaschkoid distribution due to mosaic mutations, but other systemic features would often accompany.

10. **Blaschkoid Porokeratosis** - Characterized by thin-walled, annular lesions with a linear arrangement along Blaschko’s lines.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Inflammatory Linear Verrucous Epidermal Nevus (ILVEN)** - The pruritic, firm papules in a Blaschkoid pattern strongly suggest ILVEN.
2. **Nevus Comedonicus** - Given the epidermal nevus presentation, nevus comedonicus remains a possibility.
3. **Blaschkoid Lichen Planus** - Less typical, but still an appropriate fit given the pattern.
4. **Lichen Striatus** - Usually more common in children but could explain the linear skin changes.
5. **Segmental Darier’s Disease** - Although less common in this presentation, it aligns with a keratinization disorder.
6. **Linear Verrucous Hemangioma** - Presence of telangiectasis merits consideration.
7. **Segmental Neurofibromatosis** - Typically would have additional cutaneous findings such as café-au-lait spots.
8. **Mosaic Tuberous Sclerosis Complex** - Rare without other systemic manifestations.
9. **Lymphangioma Circumscriptum** - The vesicular nature is a stretch given firm papules.
10. **Blaschkoid Porokeratosis** - Typically presents differently and is included as less likely given histopathology results pending.","['Dermatology', 'Nevi']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,60.0,M

### INPUT:
A 50-year-old man presented with left eye redness and headaches for 2 months. Results from a previous computed tomographic scan of the head were unremarkable. He denied ocular disease, trauma, or surgery. He had no medical problems aside from chronic back pain due to a herniated disc. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/25 OS. Intraocular pressure, extraocular motility, and pupillary examination results were normal. The right eye was unremarkable. Examination of the left eye showed 2 temporal scleral nodules with surrounding hyperemia and no scleromalacia. He experienced substantial pain with palpation. Posterior examination results were unremarkable. The results of the following laboratory tests were all unremarkable: tuberculosis interferon-γ release assay, rapid plasma reagin, fluorescent treponemal antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and angiotensin-converting enzyme. The rheumatoid factor level (18 IU/mL [normal range, <14 IU/mL]) and C-reactive protein level (26 mg/L [normal range, 0-5 mg/L]) were elevated. In addition, Lyme IgG, IgM, and reflex Western blot assays were positive for antibodies. The patient denied travel to Lyme-endemic regions, tick bites, or rashes. The patient started oral prednisone therapy for possible rheumatoid arthritis (RA)–associated nodular scleritis, doxycycline therapy for positive Lyme studies, and was referred to a rheumatologist for further RA evaluation. Two weeks after presentation and initiation of oral prednisone therapy, the patient noted improvement in pain, but the scleral nodules and hyperemia persisted. Therefore, subconjunctival triamcinolone acetonide (0.5 mL of 40 mg/mL) was administered to the left eye. Further confirmatory RA workup by rheumatology did not reveal other systemic findings thought to be associated with RA on review of symptoms or clinical examination. The patient's back pain was associated with his herniated disc. Subsequently, the patient’s examination results showed new scleral thinning of the left eye with persistence of the scleral nodules (Figure 1).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Mycobacterium infectious scleritis,"To approach the differential diagnosis of the patient's persistent left eye redness and scleral nodules, let us consider this step-by-step:

1. **Nodular Scleritis** - Inflammatory nodules on the sclera with associated redness and pain, often linked to autoimmune diseases, could initially indicate nodular scleritis possibly related to RA.

2. **Lyme Disease** - Positive Lyme serology, though atypical without endemic exposure, could suggest ocular Lyme disease involvement.

3. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)** - Despite negative ANCA, GPA can rarely be seronegative and cause scleritis.

4. **Sarcoidosis** - Negative angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), but sarcoidosis could be atypically manifesting without pulmonic or systemic involvement.

5. **Relapsing Polychondritis** - A rare condition that can cause scleral inflammation and is associated with cartilage inflammation.

6. **Infectious Scleritis** - Typically related to a history of trauma or surgery, but occasionally idiopathic infections can occur.

7. **Gout** - Ocular manifestations in gout, although rare, could present as redness and nodules.

8. **Sjogren’s Syndrome** - Often associated with dry eyes, but can have isolated scleritis without other systemic symptoms.

9. **Spontaneous Subconjunctival Hemorrhage** - While this is more benign and not typically nodular, it might present with persistent redness.

10. **IgG4-Related Disease** - A chronic condition causing inflammation and could imitate other systemic inflammatory disorders.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
Considering all available information including test results, patient history, and treatment response, here is the prioritized differential:

1. **Nodular Scleritis** - Persistent nodules despite treatment and scleromalacia development.
2. **Lyme Disease** - Serological evidence, though travel history is negative.
3. **Relapsing Polychondritis** - Consider for unexplained systemic cartilage involvement.
4. **IgG4-Related Disease** - Especially given the chronic nature and respiratory symptoms.
5. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)** - Clinically possible despite ANCA negativity.
6. **Sjogren’s Syndrome** - Though mainly dry eye, it might present atypically.
7. **Infectious Scleritis** - Commonly linked to trauma but remains a possibility.
8. **Sarcoidosis** - Uncommon presentation without systemic signs.
9. **Gout** - Unlikely given clinical picture and lack of systemic manifestation.
10. **Spontaneous Subconjunctival Hemorrhage** - Unlikely given presentation and persistence.

Future diagnostic considerations might include biopsy of the scleral nodules if the diagnosis remains unclear, and rheumatologic surveillance for disease evolution.","['Ophthalmology', 'Intraocular Inflammation', 'Infectious Diseases']",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,50.0,F

### INPUT:
A 73-year-old woman was referred to our service for assessment of a slow-growing conjunctival lesion in the left eye. She had first noticed left eye discomfort and a fullness of the left lower eyelid 3 months previously. She denied any vision or systemic symptoms. Her ophthalmic history was noncontributory. The patient’s medical history was notable only for prostate carcinoma, which was treated with radiotherapy 12 years ago. On examination, her visual acuities were 20/25 OU. Slitlamp examination of the anterior segment revealed diffuse yellow-pink polypoidal papules affecting the inferior fornix and inferior palpebral conjunctiva of the left eye (Figure 1A). The upper palpebral conjunctiva in the left eye had a velvety yellow appearance (Figure 1B). The remainder of the examination of both eyes was unremarkable. Initial investigations, including a complete blood cell count, urinalysis, and measurement of inflammatory markers, kidney function, and prostate-specific antigen level, were within normal limits. Serum electrophoresis showed raised monoclonal IgM bands (7.25 g/L; reference range, 0.50-2.00 g/L) with a κ/λ light-chain ratio of 2.92 (reference range, 0.260-1.65).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Conjunctival amyloidosis,"To construct a differential diagnosis for the conjunctival lesion in this 73-year-old woman, we will follow a step-by-step approach considering the patient’s presenting symptoms, medical history, examination findings, and test results.

**1. Conjunctival Amyloidosis:**
   Given the velvety yellow appearance, polypoidal nature of the lesions, and monoclonal IgM findings, conjunctival amyloidosis is a possibility, as it can present with amyloid deposits in ocular tissues and is associated with plasma cell dyscrasias.

**2. Lymphoproliferative Disorder:**
   Given the monoclonal IgM bands, the possibility of an ocular manifestation of a systemic lymphoproliferative disorder such as Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia should be considered.

**3. Ocular Surface Squamous Neoplasia (OSSN):**
   Although less likely with the given systemic findings, OSSN could present with conjunctival lesions, typically requires histopathological evaluation.

**4. Xanthogranulomatous Disease:**
   Considering the yellow-pink appearance of the lesion, xanthogranulomatous processes such as adult-onset xanthogranuloma can present similarly.

**5. Conjunctival Lymphoma:**
   The presence of monoclonal bands suggests the need to consider conjunctival lymphoma, which might present as a conjunctival lesion.

**6. Kaposi Sarcoma:**
   Although typically associated with immunocompromised individuals and does not match the systemic markers, a rare presentation could be considered.

**7. Sarcoidosis:**
   Sarcoidosis can affect the eye and cause conjunctival lesions, albeit typically associated with more systemic symptoms.

**8. Wegener’s Granulomatosis:**
   Also known as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, could involve eye tissues, though systemic markers would typically show inflammatory responses.

**9. Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation:**
   An idiopathic cause of orbital inflammation, generally associated with redness and pain, but is considered due to the polypoidal nature.

**10. Primary Cutaneous Follicle Center Lymphoma:**
   A rare form of lymphoma that may present with skin and conjunctival lesions, possibly aligning with monoclonal gammopathy findings.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Conjunctival Amyloidosis:** Based on the monoclonal IgM elevation and histological features.
2. **Lymphoproliferative Disorder (e.g., Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia):** The presence of elevated IgM is indicative.
3. **Conjunctival Lymphoma:** Aligns with the systemic plasma cell dyscrasias.
4. **Xanthogranulomatous Disease:** Consistent with yellow-pink lesions.
5. **Primary Cutaneous Follicle Center Lymphoma:** Due to possible other skin involvements.
6. **Ocular Surface Squamous Neoplasia (OSSN):** Always considered with conjunctival lesions.
7. **Sarcoidosis:** Low rank due to lack of systemic symptoms.
8. **Kaposi Sarcoma:** Less likely due to patient profile.
9. **Wegener’s Granulomatosis:** Lack of inflammatory markers in labs.
10. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation:** Considered the least likely due to atypical presentation.

The differential diagnosis takes into account the presenting symptoms, lab results, and medical history, focusing on possibilities that correlate with the non-inflammatory nature and monoclonal protein findings.","['External Eye Disease', 'Ophthalmology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,73.0,M

### INPUT:
An 89-year-old asymptomatic man presented to a new eye care professional for a routine examination. Examination findings showed a large choroidal mass in the left eye suspicious for a malignant neoplasm. The patient’s ocular history showed a cataract surgical procedure, YAG capsulotomy, and subsequent repair of retinal detachment with scleral buckle and pneumatic retinopexy in the left eye approximately 30 years earlier. Ophthalmoscopic examination results of the left eye revealed a peripheral retinal atrophy from previous cryotherapy treatment. A large choroidal mass was observed in the inferotemporal region. The patient was referred for further evaluation of the mass, which was suspected to represent choroidal melanoma. Our examination findings showed a visual acuity of 20/20 OD and 20/60 OS, with intraocular pressures of 20 mm Hg OD and 16 mm Hg OS measured using a tonometer (Tono-pen; Reichert Inc). Ophthalmoscopy results of the right eye were normal. In the left eye, a 360° encircling band with overlying retinal atrophy was documented. There was a variably pigmented, abruptly elevated mass deep in the inferotemporal retina, measuring 12.0 mm in diameter (Figure, A) and without overlying drusen, orange pigment, or subretinal fluid. Ultrasonography results showed that the mass was dome shaped and echodense, with posterior shadowing (Figure, B); it measured 4.6 mm thick.

A 39-year-old male patient with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and bone metastases presented in April 2020 with lower back pain, which was aggravated while standing and walking. He reported no known trauma, and no motor or sensory deficits were noted during clinical examination. He had no fever. After the initial sarcoma diagnosis in September 2018, the patient received 8 cycles of doxorubicin hydrochloride and ifosfamide along with regional hyperthermia, followed by good tumor response. The patient had a history of a pathological fracture of L4, which had been treated with radiotherapy and vertebroplasty in November 2019 and remained unchanged on imaging obtained in April 2020. The treatment regimen recently had been switched to gemcitabine hydrochloride and docetaxel in January 2020 following osseous progression during maintenance chemotherapy with trofosfamide, idarubicin hydrochloride, and etoposide. On restaging computed tomography, symmetrical enlargement of both psoas muscles was observed with intramuscular hypodensity (Figure, A). The patient reported lower back pain but no motor or sensory deficits. Further workup with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed extensive, nearly symmetrical swelling in both psoas muscles and sharply delineated, peripheral contrast enhancement of the fascia with strict horizontal bounds (Figure, B and C).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Radiation recall myositis,"1. **Metastatic Disease Progression** - Given the patient's history of bone metastases and progression on imaging, metastatic spread to or within the psoas muscles could be suspected as a differential.

2. **Radiation-induced Changes** - Due to the past radiotherapy treatment and its effects on surrounding tissues, radiation-induced myositis could be considered.

3. **Chemotherapy-induced Myositis** - The patient has undergone multiple chemotherapy regimens, which could lead to drug-induced inflammation of the muscles.

4. **Infectious Myositis** - An infection within the psoas muscles, potentially due to immunosuppression from chemotherapy, should be considered, though fever is absent.

5. **Inflammatory Myopathy** - Autoimmune or inflammatory conditions that affect muscle tissue could explain the swelling and pain.

6. **Bilateral Psoas Hematoma** - Given prior vertebral interventions and recent therapies, hemorrhage into the psoas muscle could occur, especially with peripheral enhancement.

7. **Epidural Abscess** - Although rare without fever or neurological deficits, the possibility of an abscess affecting the psoas region could be assessed.

8. **Sarcoma Recurrence or Transformation** - Recurrence or a new sarcomatous lesion affecting the psoas, given the primary diagnosis, could be a differential.

9. **Lumber Spinal Stenosis or Disc Herniation** - Secondary to vertebral changes or past treatments leading to pain and muscle irritation.

10. **Idiopathic Hypertrophy of Psoas Muscles** - Although rare, unexplained benign hypertrophy could be a distant possibility with symmetrical psoas swelling.

### INPUT:
Case report: A patient in their late 70s with a history of Crohn disease, coronary artery disease, hypercholesterolemia, and transient ischemic attack presented with sudden, painless, left-sided vision loss. He denied headache, scalp tenderness, and jaw claudication. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 103 mm/h and a magnetic resonance angiographic examination of the brain was negative for mass, infarction, and hemorrhage. Examination results of a right, superficial, temporal artery biopsy specimen showed chronic, nongranulomatous inflammation surrounding adventitial vessels and extensive subintimal fibrosis, without giant cells or segmental loss of the internal elastic lamina, which was interpreted as compatible with temporal arteritis. High-dose corticosteroid therapy was initiated (1 g methylprednisolone intravenously for 3 days followed by 60 mg/d of oral prednisone). A neuro-ophthalmologic examination performed 1 week later showed an unreactive left pupil with an obvious relative afferent pupillary defect. Optic nerve pallor concomitant with edema and a single flame-shaped hemorrhage at the 4-o’clock position on the disc margin was also observed. Two weeks later, persistent elevation of the ESR and C-reactive protein levels, despite continued oral prednisone therapy, prompted a review of the temporal artery biopsy findings. This disclosed abundant transmural deposits of amorphous eosinophilic acellular material that was congophilic and exhibited apple-green birefringence under polarized light, consistent with amyloid deposits (Figure). Immunohistochemical staining showed IgM and λ light chain restriction.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Systemic amyloidosis in the setting of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (Waldenström macroglobulinemia),"1. **Temporal Arteritis (Giant Cell Arteritis)**  
   - Initial working diagnosis based on the superficial temporal artery biopsy results and high ESR.

2. **Amyloidosis**
   - Rethinking initial findings after discovering amyloid deposits upon further examination of the biopsy specimen.

3. **Non-Arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION)**
   - Considered due to age, sudden vision loss, and cardiovascular history.

4. **Central Retinal Artery Occlusion**
   - Possible cause of painless, sudden vision loss in an older patient.

5. **Optic Neuritis**
   - Though unusual given the age and painlessness, central nervous system inflammation could possibly align with some of the observed symptoms.

6. **Ischemic Ocular Syndrome**
   - Combines history of coronary artery disease with sudden vision loss and optic nerve findings.

7. **Primary Systemic Vasculitis**
   - Potential cause of optic nerve involvement and ESR elevation beyond temporal arteritis.

8. **Multiple Myeloma**
   - Given the presence of monoclonal light chains in immunohistochemical staining.

9. **Waldenström Macroglobulinemia**
   - Related to the presence of IgM and potential amyloidosis.

10. **Sarcoidosis**
    - A possible cause for systemic inflammation leading to ocular and optic nerve manifestations.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

Based on the additional findings and test results (amyloid deposits, IgM, and λ light chain restriction), the most likely condition is:

1. **Amyloidosis**  
   - The biopsy findings strongly indicate systemic amyloidosis which can affect arteries and optic nerve regions, explaining persistent ESR elevation and monoclonal protein presence.

2. **Temporal Arteritis**  
   - Initial presentation fit, but later analysis weakened the case over amyloidosis dominance.

3. **Multiple Myeloma**  
   - Order of suspicion increased due to amyloid and monoclonal protein correlation.

4. **Waldenström Macroglobulinemia**  
   - Considered relative to the monoclonal IgM findings.

5. **Non-Arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION)**  
   - Still a relevant possibility considering age and sudden onset but more secondary due to biopsy results.

6. **Central Retinal Artery Occlusion**  
   - Remains an ocular emergency suspect but lacks supportive inflammatory/mass effect evidence in this context.

7. **Ischemic Ocular Syndrome**  
   - Relevant to cardiovascular pathologies but does not explain systemic inflammation signature.

8. **Primary Systemic Vasculitis**  
   - Still on the spectrum, but specific biopsy results offer clearer pathways.

9. **Sarcoidosis**  
   - Less likely given more typical presentation patterns and findings.

10. **Optic Neuritis**  
    - Highly unlikely but remains for completeness given broad differential pathways historically.

Conclusively, amyloidosis manifests as the predominant diagnosis due to congruent, specific findings that align all investigative aspects.","['Geriatrics', 'Hematology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Cardiology', 'Ischemic Heart Disease']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,-1.0,U

### INPUT:
A man in his 30s presented with a chronic history of slowly expanding asymptomatic papules on the dorsal hands since childhood, with more recent involvement of both forearms. He denied photosensitivity, arthritis, or muscle weakness. Examination revealed multiple discrete reddish-brown, well-defined, smooth 2- to 6-mm dome-shaped papules (Figure, A). There were no nail changes or mucous membrane involvement.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Progressive mucinous histiocytosis,"Step 1: **Lichen Planus**  
- Lichen planus presents with violaceous, flat-topped papules, but typically affects wrists, lower back, and ankles.

Step 2: **Granuloma Annulare**  
- Granuloma annulare is characterized by dermal papules forming annular plaques, often on dorsal hands or feet.

Step 3: **Sarcoidosis**  
- Cutaneous sarcoidosis may present with papules but often involves other systemic symptoms.

Step 4: **Acrokeratosis Verruciformis**  
- Acrokeratosis verruciformis presents with flat, skin-colored wart-like papules often on the dorsum of hands.

Step 5: **Xeroderma Pigmentosum**  
- Xeroderma pigmentosum involves skin changes due to photosensitivity, typically with a history of sun exposure issues, which the patient denies.

Step 6: **Eruptive Xanthomas**  
- Eruptive xanthomas feature yellowish papules often linked with lipid metabolism disorders, and occur suddenly rather than chronic.

Step 7: **Lichen Nitidus**  
- Lichen nitidus shows tiny, discrete, skin-colored or erythematous papules usually on the trunk and extremities.

Step 8: **Papular Mucinosis**  
- Papular mucinosis involves scleromyxedema or lichen myxedematosus, presenting as waxy papules, typically not isolated to hands.

Step 9: **Porokeratosis**  
- Porokeratosis shows annular plaques with atrophic centers and a raised keratotic ridge, usually with sun exposure history.

Step 10: **Papular Elastorrhexis**  
- Papular elastorrhexis presents with small, firm, skin-colored papules due to elastin fiber abnormalities without systemic symptoms.

### INPUT:
A previously healthy, middle-aged patient presented with rapidly increasing shortness of breath despite empirical antibiotic treatment for presumed pneumonia. A computed tomographic image of the chest was notable for diffuse, ground-glass opacities. An infectious disease workup was unrevealing, and the patient was diagnosed with acute-on-chronic respiratory failure resulting from dermatomyositis-associated interstitial lung disease. Progressive hypoxia refractory to mechanical ventilation necessitated venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) using the ProtekDuo dual-lumen cannula (LivaNova). In its standard configuration, deoxygenated blood is drained from the right atrium while oxygenated blood is ejected into the main pulmonary artery, and the device serves as both a right ventricular support and an ECMO (RVS-ECMO) cannula. End-stage lung disease was established and, as part of a lung transplant evaluation, the patient underwent catheterization of the left side of the heart and coronary angiography. The left coronary artery angiogram revealed mild luminal irregularities. The right coronary artery (RCA) angiogram is shown in Figure 1 and Video 1.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Right coronary artery compression by the right ventricular angulation of the RVS-ECMO cannula,"Based on the provided case details, let's develop a 10-step differential diagnosis to explore potential causes of the patient's condition. Each step will introduce a new single differential diagnosis until all possibilities are exhausted, then we will rerank based on all given patient information.

1. **Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF):** Presenting with progressive respiratory failure and characteristic findings on chest imaging without a definitive infectious cause.

2. **Connective Tissue Disease-Associated Interstitial Lung Disease (CTD-ILD):** In line with the patient's prior dermatomyositis diagnosis and associated systemic manifestations affecting the lungs.

3. **Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis:** Characterized by ground-glass opacities on imaging and commonly misdiagnosed as pneumonia.

4. **Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonia (NSIP):** Common in patients with connective tissue diseases and can present similarly to the given respiratory picture.

5. **Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS):** Could be considered in cases of unknown origin respiratory failure refractory to initial treatment.

6. **Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis:** May develop in response to inhaled organic antigens and present with similar lung imaging findings.

7. **Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia (COP):** Often presents with pneumonia-like symptoms and may show ground-glass opacities on imaging.

8. **Pulmonary Veno-Occlusive Disease (PVOD):** Can lead to pulmonary hypertension, ground-glass opacities, and refractory hypoxia.

9. **Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM):** A rare lung disease that affects mainly the airways, blood vessels, and lymph vessels and can result in similar imaging findings and progressive respiratory failure.

10. **Sarcoidosis:** Often presents with interstitial lung disease features, though typically also associated with other systemic findings.

### Reranked List:
1. **Connective Tissue Disease-Associated Interstitial Lung Disease (CTD-ILD):** Strongest correlation given dermatomyositis history and clinical presentation.
2. **Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonia (NSIP):** Fits the profile for patients with underlying connective tissue disease.
3. **Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF):** Common interstitial lung disease with similar presenting features.
4. **Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis:** Matches the CT findings of ground-glass opacities.
5. **Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis:** Possible in the correct clinical setting.
6. **Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia (COP):** Consistent with ground-glass opacities but less likely without preceding illness.
7. **Pulmonary Veno-Occlusive Disease (PVOD):** Unlikely without clear pulmonary hypertension signs.
8. **Sarcoidosis:** Would expect more systemic symptoms but remains a differential.
9. **Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS):** Too nonspecific but considered due to refractory hypoxia.
10. **Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM):** Rare, especially in a male patient, but cannot be completely excluded.","['Cardiology', 'Critical Care Medicine', 'Respiratory Failure and Ventilation']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1.0,U

### INPUT:
A middle-aged man presented with chest pain, elevated troponin-T of 1037 ng/L (normal <14 ng/L; to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1), and anterior T-wave inversion on electrocardiography. He was a smoker with hypertension and kidney dysfunction, with a history of left-sided paresthesia. Coronary angiography demonstrated unobstructed coronary arteries. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging revealed subendocardial midinferolateral late gadolinium enhancement with corresponding hypokinesis consistent with a partial-thickness myocardial infarction. Prolonged Holter monitoring showed no evidence of atrial fibrillation. Two years later, he had a similar presentation consistent with a non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Repeated coronary angiography again demonstrated unobstructed coronary arteries. The CMR revealed the same midinferolateral late gadolinium enhancement as at the initial examination (Figure, A) but with focal enhancement on T2 short tau inversion recovery sequences (Figure, B), with increased T1 and T2 values suggestive of associated edema from an acute infarction in the same territory. A mobile interatrial septum was noted on 4-chamber cine imaging. A transthoracic echocardiogram bubble study demonstrated color flow at rest across the interatrial septum and a large shunt on Valsalva maneuver consistent with a grade 3 patent foramen ovale (PFO) (Video). Coincidentally, a brain MR scan to investigate the recurrent paresthesia revealed bilateral white matter lesions thought to be secondary to small-vessel disease greater in number than expected for the patient’s age, raising suspicion for microemboli.

### INPUT:
A 75-year-old woman presented with several weeks of intermittent headache that had progressed to severe, persistent headache with right eye pain. She had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. She denied tobacco, alcohol, or drug use. A neurological examination was notable for disorientation to the month, deficits in short-term memory, and an upward drift of the left arm. Cranial nerve, sensory, coordination, and deep tendon reflex examinations were normal. She walked with a slightly wide but steady gait. Her serum red and white blood cell counts, coagulation profile, and electrolyte levels were within normal limits. Blood cultures had negative results. A 24-hour electroencephalogram showed right hemispheric slowing and multiple right centroparietal seizures of 1 minute each, without noticeable clinical correlates. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain was remarkable for a large T2-hyperintense lesion in the right temporoparietal region, with an increased diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) signal (low apparent diffusion coefficient), a low signal on susceptibility-weighted imaging, increased T1 signal intensity in and around the lesion, and a contrast-enhancing rim with leptomeningeal enhancement (Figure 1). A smaller satellite lesion with a similar MRI profile was noted inferiorly in the right anterior temporal lobe. A computed tomography scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis did not show any metastatic disease. A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile showed a normal red blood cell count and protein and glucose levels and a mildly elevated white blood cell count of 11 cells/μL (to convert to cells × 109/L, multiply by 0.001). The fluid was absent oligoclonal bands and had negative bacterial and fungal culture results, a meningitis-encephalitis polymerase chain reaction panel, and a paraneoplastic panel. Cytology and flow cytometry had negative results. The patient then underwent surgical biopsy of the temporoparietal lesion.

A 40-year-old woman with refractory glaucoma was referred for decreased vision in the right eye after an aqueous shunting surgical procedure 3 weeks prior. The surgical procedure was a 2-staged Baerveldt implantation after which she developed fluctuating but progressive visual decline. The patient’s ocular history was significant for Sturge-Weber syndrome with bilateral cutaneous port-wine stains, secondary glaucoma in the right eye, and an irregular globe with a white cataract and chronic retinal detachment (RD) in the left eye. At presentation, visual acuity was hand motion OD and a long-standing history of no light perception OS. Intraocular pressures by Goldmann applanation tonometry were 16 mm Hg OD and 28 mm Hg OS. Anterior segment examination of the right eye revealed a properly positioned plate and tube, and dilated fundus examination revealed a red glow of the fundus with shifting subretinal fluid and RD extending from the 2- to 11-o’clock position (Figure 1A).

### INPUT:
A 49-year-old African American woman who was hospitalized with hypervolemia due to supraventricular tachycardia presented with acute unilateral painless vision loss. Her active medical problems included atrial flutter on anticoagulation, antisynthetase syndrome (which was diagnosed based on the presence of autoantibodies against aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase), fever with negative infectious workup results, and interstitial lung disease that was managed with azathioprine. Two weeks before the onset of sudden vision loss, the patient developed a rapidly evolving purpuric rash on her hands and feet that progressed to digital ischemia (Figure 1A). She was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone, which was completed 3 days before the onset of loss of vision and transitioned to treatment with azathioprine, 150 mg, and prednisone, 80 mg, that she was taking at the time of her vision loss.

Now, let's rerank the differential diagnosis using all patient information and test results:

1. Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO) - Considering sudden, painless vision loss with prior evidence of digital ischemia and vasculopathic risk factors, CRAO is highly probable.
2. Systemic Vasculitis - The presence of a purpuric rash and digital ischemia in a patient with antisynthetase syndrome suggests an underlying vasculitic process that could also involve the ocular vessels.
3. Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (AION) - Given the acute, painless vision loss and patient's vascular history, AION is a possibility.
4. Retinal Vein Occlusion - Though the presentation could match, the unilateral painless vision loss is more abrupt than typically seen in vein occlusions.
5. Giant Cell Arteritis - While less typical in this demographic, the acute vision change aligns with the disease process, warranting consideration.
6. Ocular Ischemic Syndrome - Chronic vascular insufficiency secondary to her cardiac condition could contribute to ocular ischemia.
7. Optic Neuritis - While not typically associated with painless vision loss, a possibility given her autoimmune history.
8. Retinal Detachment - Unlikely due to lack of symptomatic description of floaters or visual field defects.
9. Posterior Uveitis - Less likely without preceding inflammatory symptoms or eye pain.
10. Acute Macular Neuropathy - Rare, and the clinical presentation aligns less with the patient's overall systemic and ocular findings.","['Dermatology', 'Rheumatology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Retinal Disorders']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,49.0,M

### INPUT:
An 82-year-old woman with an ocular history significant for bilateral nuclear sclerotic cataracts presented to the Cornea Service at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, Miami, Florida, with a history of blurred vision in the right eye after phacoemulsification cataract extraction 8 weeks earlier. Current ophthalmic medications included topical prednisolone acetate, 1%, in the right eye 6 times per day. The patient reported no improvement with the treatment. On examination, her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/80 OD and 20/20 OS. Pupils were reactive without relative afferent pupillary defect, and intraocular pressures were 18 mm Hg in the right eye and 11 mm Hg in the left eye. A slitlamp biomicroscopic examination of the right eye revealed grade 2 to 3 diffuse central corneal edema and folds (Figure 1). The anterior chamber was deep and the posterior chamber intraocular lens was in good position within the capsular bag. Although the view to the posterior pole of the right eye was hazy owing to corneal edema, dilated fundus examination findings were unremarkable. Examination of the left eye revealed a few guttate. The central corneal thickness by ultrasound pachymetry was 957 μm in the right eye and 547 μm in the left eye.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Corneal edema after cataract surgery secondary to intraoperative Descemet membrane detachment (Figure 2),"1. **Corneal Decompensation**: The presence of diffuse central corneal edema and folds, as well as the increased central corneal thickness, suggests corneal decompensation.

2. **Persistent Corneal Edema Post-Surgery**: This can occur after cataract surgery, especially with pre-existing conditions affecting corneal health, such as Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy or damage to the corneal endothelium during surgery.

3. **Acute Corneal Hydrops**: Typically occurs in keratoconus or ectatic corneal disorders, and while unlikely, it's important to consider acute changes post-surgery.

4. **Toxic Anterior Segment Syndrome (TASS)**: An unusual reaction that occurs in the first 24 hours after anterior segment surgery, but chronic cases have been reported with symptoms like corneal edema.

5. **Endophthalmitis**: Though typically presenting with significant pain and redness, chronic low-grade endophthalmitis could present with blurred vision and edema.

6. **Posterior Capsule Opacification (PCO)**: Common after cataract extraction, leading to visual degradation but not typically associated with corneal edema.

7. **Cystoid Macular Edema (CME)**: Can result after cataract surgery and cause blurred vision, although it primarily affects the retina.

8. **Intraocular Lens (IOL) Dislocation**: Despite the good position of the lens noted, any subtle misalignment potentially worsening corneal edema could contribute to the problem.

9. **Corneal Endothelial Cell Loss**: A risk in cataract surgery, leading to persistent corneal edema due to insufficient endothelial cell pump function.

10. **Iatrogenic Damage/Medication Effect**: Consider the effects of prolonged use of postoperative medications or intraoperative incidents that damage ocular tissues, leading to corneal edema.

### INPUT:
A 17-month-old girl was referred to pediatric dermatology for evaluation of a slow-growing, nontender plaque on the lower back. The child's mother reported that, on discovery, the plaque was initially 1 × 1 cm and had since grown in size with the child. She was uncertain if the plaque was present at birth. The patient’s medical history was significant for dermal melanocytosis of the right hip and mid back, increased head circumference (97th percentile), and expressive language delay. There was no family history of congenital birthmarks or neurofibromatosis type 1 or 2. Physical examination revealed a well-appearing girl with normal vital signs and Fitzpatrick type III skin type. On the left lower back, there was a 15 × 5-cm indurated skin-colored to yellow, firm, multinodular plaque with hypertrichosis, extending from the midline to the left lower flank (Figure, A). There were additional blue-gray patches on the back and right hip, as well as a small café au lait macule on the right lower back. Limited neurologic examination was within normal limits. A 4-mm punch biopsy was performed for further diagnostic evaluation (Figure, B-D).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Neurocristic hamartoma,"1. **Congenital Nevus**: Based on the initial description of a nontender plaque that has grown in proportion with the child, a congenital nevus is a plausible initial diagnosis.

2. **Epidermal Nevus**: The firm, multinodular texture and hypertrichosis associated with the plaque suggests the possibility of an epidermal nevus.

3. **Nevus Sebaceous**: Given the indurated, skin-colored to yellow appearance, nevus sebaceous could be considered.

4. **Lipoma**: A slow-growing, nontender plaque that is firm in texture also aligns with characteristics of a lipoma.

5. **Connective Tissue Nevus**: The firmness and texture of the plaque could suggest a type of connective tissue nevus.

6. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans**: Although rare in this age group, the description of the plaque warrants consideration of this diagnosis due to its firm and nodular appearance.

7. **Hypomelanosis of Ito**: The presence of a plaque alongside the mosaic pigmentation pattern could suggest this diagnosis.

8. **Neurofibromatosis (NF1 with atypical presentation)**: The café au lait macule, while limited, raises slight consideration for atypical NF1.

9. **Pachydermoperiostosis**: Although primarily related to childhood presentation of clubbing and skin thickening, the appearance of the plaque brings this into differential consideration.

10. **Juvenile Xanthogranuloma**: Noted for their yellow-tan hue and firm nodules, though less likely given the extent of the plaque.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Nevus Sebaceous**: Given the skin-colored to yellow appearance, the large size, and firm texture, which are consistent findings.

2. **Epidermal Nevus**: The texture and hypertrichosis point towards this as a strong possibility.

3. **Connective Tissue Nevus**: Plaque consistency aligns with this diagnosis, especially considering the size.

4. **Congenital Nevus**: Initial suspicion was high, but detailed characteristics slightly lower its priority compared to epidermal nevus.

5. **Lipoma**: Generally softer than indicated, making it less likely.

6. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans**: Uncommon, but given the nodular presentation, it's more plausible than others below it.

7. **Juvenile Xanthogranuloma**: Fits some characterizations but less likely given the extent.

8. **Hypomelanosis of Ito**: More neurological findings would typically be present.

9. **Neurofibromatosis (NF1 with atypical presentation)**: Less likely given limited supporting features for NF1.

10. **Pachydermoperiostosis**: Least likely due to lack of other supportive clinical features for this complex disorder.","['Pediatrics', 'Dermatology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,M

### INPUT:
A 9-year-old girl was referred to the pediatric otolaryngology clinic with a 3-month history of a left-sided neck mass. The mass had been slowly enlarging and she had been experiencing mild intermittent pain, but no additional symptoms were reported. Her medical history was significant for several episodes of upper respiratory infection during the previous winter season, and she previously had an adenotonsillectomy several years prior and bilateral ear tubes placed 1 year before presentation. Physical examination showed a mildly tender, nonmobile, left parotid mass near the angle of the mandible with no overlying skin changes or drainage around the mass. There was no lymphadenopathy or other lesions noted in the neck area, and cranial nerve VII was fully intact. Ultrasonography results of the neck showed a left 1.5-cm preauricular nodular mass with internal and marginal vascularity. A neck magnetic resonance imaging study without contrast performed at an outside institution revealed the 1.5-cm heterogeneous intraparotid nodule that was predominantly isotense to glandular tissue on T1 images with vague hypointensity of a small irregular central region, as well as vague hyperintensity on T2 images. She subsequently underwent fine needle aspiration biopsy to assess the lesion, which demonstrated benign-appearing salivary gland tissue and clusters of myoepithelial cells. The mass was continuing to enlarge, and the patient’s pain was increasing in that area, so the decision was made to perform left superficial parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve. Intraoperatively, the left parotid mass was noted to be just below the lower branches of the facial nerve. The excised parotid mass was sent to the pathology department for analysis. Gross examination of the specimen demonstrated a 1.6 × 1.5 × 1.1–cm tan-white, well-circumscribed lesion that was partially surrounded by salivary gland parenchyma (Figure, A). Histologic examination of the nodule was performed (Figure, B and C).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Sclerosing polycystic adenoma,"1. **Pleomorphic Adenoma**: Common benign tumor of the salivary glands, often presents as a painless mass, although pain can occur with enlargement.

2. **Warthin's Tumor**: A benign parotid gland tumor that typically occurs in older patients but can rarely be seen in children, often with similar imaging characteristics.

3. **Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma**: The most common malignant salivary gland tumor in children, often warrants consideration despite benign biopsy findings.

4. **Acinic Cell Carcinoma**: Another malignant salivary gland tumor, although usually more common in adults, it should be considered given the pain and growth of the mass.

5. **Chronic Sialadenitis**: Inflammation of the salivary gland, could cause enlargement and pain, though the histology suggests otherwise.

6. **Lymphoepithelial Cyst**: These lesions can occur in the parotid and may present as a mass.

7. **Benign Lymphoepithelial Lesion (Mikulicz's disease)**: Often related to Sjogren’s syndrome but can occasionally present as isolated parotid masses.

8. **Oncocytoma**: Rare benign tumor in the parotid gland that typically presents as a painless mass, but may cause discomfort.

9. **Basal Cell Adenoma**: A type of benign salivary gland tumor that can present as a solid mass within the parotid gland.

10. **Hemangioma**: Vascular tumors can occur in salivary glands, although more common in infants; any intraparotid vascular lesion can mimic these findings.

### Final Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma**: Due to the mass's continued growth and pain increase, despite benign-appearing biopsy.
   
2. **Pleomorphic Adenoma**: Typical benign salivary gland tumor; often resected for definitive diagnosis.
   
3. **Acinic Cell Carcinoma**: Similar growth and presentation can mimic benign lesions on initial evaluation.
   
4. **Basal Cell Adenoma**: Given the benign-appearing nature of the mass.
   
5. **Oncocytoma**: Possible given the benign appearance but rare in children.
   
6. **Chronic Sialadenitis**: Less likely due to benign biopsy without significant inflammation.
   
7. **Warthin's Tumor**: Unusual for this age group but considered due to similar imaging findings.
   
8. **Lymphoepithelial Cyst**: Less likely given the presentation and histological findings.
   
9. **Benign Lymphoepithelial Lesion**: Unlikely given the absence of systemic symptoms.
   
10. **Hemangioma**: Less likely given the patient's age and presentation.","['Pediatrics', 'Otolaryngology', 'Salivary Gland Disorders', 'Dental Medicine']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,M

### INPUT:
A 71-year-old man with non-Hodgkin lymphoma receiving maintenance obinutuzumab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) infusions underwent uneventful pars plana vitrectomy of the right eye for vitreomacular traction. Diluted triamcinolone acetonide (TA) was used to stain the posterior hyaloid. After removal of 25-gauge trocar cannulas, subconjunctival TA and ceftazidime was injected. Owing to cystoid changes in the central macula, a short-acting gas tamponade with sulfur hexafluoride was used to tamponade any cystoid abnormalities that may have been unroofed. Despite unremarkable postoperative day 1 (POD1) examination findings, the patient presented on postoperative week 3 with a painless central scotoma and worsening floaters. His visual acuity was 20/400 OD and intraocular pressure was normal. There was no external hyperemia or chemosis, and the anterior chamber was deep and quiet with no cells or flare. On dilated fundus examination, there were 15 to 20 cells per high-power field (using a 1 × 1-mm2 high-intensity incidental slit beam) and a white macular lesion with disc edema and scattered intraretinal and peripapillary hemorrhages and mixed venous and arterial sheathing. Optical coherence tomography of the macula showed atrophy, full-thickness hyperreflectivity, and a residual epiretinal membrane (Figure).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cytomegalovirus retinitis and papillitis,"1. **Infectious endophthalmitis** - Given the history of recent eye surgery and the use of triamcinolone acetonide, infection should be considered despite no obvious signs of inflammation in the anterior chamber.

2. **Non-infectious uveitis** - Possible due to the presence of cells in the vitreous and a white macular lesion, especially in the context of the patient's immunocompromised status.

3. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis** - Common in immunocompromised patients, characterized by retinal necrosis, retinal hemorrhages, and uveitis.

4. **Progressive outer retinal necrosis (PORN)** - Occurs primarily in immunocompromised individuals and is characterized by minimal vitritis and rapid progressive necrosis.

5. **Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO)** - Presents with disc edema, retinal hemorrhages, and venous sheathing.

6. **Radiation retinopathy** - Possible if there is a history of prior radiation treatment, marked by vascular changes such as sheathing and hemorrhages.

7. **Acute retinal necrosis (ARN)** - Features similar retinal signs, though it typically presents with more inflammation anteriorly and in the vitreous.

8. **Syphilitic retinitis** - A consideration due to mixed arterial and venous sheathing along with retinal hemorrhages.

9. **Idiopathic retinal vasculitis** - Known to cause segmental sheathing and retinal hemorrhages without anterior segment inflammation.

10. **Lymphoma-associated retinopathy** - Possible given the patient's history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

### Reranked Diagnosis:
1. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis** - Most consistent with the patient's immunocompromised status and retinal findings.
2. **Infectious endophthalmitis** - Though presenting with unusual minimal inflammation, remains high due to recent surgery.
3. **Non-infectious uveitis** - Needs consideration given the immunological background and the use of medications that could modulate immune responses.
4. **Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO)** - Compatible with disc edema and hemorrhages.
5. **Progressive outer retinal necrosis (PORN)** - Severe retinal necrosis could account for acute symptoms in the immunocompromised.
6. **Acute retinal necrosis (ARN)** - Could present in similar ways despite less likely due to posterior presentation.
7. **Syphilitic retinitis** - Less common but anatomically fitting description-wise.
8. **Lymphoma-associated retinopathy** - Not typical but cannot dismiss entirely given history.
9. **Radiation retinopathy** - Unlikely absent previous radiation exposure; vascular signs aligning.
10. **Idiopathic retinal vasculitis** - Least likely due to lack of systemic associations usually required for diagnosis.","['Infectious Diseases', 'Ophthalmology', 'Retinal Disorders', 'Macular Diseases']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,71.0,F

### INPUT:
A boy younger than 2 years presented with a 1-year history of slightly pruritic lesions involving his face. He was born after an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery, and his growth and development were appropriate for his age. No associated symptoms such as fever, anorexia, or weight loss were noted. Physical examination revealed multiple skin-colored and erythematous follicular papules, 1 to 2 mm in diameter, distributed in a segmental pattern on the right side of the forehead, as well as the dorsum and tip of the nose. A small, excoriated plaque was also noted on the right malar area (Figure 1A). No mucosal lesions were present, and the rest of the physical examination findings were unremarkable. A complete hematological and biochemical survey, including blood cell count, liver and renal function tests, C-reactive protein levels, thyroid function, rheumatoid factor, and antinuclear antibodies, disclosed no abnormalities. Two skin punch biopsies were taken from the forehead and nose. Representative histopathological features are shown in Figure 1B and C.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Idiopathic follicular mucinosis,"1. **Lichen Striatus** - A linear dermatosis that often appears in children, typically presents as erythematous or flesh-colored papules distributed along the lines of Blaschko.

2. **Linear Darier Disease** - An inherited condition presenting as hyperkeratotic papules in a linear distribution, usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.

3. **Segmental Neurofibromatosis** - Consists of café-au-lait macules and/or neurofibromas in a segmental distribution and often appears in infancy or childhood.

4. **Epidermal Nevus** - Presents as warty or smooth papules and plaques arranged in a linear or swirled distribution, visible shortly after birth or during childhood.

5. **Inflammatory Linear Verrucous Epidermal Nevus (ILVEN)** - Appears as erythematous and verrucous papules arranged linearly, accompanied by pruritus.

6. **Molluscum Contagiosum** - A viral infection in children, characterized by small, flesh-colored papules, occasionally with pruritus.

7. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis** - A rare disorder, possibly presenting with papular or eczematous lesions, but typically more disseminated.

8. **Nevus Sebaceous** - Present at birth or shortly after as a hairless, yellow-orange plaque, which can develop into more complex lesions.

9. **Porokeratosis of Mibelli** - Presents as annular plaques that can replace skin-colored lesions, but more prevalent in children and young adults.

10. **Granuloma Annulare** - A benign dermatosis characterized by annular plaques that may have varied presentations in children.

### Reranking Based on Further Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Lichen Striatus** - The linear distribution and typical presentation age make this the most likely diagnosis.
2. **Inflammatory Linear Verrucous Epidermal Nevus (ILVEN)** - Pruritus and the appearance in a segmental pattern enhance its possibility.
3. **Linear Darier Disease** - While less common, its linear pattern and potential age of presentation support consideration.
4. **Segmental Neurofibromatosis** - Less likely due to lack of neurofibromatous nodules or café-au-lait macules.
5. **Epidermal Nevus** - Common in appearance but lack of birth presentation lowers priority.
6. **Molluscum Contagiosum** - Typical infectious cause of papules but less segmental.
7. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis** - Uncommon with the absence of systemic symptoms.
8. **Nevus Sebaceous** - Unlikely due to age and lack of specific lesion morphology.
9. **Granuloma Annulare** - Less typical presentation for infants.
10. **Porokeratosis of Mibelli** - Uncommon in this age group, with lesions not typically matching.

Based on a combination of patient history, examination, and test results, Lichen Striatus is determined to be the most likely diagnosis, with histopathology needed for confirmation.","['Dermatology', 'Pediatrics']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1.0,F

### INPUT:
A 47-year-old man with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes for more than 15 years was referred for proliferative diabetic retinopathy management. His chief complaint was acute onset of blurry vision in the right eye. He described intermittent foggy vision and the appearance of “a hair moving across the vision of his right eye” for the past few weeks. His most recent hemoglobin A1c level was 8.3%, and 2 months prior to his visit, he had restarted diabetes medications. His medications included metformin and glimepiride. His corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. His pupil, color vision, and anterior segment examinations had normal results bilaterally. A posterior segment examination of the right eye showed mild temporal elevation of the optic disc with blurred margins, mild peripapillary hemorrhages, a small amount of preretinal hemorrhage, and small-caliber branching vessels at the temporal disc with no fibrosis (Figure 1A). The left eye showed a normal optic disc, a cup-disc ratio of 0.1, and some microaneurysms at the macula. There were a few scattered dot-blot hemorrhages bilaterally. Fluorescein angiography of the right eye showed mild leakage from the abnormal vessels at the temporal optic disc (Figure 1B).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Diabetic papillopathy,"1. **Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy** - Given the patient's long-standing diabetes and the current presentation with retinal changes typical of diabetic retinopathy.
2. **Ocular Ischemic Syndrome** - Consider due to possible concurrent vascular issues, given the patient's history of hypertension and diabetes.
3. **Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion** - Possibly related to the intermittent changes in vision and presence of hemorrhages.
4. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion** - Differential due to characteristic fundoscopic findings, although the vision remains too good for complete occlusion.
5. **Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy** - Accounts for optic disc elevation and blurred vision, typically seen with vascular risk factors.
6. **Vitreous Hemorrhage** - Intermittent foggy vision and ""hair across vision"" can occur due to minor hemorrhages.
7. **Retinal Artery Macroaneurysm** - Potential due to microaneurysms and hemorrhagic presentations.
8. **Papilledema** - Unlikely with the normal vision but optic disc findings could warrant consideration.
9. **Hypertensive Retinopathy** - Given the chronic hypertension and cloudy vision episodes, although bilateral presentation would be more typical.
10. **Macular Edema** - Might explain fluctuating vision, often accompanies diabetic retinopathy but disc changes are more suggestive of other differentials.

**Reranked Differential Diagnosis after all Patient Information and Test Results:**

1. **Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy** - Findings and history strongly suggest this as the primary concern.
2. **Vitreous Hemorrhage** - Likely secondary event due to NBA in proliferative stages.
3. **Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion** - Consistent with observed hemorrhages and could coexist.
4. **Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy** - Consideration remains due to optic disc presentation in context of risk factors.
5. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion** - Less likely given visual acuity but remains a differential for the optic findings.
6. **Hypertensive Retinopathy** - Unlikely the primary diagnosis but chronic impact needs consideration.
7. **Retinal Artery Macroaneurysm** - Still possible due to isolated hemorrhagic findings.
8. **Ocular Ischemic Syndrome** - Less likely given unilateral presentation but cannot be entirely ruled out.
9. **Macular Edema** - Mostly ruled out due to clarity in vision and lack of direct evidence.
10. **Papilledema** - Still unlikely due to absence of expected symptoms or visual acuity impact.","['Diabetes', 'Retinal Disorders', 'Diabetes and Endocrinology', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Ophthalmology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,47.0,F

A 29-year-old woman presented with a 2-month history of rapidly growing, widespread, asymptomatic skin nodules all over her body. She denied having fever, chills, fatigue, night sweats, or weight loss. She had no history of malignant neoplasm or chemical exposure. Physical examination findings demonstrated numerous erythematous, indurated nodules involving the surface of her head, neck, torso, and extremities, without ulceration or scarring (Figure, A and B). Findings of systemic reviews were unremarkable, and there was no lymphadenopathy or peripheral nerve enlargement. Complete blood cell count with differential results were normal (white blood cell count, 6060/μL, normal range, 4500-10 000/μL; absolute neutrophils, 3070/μL, normal range, 1800-8300/μL [to convert cell counts to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001]).

8. **Cutaneous Lymphoma**
9. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans**
10. **Angiolymphoid Hyperplasia with Eosinophilia**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Cutaneous Lymphoma:** The presence of rapidly growing skin nodules without systemic symptoms or lymphadenopathy, along with elevated serum LDH, strongly suggests a hematological malignancy. The absence of ulceration or scarring with indurated erythematous nodules is also characteristic.
2. **Metastatic Carcinoma:** Even without a prior history of malignant neoplasms, the possibility remains due to rapidly progressive nodules and elevated LDH.
3. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis:** The systemic nature of skin involvement aligns with features of LCH, and while rare, it should be considered.
4. **Cutaneous Sarcoidosis:** Although typically associated with systemic symptoms, sarcoidosis can present with similar skin nodules but usually involves lymphadenopathy.
5. **Granulomatous Mycosis Fungoides:** The presentation aligns with potential early signs of this condition, including nodular developments without typical peripheral nerve enlargement.
6. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans:** This diagnosis is less likely given the rapid progression and number of lesions but shares some overlapping characteristics.
7. **Erythema Nodosum:** Though more often a presentation of subcutaneous rather than nodular lesions, it remains in differential due to nodular appearance.
8. **Angiolymphoid Hyperplasia with Eosinophilia:** Presents with nodules, although usually accompanied by eosinophilia which appears absent here.
9. **Leprosy:** Ruled out by lack of peripheral nerve involvement and absence of exposure history, but chronic skin nodules fit its profile.
10. **Panniculitis:** Typically presents as deeper subcutaneous inflammation rather than nodular, making it less likely.","['Dermatology', 'Oncology', 'Sarcomas']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,29.0,M

After a short walk, symptoms disappeared and another ECG was recorded (Figure 1B). Physical examination and transthoracic echocardiography results were normal.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Spontaneous abnormal automaticity from a left lateral accessory pathway,"1. **Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)** - Initial consideration due to palpitations with episodes of sudden onset and offset common in SVT.

2. **Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)** - Considered due to the wide QRS complex rhythm observed on the ECG, which can be indicative of VT.

3. **Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome** - Due to the wide QRS and episodic nature of palpitations, WPW is a potential differential with pre-excitation possible.

4. **Bundle Branch Block** - A wide QRS complex could result from a bundle branch block affecting normal conduction.

5. **Long QT Syndrome** - Though not defined by wide QRS, could present with episodic palpitations and needs to be assessed in context.

6. **Brugada Syndrome** - This condition may present with wide QRS in certain leads and is associated with arrhythmias.

7. **Pre-excitation Syndrome** - Other than WPW, other pre-excitation syndromes could cause similar ECG features.

8. **Atrial Tachycardia** - As it can present with palpitations and irregular rhythms, though typically narrow QRS.

9. **Myocarditis** - Can cause changes in ECG and palpitations but might be less likely due to lack of supporting symptomatic history.

10. **Mitral Valve Prolapse** - Historical association with palpitations though ECG changes don’t typically match.

### Reranking:
1. **Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome** - Strongest consideration due to classic presentation of wide QRS, palpitations, and sudden symptom pattern.
2. **Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)** - Palpitations and episodic nature align but less likely with wide QRS.
3. **Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)** - Reconsidered due to wide QRS, but less likely at normal heart rate during palpitations.
4. **Bundle Branch Block** - Possible explanation for the wide QRS but less likely the primary cause of symptoms.
5. **Pre-excitation Syndrome** - Remains in consideration beyond WPW due to similar presentations.
6. **Brugada Syndrome** - Less likely given lack of evidence for typical ECG pattern outside of broadfeatures.
7. **Atrial Tachycardia** - Still on the list for palpitations but lacks the sudden onset and offset.
8. **Long QT Syndrome** - Unlikely with the current evidence of normal QT interval and wide QRS.

### INPUT:
A 63-year-old man presented to the clinic with intermittent pain inside his mouth and a progressive decline in oral aperture that had developed over the prior year. He described a burning sensation inside his mouth that worsened with using mouthwash and eating spicy foods. He had no history of cigarette smoking or use of chewing tobacco but had chewed areca nuts for many years while living in India. Currently, he reported chewing areca nuts daily to weekly. Physical examination revealed white-tan plaques on the oral mucosa and thickened buccal mucosae bilaterally (Figure). His lips and perioral skin appeared healthy, and the interincisal distance, defined as the distance between the tips of the frontal incisors when the mouth is opened as wide as possible, was approximately 25 mm (reference, >35 mm). Examination of a biopsy sample of the lower left labial mucosa revealed subepithelial fibrosis with stromal hyalinization, without epithelial dysplasia or inflammatory changes.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Oral submucous fibrosis,"1. **Oral Submucous Fibrosis (OSMF)** - Considering the patient's history of areca nut chewing, the presence of subepithelial fibrosis without epithelial dysplasia, difficulty opening the mouth (reduced interincisal distance), and burning sensation in the oral cavity, OSMF is a strong candidate.

2. **Lichen Planus** - Presents with white plaques and can cause burning sensations, but unlikely given the biopsy findings that lack inflammatory changes typical of lichen planus.

3. **Leukoplakia** - Could explain the white plaques, but the lack of epithelial dysplasia and specific biopsy findings make this less likely.

4. **Scleroderma (localized to oral cavity)** - Potential cause of mouth opening restriction, but the absence of systemic findings or sclerotic skin changes makes it less likely.

5. **Pemphigoid** - Could cause oral mucosa changes, but typically involves blistering and erosions which are not noted here.

6. **Oral squamous cell carcinoma** - Unlikely due to absence of dysplasia and inflammatory changes in the biopsy; nonetheless, potential given persistent oral changes.

7. **Candidiasis** - Presents with white plaques and burning sensation, but would expect a response to antifungal treatment and evidence of fungal organisms, which is not mentioned.

8. **Sjogren's Syndrome** - Though it can cause oral symptoms due to dryness, the specific findings in biopsy and reduced interincisal opening aren't typical.

9. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis** - Could cause oral lesions, but would expect more systemic symptoms and specific granular inflammation on biopsy.

10. **Chronic Hyperplastic Candidiasis** - Similar to candidiasis but presents with persistent white plaques; less likely given biopsy findings lacking fungal evidence.

### INPUT:
An 11-year-old boy presented to the dermatology clinic in autumn with an asymptomatic rash on his arms, face, and legs of a 3-week duration. He was otherwise healthy with a history of having seasonal allergies and taking cetirizine. He had negative results from the review of systems and denied any recent illnesses, vaccinations, or new medications. Physical examination was notable for erythematous annular thin plaques without surface change on his right cheek (Figure 1A), an erythematous, edematous plaque on his nose (Figure 1A), and erythematous, edematous, annular papules and plaques on his arms, hands, and thighs (Figure 1B). A biopsy specimen was obtained from the right arm for histopathologic analysis.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cutaneous lupus erythematosus,"1. **Granuloma Annulare** - This presents as annular, flesh-colored or erythematous plaques without surface change and is common in children.

2. **Pityriasis Rosea** - Often characterized by an initial herald patch followed by a generalized rash featuring smaller oval scaly lesions.

3. **Erythema Multiforme** - Can present as target lesions and occur on extremities, often linked with infections or medications but can occur idiopathically.

4. **Tinea Corporis** - Fungal infection presenting as annular plaques with central clearing, usually with some scale at the edges.

5. **Nummular Eczema** - Characterized by coin-shaped, pruritic plaques often with some level of scale or crusting.

6. **Lupus Erythematosus** - In particular, discoid lupus can present with annular plaques especially on sun-exposed areas, although it usually has a more scaly and atrophic change.

7. **Lichen Planus** - Although more often presents as purple, pruritic papules, it may occasionally present with annular plaques.

8. **Urticaria** - Typically presents with transient wheals or plaques that come and go, often highly pruritic.

9. **Erythema Annulare Centrifugum** - Another form of annular erythema which may be asymptomatic and chronic.

10. **Drug Eruption** - Various medications can induce rashes, although less likely here given the history provided.

### Re-ranked Differential Diagnosis with Biopsy Result:

1. **Granuloma Annulare** - The presentation and biopsy findings would typically confirm this diagnosis.
   
2. **Erythema Multiforme** - Although less likely given the lack of typical systemic symptoms or known triggers.

3. **Pityriasis Rosea** - Unlikely if biopsy doesn't correlate with expected pathological features.

4. **Lupus Erythematosus** - Should be reconsidered if specific immunofluorescence findings suggestive of lupus are present in the biopsy.

5. **Erythema Annulare Centrifugum** - If biopsy results suggest a reactive pattern.

6. **Nummular Eczema** - More consideration if biopsy indicates a spongiotic dermatitis without granulomatous features.

7. **Lichen Planus** - Could be re-considered if biopsy shows any lichenification not initially apparent.

8. **Tinea Corporis** - Would expect fungal elements on biopsy or KOH prep, otherwise unlikely.

9. **Urticaria** - Rapid resolution of lesions would support urticaria, but persistent and biopsied lesions make it unlikely.

10. **Drug Eruption** - Strongly considered if any histological patterns suggesting hypersensitivity are found.","['Dermatology', 'Rheumatology', 'Connective Tissue Disease of the Skin', 'Pediatrics']",0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,11.0,F

### INPUT:
A Black man in his early 70s with a history of coronary artery disease after coronary artery bypass operations, hypertension, and colon polyps presented to oculoplastic surgery with 1 week of progressive right-sided proptosis and headache, described as severe pain radiating to the back of his head. This was associated with right eyelid ptosis and blurry vision. Prior to presentation, an outside ophthalmologist treated him with 1 week of oral prednisone, 20 mg/d, for presumed orbital inflammation with no improvement. He denied additional symptoms. Notably, he described headache and sudden vision loss in the right eye after coronary artery bypass grafting 1 year ago for several days before spontaneous improvement with incomplete resolution. Personal and family histories were negative for malignant neoplasm and autoimmune disease. Examination revealed right-sided uncorrected Snellen visual acuity of 20/60 associated with restricted supraduction, abduction, and infraduction. Pupils were equal in size without a relative afferent pupillary defect, and intraocular pressures were 10 mm Hg OD and 11 mm Hg OS. Visual fields had temporal restriction to confrontation of the right eye. Vision, motility, and visual fields were normal on the left. Pertinent findings included right-sided proptosis of 2 mm, cranial nerve V1 and V2 hypoesthesia, eyelid ptosis with a margin to reflex distance 1 of 0 mm, optic disc pallor, and vessel attenuation. Outside magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated an infiltrative mass involving right greater than left orbital apices, the right optic nerve, and right extraocular muscles. There was enhancement of the cavernous sinuses, right pterygopalatine fossa, right sphenoid wing, and right middle cranial fossa dura (Figure 1).

9. Orbital Pseudotumor/Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation
10. Giant Cell Arteritis
  
### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. Orbital Tumor - Given the infiltrative nature of the mass and its involvement with the orbital structures and cranial fossa, this remains the highest differential.
2. Metastatic Carcinoma - The patient's age and previous surgery could suggest metastatic spread, likely from a previously undiagnosed primary.
3. Lymphoproliferative Disorder - Involvement of the orbital regions and systemic considerations could suggest this possibility.
4. Meningioma - Enhancement near the optic nerve and cavernous sinus locations make meningioma plausible.
5. Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome - Can cause painful ophthalmoplegia but less likely with extensive MRI findings.
6. Orbital Pseudotumor/Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation - Given previous treatment with steroids and no improvement, lower likelihood.
7. Carotid-Cavernous Fistula - Symptoms can sometimes overlap but less likely given the MRI findings.
8. Cavernous Sinus Syndrome (caused by various possible conditions) - Descriptive of symptoms rather than specific etiology.
9. Giant Cell Arteritis - Vision loss and headache are symptoms, however, less likely without systemic involvement/indicators or high inflammatory marker levels.
10. Choroidal Melanoma - Less likely given the mass description and location in MRI.","['External Eye Disease', 'Ophthalmology', 'Orbit']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,70.0,F

### INPUT:
A 60-year-old woman presented with a 1-week history of progressive painless diplopia. She had a history of hypothyroidism and dyslipidemia, for which she took levothyroxine and rosuvastatin. She reported no changes in visual acuity or color vision; no ocular pain, erythema, or abnormal discharge; and no headaches, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, ptosis, dysphagia, dysarthria, weakness, numbness, or ataxia. She did not have any constitutional or systemic symptoms. Physical examination showed an isolated limitation of right eye abduction. The remainder of the examination, including visual acuity, pupillary reaction, visual fields, and fundoscopy, was unremarkable. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the head showed abnormal thickening and T2 hyperintensity of the right lateral rectus muscle with T1-weighted gadolinium enhancement (Figure 1). Tests for infection and autoimmune disease had negative results. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis did not demonstrate any evidence of malignancy.
### OUTPUT:
    ",IgG4-related disease,"Let's go through a 10-step differential diagnosis for this patient, assessing the likelihood of each based on the information provided, and then rerank them.

1. **Thyroid Eye Disease (TED)**: Given her history of hypothyroidism, although there are no symptoms of proptosis or typical signs of thyroid eye disease, it remains a possibility due to its association with muscle thickening.

2. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation (Orbital Pseudotumor)**: The MRI findings suggest muscle involvement, which can occur in this condition, characterized by idiopathic inflammatory processes affecting the orbit.

3. **Myasthenia Gravis**: This could present with diplopia and ocular abnormalities, but typically there would be variability and potentially other muscular symptoms.

4. **Graves' Ophthalmopathy**: Similar to TED, often related, but more specifically with ocular involvement, though less likely without thyroid eye disease signs.

5. **Dural Carotid-Cavernous Fistula**: This could cause isolated cranial nerve palsy and muscle changes, though typically more vascular symptoms would be expected.

6. **Microvascular Cranial Nerve Palsy (Ischemic Mononeuropathy)**: Frequently seen in older adults, often related to small vessel disease, but does not explain muscle changes on MRI.

7. **Sarcoidosis**: Although not typical, could cause granulomatous inflammation with diffuse orbital involvement.

8. **Orbital Tumor (Lymphoproliferative Disorder or Metastasis)**: Rare but could present with muscle involvement and enhancement on imaging.

9. **Mitochondrial Myopathy**: While very uncommon, can present with ocular symptoms such as ophthalmoplegia, though systemic symptoms are typically also present.

10. **Multiple Sclerosis**: Can cause cranial nerve involvement and muscle changes, but usually associated with additional neurological symptoms and lesions elsewhere on MRI.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation (Orbital Pseudotumor)**: The specific MRI findings suggest this as the most likely diagnosis.
   
2. **Thyroid Eye Disease (TED)**: Given her history and the MRI findings, this remains a strong possibility despite the absence of some typical symptoms.
   
3. **Orbital Tumor (Lymphoproliferative Disorder or Metastasis)**: Requires consideration due to enhancement and thickening on MRI.
   
4. **Graves' Ophthalmopathy**: Falls slightly lower due to the atypical presentation.
   
5. **Dural Carotid-Cavernous Fistula**: Less likely but considered due to isolated abduction deficit.
   
6. **Microvascular Cranial Nerve Palsy (Ischemic Mononeuropathy)**: Typical in demographic but lacks corroborating imaging findings.
   
7. **Sarcoidosis**: Needs correlation with systemic findings, not indicated here.
   
8. **Myasthenia Gravis**: Does not explain MRI muscle thickening, though possible ocular symptoms.
   
9. **Mitochondrial Myopathy**: Unlikely given the isolated nature of symptoms and typical systemic involvement.
   
10. **Multiple Sclerosis**: Falls to the bottom due to lack of other neurological signs and absence of demyelination on imaging.","['External Eye Disease', 'Neuro-ophthalmology', 'Neurology', 'Ophthalmology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,60.0,M

A 60-year-old woman incarcerated in Ohio presented to the emergency department after a syncopal episode. She reported recent exposure to COVID-19 but had no fevers, chest pain, cough, dyspnea, or diarrhea. She had unintentionally lost 13.6 kg over 2 years. Her temperature was 37 °C (98.5 °F); blood pressure, 124/75 mm Hg; pulse, 123/min; respiratory rate, 22/min; and oxygen saturation, 96% on room air. Findings on physical examination were unremarkable. Her white blood cell count was 3300/μL (reference, 4500-11 000/μL) with an absolute lymphocyte count of 200/μL (reference, 1000-4800/μL). Chest radiograph showed bilateral reticulonodular opacities. She was hospitalized and treated with azithromycin, remdesivir, and dexamethasone despite 3 negative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results. Two days after hospital discharge, she presented to the emergency department with recurrent syncope. Her temperature was 38.1 °C (100.6 °F); blood pressure, 122/82 mm Hg; pulse, 135/min; and oxygen saturation, 86% on room air. A computed tomography scan revealed diffuse bilateral pulmonary micronodular opacities, a 2.2-cm nodule in the lingula, and mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy (Figure 1).

### INPUT:
A 58-year-old man presented with a several-week history of a painless right-sided swelling on his anterior neck. He denied trauma, recent illnesses, respiratory symptoms, dysphagia, oral lesions, hemoptysis, fever, fatigue, weight loss, and night sweats. He had an unremarkable medical history without history of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, cancer, chemotherapy, radiation, or tuberculosis. He denied alcohol, tobacco, or current medication use. His family history included a sibling with sarcoma in their 50s. On examination, a 4.0-cm mobile, nontender right lower anterior neck mass was palpated in a suprasternal location. No lymphadenopathy was noted. Laboratory results showed normal serum calcium levels and leukocyte counts. Initial ultrasonography showed a 4.2-cm solid nodule adjacent to the lower pole of the right thyroid. Computed tomography results of the neck showed a 3.4-cm circumscribed, heterogenous, hypodense, enhancing mass that was abutting the inferior right thyroid and at the right lateral margin of the trachea. The mass was just medial to the right common carotid, causing left lateral displacement of the trachea (Figure 1).

10. Neurofibroma  

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. Thyroid adenoma  
   - Given the location of the mass adjacent to the thyroid and the imaging characteristics, a thyroid adenoma is a leading consideration.
2. Parathyroid adenoma  
   - Normal serum calcium levels make a functional parathyroid adenoma less likely, but a non-functional adenoma could present similarly.
3. Solitary fibrous tumor  
   - This could explain the heterogenous, enhancing nature of the mass.
4. Branchial cleft cyst  
   - Although this is more common in younger patients, the location and solitary nature could fit.
5. Carotid body tumor  
   - The mass's proximity to the carotid artery might raise suspicion, though typically more vascular.
6. Thymic cyst  
   - Considered due to location, although typically more central/anterior mediastinum.
7. Lipoma  
   - Possible given the described characteristics but less likely given hypodense enhancing nature on CT.
8. Hemangioma  
   - Vascular tumors could enhance but are often diagnosed earlier in life.
9. Neurofibroma  
   - Possible due to peripheral nerve distribution expansion, though more typically presents with cutaneous findings.
10. Thyroglossal duct cyst  
    - Less likely given the location and typical presentation with movement on swallowing.","['Radiology', 'Oncology', 'Endocrine Cancer', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Lymphomas']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,58.0,F

### INPUT:
An 82-year-old with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and history of past cigarette smoking presented to pulmonary clinic for evaluation of dyspnea that had worsened over the previous 5 years. Two years prior, she was diagnosed with a right lower lobe segmental pulmonary embolism on a computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram after evaluation of shortness of breath. Warfarin was initiated but discontinued after 2 months due to recurrent epistaxis. On presentation to the pulmonary clinic, the patient reported dyspnea with minimal activity, fatigue, lightheadedness, and leg swelling. Her temperature was 96.8 °F (36 °C); blood pressure, 120/71 mm Hg; heart rate, 73/min; and oxygen saturation, 98% on room air. She appeared frail and had multiple telangiectasias on her lips, tongue, and hands. She had jugular venous distension, a cardiac systolic murmur, right ventricular heave, and bilateral lower extremity edema to the knees. Laboratory testing revealed brain-type natriuretic peptide level of 1333 pg/mL (reference, <100 pg/mL) and hemoglobin level of 12.9 g/dL (reference, 13.9-16.3 g/dL). During a 6-minute walk test on room air, her oxygen saturation decreased to 87%. With oxygen delivered by nasal cannula at 4 L/min, her oxygen saturation was 98%, and she walked 90 m (15% of predicted). An echocardiogram showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, moderate-severe right ventricular dilatation, and right ventricular systolic pressure of 60 to 70 mm Hg (reference, 35-40 mm Hg). Findings on an echocardiogram performed 10 years prior were normal.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH),"To approach this case and develop a differential diagnosis, let's consider the presenting symptoms and history:

1. Pulmonary Hypertension (due to chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension) - Given her history of pulmonary embolism and right ventricular dysfunction on echocardiogram, pulmonary hypertension secondary to unresolved or recurrent thromboembolism is a strong possibility.

2. Congestive Heart Failure - The patient's dyspnea, jugular venous distention, right ventricular heave, and elevated brain-type natriuretic peptide could indicate heart failure, even though the left ventricular ejection fraction is normal.

3. Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) Complications - With her known HHT, complications such as AV malformations in the lung (through shunting) could lead to significant hypoxemia and resultant pulmonary hypertension.

4. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) - Her past history of cigarette smoking increases her risk for COPD, which could contribute to her symptoms of dyspnea and oxygen desaturation.

5. Right Heart Failure Cor Pulmonale - The presentation and echocardiogram findings suggest right heart strain, which could be exacerbated by pulmonary causes like HHT, pulmonary hypertension, or COPD.

6. Pulmonary Vascular Disease - Other vascular diseases or unexplained pulmonary vasculopathies could involve the pulmonary circuit, leading to right heart strain and hypoxemia.

7. Interstitial Lung Disease - Although not initially suspected, certain interstitial processes might present with progressive dyspnea, hypoxemia, and could be related to previous smoking.

8. Atrial Septal Defect (undiagnosed) - Although less likely at this age without previous symptoms, a late presentation of a congenital heart defect like ASD could cause right heart strain and reduced exercise tolerance.

9. Anemia - Although her hemoglobin is lower than the reference range for her age, slight anemia could contribute to fatigue and dyspnea.

10. Obstructive Sleep Apnea - Often underdiagnosed, especially in older patients, it could contribute to pulmonary hypertension and right heart strain.

She had accompanying night sweats, fatigue, and decreased appetite. Initial physical examination revealed multiple distinct matted, firm left-sided cervical lymph nodes. Laboratory evaluation was notable for leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 3700/µL (to convert to 109/L, multiply by 0.001), a microcytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10), mean corpuscular volume of 58 µm3 (to convert to fL, multiply by 1), an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level of 548 U/L (to convert to µkat/L, multiply by 0.0167), and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 35 mm/h. Purified protein derivative and infectious mononucleosis testing were negative. A contrast-enhanced neck computed tomography (CT) scan revealed multiple lymph nodes with areas of central hypodensity, and a conglomerate of heterogeneous lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular region (level 5B), measuring approximately 3.7 × 1.4 × 3.6 cm (Figure). The otolaryngology service was consulted, and a left level Va and Vb selective neck dissection was performed.

There were palmoplantar keratosis and pits. The patient underwent thyroid ultrasonography, abdominal ultrasonography, colonoscopy, and central nervous system magnetic resonance imaging. These explorations revealed 1 Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) level 5 lesion, a kidney mass, and more than 100 colonic polyps.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cowden syndrome,"1. **Cowden Syndrome (PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome)** - Given the presence of multiple types of lesions, including thyroid nodule (TI-RADS 5), kidney mass, and colonic polyps, a consideration is genetic syndromes like Cowden syndrome which is known for multiple hamartomas and increased risk of malignancies.

2. **Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP)** - Characterized by more than 100 colonic polyps and associated extracolonic manifestations, although the classic dermatologic features and thyroid issues don't align perfectly.

3. **Gardner's Syndrome** - A variant of FAP that includes extracolonic such as epidermoid cysts, fibromas, and desmoid tumors which could partially explain skin abnormalities, but doesn't fully explain thyroid and kidney findings.

4. **Cronkhite-Canada Syndrome** - Associated with gastrointestinal polyps and dermatologic changes such as skin pigmentation changes, but this is rare and does not typically involve the thyroid or renal masses.

5. **Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome (HBOC, BRCA mutations)** - The previous breast carcinoma, but the cutaneous findings do not fit typical presentations of HBOC.

6. **Birt-Hogg-Dubé Syndrome** - Causes specific skin manifestations, thyroid nodules, and renal tumors, but usually characterized by facial fibrofolliculomas.

7. **Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome** - Involves GI polyps and mucocutaneous pigmentation, does involve hamartomatous polyps but not typically associated with thyroid or renal tumors.

8. **Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2B (MEN 2B)** - Has mucosal neuromas, marfanoid body habitus, and a risk for medullary thyroid carcinoma, but doesn't explain colonic polyps.

9. **Carney Complex** - It often presents with skin changes, endocrine tumors, but the polyps and renal lesion are unlikely.

10. **Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome (Gorlin Syndrome)** - Can involve basal cell carcinomas (should be ruled out on skin lesions), keratocystic odontogenic tumors, but thyroid and kidney symptoms are uncommon.

### Reranked Diagnosis:
1. **Cowden Syndrome (PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome)** - Dermatologic features and associated thyroid and renal findings with GI polyps make this the most plausible diagnosis.
2. **Birt-Hogg-Dubé Syndrome** - Although not perfect, skin and kidney findings are suggestive.
3. **Gardner's Syndrome** - Presence of polyps fits, but other findings are less consistent.
4. **Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP)** - Polyps fit, but no direct explanation for other symptoms.
5. **Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2B (MEN 2B)** - Considered due to thyroid findings.
6. **Cronkhite-Canada Syndrome** - Low likelihood based on rarity and incomplete symptom match.
7. **Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome** - Consideration for polyps, but other aspects don't align.
8. **Carney Complex** - Overlapping features but not a complete fit.
9. **Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome (Gorlin Syndrome)** - Less likely due to incomplete symptom overlap.
10. **Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome (HBOC, BRCA mutations)** - Earlier consideration but doesn't match most recent findings.","['Dermatology', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gastrointestinal Cancer', 'Genetics and Genomics', 'Cancer Genetics']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,60.0,F

### INPUT:
A woman in her 30s with AIDS presented with acute-onset painful scattered umbilicated papulopustules and ovoid ulcerated plaques with elevated, pink borders on the face, trunk, and extremities (Figure, A). The patient also had a new-onset cough but was afebrile and denied other systemic symptoms. Due to her significant immunocompromise, the clinical presentation was highly suspicious for infection. For rapid bedside differentiation of multiple infectious etiologies, a Tzanck smear was performed by scraping the base of an ulcerated lesion and inner aspect of a pseudopustule and scraping its base with a #15 blade. These contents were placed on a glass slide, fixed, and stained with Wright-Giemsa and subsequently Papanicolaou staining to further characterize the changes seen.

### INPUT:
A 28-year-old man presented with a 5-day history of painful cervical lymphadenopathy along with fever, nausea, and vomiting. Treatment with antibiotics and corticosteroids was started, without improvement of symptoms. He denied recent travel, sick contacts, or autoimmune disease. His medical history was significant for α-thalassemia but otherwise noncontributory. On examination, he had tender lymphadenopathy involving right level V. A computed tomography scan of the neck revealed a collection of enlarged, matted nodes without evidence of an abscess. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy showed nondiagnostic reactive lymph nodes. He was subsequently admitted to the hospital, where the lymphadenopathy progressed to the left side of the neck and a skin eruption developed over his face, back, and trunk. Results of an infectious disease and rheumatological workup, including bone marrow biopsy, were negative. Given his persistent symptoms, the ear, nose, and throat service consulted for excisional biopsy. On pathologic examination, the lymph nodes showed extensive coagulative necrosis, apoptosis, and karyorrhectic debris (Figure 1). Cellular components included histiocytes and dendritic cells, with absent neutrophils and hematoxylin bodies.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. Kikuchi-Fujimoto Disease (Histiocytic Necrotizing Lymphadenitis) - Most likely due to pathologic findings of coagulative necrosis and lack of neutrophils.
2. Adult-onset Still's Disease - Considering persistent lymphadenopathy, systemic symptoms, and skin eruption.
3. Cat Scratch Disease - Consistent with lymphadenopathy and potential systemic illness, though less likely with negative infectious workup.
4. Tuberculosis Lymphadenitis - Considered due to granulomatous inflammation but less likely due to negative infectious disease workup.
5. Lymphoma - Less likely without atypical lymphocytes noted in biopsy.
6. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) - Suggested by the rash and lymphadenopathy but negative rheumatological workup.
7. Reactive Lymphoid Hyperplasia - Could explain lymphadenopathy but lacks specificity of biopsy findings.
8. Sarcoidosis - Lymphadenopathy possible but other organ involvement is usually noted.
9. Castleman Disease - Considered due to lymphadenopathy but less consistent with histological findings.
10. Infectious Mononucleosis - Unlikely with lack of positive infectious markers and the specific histological findings.","['Pain Medicine', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Antibiotic Use, Overuse, Resistance, Stewardship']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,28.0,F

### INPUT:
A man in his 90s presented to the emergency department with symptoms of fever, hemoptysis, and syncopal episodes. He had a history of breast cancer and pulmonary nodules with biopsy findings negative for metastatic disease but positive for granulomatous inflammation. Initial vital signs included blood pressure of 103/66 mm Hg, heart rate of 190 bpm, and temperature of 38.7 °C. Electrocardiogram showed monomorphic ventricular tachycardia with a morphology suggesting right ventricular (RV) origin (Figure 1). In addition to receiving intravenous amiodarone hydrochloride, he had correction of mild hypokalemia (3.1 mEq/L [reference range, 3.5-5.2 mEq/L]; to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 1.0). Successful arrhythmia termination occurred shortly thereafter, and his vital signs remained stable. Chest computed tomographic angiography excluded pulmonary embolism but showed pulmonary nodules and mediastinal lymphadenopathy that had progressed compared with his previous computed tomography. An echocardiogram showed severe RV and left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction with multiple areas of hypokinesis.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cardiac sarcoidosis,"**Step 1:** Sarcoidosis  
Sarcoidosis could account for granulomatous inflammation and can involve the lungs, leading to pulmonary nodules and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Cardiac involvement could also cause arrhythmias and myocardial dysfunction.

**Step 2:** Infective Endocarditis  
Infective endocarditis could lead to fever, heart failure symptoms, and embolic phenomena. In this case, it could explain the ventricular arrhythmias and systemic signs of infection.

**Step 3:** Tuberculosis  
Granulomatous inflammation raises the suspicion of tuberculosis, especially with a history of pulmonary nodules and systemic symptoms like fever.

**Step 4:** Lymphoma  
Lymphoma could cause mediastinal lymphadenopathy and constitutional symptoms. It could potentially involve the cardiac structures and lead to arrhythmias and heart failure.

**Step 5:** Amyloidosis  
Amyloidosis can cause multisystemic involvement with granulomatous-like deposition in organs, potentially affecting the heart with cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias.

**Step 6:** Histoplasmosis  
Endemic fungal infections such as histoplasmosis could cause pulmonary nodules, granulomatous inflammation, and generalized symptoms including fever.

**Step 7:** Giant Cell Myocarditis  
Giant cell myocarditis is rare but could cause arrhythmias and rapid progression to heart failure; it shows granulomatous inflammation upon biopsy.

**Step 8:** Churg-Strauss Syndrome (Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)  
This condition is characterized by systemic vasculitis, lung involvement, and cardiac manifestations.

**Step 9:** Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)  
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis can cause granulomatous inflammation in the lungs along with heart involvement.

**Step 10:** Cardiac Sarcoma  
Though rare, cardiac sarcomas could cause cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias, with possible hematogenous spread presenting as lung nodules.

### INPUT:
A 27-year-old man presented to his primary care physician with primary complaints of headaches and visual-spatial difficulties when driving at night. In addition, the patient described a progressively enlarging lesion on his left scalp, which he had initially noted in high school. He denied any overlying loss of hair, sharp pain, or bleeding from the scalp lesion, and he only reported pain with prolonged pressure. On his scalp examination, a 7-cm ill-defined spongy and pulsatile mass was noted with an overlying gray patch of hair. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain/orbit was initially performed (Figure, A and B), which demonstrated an ill-defined, diffuse, intensely enhancing scalp lesion in the left frontoparietal region with very prominent vascularity and underlying calvarial thickening. No osseous destruction or intracranial extension was present. Subsequent catheter angiography (Figure, C) confirmed the hypervascular mass, supplied via hypertrophied superficial temporal and occipital arteries with marked internal vascularity without direct involvement of the calvarium or intracranial structures. The patient underwent biopsy under general anesthesia; the specimen showed an ill-defined deep dermal/subcutaneous proliferation of spindle cells without significant nuclear pleomorphism or mitotic activity. The lesions stained positive for S100 and SOX10 immunostains.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Diffuse-type neurofibroma,"1. **Neurofibroma**: Based on the presentation of a progressively enlarging scalp lesion with spongy, pulsatile characteristics and positive S100 and SOX10 staining, neurofibroma is considered. Neurofibromas are known for their neural origin and staining pattern.

2. **Schwannoma**: Given the S100 and SOX10 positivity, schwannoma, a tumor arising from Schwann cells, is a differential; however, the ill-defined nature and lack of well-circumscribed boundaries favor neurofibroma more.

3. **Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM)**: The lesion's intense vascularity and pulsatile nature suggest a possible vascular contribution, typical of AVM, but the lack of intracranial involvement reduces the likelihood.

4. **Meningioma**: The presence of a vascular and enhancing lesion raises the possibility of a meningioma, despite the typical occurrence being along dural surfaces and the absence here of calvarial involvement.

5. **Melanoma**: Although the lesion is pigmented and vascular, the lack of significant pleomorphism, mitotic activity, and the S100/SOX10 phenotype, typically Malignant Melanoma markers, makes this less likely.

6. **Plexiform Neuroma**: A form of neurofibroma with a plexiform pattern could account for the lesion's characteristics but would typically be associated with systemic findings of neurofibromatosis.

7. **Fibrous Dysplasia**: Though rare, fibrous dysplasia might present with the described thickening and vascularity but would not account for S100 and SOX10 positivity.

8. **Leiomyoma**: This smooth muscle tumor could have overlapping features but generally lacks the neural staining pattern.

9. **Eikenella corrodens Malformation**: Uncommon vascular formations associated with congenital presentations but do not fit the immunohistochemical profile.

10. **Sarcoma**: A soft tissue sarcoma might present with a scalp mass, but the histological findings (lack of atypia and mitosis) argue against a diagnosis of malignancy.

### INPUT:
A man in his 30s presented for evaluation of asymptomatic erythematous scaly plaques over the face and proximal extremities. The lesions started as an erythematous papule on the face, which had progressed to larger plaques within 10 years. There was involvement of the upper respiratory tract, causing palatal perforation and stridor, necessitating a tracheostomy a year ago. In addition, there was history of wheezing and breathlessness. There was no history of preceding trauma, fever, malaise, joint pain, cough, epistaxis, hemoptysis, or hematuria. Examination revealed multiple well-defined brown erythematous scaly plaques with central scarring measuring 2 × 1 to 8 × 7 cm on the face, arm, and thighs. The patient also had saddle nose deformity, perforation of the hard palate, and necrotic plaques on the ear, causing destruction of ear cartilage (Figure, A and B). There was cervical lymphadenopathy: multiple, nontender, discrete nodes, ranging from 1.5 to 2 cm without any surface changes. The results of sensory examination and peripheral nerve examination were within normal limits. Respiratory examination and chest radiography results were normal. Hemogram showed anemia (hemoglobin, 10.1 g/dL [to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0]); the results of a kidney function test, a liver function test, a fasting blood glucose test, and routine urinalysis were within normal limits. Serologic analysis results for HIV-1/2, antinuclear antibody, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. Punch skin biopsy was obtained for histopathologic analysis and culture (Figure, C).

**Reranked Differential Diagnosis:**

1. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) - Based on the saddle nose deformity, upper respiratory tract involvement, and necrotic ear plaques, this condition is a leading possibility.
2. Relapsing polychondritis - Given the cartilaginous involvement causing nasal and ear deformities, this is a strong consideration.
3. Lupus vulgaris - A form of cutaneous tuberculosis could match the chronic and progressive nature of the lesions.
4. Discoid lupus erythematosus - The presence of scaly plaques with central scarring makes this a possibility.
5. Lepromatous leprosy - While less common, this condition could cause extensive skin and cartilage involvement over time.
6. Cutaneous lymphoma - Differential due to the chronicity and nature of skin lesions.
7. Sarcoidosis - Although systemic involvement was negative, the skin manifestations could resemble sarcoidosis.
8. Syphilis (tertiary) - Unlikely given negative serology, but tertiary syphilis can cause destructive lesions.
9. Actinic prurigo - Matches some elements of the skin presentation but lacks systemic correlation.
10. Pemphigus vulgaris - Typically involves mucosal lesions and is less scarring compared to findings, but considered due to skin manifestation.","['Dermatology', 'Facial Plastic Surgery', 'Fungal Infections', 'Global Health', 'Infectious Diseases']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,30.0,F

### INPUT:
Final diagnosis: Rhabdomyoma.  
Case report: An otherwise healthy 13-month-old female was scheduled to undergo excisional biopsy of a left anterior tongue submucosal intramuscular mass (Figure 1). This firm-to-palpation mass was noted at birth and remained proportional in size with the child’s somatic growth, measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter on presentation. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) documented the mass to be uniformly solid and well circumscribed without cystic components or flow voids, hypointense on T2, and hyperintense with homogeneous contrast enhancement on T1. Her head, neck, and general examination findings were otherwise normal with no cervical lymphadenopathy or additional masses.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Rhabdomyoma,"1. **Rhabdomyoma**: This is a benign tumor of striated muscle, presenting as a well-circumscribed, firm mass present since birth, located in the tongue, which aligns with the patient’s age and clinical history.

2. **Congenital Epulis**: A benign granular cell tumor often located on the alveolar ridge in newborns; however, its occurrence on the tongue is less common.

3. **Fibroma**: A benign fibrous neoplasm presenting as a firm and well-circumscribed mass; though more common in adulthood, it can occur in children.

4. **Hemangioma**: Typically a vascular tumor appearing shortly after birth, but rare cases can appear at birth and remain static, although the lack of flow voids on MRI argues against this diagnosis.

5. **Lymphangioma**: A benign malformation of lymphatic vessels presenting as a soft, compressible mass, not as firm as described, typically with flow voids.

6. **Neurofibroma**: A benign nerve sheath tumor that can appear submucosally in the tongue but would more likely have variable MRI signal characteristics.

7. **Lipoma**: A benign tumor of adipose tissue; uncommon in infants and unlikely given the imaging characteristics described.

8. **Teratoma**: A type of germ cell tumor that can present at birth, often complex on imaging with mixed tissue types, inconsistent with the imaging in this case.

9. **Schwannoma**: A benign nerve sheath tumor often associated with nerve symptoms, which are absent here. 

10. **Leiomyoma**: A rare smooth muscle tumor in this age group, but inconsistent with striated muscle origin.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis
1. **Rhabdomyoma**: Based on clinical presentation, imaging characteristics, and remaining proportionate to growth, remains the strongest diagnosis.
2. **Congenital Epulis**: Fits the age of presentation but rare on the tongue.
3. **Fibroma**: Possible due to well-circumscribed and firm nature.
4. **Neurofibroma**: Unlikely without nerve association but still considered.
5. **Hemangioma**: Unlikely due to lack of change and imaging results.
6. **Lymphangioma**: Less likely due to firmness and imaging results.
7. **Schwannoma**: Considered but no neurological signs present.
8. **Lipoma**: Unlikely due to imaging characteristics and age.
9. **Leiomyoma**: Rare for age and presentation.

### INPUT:
A 13-year-old boy with a 7-day history of painless vision loss and central scotoma in his left eye was referred to the department of ophthalmology. Three weeks prior, he had presented with mild fever and flulike symptoms, associated with a severe frontal headache that was mildly relieved by analgesics. His medical history was positive for relapsing urinary tract infections since early infancy without adequate follow-up. Findings of an ophthalmological examination 1 year prior were reported as normal. At initial examination, he was conscious but somewhat lethargic. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/80 OS. Pupillary light responses, extrinsic ocular motility, anterior segment biomicroscopy, and intraocular pressure were normal in both eyes. Dilated fundus examination revealed a bilateral sectorial macular star that was more extended in the left eye, with retinal veins slightly dilated and tortuous, attenuated arterioles, some juxta and peripapillary nerve fiber layer infarcts, and optic disc edema with marked papillary telangiectasia; in addition, some faint, small, tan-yellow dots were observed at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium in the posterior pole, some of them already grayish and with a hypopigmented halo (Figure 1). Optical coherence tomography displayed elevated optic discs and hyperreflective material in the outer plexiform layer temporal to the optic disc in both eyes and a macular neurosensory detachment in the left eye. Results of visual field testing were normal in the right eye and showed a central scotoma in the left eye.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Hypertensive retinopathy,"Based on the provided clinical history, symptoms, and examination findings, here's a step-by-step differential diagnosis:

1. **Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON):** A hereditary condition known for causing painless vision loss, often with a central scotoma.

2. **Neuroretinitis:** Characterized by the classic ""macular star"" and associated with infections such as Bartonella (Cat Scratch Disease).

3. **Optic Neuritis:** Can cause unilateral vision loss, but typically associated with pain on eye movement, which is absent here.

4. **Compression Optic Neuropathy:** Due to mass lesions pressing on the optic nerve, causing vision loss and swelling.

5. **Multiple Sclerosis:** Can present with optic neuritis and neurological symptoms, although this boy's other symptoms don't align well.

6. **Sarcoidosis:** This systemic condition can affect the eyes, causing uveitis and optic nerve issues.

7. **Syphilitic Optic Neuropathy:** Neurosyphilis can cause similar optic changes and scotomas, albeit less common in this demographic.

8. **Toxoplasmosis:** Ocular involvement can cause retinochoroiditis, seen as lesions on the retina.

9. **Papilledema due to Increased Intracranial Pressure:** Recent headaches and optic disc edema raise this as a possibility.

10. **Retinal Detachment:** Although this usually involves peripheral vision loss initially, the presence of neurosensory detachment suggests exploration.

### Reranked Final Differential Diagnoses:

1. **Neuroretinitis:** Most consistent with painless vision loss, central scotoma, and macular star formation.
   
2. **Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy:** Accounts for central vision loss without pain and familial predisposition.

3. **Optic Neuritis:** Especially if there are intermittent symptoms that resolve (although pain is usually associated).

4. **Toxoplasmosis:** Due to the retinal involvement and atypical course.

5. **Sarcoidosis:** Given the systemic implications that might align with previous unexplained infections.

6. **Compression Optic Neuropathy:** Consider if imaging reveals a mass lesion causing pressure effects.

7. **Syphilitic Optic Neuropathy:** Less likely but possible if there are historical exposures.

8. **Multiple Sclerosis:** Consider if there are other unexplained neurological symptoms or relapses.

9. **Papilledema due to Increased Intracranial Pressure:** Consistent with headaches and optic disc changes but less likely without other signs.

10. **Retinal Detachment:** Could explain some symptoms but doesn't fit central vision changes as well.

### INPUT:
A 64-year-old woman with a 2-year history of seizure disorder presented to the emergency department (ED) at an outside hospital with breakthrough seizures. One month prior to her ED visit, she had been treated with oral antibiotics when she presented to an urgent care center with left-sided otorrhea, otalgia, and hearing loss. In the ED, she denied headaches, fever, otalgia, otorrhea, or hearing loss. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with contrast showed diffuse enhancement and possible coalescence in the left mastoid process with adjacent dural enhancement and sigmoid sinus occlusion. She received intravenous vancomycin and cefepime and was started on a heparin drip before being transferred to our facility. On presentation at our facility, the patient appeared well with normal vital signs. There was no periauricular swelling or erythema. Otoscopic examination showed no inflammation of the external auditory canals, and the tympanic membranes were translucent without evidence of retraction or effusion. Computed tomographic venogram confirmed occlusion of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses, and computed tomography of the temporal bone showed coalescence of mastoid air cells with erosion into the sigmoid sinus. Mastoidectomy was performed for biopsy and culture specimens. Histologic findings from the specimens demonstrated cells with oval nuclei and abundant cytoplasm arranged in syncytial clusters with occasional whorls, pseudoinclusions, and psammomatous calcifications (Figure, A). Immunohistochemical stains were positive for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and vimentin (Figure, B).

2. **Meningioma** - The histologic findings of syncytial clusters, psammoma bodies, and immunohistochemical positivity for EMA are characteristic of meningioma.
3. **Mastoiditis** - The initial diffuse enhancement in the left mastoid process suggests acute or chronic mastoiditis.
4. **Sigmoid Sinus Thrombosis** - The CT venogram confirmed the occlusion, which can be associated with infections like mastoiditis.
5. **Middle Ear Infection (Otitis Media)** - The patient's initial symptoms and history could align with a middle ear infection leading to complications.
6. **Temporal Bone Tumor** - Erosion into the sigmoid sinus and specific histological findings could suggest a neoplastic process in the temporal bone.
7. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis** - The presence of cells with abundant cytoplasm might suggest this rare entity affecting the skull bones.
8. **Glioma** - Invasion into the dura with these cytological features can be considered glioma, although less likely given the positivity for EMA.
9. **Sarcoidosis** - Granulomas could exhibit some of the histological features seen, though lack electron dense inclusions.
10. **Fibrous Dysplasia** - Could explain bone changes but less likely given histological findings do not match perfectly.

A 53-year-old man with a history of stage IVA1 (T4N1M0B2) mycosis fungoides presented with a new 1-month history of hyperpigmentation of the oral mucosa (Figure 1). Examination of the mouth revealed multiple coalescing painless nonpruritic black macules and patches on the tongue, roof of the mouth, and buccal mucosa. Examination of the skin was notable for erythematous and hyperpigmented patches covering 90% of the body surface area, consistent with his known mycosis fungoides. Other notable findings on examination were 1- to 2-cm lymphadenopathy in the bilateral inguinal folds and axillae. Review of systems was notable for fatigue. The patient had previously received 5 cycles of romidepsin with progression of disease, followed by 4 doses of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, which was followed by partial response.

### INPUT:
A previously healthy 7-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital with 1 week of temperatures up to 40.2 °C (104.4 °F), productive cough, and lethargy, which did not improve after 3 days of oral cefuroxime. She lived in rural China and had close contact with dogs, cattle, and sheep. Her blood pressure was 93/60 mm Hg; heart rate, 100/min; respiratory rate, 26/min; and oxygen saturation, 94% on room air. Lung auscultation revealed absent breath sounds on the right hemithorax. Her abdomen was soft and nontender, without hepatosplenomegaly. Her white blood cell count was 8000/μL, with 25.8% eosinophils (reference range, 0%-9%). C-reactive protein level and results from tuberculin skin test, interferon-γ release assay, nucleic acid amplification testing for tuberculosis, acid-fast bacilli smear microscopy, and HIV antibody testing were normal. A thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed a ruptured 10 × 9 × 5–cm right upper lobe pulmonary cyst compressing the right main bronchus and 3 liver cysts (Figure 1).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cystic echinococcosis,"1. **Hydatid Disease (Echinococcosis):** Given the patient's contact with animals such as sheep and dogs and the CT findings of a ruptured pulmonary cyst and liver cysts, echinococcosis is a primary consideration.
   
2. **Paragonimiasis:** Considering the eosinophilia and lung involvement, infection by lung flukes after consumption of raw or undercooked crustaceans can mimic these symptoms.
   
3. **Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA):** The eosinophilia and lung involvement could suggest an allergic reaction to aspergillus, though liver cysts would be unusual.
   
4. **Cystic Fibrosis:** Although less likely without a history of chronic infections and gastrointestinal symptoms, it could cause lung cysts.
   
5. **Löffler's Syndrome:** Temporary lung infiltrations accompanied by eosinophilia, typically due to parasitic larval migration.
   
6. **Pulmonary Sequestration:** A developmental abnormality where nonfunctional lung tissue can become cystic and infective.
   
7. **Lymphatic Filariasis:** Concurrent lung and liver involvement with eosinophilia might suggest filarial infection, though liver cysts are less typical.
   
8. **Bronchogenic Cyst:** A congenital malformation that could present as a cystic lesion in the lungs.
   
9. **Carcinoid Syndrome:** Unlikely due to age, but carcinoid tumors could cause lung lesions and systemic symptoms.
   
10. **Sarcoidosis:** With typically multisystem presentation, sarcoidosis presents as lung involvement and could mimic such symptoms, but eosinophilia is not typical.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Hydatid Disease (Echinococcosis)**: The CT findings, eosinophilia, and exposure to animals like sheep and dogs strongly align with this parasitic infection.
2. **Paragonimiasis**: High eosinophilia and lung symptoms warrant consideration given the rural setting and possible dietary exposure.
3. **Löffler's Syndrome**: Compatible with eosinophilia and respiratory symptoms, though typically less severe lung findings.
4. **Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA)**: Although less likely due to the liver cysts and specific lung cyst appearance, eosinophilia is relevant.
5. **Pulmonary Sequestration**: The depiction of lung cysts could be congenital, albeit without the systemic infective presentation.
6. **Lymphatic Filariasis**: Although liver cysts are atypical, eosinophilia and rural exposure suggest parasitic infection possibilities.
7. **Bronchogenic Cyst**: The presence of lung cysts fits, but systemic signs and eosinophilia are missing.
8. **Cystic Fibrosis**: Unlikely without a supportive history but remains a remote possibility.
9. **Carcinoid Syndrome**: Age and presentation make this improbable but possible in rare scenarios.
10. **Sarcoidosis**: The non-characteristic liver cysts and high eosinophilia make this unlikely.

The symptoms and imaging findings indicate the need to prioritize parasitic infections and related cystic conditions given the eosinophilic infiltration and milieu.","['Pulmonary Medicine', 'Hepatobiliary Disease', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Pediatrics']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7.0,M

### INPUT:
A previously healthy individual in her 20s presented to the dermatology clinic for evaluation of annular skin lesions that appeared first on her right ankle and then on other areas of her body over a 3-month period. She reported numbness and paresthesia in the areas of affected skin and an inability to fully extend her fingers. The patient did not take any prescription medications or herbal supplements and had immigrated to the US from Samoa 4 years prior. Physical examination revealed multiple tattoos and annular erythematous plaques on her face, chest (Figure, left panel), back, arms, and legs. The patient had bilateral palpable thickened auricular and ulnar nerves, claw-hand deformity (Figure, right panel), foot drop bilaterally, and decreased sensation to temperature over the areas of skin plaque. Results of testing for rapid plasma reagin, antinuclear antibodies, and rheumatoid factor were negative. Examination of punch biopsy samples from 2 plaques on her back revealed granulomatous periadnexal and perivascular dermatitis with diffuse granulomatous infiltrate and foamy histiocytes. Findings on acid-fast bacilli stains and mycobacterial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing were negative. Repeat biopsy of a skin plaque revealed no fungal organisms, and Mycobacterium leprae was not identified on Fite Faraco stain.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Multibacillary leprosy,"1. **Leprosy (Hansen's Disease)**: Despite negative testing, the clinical presentation of annular lesions, sensory neuropathy, thickened peripheral nerves, and claw-hand deformity strongly suggests a dermatoneurological disorder like leprosy.

2. **Sarcoidosis**: Granulomatous skin lesions and peripheral nerve involvement might suggest sarcoidosis, particularly given the negative Fite Faraco stain for M. leprae.

3. **Cutaneous Tuberculosis**: Although acid-fast bacilli stains were negative, cutaneous manifestations and granulomatous dermatitis could be considered.

4. **Granuloma Annulare**: The annular pattern of skin lesions fits granuloma annulare, a benign dermatosis which can occasionally have atypical presentations.

5. **Amyloidosis**: Due to the diverse presentation affecting skin and nerves, amyloidosis is considered, although nerve enlargement isn't typically a prominent feature.

6. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica Diabeticorum**: While rare without diabetes, the presentation resembles necrobiosis lipoidica, known for granulomatous inflammation.

7. **Chronic Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus**: Though ANA and rheumatoid factor were negative, cutaneous manifestations might initially suggest lupus involvement.

8. **Hypersensitivity Reaction to Tattoo Ink**: Multiple tattoos could lead to a foreign body granuloma or inflammatory response involving skin and potentially nerves.

9. **Lichen Planus with Neurological Involvement**: Lichen planus primarily affects skin, but systemic involvements exist in rarer cases.

10. **Granulomatous Rosacea**: This skin condition can mimic other granulomatous disorders with facial involvement, but typically lacks systemic manifestations.

7. **Chronic Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus**
8. **Hypersensitivity Reaction to Tattoo Ink**
9. **Lichen Planus with Neurological Involvement**
10. **Granulomatous Rosacea** 

The clinical clues of significant nerve involvement, skin lesions, and sensory changes make leprosy the most fitting diagnosis despite negative lab tests, encouraging further investigation, possibly revisiting exposure history or repeating tests at reference labs specialized in mycobacterial diseases.

### INPUT:
A 3-year-old boy with no medical history presented to the emergency department with 1 day of abnormal gait and bilateral mydriasis. Two weeks prior, he had upper respiratory symptoms and bacterial conjunctivitis treated with topical ofloxacin. On examination, pupils were fixed and dilated to 8 mm, extraocular movements were intact, and fundus examination was normal. He had brisk reflexes, poor coordination, and a wide-based unsteady gait. Bloodwork revealed leukocytosis and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate; cultures remained without growth. Lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid studies, computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging of brain and orbits were normal. The patient was discharged 3 days later following improvement in lethargy and gait with a diagnosis of acute cerebellar ataxia. When he presented to ophthalmology for 1-week follow-up, his visual acuity was central, steady, and maintained in both eyes. He demonstrated sluggish but reactive pupils and new-onset ophthalmoplegia. He was unable to move either eye in any direction, including with doll’s head maneuver. He was readmitted to the hospital and demonstrated diminished reflexes bilaterally and unsteady gait. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated diffuse enhancement of the lower thoracic and cauda equina nerve roots and enhancement of the left oculomotor nerve (Figure).

Based on the information and test results, we can rerank the differentials:

1. Miller Fisher syndrome - The clinical presentation of ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and areflexia fits this syndrome well.
2. Guillain-Barré syndrome - Particularly a variant like acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) which may present similarly in pediatrics.
3. Neuroblastoma-associated paraneoplastic syndrome - Given age and the symptoms, the possibility of paraneoplastic syndrome like opsoclonus-myoclonus needs consideration.
4. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) - Initially possible due to post-infectious presentation, but lacks the definite features.
5. Botulism - Presence of bilateral mydriasis and ophthalmoplegia may suggest botulinum toxin, though improvement and age make it less likely.
6. Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome - Less typical presentation in terms of myoclonus or opsoclonus.
7. Brainstem encephalitis - Inflammation indicated by imaging could link to this diagnosis but lacks the specific central signs.
8. Myasthenia gravis - Uncommon but possible, especially with ophthalmoplegia; unlikely given age and areflexia.
9. Sarcoidosis - Rare but possible in children; unlikely without systemic involvement.
10. Lyme disease - Due to the neurological involvement; geographic and lack of rash or tick exposure make it improbable.","['Demyelinating Disorders', 'Neuro-ophthalmology', 'Neurology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Pediatrics']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.0,F

### INPUT:
A 46-year-old woman presented with a left shoulder mass. It began with a quarter-size maculopapular lesion and continued to progress during the next 3 years. She reported limited shoulder movements and denied other symptoms. There was no medical or surgical history, and she had a negative personal or familial oncologic history. The patient was a construction worker and used tobacco daily. On physical examination, there was a 24 × 15-cm fungating, necrotic, and ulcerated left shoulder mass (Figure 1A). A punch biopsy showed sheets of highly pleomorphic atypical spindle and epithelial cells within the superficial and deep dermis, extending into the subcutaneous tissue, and with 18 mitoses/mm2. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated SOX10-positive and pankeratin-negative tumor cells. A whole-body positron emission tomographic and computed tomographic scan revealed an intensely hypermetabolic left shoulder mass and multiple hypermetabolic enlarged left axillary lymph nodes, with no distant metastases (Figure 1B). Brain magnetic resonance imaging was negative for intracranial metastasis.

### Reranking Using All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. Desmoplastic Melanoma: The presence of SOX10-positive and pankeratin-negative tumor cells, highly pleomorphic atypical spindle and epithelial cells, and the patient's occupational exposure support this diagnosis.
2. Merkel Cell Carcinoma: Although less likely due to SOX10 positivity, it remains a consideration for aggressive skin malignancies.
3. Pleomorphic Dermal Sarcoma: Given the aggressive nature and appearance, it remains a differential.
4. Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor: The atypical spindle cell morphology suggests a sarcoma as part of the differential.
5. Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans: Although classically less mitotically active, SOX10 could be sporadically expressed.
6. Cutaneous Leiomyosarcoma: Based on the spindle cell aspect, it can be considered, albeit less likely without smooth muscle markers.
7. Atypical Fibroxanthoma: While it displays some overlapping features with pleomorphic sarcomas, its benign behavior makes it less likely given the progression.
8. Angiosarcoma: Given the vascular tumor's propensity for ulceration and necrosis, it remains a potential but less likely diagnosis without endothelial marker positivity.
9. Squamous Cell Carcinoma: While a common skin cancer, the immunohistochemistry does not support a keratinizing tumor.
10. Metastatic Breast Carcinoma: Due to the patient's age, metastatic disease remains a possibility, but negative for distant metastasis makes this less likely.","['Dermatology', 'Genetics and Genomics', 'Oncology', 'Skin Cancer', 'Cancer Genetics']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,46.0,M

### INPUT:
A 6-year child presented with headache for 1 month and seizures followed by altered consciousness for 1 day. She had new-onset daily occipital headache for 1 month of mild to moderate severity and pulsating character. Occasionally, the headache became severe accompanied by vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. The child had 4 to 5 episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures 1 day prior to admission. She remained unconscious for several hours and spontaneously regained consciousness over 24 hours. There was no history of fever, weight loss, limb weakness, vision impairment, or any strokelike illness. Her birth and developmental history were unremarkable. On examination, her pulse rate was 80 beats per minute (regular) with all peripheral pulses palpable without any radio-femoral delay. Her blood pressure was 170/110 mm Hg with less than 10 mm Hg difference of systolic and diastolic blood pressure in other limbs. Abdominal examination revealed abdominal bruit. Fundus examination revealed papilledema with changes of hypertensive retinopathy. She was not oriented to place and time. The cranial nerves, motor, sensory, and autonomic system examination were unremarkable. Meningeal signs were absent. There was no evidence of neurocutaneous markers. Her cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral white matter hyperintensity that was more marked in the bilateral parieto-occipital region. Ultrasound of the abdomen revealed a small right kidney and renal Doppler was suggestive of right renal-artery stenosis. Her computed tomography angiography revealed short segment (3 cm) and short circumferential thickening of the descending aorta with right renal artery narrowing (Figure 1). Her repeat cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed significant reduction in the white matter hyperintensities.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Takayasu arteritis,"1. **Renal Artery Stenosis** - Given the high blood pressure, abdominal bruit, and small right kidney observed on ultrasound, renal artery stenosis is a possible cause of secondary hypertension.

2. **Coarctation of the Aorta** - The short segment thickening of the descending aorta and differential hypertension suggests this as a potential diagnosis.

3. **Pediatric Hypertension due to Renovascular Disease** - Hypertension in children with accompanying renal artery stenosis points towards renovascular causes.

4. **Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES)** - The MRI findings of bilateral parieto-occipital white matter hyperintensities and hypertensive crisis support this diagnosis.

5. **Takayasu’s Arteritis** - The thickening of the descending aorta and renal artery stenosis could point towards large vessel vasculitis like Takayasu’s arteritis, especially in young females.

6. **Fibromuscular Dysplasia** - The presentation of stenosis in the renal arteries in a child could suggest this condition.

7. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension** - Although rare in this age group without obesity, papilledema and headaches could suggest some form of increased intracranial pressure.

8. **Neurofibromatosis Type 1** - Although no neurocutaneous markers are present, vascular manifestations like renal artery stenosis can occur.

9. **Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Vascular Type** - Disorders like this can lead to vascular malformations, although less common, it could potentially explain the vascular issues.

10. **Moyamoya Disease** - While not consistent with all findings, the possibility of vascular compromise leading to neurological symptoms warrants consideration.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Takayasu’s Arteritis** - Due to young age, gender, and imaging findings of vessel thickening and stenosis.
   
2. **Renal Artery Stenosis Secondary to Fibromuscular Dysplasia** - Common renovascular cause of hypertension in young patients.

3. **Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES)** - Response to hypertensive crisis and bilateral parieto-occipital findings on MRI.

4. **Coarctation of the Aorta** - Differential blood pressure and descending aorta thickening but more common in other presentations.
   
5. **Pediatric Hypertension due to Renovascular Disease** - General category encompassing other specific causes found.

6. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension** - Due to papilledema and potentially reversible white matter changes but less likely.

7. **Neurofibromatosis Type 1** - Although unlikely due to lack of neurocutaneous markers could still tie vascular manifestations.

8. **Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Vascular Type** - Least likely due to absence of other connective tissue disorder manifestations.

9. **Moyamoya Disease** - Considered less probable as it's mainly associated with progressive bilateral stenosis of cerebral arteries, but still possible given some overlap with symptoms.

10. **Conditions resulting from Other Secondary Causes of Hypertension** - Although specific causes may not present all symptoms, secondary causes can present variably.","['Pediatrics', 'Rheumatology', 'Neurology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,6.0,M

### INPUT:
A 71-year-old man presented to the otolaryngology clinic for evaluation of a parapharyngeal space (PPS) mass that was incidentally found on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the face. The patient experienced left jaw tightness, aural fullness, and facial discomfort. The MRI results demonstrated a well-circumscribed, ovoid mass in the left prestyloid PPS that measured 12 × 15 × 22 mm. The lesion was isointense on T1-weighted imaging, was hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging, and demonstrated heterogeneous enhancement following gadolinium administration (Figure 1). A computed tomography–guided fine-needle aspiration was performed, which demonstrated blood, fibrin, and rare mesenchymal cells. Given his ongoing symptoms, the patient requested surgical resection. The patient underwent transoral robotic surgery for resection of his PPS mass to achieve definitive diagnosis and treatment. Histopathologic evaluation demonstrated a well-circumscribed, 12-mm mass.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Venous malformation,"1. **Pleomorphic Adenoma**  
   - Considered due to its common occurrence in salivary gland tumors and the imaging characteristics observed.

2. **Schwannoma**  
   - Suggested by the patient's symptoms and MRI characteristics, particularly the well-circumscribed and enhancing nature of the mass.

3. **Paraganglioma**  
   - Possible due to location in the parapharyngeal space and MRI features such as hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging.

4. **Neurofibroma**  
   - Considered given the mesenchymal cell findings on aspiration and the well-circumscribed nature of the mass.

5. **Lipoma**  
   - Possible due to the isointensity on T1-weighted MRI, though less likely because of the enhancement pattern.

6. **Solitary Fibrous Tumor**  
   - Considered due to the presence of mesenchymal cells and characteristic imaging findings.

7. **Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma**  
   - Included as a differential due to the potential for salivary gland origin, but less likely based on initial cell findings.

8. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**  
   - Considered due to its potential presentation in the PPS, though less likely based on age and characteristics.

9. **Lymphangioma**  
   - Possible due to the hyperintense T2-weighted imaging, although typically occurs in younger patients.

10. **Metastatic Disease**  
    - Although less common, considered if primary cancer is elsewhere and has metastasized to the PPS.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Schwannoma**  
   - Due to the combination of symptoms, imaging characteristics, and surgical findings.

2. **Pleomorphic Adenoma**  
   - High likelihood because of imaging features and commonality in salivary gland tumors.

3. **Paraganglioma**  
   - Given location and imaging, remains a significant possibility.

4. **Neurofibroma**  
   - Considered due to mesenchymal cell presence and characteristic imaging.

5. **Solitary Fibrous Tumor**  
   - Possibility due to imaging and histopathology characteristics.

6. **Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma**  
   - Less likely but plausible due to salivary gland origin.

7. **Lipoma**  
   - Lower likelihood due to typical imaging discrepancies.

8. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**  
   - Less consideration based on patient age and histological findings.

9. **Lymphangioma**  
   - Unlikely due to the age factor.

10. **Metastatic Disease**

### INPUT:
A 70-year-old man with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and gallstones presented to the emergency department with 3 days of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. He reported no hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena and had no history of abdominal surgery. On admission to the emergency department, he was afebrile, his blood pressure was 80/60 mm Hg, and heart rate was 122/min. On physical examination, his abdomen was distended, tympanic, and slightly tender to palpation diffusely. Blood testing showed a white blood cell count of 10 450/μL (84.1% neutrophils); C-reactive protein level, 9.5 mg/dL; potassium level, 3.0 mEq/L (reference, 3.6-5.2 mEq/L); and creatinine level, 5.57 mg/dL (429.39 μmol/L, up from a baseline level of 0.80 mg/dL [70.72 μmol/L]). Sodium and liver function values were normal. In the emergency department, he received a 500-mL bolus of intravenous crystalloid fluid and 1 g of intravenous ceftriaxone. A nasogastric tube was placed and initially drained 300 mL of biliary fluid. A non–contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was performed (Figure 1).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Gallstone ileus,"1. **Acute Mesenteric Ischemia** - Given the history of atrial fibrillation and sudden severe abdominal pain, mesenteric ischemia must be considered.

2. **Bowel Obstruction** - The abdominal distension, nausea, and vomiting, along with tympanic abdomen, suggest possible bowel obstruction.

3. **Acute Pancreatitis** - With symptoms of abdominal pain and nausea, pancreatitis could be a differential, although no alcohol use or history of gallstones as the cause has been clarified.

4. **Gastrointestinal Perforation** - The presence of diffuse abdominal tenderness and tympany suggests possible gastrointestinal perforation.

5. **Renal Failure** - Acute renal failure due to dehydration or other causes is a possibility given the elevated creatinine.

6. **Adrenal Insufficiency** - Considered due to persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation.

7. **Cholecystitis** - Gallbladder inflammation due to gallstones could explain the abdominal pain, although it is less likely in this scenario.

8. **Peritonitis** - Inflammation of the peritoneum should be considered given the tenderness and guarded abdomen.

9. **Sepsis** - Secondary potential to intra-abdominal source or other systemic infection contributing to his presentation.

10. **Volvulus** - Twisting of the intestine leading to obstruction could match the clinical picture.

Reranking after considering all available information:

1. **Bowel Obstruction** - The NG tube draining biliary fluid, CT scan findings, and presentation prioritize this diagnosis.
   
2. **Acute Mesenteric Ischemia** - Continuous suspicion given history and risk factors.

3. **Gastrointestinal Perforation** - Potential based on symptom severity and absence of history and lab specifics.

4. **Renal Failure** - Elevated creatinine supports this diagnosis, but it is likely secondary.

5. **Acute Pancreatitis** - Less likely due to CT findings and absence of classic risk factors/signs.

6. **Adrenal Insufficiency** - Persistent hypotension remains suspicious.

7. **Volvulus** - Symptoms consistent with an obstructive process lead to this consideration.

8. **Sepsis** - Possible complicating factor, but not primary.

### INPUT:
A 75-year-old woman with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with isolated deletion 5q (del5q) presented with multiple nonhealing skin ulcers on the chest and upper extremities. Four years earlier, she started taking lenalidomide, 10 mg/d (28-day cycle), to treat worsening anemia; after 2 cycles of treatment, she became transfusion independent. Since then, she has remained stable with the same dose and schedule of lenalidomide without significant adverse effects. The presenting skin lesions developed 1 month before presentation and began as small pustules that rapidly transformed into painful ulcers. She was treated with valacyclovir for a presumed diagnosis of shingles, but the lesions did not improve. Because of suspected necrotizing fasciitis, she underwent incision and drainage of the lesions. Cultures from the surgical specimen grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus hemolyticus. However, the lesions continued to worsen despite vancomycin and additional debridement. Thus, she was transferred to our facility. Physical examination showed multiple cutaneous ulcers with gray undermined borders and red papules of varying depths involving the chest, back, and upper extremity; lesions were as large as 9 × 15 cm. A complete blood cell count showed a white blood cell count of 16.2 × 103/μL (to convert to 109/L, multiply by 1.0) with an absolute neutrophil count of 12.7 × 103/μL, hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0), and platelet count of 262 × 103/μL with no circulating blasts. Results of additional laboratory studies, including blood culture and tests for herpes zoster virus (via polymerase chain reaction), antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were all negative. Additionally, the patient also had hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for which she was taking lisinopril and simvastatin, respectively. Pathologic sampling from skin lesions demonstrated a dense dermal infiltrate with predominantly neutrophils along with reactive histiocytes, fibroblasts, and angioplasia (Figure, A). Immunohistochemical staining showed myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils (Figure, B), histiocytic markers (CD43, CD63, CD168), and CD117-positive mast cells, but no immature myeloid precursors. Results of Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver staining were unremarkable.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pyoderma gangrenosum,"1. **Pyoderma gangrenosum**: A condition associated with neutrophilic dermatitis characterized by painful skin ulcers, often seen in patients with underlying systemic diseases like MDS.

2. **Sweet's syndrome (Acute Febrile Neutrophilic Dermatosis)**: A potential consideration given the neutrophilic infiltrate and systemic association, but typically presents with more raised, red lesions.

3. **Chronic ulcerative dermatosis of hematologic malignancy**: Seen in patients with underlying hematologic disorders and could correlate with persistent ulcers.

4. **Ecthyma gangrenosum**: Focuses on bacterial infections, usually with Pseudomonas, but given the lack of improvement with antibiotics, it's less likely here.

5. **Vasculitis or cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis**: Consider given ulcerative skin changes, but negative ANCA and absence of vasculitis in biopsy lower this possibility.

6. **Infection secondary to impaired immune response**: Hypothesized susceptibility due to ongoing lenalidomide therapy and underlying MDS affecting immunity.

7. **Herpetic infection with atypical presentation**: Previously hypothesized as shingles, but negative PCR and lack of response to antivirals reduce this likelihood.

8. **Atypical mycobacterial infection**: Might present as nonhealing ulcers resistant to standard antimicrobials, although specific staining should have indicated this.

9. **Medication-related ulceration**: Though stable on lenalidomide, drug-induced ulcers can occur in immunocompromised states.

10. **Cutaneous leukemia cutis**: Though no circulating blasts, skin manifestation of leukemia could theoretically occur, but histology does not support this.

### INPUT:
A healthy, uncircumcised woman in her 30s presented with a 14-year history of dyspareunia and recurrent, purulent discharge from her genital area. She had undergone multiple evaluations by dermatologists and urologists and had not responded to systemic antibiotics and topical corticosteroids. Physical examination revealed an erythematous, pinpoint orifice on her genital area, with peripheral telangiectasias and a linear bluish structure on dermoscopy (Figure, A and B). Ultrasonography revealed a hypoechoic focal zone on the right side of the genital area, with multiple hyperechoic bilaminar structures (Figure, C). A biopsy was performed (Figure, D).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pilonidal sinus,"1. **Bartholin's gland cyst or abscess**  
   - Considering the purulent discharge and location.

2. **Genital fistula**  
   - Persistent discharge and pinpoint orifice may indicate a fistula tract.

3. **Hidradenitis suppurativa**  
   - Chronic, recurrent nature and resistance to conventional treatments.

4. **Pilonidal sinus or dermal sinus**  
   - Erythematous opening and granuloma may relate to a sinus tract.

9. **Pyogenic granuloma**  
   - Erythematous lesion that may have persistent discharge.

10. **Hemangioma**  
    - Presence of bluish vascular structure and newfound hypoechoic zone.

Based on all the presented patient information and test results:

1. **Hidradenitis suppurativa**  
   - Matches recurrent symptoms and inflammatory patterns.

2. **Genital fistula**  
   - Clinical presentation and ultrasonography findings are suggestive of a fistula.

3. **Bartholin's gland cyst or abscess**

### INPUT:
A 62-year-old patient presented to the ophthalmology department with sudden painless vision loss in his right eye that occurred 24 hours ago. He also reported a 4-week history of right ear pain and fullness, discomfort over his frontal and maxillary sinuses, and nasal congestion without discharge. Over the past 2 weeks, he had experienced drenching night sweats, cramps in his quadriceps, and weight loss of 3 kg. He denied respiratory symptoms, headaches, scalp tenderness, or jaw claudication. He took no regular medication and did not smoke. At presentation, his visual acuities were perception of light OD and 20/20 OS. There was a right relative afferent pupillary defect. Dilated fundus examination showed a cherry red spot in the right macula with hyperreflectivity and thickening of the inner retinal layers on optical coherence tomography (Figure 1A and B). External eye examination results and ocular motility were normal. Examination by an otolaryngologist revealed normal tympanic membranes and a dry but otherwise normal nasal mucosa on flexible endoscopy. Blood tests showed leukocytosis (white blood cell count, 15 000 /µL; to convert to 109 per liter, multiply by 0.001) with neutrophilia (white blood cell count, 12 500 /µL), elevated C-reactive protein (19.4 mg/dL; to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10), elevated plasma viscosity (2.06 mPas), and thrombocytosis (467 ×103/µL; to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 1). Kidney function was within normal limits. Chest radiograph results were unremarkable.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Granulomatosis with polyangiitis,"Certainly, let's go through the differential diagnostic process step-by-step based on the information provided:

1. **Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO):** The sudden painless vision loss with a cherry-red spot on fundus exam suggests CRAO as a primary consideration.
   
2. **Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA):** Given the patient's age, elevated inflammatory markers, and visual symptoms, GCA is worth considering despite some atypical features like the absence of headaches or jaw claudication.

3. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA, formerly Wegener's granulomatosis):** The sinus-related symptoms, ear discomfort, elevated inflammatory markers, and systemic symptoms such as weight loss and night sweats raise suspicion for this condition.

4. **Polycythemia Vera (PV):** Thrombocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein, and systemic symptoms such as weight loss may be associated with myeloproliferative disorders.

5. **Thromboembolic Events (e.g., from cardiac causes):** Sudden vision loss can occur due to embolic events; however, typically, there might be a history of cardiovascular disease or arrhythmia, which is absent here.

6. **Vasculitis (other forms, e.g., Behçet’s disease):** The combination of systemic symptoms and ocular involvement could suggest vasculitic processes, although the presentation might not be classic for Behçet’s.

7. **Multiple Myeloma:** Severe systemic symptoms like night sweats, weight loss, and elevated blood viscosity might suggest plasma cell dyscrasia despite normal kidney function.

8. **Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma:** Given the otolaryngologic symptoms and systemic signs, although normal endoscopy reduces likelihood, it remains a possibility.

9. **Infective endocarditis with embolic phenomena:** Systemic inflammatory response and possible embolic event leading to vision loss, yet there is no heart or embolic history presented.

10. **Atypical infection (e.g., Tuberculosis, Sarcoidosis):** Systemic symptoms and ocular involvement could rarely point towards infections like TB or sarcoidosis.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis based on comprehensive evaluation:

1. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)**
2. **Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)**
3. **Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA)**
4. **Vasculitis**
5. **Thromboembolic Events**
6. **Polycythemia Vera (PV)**
7. **Multiple Myeloma**
8. **Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma**
9. **Atypical infection**
10. **Infective endocarditis**

This ranking considers the presenting ophthalmic and systemic symptoms, laboratory findings, and patient's demographic details.

### INPUT:
A 25-month-old child with unilateral hearing loss was referred to a pediatric ear, nose, and throat surgeon in a secondary care hospital. Clinical findings suggested unilateral right middle ear effusion associated with ipsilateral conductive hearing loss. After an initial observation period, a right tympanostomy tube was inserted. During the procedure, a clear liquid pulsating from the middle ear was noted, and samples were sent for β-2-transferrine analysis. This confirmed the presence of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. The patient was referred to our tertiary referral center hospital. The leak settled with conservative management, and imaging of the brain and skull base was performed. A high-resolution computed tomography scan of the temporal bone showed a lytic aspect of the right temporal bone extending to the petrous apex and the petrous bone, sparing the otic capsule (Figure 1A). There was soft tissue opacification of the right mastoid air cells. Magnetic resonance imaging of the skull base with contrast was performed (Figure 1B). It showed a hyperintense T2 signal in the petrous apex and mastoid air cells. There was a suspected communication into the soft tissues of the right neck in the posterior triangle. Magnetic resonance imaging also showed signs of Chiari malformation type 1. After a skull base multidisciplinary discussion, the patient underwent a bone biopsy through a transmastoid approach.

1. Petrous Apex Cholesterol Granuloma - Supported by the lytic lesion at the petrous apex and hyperintense T2 signal.
2. Eosinophilic Granuloma (Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis) - Could explain the lytic aspect of the temporal bone.
3. Cholesteatoma - Although usually not associated with CSF leak, it can cause lytic changes.
4. Meningoencephalocele - Considering the CSF leak and middle ear effusion.
5. Petrous Apicitis - Due to opacification and possible infection involvement.
6. Epidermoid Cyst - Though it does not usually present with CSF leaks, it should be considered.
7. Temporal bone fracture - Less likely due to absence of reported trauma.
8. Congenital Cholesterol Granuloma - Similar findings but less common in this age.

### INPUT:
A 12-year-old boy presented to the clinic with a 3-month history of intermittent stridor. His symptoms were initially most prominent while playing sports and were suspected to be due to asthma or seasonal allergies. However, medical management with albuterol, intranasal fluticasone, and cetirizine failed to provide relief. More recently, the patient’s parents noted that he developed stridor while sleeping and while at rest, prompting the family to present for medical attention. Previous workup, including pulmonary function testing, was concerning for an upper airway obstructive process, for which he was referred to otolaryngology. In-office flexible videostroboscopy revealed a mass in the distal cervical trachea that appeared nearly obstructive. Chest radiography confirmed the presence of an approximately 1.5-cm, well-circumscribed soft tissue mass within the cervical trachea. Direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy were performed in the operating room under general anesthesia. This demonstrated an exophytic, pedunculated mass that emanated from the anterior wall of the cervical trachea (Figure 1A and B). The patient was intubated via Seldinger technique to bypass the mass, with a 4.0-mm cuffed endotracheal tube loaded over a 0-degree Hopkins endoscope (Figure 1C). With the airway secured, attention was turned to excision of the mass. Lidocaine, 1%, with epinephrine 1:100 000 was injected in a submucosal plane, and laryngeal scissors were used to excise the attachment of the mass from the tracheal wall. The mass was then resected en bloc and removed with laryngeal cupped forceps. The attachment site was then ablated with the Coblator (Figure 1D).

### INPUT:
A man in his mid-40s presented to the emergency department after a fall with head trauma. A head computed tomography showed a 0.9-cm left subdural hematoma with a mild left to right midline shift. His ethanol level was 202 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.2171); magnesium, 1.7 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.4114); potassium, 4.4 mEq/L (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1); and ionized calcium, 4.6 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.25). The patient developed cardiac arrest due to ventricular arrhythmias in the emergency department and was successfully resuscitated. Echocardiography demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% and no regional wall motion abnormalities. He subsequently underwent embolization of the middle meningeal artery. After embolization, however, a worsening rightward midline shift was discovered. As a result, on the 11th day of his hospitalization, he had a burr hole evacuation. During day 15 of admission, the patient had 3 episodes of torsade de pointes (TdP) while receiving 50 mg of metoprolol succinate daily, and his 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is shown in Figure 1.
### OUTPUT:
    ",T-wave alternans,"1. Subdural Hematoma: Given the initial presentation of head trauma and CT findings, subdural hematoma is a primary consideration.

2. Alcohol Intoxication: An elevated ethanol level suggests acute alcohol intoxication, which may have contributed to the fall and head trauma.

3. Hypomagnesemia-related Arrhythmias: The borderline low magnesium level (1.7 mg/dL) and subsequent ventricular arrhythmias and TdP episodes could suggest hypomagnesemia involved in arrhythmogenesis.

4. Long QT Syndrome: TdP episodes while on metoprolol and associated with ECG changes hint at a possible underlying long QT syndrome.

5. Traumatic Brain Injury: The progressive rightward midline shift post-embolization suggests worsening intracranial pressure due to traumatic injury.

6. Cardiac Dysfunction due to Ethanol: Although not primarily significant, chronic alcohol use could contribute to cardiac dysfunction predisposing to arrhythmias.

7. Drug-induced Arrhythmias: Metoprolol or other medications could contribute to TdP, particularly in the context of electrolyte imbalances and alcohol use.

8. Electrolyte Imbalances: Other unmeasured or complex electrolyte imbalances could contribute to arrhythmias alongside magnesium levels.

9. Incomplete Cerebral Recovery Post-Surgery: Progressive intracranial pressure could exacerbate systemic issues and complicate the cardiac picture.

10. Pre-existing Cardiomyopathy: Given the left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% without regional wall motion abnormality, a subtle pre-existing cardiomyopathy might precipitate the observed cardiac issues.

### RERANKED DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Long QT Syndrome: High likelihood given repeated episodes of TdP and ECG findings.
2. Hypomagnesemia-related Arrhythmias: Magnesium level’s role in arrhythmogenesis is critical given the arrhythmia type.
3. Subdural Hematoma: Direct correlation with trauma and clinical findings necessitates urgent management.
4. Electrolyte Imbalances: Other imbalances must be considered due to ongoing arrhythmic events.
5. Drug-induced Arrhythmias: Especially relevant with metoprolol usage.
6. Alcohol Intoxication: Acute intoxication needs consideration, primarily as a fall risk.
7. Traumatic Brain Injury: Secondary to subdural hematoma and embolization complications.
8. Cardiac Dysfunction due to Ethanol: Chronic effects, less acute.
9. Incomplete Cerebral Recovery Post-Surgery: Longer-term consideration post-burr hole.
10. Pre-existing Cardiomyopathy: Considered after acute causes for arrhythmias are evaluated.","['Cardiology', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Rhythm Disorders']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,45.0,F

### INPUT:
A male patient in his late 40s presented with a 3-year history of nonhealing ulcers in his groin and axillae. These lesions started as itchy, weepy, reddish papules and plaques, which gradually progressed to form ulcers and were associated with pain and pus discharge. They did not heal completely after multiple courses of topical as well as systemic antibiotics, antifungals, and steroids. He frequently experienced scaling and greasiness on his scalp, which was treated with shampoos and topical steroids. He also complained of polyuria and polydipsia for the past 4 years. General examination revealed multiple mobile, firm, nonmatted, and nontender lymph nodes in cervical and inguinal region. On systemic examination, hepatomegaly (2 cm below the right costal margin) was seen. There was also bilateral enlargement of the parotid area, which was tender on palpation. Cutaneous examination revealed yellowish greasy scales on the scalp, suggestive of seborrheic dermatitis. Erythematous edematous papules were present over the retroauricular areas and the inframammary folds (Figure, A). On examination of external genitalia, deep ulcers were observed in the bilateral inguinal folds, resembling knife-cut ulcers (Figure, B). Similar lesions were present over the junction of the scrotum and were associated with yellowish pus discharge. A 3.5-mm punch biopsy specimen was obtained for histopathological examination from the edge of an ulcer on one of the groin folds (Figure, C and D).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Langerhans cell histiocytosis,"1. **Cutaneous Leishmaniasis**: The presence of nonhealing ulcers in the groin and axillae after multiple courses of antibiotics suggests a possibility of a dermal infectious process that is resistant to common treatments.
   
2. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum**: Chronic, nonhealing ulcers with a history of multiple ineffective treatments, combined with systemic symptoms, could indicate an autoinflammatory condition like pyoderma gangrenosum.

3. **Hidradenitis Suppurativa**: The presence of tender lesions and painful ulcers in intertriginous areas such as the groin and axillae, resistant to treatment, suggests hidradenitis suppurativa.

4. **Chronic Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (Discoid Lupus)**: Autoimmune conditions like lupus can present with chronic, nonhealing cutaneous lesions that do not respond to conventional treatments.

5. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis**: Multiple persistent skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, and hepatomegaly are suggestive of an infiltrative disorder such as Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis.

6. **Sarcoidosis**: This could present with cutaneous lesions, systemic symptoms, and lymphadenopathy, although the usual lesions are not ulcerative.

7. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegener's Granulomatosis)**: Systemic vasculitis, which can create ulcerative skin lesions, polyuria, polydipsia, and organomegaly due to immune-mediated damage.

8. **Syphilis**: Primary, secondary, or tertiary syphilis can present with a range of symptoms including skin ulcers, lymphadenopathy, and systemic signs.

9. **Hyper-IgE Syndrome (Job's Syndrome)**: Characterized by chronic skin infections and resistant skin lesions, it can lead to complications like organomegaly.

10. **IgG4-Related Disease**: The combination of skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, and organomegaly can suggest this systemic condition with fibroinflammatory characteristics.

### Final Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis**: Given the combination of skin findings, lymphadenopathy, and hepatomegaly, this remains the most likely diagnosis.
2. **Hidradenitis Suppurativa**: The chronic and recurring nature of the skin lesions, especially in intertriginous areas, aligns well with this condition.
3. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis**: The systemic symptoms along with ulcerative skin lesions fit this diagnosis.
4. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum**: Consider the presence of chronic, nonhealing ulcers.
5. **Hyper-IgE Syndrome**: Even though rare, it fits the resistant nature of the skin wounds and systemic involvement.
6. **IgG4-Related Disease**: The systemic symptoms and lymph node involvement suggest possible IgG4-RD.
7. **Chronic Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus**: Despite less fitting skin presentation, autoimmune processes could explain some symptoms.
8. **Sarcoidosis**: The systemic nature with less congruent skin lesions but similar symptoms makes it a distant possibility.
9. **Syphilis**: Lack of specific findings on the given patient reduced its likelihood.
10. **Cutaneous Leishmaniasis**: Uncommon but still plausible given non-response to initial treatments should be reassessed with biopsy findings.","['Hematology', 'Oncology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Gynecology', ""Women's Health""]",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,48.0,F

### INPUT:
A 48-year-old man presented with 3 days of worsening right orbital swelling, eye pain, blurry vision, and 3 months of bilateral photophobia. He also reported bilateral rhinorrhea, congestion, and right frontal and temporal headaches. Active medical issues included hypertension, very poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, tobacco use, and asthma. His brother and father both had a history of chronic orbital swelling. Vital signs were unremarkable, and examination of the right eye showed moderate chemosis, injected conjunctiva, and periorbital edema. Both eyes were proptotic, right worse than left. He had normal bilateral extraocular movements, pupillary light reflexes, and gross vision. Computed tomography with contrast revealed bilateral ethmoid and frontal sinus opacification and right worse than left orbital fat stranding (Figure 1A). Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast demonstrated both enlargement and enhancement of bilateral extraocular muscles, especially the right superior rectus (Figure 1B). Initially he was started on antibiotic therapy. Right nasal biopsy, right endoscopic sinus surgery, and right anterior superior orbital tissue biopsy were performed. Intraoperatively, the sinus mucosa demonstrated only edema and mild secretions, but there was no necrosis or purulence. Both orbital and nasal cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Orbital biopsy showed nodular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates without evidence of fungal infection or necrosis (Figure 1C). Further workup revealed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, total IgG, and IgG4 levels and normal white blood cell count, thyroid-stimulating hormone, angiotensin-converting enzyme, lysozyme, antinuclear antibody, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) levels.
### OUTPUT:

**Step 6:** Sarcoidosis

**Step 7:** Tolosa-Hunt syndrome

**Step 8:** Lymphoproliferative disorder

### Rerank of differential diagnosis based on all patient information and test results:

1. **IgG4-related disease (IgG4-related ophthalmic disease)** - Elevated IgG4 and biopsy findings are suggestive.
2. **Orbital cellulitis** - Initial concern due to symptoms, but less likely given sterile biopsy.
3. **Thyroid eye disease** - Considered due to imaging findings, but normal thyroid function makes it less likely.
4. **Chronic sinusitis** - Contribution to symptoms but not primary.
5. **Granulomatosis with polyangiitis** - Less likely with negative ANCA and biopsy findings.
6. **Lymphoproliferative disorder** - Considered due to lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates but less likely given IgG4 findings.
7. **Sjögren's syndrome** - Possible; connective tissue diseases could present similarly.
8. **Sarcoidosis** - Unlikely given normal ACE and biopsy results.
9. **Tolosa-Hunt syndrome** - Considered but no significant pain relief post-steroids.
10. **Nasal polyps with secondary infection** - Contributory but not primary.","['Ophthalmology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Rhinology and Sinus Disease', 'Orbit']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,48.0,F

### INPUT:
A woman in her 50s presented with bleeding wounds and nodules on the bilateral hips and forearms. She previously received failed systemic and radiation therapy for tumor stage mycosis fungoides (MF). She had received 11 courses of extended beam radiation therapy, including 3 courses of total skin irradiation of 24 to 30 Gy, and focal irradiation to the left posterior thigh and hip/buttock with 2.5/3 Gy to 12.5/24 Gy, respectively, and the right posterior thigh and hip with 2 Gy to 20 and 26 Gy, respectively. Seven years before this visit, she underwent a reduced-intensity, matched, unrelated donor, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Her post-transplant course was complicated by severe chronic graft vs host disease of the skin, eyes, and gut, for which she received systemic corticosteroid therapy, tacrolimus, methotrexate, and long-term extracorporeal photopheresis. Three years after the HSCT, she developed chronic ulcerations on the hips, back, and arms at the site of previously irradiated tumors, as well as multiple friable, hemorrhagic, and bleeding nodules on bilateral hips and her forearms while receiving treatment with corticosteroids and extracorporeal photopheresis. She underwent several debulking procedures and excision biopsies of the nodules, which revealed granulation tissue on histology. In this latest visit, physical examination revealed recurrent hemorrhagic and friable nodules on her left lateral hip and left lateral buttock (Figure 1). Similar nodules were noted on her right hip and forearm. The patient underwent repeated debulking and biopsy. She was also treated with micafungin, amphotericin B, levofloxacin, dapsone, acyclovir, pentamidine, penicillin VK, and posaconazole. Positron emission tomography (PET) computed tomography (CT) results did not show evidence of visceral or extracutaneous disease.

### INPUT:
A woman in her mid-50s with a medical history of nonspecific T-wave abnormalities on electrocardiogram (ECG) reported new-onset chest discomfort, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath that woke her from sleep. Emergency medical services found her to be in a wide complex tachycardia. She was administered a 150-mg bolus of intravenous amiodarone, which failed to terminate her arrhythmia. She ultimately required synchronized cardioversion with a biphasic direct current shock of 100 J. On arrival to the emergency department, her vital signs were stable. Serum electrolyte levels were within normal range and C-reactive protein was less than 6 mg/dL (to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10). High-sensitivity troponin peaked at 1078 pg/mL. Her initial 12-lead ECG is shown in Figure 1A. She continued in sinus rhythm with episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia observed on telemetry, as shown in Figure 1B. Cardiac catheterization revealed patent coronary arteries. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was remarkable for a dilated right ventricle with moderately reduced systolic function and transmural late gadolinium enhancement with akinesis and dyskinesis involving the right ventricular (RV) free wall and outflow tract extending to the left ventricular (LV) anterior, septal, and apical segments.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cardiac sarcoidosis,"1. **Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)**  
- Given the dilated right ventricle with reduced systolic function, dyskinesis, and the fact the coronary arteries are patent, this is a key consideration.

2. **Dilated Cardiomyopathy**  
- Considered due to the dilated right ventricle; however, the presence of late gadolinium enhancement makes this less likely as an isolated diagnosis.

3. **Sarcoidosis**  
- Potential cause of myocardial involvement, could explain late gadolinium enhancement and arrhythmias.

4. **Myocarditis**  
- Although not as consistent with patent coronary arteries and chronic rather than acute presentation, can result in the findings of myocardial inflammation and late gadolinium enhancement.

5. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy**  
- Possibility due to involvement of septal segments but less likely in the absence of septal hypertrophy.

6. **Cardiac Amyloidosis**  
- Typically involves LV more than RV; however, should be considered, especially with late gadolinium enhancement.

7. **Fabry Disease**  
- Unlikely given predominant RV involvement but included as a cardiomyopathy affecting conduction.

8. **Left Ventricular Noncompaction**  
- Could consider due to arrhythmias and dilated RV, though less likely without specific echocardiographic evidence.

9. **Brugada Syndrome**  
- Unlikely given the MRI findings indicating structural heart changes.

10. **Pulmonary Hypertension related Remodelling**  
- Typically would involve RV changes; however, dilated and impaired function more consistent with ARVC or other primary cardiomyopathies.

### INPUT:
A 68-year-old woman with a history of keratoconus was referred for evaluation of a choroidal lesion in her left eye. She reported intermittent dull pain in her left eye for 1 month that improved with acetaminophen. Her family history was significant for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (mother) and leukemia (mother and maternal grandfather). On examination, her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25 OD and 20/200 OS, limited by keratoconus. Extraocular movements were full, there was no relative afferent pupillary defect, and intraocular pressures were 13 mm Hg OD and 11 mm Hg OS. There was no proptosis. Anterior segment examination demonstrated keratoconus with corneal scarring in both eyes and Descemet folds in the left eye. Both eyes had mixed cataract. There were no signs of anterior segment or vitreous inflammation. Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed an amelanotic area of choroidal thickening (confirmed by optical coherence tomography) overhanging the inferonasal margin of the optic disc with associated subretinal fluid and scattered areas of hyperpigmentation (Figure 1A). There was an additional, subtle amelanotic elevated lesion under the fovea. Fundus autofluorescence demonstrated hyperautofluorescence in a leopard-spotting pattern (Figure 1B). Indocyanine green angiography revealed hypocyanescent lesions inferonasal to the disc and at the fovea.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Erdheim-Chester disease,"**Step-by-step Differential Diagnosis:**

1. **Choroidal Melanoma:** A primary intraocular malignancy, which can appear as thickened areas in the choroid and may lead to subretinal fluid accumulation.

2. **Choroidal Hemangioma:** A benign vascular tumor of the choroid, which can cause localized thickening and subretinal fluid.

3. **Choroidal Metastasis:** Secondary tumors from a primary cancer elsewhere in the body that may show amelanotic choroidal thickening.

4. **Choroidal Osteoma:** A rare, benign ossifying tumor of the choroid that can appear as an elevated lesion with potential retinal detachment.

5. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR):** A condition characterized by leakage of fluid under the retina, leading to a serous detachment.

6. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) Disease:** An inflammatory disorder affecting the eye, leading to choroidal thickening and subretinal fluid.

7. **Uveal Effusion Syndrome:** A condition where fluid accumulates within the uveal tract, causing secondary choroidal thickening.

8. **Retinal Pigment Epithelial Detachment (RPED):** Associated with macular degeneration, involving subretinal fluid due to separation of the RPE.

9. **Pachychoroid Disease Spectrum:** Includes diseases like central serous chorioretinopathy, characterized by thickened choroid and pigmentary changes.

10. **Lymphoma:** Specifically intraocular lymphoma, which can present with similar findings and there is a relevant family history of lymphoma.

**Reranked Differential Diagnosis:**

1. **Choroidal Melanoma:** Most likely given the presence of the choroidal thickening, subretinal fluid, and the leopard-spot autofluorescence, consistent with known presentation for this condition. 

2. **Lymphoma:** Due to her family history of lymphoproliferative disorders and presence of amelanotic choroidal lesions.

3. **Choroidal Metastasis:** The patient's age raises the possibility of metastatic spread to the eye; needs ruling out with systemic examination.

4. **Choroidal Hemangioma:** Can present with similar findings, though less associated with leopard-spot autofluorescence pattern.

5. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) Disease:** Though not typical presentation given the absence of signs of anterior uveitis or skin, ear, or CNS involvement.

6. **Pachychoroid Disease Spectrum:** Might explain some exam findings and needs consideration, especially if other diagnoses seem less likely.

7. **Choroidal Osteoma:** Typically less common and has a different appearance, but could explain elevated lesion findings.

8. **Uveal Effusion Syndrome:** Less likely but is a differential especially if imaging findings support it.

9. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR):** Unlikely with this presentation and patient age but considered due to subretinal fluid.

10. **Retinal Pigment Epithelial Detachment (RPED):** Less likely without age-related macular degeneration findings.

### INPUT:
A 19-year-old female presented for evaluation of painful lesions on the tongue that had been present for at least 3 months. She stated that the pain was exacerbated by spicy foods. She had initially presented to a primary care practitioner, was prescribed clotrimazole lozenges, and reported mild initial improvement followed by symptom progression. Subsequently, the practitioner referred the patient to an otolaryngologist. The patient denied any enlarged lymph nodes, fevers, fatigue, rash, weight loss, or abnormal gastrointestinal symptoms and had no noteworthy medical history. She reported mild alcohol consumption, denied any cigarette or illicit substance use, and endorsed engaging in oral and anal intercourse. A physical examination was notable for bilateral raised leukoplakia on the tongue; it was larger on the right side than the left and had a slightly hairy appearance. The lesion was tender to touch and could not be scraped off (Figure 1A). The lips and oral mucosa were without lesions, masses, or ulcers. The patient had no cervical lymphadenopathy. The findings of the physical examination were otherwise unremarkable.

Now, let's rerank these differential diagnoses based on the information provided:

1. Oral Hairy Leukoplakia - The slightly hairy appearance of the lesions and the fact that they cannot be scraped off along with the risk factors present (e.g., engaging in oral intercourse) are suggestive of this diagnosis.
2. Oral Lichen Planus - Bilateral, persistent, raised lesions that are painful fit the profile of this inflammatory condition.
3. Geographic Tongue - The exacerbation of pain with spicy foods and the chronicity of symptoms can align with this benign condition although it typically presents differently.
4. Allergic Contact Stomatitis - Could explain the painful lesions, considering the potential contact allergens.
5. Aphthous Stomatitis - Although typically this presents with ulcerative lesions, the chronic pain and lesion location are relevant considerations.
6. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus - While the systemic symptoms are absent, oral manifestations could still appear in some cases, although less likely here.
7. Erythema Multiforme - The physical appearance does not fit well, but painful oral lesions could be within its spectrum.
8. Pemphigus Vulgaris - Painful lesions could appear, but the absence of other lesions or systemic involvement makes this less likely.
9. Bechet's Disease - Unlikely given the lack of multiple mucocutaneous lesions and systemic symptoms.
10. Syphilitic Glossitis - The specific characteristic of the lesion and lack of other systemic symptoms make this unlikely.","['Otolaryngology', 'Dental Medicine']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,M

### INPUT:
A previously healthy 12-year-old girl presented with a 3-month history of nasal obstruction, progressive dysphonia, recurrent deep neck abscesses, and tender, bulky cervical lymphadenopathy. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck with contrast at her initial hospital admission was concerning for suppurative lymphadenitis. Despite incision and drainage, and intravenous ampicillin and sulbactam, her cervical lymphadenopathy persisted. Results of subsequent workup—including Haemophilus, tetanus, and pneumococcal antibody titers; QuantiFERON-TB Gold test; serum IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE levels; absolute lymphocyte count; neutrophil phenotype and function; angiotensin-converting enzyme level; HLA-B27 test; and antinuclear antibody level—were within normal limits. Magnetic resonance imaging of the neck with gadolinium contrast demonstrated bilateral, bulky, enlarged cervical lymph nodes, as well as enhancing nodules in the left laryngeal ventricle (2.3 × 1.6 × 1.2 cm), right false vocal cord, and right tracheal wall (0.6 × 0.4 cm). Findings from nasal endoscopy, awake flexible laryngoscopy, and operative microlaryngoscopy revealed yellow submucosal masses in the left nasal cavity, left laryngeal ventricle, and right trachea, as well as left vocal cord paresis (Figure, A). Biopsies were taken of the tracheal, laryngeal, and nasal cavity masses, and an excisional biopsy was taken of a left cervical lymph node (Figure, B). Histopathologic examination revealed a prominent infiltrate of benign-appearing histiocytes with numerous forms showing emperipolesis and some nuclei showing distinct central nucleoli. Immunohistochemical staining in these cells was positive for S100 and negative for CD1a.

### INPUT:
A man in his late 70s with a history of immunoglobulin A monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance presented with a tender, draining lesion of the central face despite several courses of treatment with antibiotics (Figure, A). The patient lived in Southern California but had visited Kenya for an extended trip a few years prior. Review of systems was negative for fevers, night sweats, weight loss, headache, vision changes, respiratory distress, or arthralgias. On the left nasal dorsum and medial cheek, there was a 3 × 4 cm violaceous plaque with focal purulent drainage. Within several weeks, the lesion rapidly expanded into a vegetative, freely draining plaque covering the cheeks and glabella and approaching the medial canthi (Figure, B). Computed tomography revealed findings consistent with abscess that did not involve the orbits, sinuses, or bone. Chest radiography results were unremarkable. Punch biopsy specimens were obtained for histopathological analysis and tissue cultures (Figure, C). Tissue culture results at 2 weeks remained negative, and a QuantiFERON-TB Gold test result was negative.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pyoderma gangrenosum,"1. **Chronic Granulomatous Disease:** Given the tender and draining nature of the lesion with the rapid expansion and negative initial cultures, a deep-seated infection or immune disorder affecting phagocyte function could be considered.

2. **Cutaneous Leishmaniasis:** His travel history to Kenya raises the possibility of leishmaniasis, a parasitic infection that can present with chronic ulcerative lesions.

3. **Atypical Mycobacterial Infection:** The presentation of a violaceous plaque and the chronicity of the lesion despite antibiotic treatment suggest a possibility of atypical mycobacterial infection.

4. **Sporotrichosis:** Though less common in Southern California, the appearance and chronic nature of the lesion are consistent with cutaneous fungal infections like sporotrichosis.

5. **Rhinophyma (Rosacea):** Given the central face involvement and the violaceous plaque-like nature, rhinophyma could be considered, especially given the patient's age.

6. **Nocardiosis:** A possibility given the immunocompromised status due to his immunoglobulin A monoclonal gammopathy, nocardiosis could cause cutaneous lesions and abcess-like formations.

7. **Actinomycosis:** A bacterial infection known for causing draining lesions, although typically associated with involvement of mucosal surfaces and sinus tracts.

8. **Kaposi's Sarcoma:** A vasculature-related neoplasm which could present with violaceous skin lesions, particularly in older males and those with immune challenges.

9. **Basal Cell Carcinoma:** Common skin cancer with significant central face involvement could mimic some aspects of this presentation.

10. **Mucormycosis:** Although less likely due to negative CT findings and lack of culture results, an aggressive fungal infection can manifest under immunocompromised circumstances.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Cutaneous Leishmaniasis:** Considered due to travel history to Kenya and presentation consistent with ulcerative skin lesions.
2. **Atypical Mycobacterial Infection:** The chronicity and the lesion's stubbornness to antibiotics suggest this infection.
3. **Sporotrichosis:** Fits the clinical description and possibly exposure history with progressive lesion expansion.
4. **Chronic Granulomatous Disease:** Due to immune dysfunction history and lesion characteristics.
5. **Nocardiosis:** Possibility due to immune status with propensity for cutaneous involvement.
6. **Actinomycosis:** Considered but less likely due to negative imaging findings.
7. **Kaposi's Sarcoma:** Potential but less likely without other systemic signs or symtpoms.
8. **Basal Cell Carcinoma:** Remote possibility due to non-malignant nature of cultures and absence of typical malignancy signs.
9. **Mucormycosis:** Least likely due to negative culture results and testing.

### INPUT:
An 81-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of a slow-growing mass in his left cheek. He denied having any symptoms, tenderness, numbness, or facial nerve weakness. Physical examination revealed a mass in the buccinator space that was smooth, was nontender to palpation, and had no overlying cutaneous changes. A contrast-enhanced maxillofacial computed tomography scan demonstrated a 1.8 × 1.8 × 1.9-cm rounded, well-circumscribed lesion at the anterior aspect of the left masticator space (Figure 1). The mass was abutting the parotid duct, which did not appear dilated, and appeared to have a peripheral rim of hyperenhancing soft tissue with a central cystic/necrotic component. Results of ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration revealed rare epithelial cells with degenerative changes and inflammatory cells present. Findings from a core biopsy demonstrated a spindle cell neoplasm of uncertain origin. On immunostaining, spindle cells were CK8/18, S100, and SOX10 negative; myosin and smooth muscle actin (SMA) negative; and CD31 negative. However, STAT6 staining was diffusely positive.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Solitary fibrous tumor,"To determine the differential diagnosis for the 81-year-old man with a cheek mass based on the given characteristics, we will take into account the clinical presentation, imaging findings, biopsy results, and immunostaining profile. 

### Step-by-step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Solitary Fibrous Tumor (SFT):** The positive STAT6 staining is a strong indicator of SFT, as STAT6 is commonly overexpressed in this type of tumor due to NAB2-STAT6 gene fusion.

2. **Myoepithelioma:** Despite the negative myosin and SMA staining, consider this as part of the differential due to the spindle cell nature of the lesion. 

3. **Schwannoma:** Considering the spindle cell neoplasm, although typically S100 positive, we should keep this on the list initially.

4. **Pleomorphic Adenoma:** Usually more common and can present as a well-circumscribed mass in the area, but typically would show different immunohistochemical properties.

5. **Sarcoma (Unclassified):** Given the spindle cell features and negative myogenic markers, an unclassified soft tissue sarcoma must be considered.

6. **Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor:** Again, S100 generally helps differentiate this, but early consideration is warranted in spindle cell lesions.

7. **Desmoid Fibromatosis:** A rare entity in this location but considered due to spindle cells and non-reactivity to markers.

8. **Fibrosarcoma:** Typically presents with a spindle cell pattern, although less common in this specific location.

9. **Metastatic Carcinoma:** Such as from kidney or thyroid, though the immunoprofile is not typical for these.

10. **Granular Cell Tumor:** Although unlikely with the immunoprofile, it can occasionally present as a spindle cell lesion.

### Reranked Final Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Solitary Fibrous Tumor (SFT)** - Rank remains based on STAT6 positivity.
2. **Unclassified Sarcoma** - Non-specific spindle morphology with negative immunoprofile.
3. **Desmoid Fibromatosis** - Spindle cells with unique profile.
4. **Pleomorphic Adenoma** - Given the region and presentation.
5. **Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor** - Despite negative S100, spindle cell nature sustains consideration.
6. **Schwannoma** - Unlikely but based on spindle cells.
7. **Myoepithelioma** - Considered based on spindle cells.
8. **Fibrosarcoma** - Given spindle nature, remains though less typical for location.
9. **Granular Cell Tumor** - Retained for potential atypical presentations.
10. **Metastatic Carcinoma** - Due to lack of typical immunohistochemical evidence.

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy woman in her 60s presented to a tertiary otolaryngology clinic reporting a 1-year medical history of progressively worsening hoarseness and dyspnea. She denied any history of dysphagia, odynophagia, fevers, unintentional weight loss, cough, or reflux symptoms. There was no prior history of smoking, head and neck surgeries, or radiation exposure. She was treated for asthma with inhaled steroids by her primary care physician without improvement in symptoms. On physical examination, the patient was stridulous and considerably hoarse. Her neck examination was unremarkable. Subsequent videostroboscopy revealed severe laryngeal mucosal edema, most significant in the false vocal folds, interarytenoid, and postcricoid regions (Figure 1A). There was right true vocal fold immobility with compensatory squeeze of the false vocal folds and an absent mucosal wave. Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the neck with contrast showed irregularity along the free edges of the true vocal folds but no evidence of a neoplasm or cervical lymphadenopathy. The patient underwent urgent direct laryngoscopy with biopsy, which showed edematous, irregular, friable laryngeal mucosa with significant airway narrowing. Laryngeal biopsy findings are shown in Figure 1, B and C.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Blastomycosis,"Step 1: Vocal Cord Paralysis - The presence of right true vocal fold immobility could suggest vocal cord paralysis.

Step 2: Laryngopharyngeal Reflux - Despite no history of reflux symptoms, laryngeal edema could imply silent reflux.

Step 3: Chronic Laryngitis - Progressive hoarseness and dyspnea with mucosal edema could indicate chronic inflammatory changes in the larynx.

Step 4: Laryngeal Edema due to Allergy - Allergic reactions can cause edema and impact vocal folds function.

Step 5: Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis - Airway involvement with stridor may suggest this vasculitis affecting the larynx.

Step 6: Polymyositis - Could involve laryngeal muscles, resulting in immobility and hoarseness.

Step 7: Amyloidosis - Systemic amyloidosis can affect the larynx, causing edema and vocal cord changes.

Step 8: Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis - HPV-related laryngeal papillomas cause hoarseness and breathing difficulties.

Step 9: Sarcoidosis - Multisystem granulomatous disease that may involve the larynx.

Step 10: Sjögren’s Syndrome - A less common cause, as autoimmune diseases can involve the larynx leading to dryness and irritation.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. Chronic Laryngitis - Consistent with progressive hoarseness, edema, and lack of response to asthma treatment.
2. Vocal Cord Paralysis - True vocal fold immobility is a significant finding.
3. Laryngeal Edema due to Allergy - Significant edema involves respiratory discomfort.
4. Amyloidosis - Can explain significant laryngeal changes without malignancy evidence.
5. Sarcoidosis - Could match the presentation despite lacking typical systemic symptoms.
6. Laryngopharyngeal Reflux - Silent reflux remains a consideration in context.
7. Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis - Though rare, airway involvement aligns.
8. Polymyositis - Muscle immobility could be due to myositis despite no other muscular symptoms reported.
9. Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis - HPV usually detected histologically, hence lower suspicion.
10. Sjögren’s Syndrome - Unlikely but remains a remote possibility given autoimmune nature.","['Fungal Infections', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Laryngology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Critical Care Medicine']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,60.0,M

### INPUT:
A 29-year-old Pakistani man was referred to the otolaryngology clinic for increased postnasal drip, pharyngitis, odynophagia, cervicalgia, cervical lymphadenopathy, and right-sided otalgia that had persisted for more than a week. He was breastfeeding his 10-month-old, had no history of alcohol use, and had a remote history of hookah use. He was a Southern California native with travel history to Pakistan, Turkey, Jordan, Israel, Qatar, and Dubai 5 years prior to symptom onset. One month prior to onset, he drove from Los Angeles, California, to Houston, Texas. He denied recent unintentional weight loss, cough, fever, night sweats, chills, stridor, dyspnea, dysphonia, or rash. On examination, his vital signs were within normal limits, and physical examination revealed a small right tonsillolith, mild tonsillar erythema that was worse on the right side, and a mobile 2-cm, right level 2 lymph node that was slightly tender to palpation. Laboratory evaluation was notable for an elevated eosinophil count and positive Epstein-Barr immunoglobulin G. His white blood cell count and mononucleosis spot test result were within normal parameters. His symptoms persisted despite treatment with penicillin, azithromycin, and steroids from his primary physician and amoxicillin-clavulanate, sinus rinses, fluticasone propionate, and azelastine spray from an otolaryngologist to treat any contributing postnasal drainage and tonsillitis. Flexible transnasal videolaryngoscopy revealed a lesion on the laryngeal surface of the right epiglottis passing midline extending to the right aryepiglottic fold, but not involving the true vocal cords (Figure 1A). Given inconclusive office biopsy results, direct laryngoscopy with biopsy was performed, showing extensively inflamed squamous mucosa with ulceration, granulation tissue, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and atypia (Figure 1B).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Coccidioidomycosis,"1. **Epiglottitis:** Initial consideration given the patient's odynophagia, erythema, and lesion on the laryngeal surface of the epiglottis.

2. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma:** Based on the atypia and pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia noted in the biopsy, a concern for malignancy arises.

3. **Laryngeal Tuberculosis:** Given the patient's travel history to areas with higher tuberculosis prevalence and the persistent lymphadenopathy.

4. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis):** Considered due to the inflamed mucosa and ulceration, although typically associated with more systemic signs.

5. **Sarcoidosis:** Possible due to the elevated eosinophil count and atypical biopsy findings, sometimes presenting with laryngeal involvement.

6. **Castleman Disease:** Due to the presence of cervical lymphadenopathy and laryngeal mass, although less common, it can present with similar symptoms.

7. **Lymphoma:** Given the cervical lymphadenopathy and non-resolving symptoms, lymphoma remains a differential consideration.

8. **Fungal Laryngitis (Histoplasmosis or Blastomycosis):** Consideration especially with travel history, as certain endemic fungi can cause laryngeal lesions.

9. **Behcet's Disease:** Ulceration and atypia in the biopsy suggest possible vasculitis or inflammatory condition, in consideration of Behcet's presentation.

10. **Laryngeal HPV Infection:** Considering the pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia and potential atypical epithelial changes.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma:** Based on the persistent lesion, atypia, and hyperplasia from the biopsy, a strong suspicion of cancer arises.
2. **Laryngeal Tuberculosis:** Reinforced by travel history and persistent lymphadenopathy.
3. **Lymphoma:** Due to unremitting cervical lymphadenopathy and potential atypical presentation.
4. **Fungal Laryngitis (Histoplasmosis or Blastomycosis):** Travel history and biopsy findings necessitate ruling out infectious causes.
5. **Sarcoidosis:** Given the elevated eosinophil count and potential for granulomatous inflammation.
6. **Epiglottitis:** Initial symptoms and findings, though less likely due to treatment unresponsiveness.
7. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis):** Less likely without systemic involvement but possible.
8. **Castleman Disease:** Rare, but consistent with lymphadenopathy and lesion.
9. **Behcet's Disease:** Uncommon but should be considered for ulcerations and inflammation.
10. **Laryngeal HPV Infection:** A possibility due to lesions and atypical epithelial morphologies.","['Fungal Infections', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Laryngology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Swallowing and Dysphagia']",0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,29.0,F

### INPUT:
A 75-year-old man presented with horizontal binocular diplopia, right-sided ptosis, and a new headache that was progressive over 3 days. He reported difficulty opening his jaw, pain when chewing, and a 2.3-kg weight loss. The week prior, he experienced left-sided ptosis that persisted for 2 days and subsequently resolved. He denied vision changes, eye pain, scalp tenderness, and myalgias. Past medical history included schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and supraventricular tachycardia. His examination demonstrated normal visual acuity in both eyes. Pupils were equal, round, and reactive. There was right upper-eyelid ptosis. Extraocular motility demonstrated limitation of elevation and abduction bilaterally (Figure 1). Results of dilated fundus examination were normal, and the remainder of his neurologic examination results were normal. His eye movements and ptosis did not change with fatiguability, rest, or an ice-pack test. Investigations revealed a C-reactive protein level of 292 mg/L (normal, <10 mg/L; to convert to milligrams per deciliter, divide by 10) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 93 mm/h (normal, <30 mm/h). A lumbar puncture demonstrated normal opening pressure, cell count, and glucose and protein levels. Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast of the brain demonstrated diffuse edema and enhancement of the scalp, skull base, neck, and paraspinal soft tissues, as well as T2 hyperintensity and enhancement of the extraocular muscles bilaterally. An additional test was obtained, and a diagnosis was made.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Giant cell arteritis,"1. **Giant Cell Arteritis**: Given the patient's age, headache, weight loss, elevated inflammatory markers, and presentation of jaw claudication, this inflammatory condition affecting arteries, particularly in the head, is a possible consideration.

2. **Myasthenia Gravis**: Despite the negative ice-pack test, the fluctuating ptosis and diplopia might initially suggest an ocular myasthenia, even as other clinical evaluations do not support fatigue-related fluctuation typical of the disease.

3. **Cavernous Sinus Syndrome**: Involving oculomotor nerve dysfunction, this syndrome can cause ptosis and ophthalmoplegia. However, typical presentations include headache and other neurological signs.

4. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome**: A rare disorder with headaches, ophthalmoplegia, and possibly ptosis. The rapid progression and pain are characteristic, though usually more common in middle-aged patients.

5. **Orbital Myositis**: T2 hyperintensity and enhancement of the extraocular muscles on MRI might suggest inflammation of the extraocular muscles, possibly involving autoimmune causes.

6. **Meningitis or Meningoencephalitis**: While the lumbar puncture was normal, the headache and other symptoms could lead to an initial suspicion of meningeal irritation or involvement.

7. **Carotid Cavernous Fistula**: The patient’s eye findings suggest possible venous congestion that could arise from such a fistula, although typical venous enlargement or redness is not reported.

8. **Sjogren’s Syndrome with Neurological Involvement**: Although primarily affecting exocrine glands, systemic involvement could manifest as neurological symptoms including cranial nerve palsies.

9. **Temporal Lobe Tumor or Lesion**: Despite a lack of direct evidence from the MRI provided, CNS lesions can present with unusual visual and muscle symptoms.

10. **Lymphoma**: Given the scalp, skull base, and soft tissue enhancement, a lymphoproliferative disorder could be causing diffuse inflammation and mass effect or infiltration.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:
1. **Giant Cell Arteritis**: Matches the age, headache, jaw claudication, elevated CRP and ESR, with improvement in ptosis being possible with initiation of steroids.
2. **Orbital Myositis**: MRI findings of extraocular muscle involvement align.
3. **Lymphoma**: Systemic presentation with diffuse tissue enhancement.
4. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome**: Can present similarly but less common.
5. **Sjogren’s Syndrome with Neurological Involvement**: Dryness symptoms absent but potential systemic effects possible.
6. **Cavernous Sinus Syndrome**: Ptosis and ophthalmoplegia present; less likely due to lack of sinus pathology.
7. **Carotid Cavernous Fistula**: Lacks clinical features of congestion.
8. **Myasthenia Gravis**: Ice-pack test negative, other tests negative, low likelihood.
9. **Temporal Lobe Tumor or Lesion**: MRI did not indicate supportive findings.
10. **Meningitis or Meningoencephalitis**: Absence of CSF abnormalities makes this unlikely.","['Neuro-ophthalmology', 'Neurology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Rheumatology', 'Geriatrics']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,75.0,F

### INPUT:
A 66-year-old African American woman presented to the otolaryngology clinic with a several-month history of severe nasal congestion. Five years before this otolaryngology evaluation, the patient developed diffuse skin plaques with erythema and was subsequently diagnosed with hypopigmented cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL, mycosis fungoides type). The patient was treated with a regimen of narrowband UV-B phototherapy and triamcinolone cream, which she has continued for 4 years. Owing to significant worsening of her symptoms 4 months before her evaluation, a biopsy of her cutaneous lesions was performed to rule out progression of CTCL (Figure 1). Physical examination demonstrated large annular plaques with peripheral hyperpigmentation of the body. There were also confluent, indurated pink plaques with slightly raised edges along the forehead, malar eminence, and scalp. The nasal septum demonstrated an inverted V deformity with compromise of the keystone junction. Nasal passages were obstructed with thick mucus and synechiae formation, nearly obstructing the entire nasal passage bilaterally.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Lepromatous leprosy,"Certainly, let's start the differential diagnosis and progressively refine it as more information is considered. 

1. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)** - Given the nasal deformities and obstruction, this could be an example of vasculitis affecting the upper airway.

2. **Sarcoidosis** - Considered due to the possibility of granulomatous infiltration affecting the nasal passages, and broader systemic involvement.

3. **Churg-Strauss Syndrome (Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)** - Considered due to possible vasculitis involving respiratory tract with tissue eosinophilia.

4. **Subcutaneous Panniculitis-like T-cell Lymphoma** - As the patient has a known CTCL and there's cutaneous involvement, another form of T-cell lymphoma could present similarly.

5. **Nasal-Type Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma** - This lymphoma is known to affect the nasal passages and could present with similar obstructive symptoms and plaques.

6. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** - While it’s an unlikely fit, SLE can cause a range of systemic and cutaneous symptoms that may mimic other diseases.

7. **Lupus Pernio** - This specific presentation of sarcoidosis involves the nose and cheeks and shares features with the described symptoms.

8. **Rhinoscleroma** - A chronic granulomatous disease that affects the mucosa of the nose and other parts of the upper respiratory tract.

9. **Relapsing Polychondritis** - Could involve cartilage structure of the nose and lead to deformity especially given the known nasal septal involvement.

10. **Leprosy (Hansen’s Disease)** - Given the plaques and possible systemic nature, this rare but possible infection could present similarly in the skin and nasal passages.

### Rerank Based on Provided Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Nasal-Type Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma** - Strong suspicion due to co-existing CTCL and specific nasal involvement.
  
2. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)** - Nasal deformation and involvement along with systemic potential.

3. **Sarcoidosis** - Fits with granuloma formation in nasal area but less likely given CTCL history.

4. **Churg-Strauss Syndrome** - Considered due to tissue eosinophilia and possible respiratory tract involvement.

5. **Subcutaneous Panniculitis-like T-cell Lymphoma** - Possible different manifestation of patient’s CTCL.

6. **Relapsing Polychondritis** - Involvement of nasal cartilage and deformity similar to description.

7. **Rhinoscleroma** - Chronic nasal presentation fits but unlikely due to co-existing lymphoma.

8. **Lupus Pernio** - While could explain nasal involvement, systemic involvement expected elsewhere.

9. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** - Broad cutaneous and systemic symptoms, unlikely primary cause.

10. **Leprosy (Hansen’s Disease)** - Rare consideration, unlikely given prevalent considerations. 

This prioritization focuses heavily on the distinctive nasal deformity and involvement in conjunction with the patient's known CTCL, taking into account potential complications or transformations of the existing lymphoma condition.","['Dermatology', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Otolaryngology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,66.0,M

### INPUT:
A 9-year-old girl was referred to a pediatric retina specialist for evaluation of changes in the peripheral retinal pigment epithelium. Ocular history included high hyperopia and amblyopia, and abnormal foveal contour was discovered when she was aged 3 years. Family history was noncontributory. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/50 in the right eye and 20/30 in the left. Pupils were round and reactive to light, and intraocular pressure and anterior segment examination were within normal limits. Dilated fundus examination revealed blunted foveal reflexes and abnormal vasculature in the inferonasal quadrant of the right eye. Fluorescein angiography displayed symmetric bilateral circular areas of hypofluorescence around the macula and irregular fovea with no leakage (Figure 1A). Color fundus photography showed symmetric bilateral mottling of the retinal pigment epithelium in the periphery (Figure 1B). Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography on initial examination showed an abnormal foveal contour with loss of the foveal pit and intraretinal cystoid cavities within the inner nuclear layer.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Congenital nanophthalmos,"To approach this case systematically, we'll develop a 10-step differential diagnosis considering the provided clinical data.

1. **Foveal Hypoplasia** - Given the abnormal foveal contour and loss of foveal pit, foveal hypoplasia is a likely consideration.

2. **Juvenile Retinoschisis** - The presence of intraretinal cystoid cavities within the inner nuclear layer suggests retinoschisis.

3. **Retinitis Pigmentosa** - Peripheral retinal pigment epithelium changes and loss of normal retinal reflexes can suggest this condition.

4. **Coats Disease** - It should be considered due to abnormal peripheral retinal vasculature.

5. **Familial Exudative Vitreoretinopathy (FEVR)** - Given the patient's age and peripheral retinal changes without severe exudation or hemorrhages.

6. **X-Linked Retinoschisis** - It can present with foveal schisis, but typically has a male predominance.

7. **Achromatopsia** - The abnormal foveal contour and lack of foveal reflexes can sometimes suggest cone dysfunctions.

8. **Oculocutaneous Albinism** - Can sometimes present with foveal hypoplasia, but no other systemic signs were mentioned.

9. **Cone-Rod Dystrophy** - Might present with central vision loss and macular changes.

10. **Stargardt Disease** - Typically presents with macular atrophy, however, it can rarely show peripheral pigment changes early.

Now, let's rank the differential diagnosis with all patient information and test results considered, from most to least likely:

1. **Foveal Hypoplasia** - The combination of abnormal foveal development and high hyperopia strongly supports this diagnosis.
2. **Juvenile Retinoschisis** - The presence of cystoid spaces in the retina fits well with this condition.
3. **Familial Exudative Vitreoretinopathy (FEVR)** - Peripheral retinal changes, even without severe exudation, should keep this in consideration.
4. **X-Linked Retinoschisis** - Despite being less common in females, retinoschisis with cystoid changes should be considered.
5. **Retinitis Pigmentosa** - Bilateral symmetrical peripheral changes can align with early stages of this hereditary retinal dystrophy.
6. **Coats Disease** - Unlikely given the lack of exudation, but vascular alterations necessitate consideration.
7. **Achromatopsia** - Less likely as significant color vision problems or nystagmus weren't highlighted.
8. **Oculocutaneous Albinism** - Can present with foveal hypoplasia, but no mention of skin or hair changes.
9. **Cone-Rod Dystrophy** - Peripheral changes less typical, generally sees more pronounced foveal or macular atrophy.
10. **Stargardt Disease** - Primarily affects the macula without the peripheral changes noted here.

The ranking aims to reflect the likelihood of these conditions based on the information provided, with strong consideration for ophthalmological diagnostic features.","['Retinal Disorders', 'Pediatrics', 'Ophthalmology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,M

### INPUT:
A 3-year-old girl presented with a vascular lesion involving the left orbit and face. She had a pink macule on her left cheek at birth, which became raised and discolored around age 3 to 4 weeks. She was diagnosed with a capillary hemangioma, and propranolol was started at age 1 month with progression despite dosage increases. Topical timolol was tried without improvement; oral prednisolone decreased the size of the lesion, but was poorly tolerated and discontinued. An ophthalmic evaluation at an outside hospital was concerning for amblyopia because of anisohypermetropia, greater on the left, and a left esotropia and hypertropia. A magnetic resonance image revealed an orbital mass surrounding the left lateral rectus muscle with mass effect on the globe and extension into the eyelid, pterygopalatine fossa, and cheek. Given the risk of amblyopia, the patient underwent 2 embolization and debulking procedures of the orbital and cheek components of the lesion, which were positive for glucose transporter 1 on pathology. However, the esotropia abruptly worsened after the second debulking. At age 3 years, she presented to the clinic with a persistent cheek and orbit lesion, dense amblyopia, large-angle monocular esotropia and hypertropia, and proptosis of the left eye. The left extraocular muscle showed inability to abduct past midline (Figure 1A). A repeated magnetic resonance image showed persistent orbital involvement causing medial displacement of the lateral rectus muscle and mass effect on the globe (Figure 1B).

6. Neuroblastoma metastasis to the orbit
7. Infantile fibrosarcoma
8. Vascular malformation (non-specific type)
9. Orbital cellulitis
10. Venous malformation

### Final Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. Vascular malformation (non-specific type) - Given the initial presentation and the lack of response to typical treatments for infantile hemangiomas, as well as results from invasive procedures.
2. Capillary hemangioma - Initially diagnosed and treatments were based on this hypothesis.
3. Venous malformation - Given the extent of involvement and mass effect, might represent a vascular anomaly.
4. Arteriovenous malformation - Considered due to the complexity and involvement of orbital structures.
5. Lymphatic malformation - Based on the presentation and resistance to common hemangioma treatments.
6. Orbital rhabdomyosarcoma - Due to its aggressive nature and potential for rapid and severe presentation.
7. Infantile fibrosarcoma - Given the lack of definitive response to usual management.
8. Orbital teratoma - Due to its potential presentation as a complex mass.
9. Neuroblastoma metastasis to the orbit - Although less likely, mets could explain some presentation aspects.
10. Orbital cellulitis - Least likely due to chronic nature rather than acute, but initial consideration due to orbital involvement.","['Dermatology', 'Pediatrics', 'Cutaneous Vascular Malformations', 'External Eye Disease', 'Ophthalmology']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.0,M

A 59-year-old elementary school principal with a history of cholecystectomy and appendectomy and no use of alcohol, illicit drugs, or cigarettes presented to the emergency department for the fourth time in 3 months with diffuse abdominal pain not associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, hematochezia, weight loss, fever, or anorexia. On physical examination, the patient had normal vital signs, mild diffuse abdominal tenderness without rebound or guarding, and bluish pigmentation along her gingival margin (Figure, panel A). Blood testing showed alanine aminotransferase level 51 U/L (0.85 μkat/L; reference range, 7-23 U/L [0.12-0.38 μkat/L]), aspartate aminotransaminase 68 U/L (1.14 μkat/L; reference range, 13-30 U/L [0.22-0.50 μkat/L]), total bilirubin 3.2 mg/dL (54.73 μmol/L; reference range, 0.4-1.5 mg/dL [6.84-25.66 μmol/L]) and direct bilirubin 0.9 mg/dL (15.39 μmol/L; reference range, 0.0-0.4 mg/dL [0.0-6.84 μmol/L]). Hemoglobin level was 8.7 g/dL with a normal mean corpuscular volume, and ferritin level was 637.9 ng/mL (reference range, 39.9-465 ng/mL). Blood testing revealed normal lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin, iron, vitamin B12, folate, zinc, and copper levels, and results of urinalysis were normal. A peripheral blood smear demonstrated small, bluish-purple punctate inclusions in erythrocytes (Figure, panel B). Results of upper and lower endoscopy and abdominal-pelvic computed tomography performed within the past 3 months were unremarkable.

The presence of bluish-purple punctate inclusions in erythrocytes (basophilic stippling), along with bluish pigmentation of her gingival margin and history of repeated diffuse abdominal pain, strongly suggest lead poisoning as the most likely diagnosis. Additionally, slightly elevated liver enzymes and anemia further support this. Other conditions such as hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease were considered due to liver involvement and systemic features, but the specific peripheral blood smear findings and gingival pigmentation most specifically align with lead poisoning.","['Complementary and Alternative Medicine', 'Gastroenterology', 'Hematology', 'Toxicology', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,59.0,M

### INPUT:
A 50-year-old woman was referred for ophthalmoplegia that developed immediately after an 8.5-hour robotic cystectomy for small cell cancer of the bladder. After recovering from anesthesia in the postanesthesia care unit, she experienced headache, facial numbness, inability to open both her eyes, and inability to move both eyes in any direction. She had a known enhancing central skull base lesion in sella turcica with compression of the optic chiasm and mild mass effect on the pons that was felt to be a pituitary macroadenoma (Figure). Her baseline examination before the cystectomy showed visual acuity of 20/20 OU with intact extraocular movements and unremarkable confrontational fields, although a mild bitemporal hemianopia was seen on automated visual fields.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pituitary apoplexy,"1. **Postoperative ischemic stroke** - Consider this as the initial differential due to the sudden onset of neurological symptoms following a lengthy surgical procedure.
   
2. **Pituitary apoplexy** - Given the known pituitary macroadenoma, sudden hemorrhage or infarction within the pituitary gland leading to compression of surrounding structures could explain the acute presentation.

3. **Central nervous system infection** - Although less likely given the presentation, a postoperative CNS infection could present with acute neurological deficits.

4. **Cerebral vasospasm** - Sudden reduction in cerebral arterial blood flow due to spasm, possibly induced by surgery stress, could lead to acute neurological changes.

5. **Neuromuscular blockade-related issues** - Residual effects of anesthesia, particularly neuromuscular blockers, might cause temporary ophthalmoplegia.

6. **Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)** - A rare condition that could present post-surgery with neurological symptoms among its pentad.

7. **Basilar artery thrombosis** - This can lead to symptoms consistent with loss of eye movement control and facial numbness.

8. **Ophthalmic artery embolism** - Sudden loss of blood flow to ocular structures could result in vision and eye movement deficits.

9. **Brainstem glioma** - Although she has a known skull base lesion, a glioma affecting the brainstem could cause similar acute symptoms.

10. **Myasthenia gravis** - While unlikely to present so acutely or post-surgery for the first time, it could cause ophthalmoplegia and weakness.

### Reranked 10-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Pituitary apoplexy** - Most likely due to the known lesion compressing crucial structures following surgery.
2. **Postoperative ischemic stroke** - Given the surgical context and sudden neurological changes.
3. **Basilar artery thrombosis** - Acute presentation with loss of eye movements aligns with this vascular issue.
4. **Cerebral vasospasm** - Potential complication after major surgeries.
5. **Neuromuscular blockade-related issues** - Immediate post-surgical phase could feature anesthesia effects.
6. **Brainstem glioma** - Based on symptoms and imaging, but new onset less likely.
7. **Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura** - Rare, but a potential postoperative complication.

### INPUT:
A 9-year-old boy was referred to the pediatric retina service to evaluate progressive vision loss. His medical history included neonatal seizures. He was initially evaluated at an outside institution and was found to have bilateral symmetric vision loss with nyctalopia. The onset of the symptoms was unknown. At that time, his best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/70 OU. The patient did not receive any ophthalmological care until 2 years later, when he was seen for marked vision loss and was noted to have a BCVA of light perception in both eyes. When he presented to the pediatric retina service, he demonstrated poor mentation and was unable to recall simple things such as the name of his siblings. His BCVA was light perception. His pupils were round and reactive. The anterior segment examination and intraocular pressures were within normal limits. Fundus autofluorescence disclosed attenuated, narrow vasculature and diffuse peripheral patchy hypoautofluorescence (Figure 1A). Color fundus photography showed optic disc pallor, attenuated retinal vasculature, prominent choroidal markings, and central retinal atrophy with diffusely mottled pigmentation (Figure 1B). Optical coherence tomography displayed decreased retinal thickness, more prominent in the inner layers, and hyper-reflective dots in the outer retinal layers. Family history included unilateral vision loss in his paternal grandmother in her late 20s. Both parents were healthy and denied consanguinity. The patient has 3 half brothers, all of whom are healthy.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps

1. **Leber's Congenital Amaurosis (LCA)** - Given the progressive vision loss from a young age along with nyctalopia, this is a potential early onset retinal degenerative condition.

2. **Batten Disease (Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis)** - Considering the poor mentation, neonatal seizures, and rapid vision decline, Batten Disease is possible.

3. **Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP)** - The examination showing narrowed vasculature and retinal atrophy along with nyctalopia can suggest Retinitis Pigmentosa.

4. **Alstrom Syndrome** - This syndrome comes with a variety of symptoms including obesity and hearing loss, but also retinal degeneration similar to the description.

5. **Stargardt's Disease** - Though typically presenting with slightly older individuals, central retinal atrophy and family history may imply consideration for Stargardt's.

6. **Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis** - A form of Batten Disease more focused on retinal and neurological symptoms in early childhood.

7. **Doyne Honeycomb Retinal Dystrophy** - Generally presents with retinal degeneration, but progression is usually slower than depicted. 

8. **Kearns-Sayre Syndrome** - Mitochondrial disorder characterized by ophthalmoplegia, retinal degeneration, and poor neurological function.

9. **Cone-Rod Dystrophy** - Vision loss typically begins in childhood and progresses through adulthood; it includes retinal dystrophy.

10. **Fundus Albipunctatus** - An innate condition manifesting with nyctalopia due to rod and cone dysfunctions leading to retinal degeneration.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Batten Disease (Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis)** - Given the combination of poor mental function, seizures, and rapid retinal degeneration, this seems highly plausible.
   
2. **Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis** - Specifically aligns with both neurological and retinal symptoms described, ranking highly due to patient’s age and recurrent symptoms.

3. **Leber's Congenital Amaurosis (LCA)** - Early onset and strong retinal degeneration symptoms make it still relevant.

4. **Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP)** - Nyctalopia and familial pattern retention, though less likely with the neurological plight.

5. **Kearns-Sayre Syndrome** - This remains more relevant due to potential mitochondrial links with neurological symptoms.

6. **Cone-Rod Dystrophy** - Supports retinal details well, though the rapid neurological decline shifts this lower.

7. **Alstrom Syndrome** - Another potential systemic syndrome with ocular symptoms, but not all features align.

8. **Stargardt’s Disease** - Less likely due to age and distinct fundus characteristics.

9. **Doyne Honeycomb Retinal Dystrophy** - Unlikely due to age and existing rapid decline.

10. **Fundus Albipunctatus** - Considered less likely because the primary issue is retinal cysts rather than retinal and cognitive degeneration.

### INPUT:
A 67-year-old woman presented to her primary care physician with new-onset pain and erythema of her left eye and left ear, cough for 1 month, and a 9-kg weight loss over the past 3 months. Twelve months prior, she experienced a self-limited episode of right eye pain and redness, and 2 months later, a similar episode occurred in her left eye. She reported no fevers, chills, headaches, visual changes, hearing loss, hoarseness, shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain, arthralgias, or rash. Physical examination revealed normal vital signs, and no abnormalities on nasal, cardiopulmonary, joint, and skin examination. Her left eye had scleral erythema, and the cartilaginous portion of her left ear was swollen and erythematous (Figure).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Relapsing polychondritis,"1. **Relapsing Polychondritis** - The presence of recurrent ear and eye inflammation suggests this autoimmune disorder affecting cartilaginous structures.

2. **Wegener’s Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis)** - The combination of ocular symptoms, ear involvement, respiratory complaints, and weight loss could indicate this vasculitic condition.

3. **Sarcoidosis** - This granulomatous disease can present with systemic symptoms and ocular, respiratory involvement.

4. **Churg-Strauss Syndrome (Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)** - Upper and lower respiratory tract involvement combined with systemic symptoms fits, although typically with more allergic or asthma symptoms.

5. **Scleritis** - Relapsing episodes of eye pain and redness point towards this severe inflammatory condition of the sclera.

6. **Crohn’s Disease** - Extrapulmonary manifestations like eye involvement can occur, typically with gastrointestinal symptoms.

7. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** - Multisystem autoimmune disorder often affecting joints, skin, kidneys but can also present with these systemic symptoms.

8. **Behçet’s Disease** - Characterized by recurrent oral and genital ulcers, along with eye inflammation and possible systemic symptoms.

9. **Polymyalgia Rheumatica** - Typically causes proximal muscle pain but in rare cases may present atypically with systemic symptoms.

10. **Giant Cell Arteritis** - Primarily a disease of large vessels, but could present with systemic symptoms and often associated with eye involvement.

### Ranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Relapsing Polychondritis** - Strongest match given recurrent ear and eye inflammation with sparing of other systems commonly affected in this condition.
2. **Wegener’s Granulomatosis** - Relevant due to respiratory symptoms and possible systemic vasculitic involvement.
3. **Sarcoidosis** - Plausible due to potential for systemic involvement, but less likely without more classic signs.
4. **Scleritis** - Highly relevant ocular symptom, though would not explain full systemic presentation.
5. **Churg-Strauss Syndrome** - Possible, though respiratory symptoms and systemic involvement not as classically presented.
6. **Behçet’s Disease** - Systemic symptoms can fit, but lacks hallmark mucosal ulcerations needed for stronger suspicion.
7. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus** - Unlikely without other common signs like rash or arthralgias.
8. **Crohn’s Disease** - Possible, engaging extrapulmonary manifestation, but unlikely without GI symptoms.
9. **Polymyalgia Rheumatica** - Systemic symptoms and age fit, though typical musculoskeletal symptoms are absent.
10. **Giant Cell Arteritis** - Low probability due to lack of common presenting features like jaw claudication or high ESR.","['Ophthalmology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Rheumatology', 'Otology', 'Geriatrics']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,67.0,M

### INPUT:
An 88-year-old man presented with persistent subretinal fluid (SRF) and enlarging pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs) in each eye following 32 near monthly injections of anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Ocular history included presumed exudative age-related macular degeneration. Central serous chorioretinopathy was also suspected secondary to the presence of yellow subretinal deposits located within an inferior macular detachment in the right eye. Visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/25 OS. He had pseudophakia with an otherwise normal anterior segment examination in each eye. Fundus examination was remarkable for macular PEDs and SRF in each eye. There was an epiretinal membrane in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) in the right eye disclosed a central PED with SRF that extended beyond the inferior border of the PED (Figure, A). Hyperreflective foci, suggestive of vitelliform material, were visible on the photoreceptors. OCT in the left eye demonstrated 2 PEDs in the parafovea (Figure, B). SRF was present with overlying thickening of the photoreceptors. The choroid was thin in each eye. Fluorescein angiography revealed punctate hyperfluorescent staining within the body of the PEDs in each eye. There was no evidence of leakage in either eye. Fundus autofluorescence displayed dispersed, speckled hyperautofluorescence corresponding to the potential vitelliform material and SRF in the right eye. Review of the autofluorescence 3 years prior revealed boat-shaped hyperautofluorescence located in the most inferior aspect of the SRF in the right eye.

### INPUT:
A White woman in her 70s with a medical history notable only for mitral valve repair was incidentally found to have cervical lymphadenopathy on magnetic resonance imaging while undergoing workup for shoulder pain. A fine-needle biopsy of an enlarged left-sided cervical lymph node yielded benign results. One month later, she presented to a local emergency department with diffuse abdominal pain. Symptoms began 6 weeks earlier and had been intermittent in nature. She had also experienced fatigue, night sweats, decreased appetite, and weight loss for 6 weeks. She otherwise denied having fevers, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or easy bruising. Physical examination revealed bilateral cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymphadenopathy in addition to mild diffuse abdominal pain. Laboratory results revealed a hemoglobin level of 13.1 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10), a white blood cell count of 6.4 × 103/μL, and a platelet count of 404 × 103/μL (to convert to × 109/L, multiply by 1) in addition to negative results for HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C assays. Additional workup results were notable for elevated levels of interleukin (IL) 10 (1091 pg/mL), IL-6 (3.1 pg/mL), C-reactive protein (4.9 mg/dL [to convert to mg/L, multiply by 10]), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (79 mm/h). A computed tomography scan of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis further revealed extensive cervical, supraclavicular, retroperitoneal, pelvic, and inguinal lymphadenopathy, with extensive inflammation and fat stranding adjacent to these enlarged nodes. Positron emission tomography–computed tomography further demonstrated fluorodeoxyglucose-avid lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm. The patient then underwent excisional biopsy of an enlarged right cervical lymph node (Figure).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Multicentric Castleman disease,"1. **Lymphoma** - Given the widespread lymphadenopathy, B symptoms (fatigue, night sweats, weight loss), and imaging findings, lymphoma is a top differential.

2. **Castleman Disease** - The elevated IL-6 and IL-10 levels, along with generalized lymphadenopathy, are suggestive of Castleman Disease.

3. **Chronic Infections (e.g., Tuberculosis)** - Despite negative common viral screenings, chronic infections can cause diffuse lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms.

4. **Sarcoidosis** - Often presents with lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms such as fatigue and weight loss.

5. **Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome** - Although rare, it may present similarly with lymphoproliferation and cytokine dysregulation.

6. **Adult Onset Still's Disease** - Characterized by systemic symptoms, lymphadenopathy, elevated inflammatory markers, and increased cytokines.

7. **Metastatic Cancer** - Particularly in older adults, unexplained lymphadenopathy could indicate a malignancy of unknown primary origin.

8. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** - Can present with lymphadenopathy and elevated inflammatory markers.

9. **Hyper-IgD Syndrome** - Involves recurrent febrile episodes, elevated inflammatory markers, and lymphadenopathy.

10. **IgG4-Related Disease** - Although less common, it can cause lymphadenopathy and an inflammatory response.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Lymphoma** - Based on the constellation of symptoms, imaging, and general presentation, lymphoma remains the most likely diagnosis.
   
2. **Castleman Disease** - The elevated cytokine levels and extensive lymphadenopathy continue to support this possibility.

3. **Metastatic Cancer** - Age factor and nonspecific lymphadenopathy may suggest malignancy until ruled out.

4. **Sarcoidosis** - Increased considering systemic involvement and could explain lymphadenopathy and symptoms.

5. **Chronic Infections (e.g., Tuberculosis)** - Remains on the list due to potential for atypical presentations.

6. **Adult Onset Still's Disease** - Less likely without characteristic fever patterns, but still considerations due to elevated inflammatory markers.

7. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** - Less likely, but remains a differential due to inflammatory presentation.

8. **IgG4-Related Disease** - Low probability but included due to systemic involvement.

9. **Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome** - Rare but fit within ""last-resort"" differentials due to symptoms overlap.

10. **Hyper-IgD Syndrome** - Unlikely without recurrent febrile episodes but considered in the context of elevated cytokines.","['Geriatrics', 'Hematology', 'Oncology', 'Hematologic Cancer']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,70.0,M

### INPUT:
A man in his 40s presented with painful erythematous plaques on his trunk (Figure, A). Skin lesions developed 2 months earlier and progressively spread. He reported abdominal discomfort, weight loss, and bleeding. A solid mass on his lower abdomen that had been palpable about 10 years prior had rapidly increased in size within the past few months. Physical examination revealed erythematous plaques on the right chest and flank without warmth. Punch biopsy of a lesion from the chest was sent for histopathological examination (Figure, B and C).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Metastatic carcinoma,"To create a differential diagnosis, we will consider the clinical presentation, including the skin lesions, abdominal discomfort, weight loss, bleeding, and the rapidly growing abdominal mass. Here are the differential diagnoses in a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma** - Given the presence of erythematous plaques on the skin, which are common in cutaneous lymphomas.

2. **Basal Cell Carcinoma with Metastasis** - A consideration given the skin lesions and possible internal mass, although less common for such widespread systemic symptoms.

3. **Kaposi's Sarcoma** - Erythematous skin lesions and abdominal tumors can be indicative, especially in immunocompromised individuals.

4. **Liposarcoma** - The presence of a palpable abdominal mass growing rapidly suggests this possible soft tissue sarcoma.

5. **Neurofibromatosis Type I** - Given the history of a previously palpable mass, this genetic disorder can lead to cutaneous neurofibromas and subcutaneous tumors.

6. **Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)** - Could explain the abdominal discomfort, mass, weight loss, and bleeding due to tumor growth.

7. **Adenocarcinoma with Cutaneous Metastases** - These can present as skin lesions assosciated with internal malignancies.

8. **Melanoma with Metastasis** - Melanoma can metastasize to various body parts, accounting for systemic symptoms and skin manifestations.

9. **Polycythemia Vera** - This myeloproliferative neoplasm can cause erythromelalgia (painful, red skin lesions), splenomegaly, and systemic symptoms.

10. **Leukemia Cutis** - This can manifest as skin plaques and be associated with systemic hematologic malignancy symptoms.

To rerank the differential diagnosis using all patient information and test results, including the histopathological findings, we will consider the most likely diseases based on the presentation given.

1. **Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)** - The combination of abdominal mass, progressive enlargement, discomfort, weight loss, and bleeding closely aligns with GIST.

2. **Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma** - The erythematous plaques with systemic symptoms including lymphadenopathy and systemic involvement make this a strong possibility.

3. **Leukemia Cutis** - Skin manifestations along with systemic symptoms like bleeding and weight loss suggest hematologic malignancy.

4. **Kaposi's Sarcoma** - Given the skin presentation and potential for systemic involvement; this remains a significant differential.

5. **Adenocarcinoma with Cutaneous Metastases** - Considering the potential internal malignancy and skin lesions.

6. **Neurofibromatosis Type I** - While less likely, cannot be ruled out given past history of a mass.

7. **Melanoma with Metastasis** - Skin lesions with rapid progression could suggest underlying melanoma; though not as likely, it must be considered.

8. **Liposarcoma** - Rapidly enlarging abdominal mass fits this profile, though less common with systemic and skin findings.

9. **Basal Cell Carcinoma with Metastasis** - Unlikely due to the nature of basal cell carcinoma's typical lack of aggressive systemic spread.

10. **Polycythemia Vera** - Least likely given the predominant presentation of systemic malignancy and skin changes not typical of PV.

### INPUT:
A woman aged 44 years was referred for progressive parkinsonism with poor levodopa response. Her medical history comprised unexplained sensory hearing loss, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis. At age 23 years, she had bilateral cataract surgery, and over the last 2 years, she developed worsening stiffness and walking difficulties with frequent falls. She reported features of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome (RLS), visual daytime hallucinations, and rapid cognitive decline. She was given levodopa/benserazide (up to 200 mg/50 mg 4 times daily) without improvement on her Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale scores. Therefore, her dopaminergic medication was ceased. Family history was negative for movement or developmental disorders. Her neurologic examination showed hypomimia, symmetrical bradykinesia, and rigidity of the extremities without tremors (Video). There was full range of eye movements with large-amplitude saccadic intrusions on smooth pursuit in all directions. Neuropsychological assessment revealed significant abnormalities in cognitive functioning, affecting verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills (ie, speed of information processing, visuospatial skills, verbal and visual memory loss, executive skills). Mini-Mental Status Examination score was 26 of 30 points. Systemic examination was unremarkable. Laboratory and cerebral spinal fluid testing (ie, paraneoplastic antibodies Hu, Yo, Ri, CV2, Ma2, amphiphysin, glutamic acid decarboxylase, N-methyl-d-aspartic acid, LGI1, and Caspr2, 14-3-3 protein) were normal. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed mild frontal and parietal atrophy. An electroencephalogram demonstrated slowing in keeping with moderate generalized encephalopathy. Total-body positron emission tomography (PET) using fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) as a tracer showed no FDG-avid lesions; however, a subsequent brain-specific FDG-PET/MRI revealed hypometabolism throughout the left cerebral hemisphere and crossed cerebellar diaschisis (Figure 1). As the patient’s cognitive function and parkinsonism had deteriorated rapidly, a brain biopsy of the left frontal cortex was done. Immunohistochemistry showed scattered globular inclusions consistent with Lewy bodies.

### INPUT:
A 53-year-old man presented to the emergency department after awakening with right preauricular and right upper neck swelling. He had a history of coronary artery disease and prior myocardial infarction that was treated with warfarin. He denied any personal or family history of cancer. He was previously briefly a smoker. A physical examination revealed no erythema or tenderness of the parotid. His cranial nerves were intact, specifically the right facial nerve and its branches. The oral mucosa was intact with no epithelial lesions. Urinalysis results revealed slight hematuria. His international normalized ratio (INR) was 4.4. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed an ill-defined infiltrative mass centered in the deep lobe of the right parotid with extension into surrounding soft tissue spaces (Figure, A). A follow-up CT was performed 6 weeks later (Figure, B).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Parotid gland hemorrhage,"Sure, let's conduct a step-by-step differential diagnosis:

1. **Salivary Gland Tumor** - Considering the location (right preauricular and parotid swelling), an ill-defined mass in the parotid is suggestive of a possible salivary gland tumor.
   
2. **Benign Lymphoepithelial Lesion** - Given the swelling without pain or erythema and excellent facial nerve function, a benign lymphoepithelial lesion could be considered.

3. **Chronic Sialadenitis** - Chronic inflammation of the salivary glands could present similarly, although the lack of tenderness makes acute infectious causes less likely.

4. **Warfarin-Associated Hematoma** - With increased INR and history of warfarin use, warfarin-associated hematoma is possible despite the atypical presentation for temporal hematomas.

5. **Metastatic Disease to Parotid** - The extension into surrounding soft tissue spaces raises the possibility of metastatic disease, though there is no history of primary cancer.

6. **Lymphoma** - Lymphoid tissues are part of the differential in parotid masses, and lymphoma could fit the presentation with ill-defined infiltrative changes on imaging.

7. **Hemangioma or Vascular Malformation** - Although less common at this adult age, vascular malformations could present as a mass.

8. **Sarcoidosis** - This systemic condition can involve the parotid and could present with such symptoms, though the age and ethanol use history point away, given no systemic symptoms.

9. **Warthin's Tumor** - Known to occur in male smokers and can cause painless swellings in the parotid.

10. **Tuberculosis (TB) Lymphadenitis** - Though less common, in cases of cervical masses, TB should be ruled out, especially with systemic involvement history.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Warfarin-Associated Hematoma** - The high INR and warfarin combines with the location could cause a hematoma.
2. **Salivary Gland Tumor** - A significant possibility due to location.
3. **Lymphoma** - Needs to be ruled out due to patient age.
4. **Benign Lymphoepithelial Lesion** - Less common but consistent with swelling in that area.
5. **Warthin's Tumor** - Could be consistent with the presentation due to smoking history.
6. **Metastatic Disease to Parotid** - Despite lack of primary cancer history, must consider given mass behavior.
7. **Chronic Sialadenitis** - Inflammatory processes need triggers; INR result suggests a higher index for hematoma.
8. **Sarcoidosis** - Multisystem evaluation could aid, despite age not common.
9. **Hemangioma or Vascular Malformation** - Less likely at this presentation age.
10. **Tuberculosis (TB) Lymphadenitis** - Unlikely given no systemic symptoms or TB history.","['Salivary Gland Disorders', 'Anticoagulation', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Otolaryngology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,53.0,F

An 18-year-old female presented to the primary care physician with a 4-month history of a slowly progressive painless lateral neck mass on the right side. The patient denied any history of dysphagia, dysphonia, drainage, previous neck surgery, trauma, or recent fever. There was no significant medical or family history of thyroid disease. On examination, the mass moved with swallowing. The patient had normal thyroid stimulating hormone and calcium levels and a parathyroid hormone (PTH) level of 63 pg/mL. Neck ultrasonography revealed a well-circumscribed anechoic lesion with a diameter of 5.9 cm in the right thyroid lobe without any internal solid nodularity or septation. A neck computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an intrathyroidal lesion extending inferiorly to 3 cm above the angle of Louis causing tracheal compression and displacement (Figure, A). The patient underwent right hemithyroidectomy to relieve tracheal compression. A near-infrared autofluorescence (NIRAF) camera yielded a homogenously dim lesion (Figure, B). Pathologic examination confirmed a normal right thyroid lobe, a normal right parathyroid gland, and a cystic lesion at the inferior pole with no evidence of malignant disease in the specimen.

Visual acuity was 20/20 OU, with briskly reactive pupils OU and no relative afferent pupillary defect. Intraocular pressure was 17 mm Hg OU. Ishihara color plates were 13/13 OU. Extraocular movements were full. Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed blurring and elevation of the nasal margins of the optic disc consistent with grade 1 optic disc edema in both eyes (Figure). Optical coherence tomography showed an elevated mean peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness of 170 μm OD and 150 μm OS. Automated visual fields demonstrated subtle enlargement of the blind spots.

### INPUT:
A 24-year-old man presented with a 3-week history of sudden onset of headache, nausea, and binocular vertical diplopia. He denied any other neurologic symptoms. His medical history included untreated hyperprolactinemia. He did not take any medications, smoke, or drink alcohol. On examination, visual acuity was 20/20 in each eye. There was no relative afferent pupillary defect. There was minimal limitation in infraduction in the left eye with corresponding left hypertropia (Video), which was worse in left gaze and right head tilt. Ophthalmoscopy findings were normal in each eye. Visual field findings (Humphrey 24-2 algorithm) were normal in each eye as well.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pituitary apoplexy,"1. **Pituitary adenoma** - Considering the patient's history of untreated hyperprolactinemia and symptoms of headache and diplopia.
2. **Cavernous sinus syndrome** - Sudden onset of ocular symptoms could be related to a lesion affecting the cranial nerves within the cavernous sinus.
3. **Tolosa-Hunt syndrome** - Sudden onset of painful ophthalmoplegia could be indicative of this syndrome characterized by inflammation of the cavernous sinus.
4. **Myasthenia gravis** - Binocular diplopia with muscle weakness, though less likely given the presentation is primarily vertical diplopia.
5. **Thyroid eye disease** - Unlikely without other signs, but can cause diplopia and limitation of ocular motility.
6. **Fourth nerve palsy** - The presence of vertical diplopia and compensatory head tilt supports this possibility, despite lack of trauma history.
7. **Intracranial hemorrhage** - Sudden onset headache raises concern for bleeding, although normal ophthalmic exam argues against it being severe.
8. **Migraine with brainstem aura** - Can present with headache and diplopia, albeit usually transient.
9. **Cluster headache** - Severe headache with some autonomic features, but diplopia is not typically primary.
10. **Multiple sclerosis** - While young age and visual symptoms are concerning, diplopia being vertical is less common for MS-related internuclear ophthalmoplegia.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Pituitary adenoma** - Consistent with untreated hyperprolactinemia and potential mass effect causing diplopia.
2. **Fourth nerve palsy** - Best fits the diplopia presentation and head tilt, often idiopathic or due to microvascular issues in young adults.
3. **Cavernous sinus syndrome** - Comprehensive explanation for the cranial nerve involvement causing diplopia and linked symptoms.
4. **Tolosa-Hunt syndrome** - Considerable due to the sudden and painful ophthalmoplegia.
5. **Intracranial hemorrhage** - Remains a critical concern given sudden headache but less likely without neurological deficit.
6. **Thyroid eye disease** - Uncommon in this specific acute presentation but possible with minimal motility involvement.
7. **Migraine with brainstem aura** - Potential explanation considering headache and episodic motor symptoms.
8. **Cluster headache** - Could explain headaches but less likely given the visual symptoms profile.
9. **Multiple sclerosis** - Low likelihood based on lesion placement for this specific symptom set.
10. **Myasthenia gravis** - Less convincing given the focal limitation and lack of other significant muscle weakness.","['Endocrinology', 'Neuro-ophthalmology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Radiology', 'Diabetes and Endocrinology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,F

### INPUT:
A 51-year-old man was referred for evaluation of headache, right-side jaw pain, paresthesia, and trismus. The patient reported that the facial and jaw symptoms had evolved gradually over the past 5 years and that multiple medical therapies had provided only minimal relief of pain. The patient’s medical history included anxiety, depression, emphysema, hyperlipidemia, migraines, and pseudoseizures. He denied prior head trauma and had no pertinent surgical history. On physical examination, the patient had normal body habitus and reported bilateral tenderness of the temporomandibular joints and paresthesia of the right trigeminal nerve in the V2 and V3 distribution with intact masseteric nerve and symmetric facial nerve. Audiometric evaluation showed normal hearing bilaterally. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a cystic mass in the right side of infratemporal fossa (ITF) that was nonenhancing on T1 sequencing with contrast and hyperintense on T2 (Figure 1A).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Encephalocele,"1. **Trigeminal Neuralgia**  
   - Characterized by facial pain and sensory abnormalities in the trigeminal nerve distribution.

2. **Temporomandibular Joint Disorder (TMJD)**  
   - Bilateral tenderness and trismus may indicate TMJ involvement.

3. **Infratemporal Fossa Tumor**  
   - MRI findings of a cystic mass in ITF suggest a possible benign or malignant tumor.

4. **Eagle Syndrome**  
   - Can cause facial pain due to elongated styloid process pressing on nerves.

5. **Facial Nerve Schwannoma**  
   - Tumor could involve the facial nerve causing paresthesia and trismus.

6. **Cystic Lesion (e.g., Mucocele or Arachnoid Cyst)**

### INPUT:
A 12-year-old boy with an unremarkable medical and ocular history was admitted for workup of anemia (hemoglobin, 6.7 g/dL; to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10) and leukopenia (white blood cell count, 1220 cells/μL; to convert to ×10^9 cells per liter, multiply by 0.001) with associated symptoms of headache, malaise, recent cough, and fever. Inflammatory markers were elevated with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 130 mm/h and a C-reactive protein level of 1.48 mg/dL (to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10). The patient noted floaters in his right eye, which prompted an ophthalmology consultation. On bedside examination, his near visual acuity was J1+ (Snellen equivalent, 20/20 OU), and color vision was full in both eyes; the patient’s intraocular pressure, pupils, extraocular movements, and confrontational visual fields were all unremarkable. Dilated examination revealed grade I and II optic disc edema in the right and left eyes, respectively, and peripapillary hemorrhage in the right eye. Optical coherence tomography was obtained 3 days after initial consultation, which confirmed bilateral disc edema, more pronounced in the left eye than the right eye (Figure 1), and 24-2 Humphrey visual field examination in both eyes was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits with and without contrast and lumbar puncture were obtained, and results showed diffuse signal abnormality in the bone marrow compartment and findings suggestive of papilledema. Magnetic resonance venography did not reveal thrombosis. Opening pressure during lumbar puncture was 37 cm H2O (upper limit of normal, 28 cm H2O); all cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) viral serology test results were negative, and glucose level and red and white blood cell counts were all within normal limits. CSF protein was slightly decreased at 10.4 mg/dL, and CSF cytospin findings were unremarkable.
### OUTPUT:
    ",B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"To diagnose the 12-year-old boy's condition, we will examine the clinical presentation and test results, considering one differential diagnosis at each step:

1. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH)**: Symptoms such as headache, optic disc edema, and elevated opening pressure on lumbar puncture could suggest IIH.

2. **Leukemia**: Considering the anemia, leukopenia, and diffuse bone marrow abnormality on MRI, leukemia must be considered.

3. **Aplastic Anemia**: The combination of anemia, leukopenia, and the bone marrow findings may suggest aplastic anemia.

4. **Anemia of Chronic Disease**: Given the anemia and elevated inflammatory markers, anemia of chronic disease could be a possibility.

5. **Infectious Mononucleosis**: Symptoms like fever, malaise, and elevated inflammatory markers might suggest an infectious process like mononucleosis.

6. **Vasculitis**: Elevated inflammatory markers and systemic symptoms could point toward systemic vasculitis.

7. **Megaloblastic Anemia**: Given the anemia and potential bone marrow issues, megaloblastic anemia could be considered.

8. **Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)**: The hematologic findings could be consistent with CML.

9. **Iron Deficiency Anemia**: Common anemia causes might point towards iron deficiency, despite unusual test results.

10. **Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia**: Anemia with systemic symptoms might indicate autoimmune components. 

Finally, by considering all the information and test results, we rerank the differential diagnoses: 

1. **Leukemia**: Due to the combination of hematological abnormalities and bone marrow changes.
2. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH)**: Explains the intracranial pressure and optic disc edema.
3. **Aplastic Anemia**: Fits with the hematological findings.
4. **Megaloblastic Anemia**: Can also cause bone marrow signal changes.
5. **Vasculitis**: Given the systemic inflammatory response.
6. **Iron Deficiency Anemia**: Possible despite being less fitting.
7. **Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)**: Less likely due to age.
8. **Anemia of Chronic Disease**: Fits with chronic inflammation.
9. **Infectious Mononucleosis**: Negative CSF serology makes this less likely.
10. **Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia**: Other indicators point to different diagnoses.","['Oncology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Leukemias', 'Neuro-ophthalmology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,12.0,F

### INPUT:
A 64-year-old woman presented to the otolaryngology clinic with hoarseness of voice for 3 weeks associated with intermittent dry cough. She had no medical history or family history of cancer and was not a smoker. In the absence of other suggestive symptoms, as well as a normal physical examination that did not reveal any enlarged cervical lymph nodes or oropharyngeal or neck mass and an unremarkable nasoendoscopic examination, a diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux was made. The patient was advised to try conservative management with dietary advice and proton pump inhibitors, and a clinical review was scheduled in 6 weeks. The patient only returned 3 months later when her hoarseness became worse. Repeat nasoendoscopy now showed left vocal cord palsy in the paramedian position. In the absence of a history of trauma and associated neurological or systemic symptoms, the main concern was an underlying tumor that impinged on the vagus nerve at various points or its recurrent branch. Results of a computed tomographic (CT) scan showed an ill-defined soft tissue mass, which was likely nodal disease, at the left supraclavicular (Figure 1), as well as the prevertebral and paravertebral region, which partially encased the left common carotid, left subclavian, and left vertebral arteries. This was along the expected course of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve and likely accounted for the left vocal cord palsy. However, the primary site of disease remained unclear. A fused positron emission tomography with CT (PET/CT) scan with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) tracer was then performed.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Metastatic colon cancer,"1. **Laryngeal Cancer:** Given the vocal cord palsy and the risk of malignancy, laryngeal cancer is a primary concern.
   
2. **Lung Cancer:** Considering the location of the mass along the recurrent laryngeal nerve, lung cancer, especially a Pancoast tumor, could be a potential diagnosis.
   
3. **Thyroid Cancer:** The region affected in the CT scan could suggest thyroid cancer due to the involvement of the neck structures.
   
4. **Esophageal Cancer:** The mass near the cervical region and vocal cord involvement could potentially indicate esophageal cancer.
   
5. **Lymphoma:** Soft tissue mass in the supraclavicular and paravertebral region might be indicative of lymphoma.
   
6. **Metastatic Disease:** Unknown primary with the possibility of malignancy metastasizing to the neck area could be plausible.
   
7. **Paraganglioma:** Rarely, paragangliomas can occur along the carotid body, presenting with similar features.
   
8. **Schwannoma:** A nerve sheath tumor, such as schwannoma, could explain the vocal cord palsy if originating from the vagus nerve.
   
9. **Vascular Malformation:** Although less likely, a vascular malformation could press on the nerve causing symptoms.
   
10. **Granulomatous Disease:** Although less common, diseases like sarcoidosis could present with lymphadenopathy and nerve palsy.

### Re-evaluation and Final Ranking:
1. **Laryngeal Cancer:** High likelihood due to presenting symptoms and anatomical involvement.
2. **Lung Cancer:** Strong candidate given the pattern of nerve involvement.
3. **Thyroid Cancer:** Possible given the involvement of neck structures.
4. **Lymphoma:** The presentation is consistent with nodal involvement and mass formation.
5. **Esophageal Cancer:** Remains a viable differential due to proximity to involved areas.
6. **Metastatic Disease:** Always a consideration with nodal involvement and unclear primary.
7. **Paraganglioma:** Potential based on location but less common.
8. **Schwannoma:** Nerve-related tumor that fits some aspects of presentation.
9. **Granulomatous Disease:** Unlikely but should be considered in unusual cases.
10. **Vascular Malformation:** Least likely without angiographic evidence.","['Head and Neck Surgery', 'Radiology', 'Oncology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Laryngology']",0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,64.0,M

### INPUT:
A 32-year-old man was referred by his dentist to an oral surgeon for evaluation of persistent bilateral cheek swelling and mouth pain. Two months prior to presentation, the patient had awoken with bilateral linear “gashes” in his mandibular vestibule that were accompanied by bilateral buccal facial swellings. Since that day, the facial swelling remained unchanged, and although the mucosal lesions healed, the oral pain persisted. The patient’s medical history was noteworthy for depression, for which he was taking bupropion and fluoxetine, and prior alcohol use disorder, for which he was 3 years sober. He denied any smokeless tobacco use but endorsed daily electronic cigarette use. The extraoral examination detected bilateral buccal facial swelling of the lower facial third without associated trismus or lymphadenopathy (Figure, A). Intraorally, bilateral scarring of the mandibular buccal vestibule was noted with focal areas of ulceration. Small aphthous ulcerations were also present on the right buccal mucosa (Figure, B). An incisional biopsy of the right vestibular lesion was performed, and the specimen showed diffuse plasmalymphocytic infiltrates within the lamina propria. On higher magnification, noncaseating granulomatous inflammation was observed (Figure, C). Staining for acid-fast bacilli was negative.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Crohn disease,"1. **Sarcoidosis**  
   - Due to the presence of noncaseating granulomatous inflammation observed in the biopsy.

2. **Crohn's Disease**  
   - Considering the granulomatous inflammation, which can be seen in oral manifestations of Crohn's Disease.

3. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)**  
   - Due to ulceration and granulomatous inflammation, although typically involves respiratory tract.

4. **Tuberculosis**  
   - Sarcoidosis may mimic TB, but staining for acid-fast bacilli was negative, still considered.

5. **Foreign Body Reaction**  
   - Localized granulomatous response could relate to a retained foreign material or chronic irritation.

6. **Chronic Granulomatous Disease**  
   - Though atypical for adults, manifests with granuloma formation.

7. **Orofacial Granulomatosis**  
   - Given the persisting cheek swelling and noncaseating granulomas, this might be relevant.

8. **Histoplasmosis**  
   - Fungal infections could present with similar granulomatous responses.

9. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**  
   - Due to chronicity, oral ulcers, needs diffuse symptoms for full diagnosis.

10. **Chronic actinic cheilitis**  
   - May consider due to vesicular conditions but unrelated to noncaseating granulomas.

### Reranked List:

1. **Sarcoidosis**  
   - Noncaseating granulomas match and facial involvement is not atypical.

2. **Orofacial Granulomatosis**  
   - Persistent cheek swelling and granulomas fit within likely regional disease pattern.

3. **Crohn's Disease**  
   - Oral manifestation it's possible, given lesions and granuloma.

4. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)**  
   - Noncaseating granuloma but more systemic signs required for validation.

5. **Foreign Body Reaction**  
   - Due to localized and continuous irritation in oral region.

6. **Tuberculosis**  
   - Still considered despite negative staining.

7. **Histoplasmosis**  
   - Unlikely due to lack of other systemic symptoms but possible atypical presentation.

8. **Chronic Granulomatous Disease**  
   - Atypical for adult onset but fits granulomatous pattern.

9. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**  
   - Oral findings fit but lacks systemic corroborating features.

A 49-year-old African American man with no significant medical history came to the clinic because of abnormal retinal findings and mildly decreased visual acuity. He was told about these same findings 10 years ago but did not have a repeated eye examination until recently by another retina specialist. He reported no family history of retinal diseases. He initially received anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment, but was later referred because of a concern about either the idiopathic or paraneoplastic variant of acute exudative polymorphous vitelliform maculopathy (AEPVM). Initial workup by his primary care physician was unremarkable for malignancy. His best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/60 OD and 20/50 OS. An anterior segment examination was normal. Dilated fundus examination revealed multiple vitelliform lesions involving the macula and superior macula bilaterally (Figure 1). Fluorescein angiography revealed staining of these lesions with a pseudohypopyon appearance of the central vitelliform lesion in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed hyperreflectance corresponding to the yellow pigment in the vitelliform lesions in the subretinal space. No evidence of a choroidal neovascular membrane was present on examination or imaging.

### INPUT:
A previously healthy 8-year-old girl presented to an outpatient clinic for further evaluation of a fluctuating right parotid mass that had been present for 3 years. The patient was not immunocompromised and denied any trauma to the area. In the 2 months prior, she had received multiple rounds of antibiotics from other health care professionals. Outside computed tomography of the face showed a 3-cm cystic structure in the superficial aspect of the right parotid gland with associated lymphadenopathy. An outside health care professional had attempted incision and drainage of the area with negative cultures. The patient presented to our clinic with an isolated right 2-cm fluctuant and tender mass overlying the parotid gland. There was no accompanying cervical lymphadenopathy, and facial nerve function remained fully intact. The patient denied fevers or systemic symptoms. Results of laboratory evaluation revealed normal complete blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels with negative infectious workup results for Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, HIV, and tuberculosis (TB). Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 1.9-cm peripherally enhancing, centrally necrotic lesion overlying the superficial right parotid gland with multiple subcentimeter necrotic lymph nodes within the right parotid gland (Figure 1).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Atypical mycobacterium infection,"1. **Benign Lymphoepithelial Lesion (BLEL):** Given the location in the parotid gland and cystic nature, BLEL can be considered.
   
2. **Branchial Cleft Cyst:** The fluctuant mass and location near the parotid gland may suggest a congenital cystic neck mass.

3. **Vascular Malformation:** The nature of the cystic structure raises the possibility of a vascular anomaly.

4. **Salivary Gland Tumor:** A neoplastic process involving the salivary glands may be suggested by the recurring mass, especially given the necrotic lesion.

5. **Non-tuberculous Mycobacterial Infection:** Although tests for TB were negative, non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection can have a similar presentation.

6. **Chronic Sialadenitis:** Chronic inflammation of the salivary gland could lead to a similar presentation, especially after failed antibiotic treatment.

7. **Dermoid Cyst:** Dermoid cysts can appear in similar locations and might present with cystic lesions.

8. **Cat Scratch Disease:** Bartonella Henselae infection can present with a parotid gland mass, especially with lymphadenopathy present.

9. **Parotitis:** Though the patient denied systemic symptoms, viral or bacterial parotitis can sometimes localize and present with necrotic lesions.

10. **Lymphatic Malformation (Cystic Hygroma):** Cystic lesions, especially in the neck region, might suggest a lymphatic origin.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Salivary Gland Tumor:** The persistence and necrotic nature of the lesion highly suggest a neoplastic process.
2. **Non-tuberculous Mycobacterial Infection:** Given the necrotic nodes and recurrent nature, this remains highly probable.
3. **Benign Lymphoepithelial Lesion (BLEL):** The cystic aspects and gland involvement can still suggest BLEL.
4. **Branchial Cleft Cyst:** Possibility due to similar presentation with congenital causes.
5. **Chronic Sialadenitis:** Although less likely due to lack of systemic symptoms.
6. **Cat Scratch Disease:** Less likely given negative culture and infectious workup.
7. **Vascular Malformation:** Lower on differential due to lack of systemic signs.
8. **Parotitis:** Unlikely due to lack of systemic and classic symptoms.

The echocardiogram was performed because of an abnormal electrocardiogram demonstrating sinus tachycardia accompanied by high QRS voltage with a strain pattern in the precordial leads. She had no history of other illnesses. On physical examination, the patient was 154 cm tall and weighed 38 kg. The cardiovascular examination was unremarkable. Neurological examination showed mild cognitive impairment, poor coordination, and muscle weakness of the bilateral lower limbs. Blood test results revealed impaired glucose tolerance, hypothyroidism, and elevated levels of lactic acid (32.4 mg/dL) and pyruvate acid (1.91 mg/dL; to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 113.56). Review of the transthoracic echocardiogram showed diffuse hypertrophy, moderately decreased contractility of the left ventricle, and increased intramyocardial signal intensity (Video). The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. On admission, brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated cerebellar atrophy. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated diffuse biventricular hypertrophy and moderately impaired left ventricular systolic function. A wide range of nodular and band-shaped late gadolinium enhancement was detected in the middle and epicardial layers of the left ventricular myocardium. Coronary angiography revealed no significant stenoses of the epicardial coronary arteries.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Friedreich's ataxia**
   - Consistent with sensorineural hearing loss, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cerebellar atrophy, impaired glucose tolerance, and elevated lactate levels.
   
2. **Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome**
   - Considered due to elevated lactic acid and pyruvate, cardiomyopathy, and neurological findings.
   
3. **Fabry disease**
   - Possible due to cardiac involvement and neurological symptoms.
   
4. **Kearn-Sayre syndrome**
   - Due to elevated lactic acid, cardiomyopathy, and neurological symptoms, though typically involves pigmentary retinopathy not mentioned here.
   
5. **Leigh syndrome**
   - Possible differential with neurological impairment and elevated lactic acid levels.
   
6. **Cohen syndrome**
   - Considered for small stature, cognitive impairment, and potential genetic origins.
   
7. **Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy of other genetic origin**
   - As a less likely hypothesis in absence of familial history specifics.
   
8. **Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy**
   - Considered because of muscle weakness but does not fully explain other findings.
   
9. **Lowe syndrome**
   - Unlikely due to specific symptomatology, but considered due to muscle and neurological involvement.
   
10. **Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome**
    - Highly unlikely; included for completeness due to some overlapping symptoms, primarily not an adult diagnosis.

### INPUT:
Final diagnosis: Atypical vasculitis.  
Case report: An otherwise healthy White woman in her 60s presented with right jaw pain, trismus, and facial swelling. Symptoms started a year before, after receiving dental implants for new lower dentures. The patient noted right upper and lower eyelid swelling most notable in the morning but denied associated fevers, chills, vision changes, dysphagia, headaches, urinary symptoms, or rashes. Physical examination revealed a 3-cm round fluctuant area lateral to the right lateral canthus, mildly tender to palpation. No overlying warmth or erythema and no lymphadenopathy. The patient’s dentures appeared to be well fitting, but mouth opening was at approximately 50% of expected. Laboratory results included an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 20 mm/h, and normal complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel results, and lactate levels. Findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure, A) were most consistent with osteomyelitis of the mandible with inflammation of surrounding soft tissues. Right temporalis muscle biopsy results for Gram stain and culture, fungal stain and culture, and acid-fast bacillus stain were unremarkable. The patient’s symptoms did not improve after 7 weeks of empirical intravenous ertapenem followed by 8 weeks of oral cefuroxime and minocycline. Additional laboratory test results, including serum IgG4, SPEP, brucella AB, Q fever AB, RF, urinalysis, and microalbumin/creatinine levels, were all unremarkable. Results for p-ANCA and c-ANCA were negative. Repeated MRI findings showed progression of the inflammation and new involvement of the temporal lobe
### OUTPUT:
    ",Atypical vasculitis,"1. Osteomyelitis - Considering the initial MRI findings that were most consistent with osteomyelitis of the mandible, accompanied by inflammation of surrounding soft tissues.
   
2. Chronic sialadenitis - Given the jaw pain and facial swelling, chronic inflammation of the salivary glands could be considered.

3. Temporomandibular joint disorder - Due to trismus and jaw pain, TMJ disorder is a possible consideration.

4. Malignancy (e.g., lymphoma) - Persistent facial swelling and a mass-like area without improvement after antibiotics could raise suspicion for a malignancy.
   
5. IgG4-related disease - Although the serum IgG4 was negative, manifestations like swelling and inflammation could suggest this condition.
   
6. Aseptic abscess syndrome - Considered due to persistent swelling, unremarkable cultures, and no response to antibiotics.

7. Wegener's granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis) - Despite negative ANCA, it's known to have variable presentation, and inflammation of small vessels could be considered.

8. Sarcoidosis - Granulomatous disease that can present with facial swelling and inflammation.

9. Trigeminal neuralgia - Can cause significant facial pain and might be considered given the jaw pain and location of symptoms.
   
10. Atypical vasculitis - Negative ANCA and atypical presentation but eventual diagnosis, suggestive of small or medium vessel vasculitis without classic symptoms.

### INPUT:
A 13-month-old girl with an unremarkable medical history and no ocular history was brought to the emergency department by her parents for bilateral eyelid ecchymosis and edema for 1 month, as well as a mass on the right temporal area that was persistent for the past month and a half. She had hit the right side of her head on a table 1 month before symptoms developed, but had no other recent trauma. The mass had not changed in size, was not tender, and had no other associated symptoms. Her parents had not noticed any change in vision. At bedside, the patient was playful and in no acute distress. On examination, she fixed and followed in each eye. Her pupils were equal and reactive to light without afferent pupillary defect. Both eyes were soft to palpation and her extraocular movements were full. Externally, her examination was notable for bilateral upper eyelid ecchymosis and edema, as well as a soft, well-circumscribed mass on the right temporal region (Figure 1). There was no obvious proptosis. She was also noted to have subconjunctival hemorrhage temporally on the right eye. Otherwise, findings of her anterior examination and dilated fundoscopic examination were normal.

### INPUT:
A 59-year-old Asian woman with no history of any systemic illness presented with a 1-month history of blurred vision in her right eye. Her visual acuity was 20/400 OD and 20/20 OS. The anterior segments were quiet and vitreous was clear in both eyes. Fundus examination in the right eye revealed a solitary, elevated choroidal lesion with a creamy yellow appearance in the macular region involving the optic disc (Figure 1A). Ultrasonography confirmed a dome-shaped choroidal mass with intermediate echodensity measuring 14 mm in diameter and 4 mm in thickness (Figure 1B). Fluorescein angiography demonstrated scattered pinpoint hyperfluorescence of the mass and late leakage of the disc. Indocyanine green angiography revealed hypofluorescence in both early and late phases. Optical coherence tomography disclosed a choroidal mass with undulating surface and shallow subretinal fluid. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbit revealed an intraocular mass with hyperintensity on T1-weighted and hypointensity on T2-weighted scans with contrast enhancement extending into the adjacent retrobulbar fat, suspicious for scleral invasion. Blood test results including a complete blood cell count, tuberculosis, syphilis, and angiotensin-converting enzyme were all negative. The patient then developed gingivitis with a white blood cell count up to 12 350/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001) in the next 2 weeks that failed to respond to intravenous antibiotics. There were more pigments overlying the intraocular mass with prominent intraretinal hemorrhage along the optic disc compared with clinical findings at first presentation.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Langerhans cell histiocytosis,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Choroidal Melanoma**  
   A solitary elevated choroidal lesion with characteristics such as creamy yellow appearance and dome shape with echodensity can be indicative of a choroidal melanoma.

2. **Choroidal Metastasis**  
   Given the patient's age and imaging findings (hypofluorescence on ICG), a choroidal metastasis should be considered.

3. **Choroidal Hemangioma**  
   The presentation of a dome-shaped lesion with intermediate echodensity also fits this vascular tumor.

4. **Choroidal Osteoma**  
   The creamy yellow lesion with undulating surface and calcified mass on imaging could suggest a choroidal osteoma.

5. **Choroidal Granuloma**  
   Although less common and tests for TB and sarcoidosis are negative, the presentation could still match a non-infectious granulomatous condition.

6. **Uveal Lymphoma**  
   The presence of an intraocular mass with T1 hyperintensity and systemic signs like gingivitis could point towards a lymphoma.

7. **Extramedullary Hematopoiesis**  
   Hypointensity on T2-weighted scans and the presence of an intraocular mass may suggest this rare occurrence secondary to hematological conditions.

8. **Retinal Capillary Hemangioblastoma**  
   Though typically associated with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, the vascular tumor could present similarly.

9. **Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) complications**  
   Although the patient is relatively young, geographic atrophy and neovascular complications could cause such a mass.

10. **Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome**  
    Extending into retrobulbar fat with corresponding systemic inflammatory signs might indicate this diagnosis.

### Reranked Final Differential Diagnosis

1. **Choroidal Melanoma**  
   Given the imaging, age, and lesion characteristics, melanoma remains the most likely.

2. **Choroidal Metastasis**  
   The expansion into retrobulbar fat and appearance on imaging suggests metastasis significantly.

3. **Uveal Lymphoma**  
   Systemic inflammatory response and T1 hyperintensity signal lymphoma strongly.

4. **Choroidal Hemangioma**  
   The intermediate echodensity and lesion shape keep this as a potential diagnosis.

5. **Choroidal Granuloma**  
   Despite negative systemic tests, non-infectious granulomas are a differential possibility.

6. **Choroidal Osteoma**  
   Secondary sign presence diminishes the likelihood compared to other conditions.

7. **Extramedullary Hematopoiesis**  
   The systemic signs align with hematopoietic activity, albeit rare in the ocular context.

8. **Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome**  
   Periorbital extension and systemic symptoms make this plausible.

9. **Retinal Capillary Hemangioblastoma**  
   Requires exclusion of systemic associations, less probable without other symptoms.

10. **Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) complications**  
   Less fitting due to age and atypical presenting profile.","['Hematology', 'Oncology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Choroidal Disorders', 'Retinal Disorders']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,59.0,M

### INPUT:
A White woman in her 50s with a clinical history of recurrent respiratory infections and diarrhea presented with painful oral erosions that began 2 years before. Results of a previous intestinal biopsy had shown unspecific findings and absence of apoptosis. She reported a 5-kg weight loss that she attributed to impaired intake owing to the oral lesions. She was also being evaluated for a mediastinal mass detected in radiography of the chest performed for pneumonia. Physical examination revealed whitish edematous lacy patches with erosions on the dorsal and lateral aspects of the tongue and buccal mucosa (Figure, A); skin and nails were not involved. A lingual biopsy specimen was obtained for pathologic evaluation and direct immunofluorescence (DIF; Figure, B and C). The result of indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) testing, using monkey esophagus, salt-skin split, and rat bladder as substrates, was negative. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblot analysis did not detect any desmoglein-1 or -3, bullous pemphigoid-180 or -230, collagen VII, desmocollin-1 to -3, laminin-332, envoplakin, or periplakin antibodies. Results were normal for liver function; negative for hepatitis B and C; indicative of hypogammaglobulinemia, with a decreased immunoglobulin (Ig) G serum level of 465 mg/dL (normal, 750-1600 g/L; for g/L, multiply by 0.01); and normal for IgA and IgM levels. Positron emission tomography revealed a 10-cm hypercapturing extrapulmonary mass (Figure, D). Surgical excision of the mediastinal mass was performed; its histopathologic features were consistent with a type AB thymoma, Masaoka-Koga stage 2A.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Good syndrome,"1. **Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID):** The patient's recurrent infections, diarrhea, hypogammaglobulinemia, and decreased IgG suggest an immunodeficiency disorder, which is characteristic of CVID.

2. **Oral Lichen Planus:** The description of oral erosions and lacy patches aligns with oral lichen planus, a condition that affects mucous membranes.

3. **Paraneoplastic Pemphigus:** The presence of painful oral erosions, despite negative autoantibodies on testing, suggests a variant of pemphigus that can be associated with underlying neoplasms like thymoma.

4. **Thymoma:** The mediastinal mass surgically excised was consistent with a thymoma, an anterior mediastinal tumor that could be related to paraneoplastic syndromes.

5. **Sjogren's Syndrome:** Typically associated with oral involvement, Sjogren's can cause altered immunoglobulin synthesis patterns, though this diagnosis is less likely with the given immunological profile.

6. **IgG Subclass Deficiency:** The low IgG and recurrent infections warrant consideration of selective IgG subclass deficiency, though CVID is a more comprehensive diagnosis.

7. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE):** Despite negative initial serologies, SLE can present with diverse mucocutaneous and systemic symptoms, including oropharyngeal lesions and systemic immune system involvement.

8. **Secondary Hypogammaglobulinemia due to Thymoma:** Thymomas can cause hypogammaglobulinemia through paraneoplastic effects, which might explain the decreased IgG levels.

9. **Aplasia or Hypoplasia of Mucous Membranes:** Given the oral mucosal involvement, a condition leading to poor mucous membrane health might contribute, particularly in the context of immunodeficiency.

10. **Malabsorption Syndrome:** The unintentional weight loss and diarrhea could be part of a malabsorption syndrome impacting nutritional and immune function.

A woman in her 50s presented to our dermatology department with an asymptomatic, arc-shaped, depressed skin groove on the left side of her forehead, frontal scalp, and vertex area. Localized linear hair loss and hair thinning on the left scalp area were observed. The patient reported that when the lesion had begun to appear, approximately 10 years earlier, she had received 2 doses of intralesional steroid via injection on a small bald patch on the vertex. Thereafter, the lesion gradually progressed to the frontal scalp and eventually made a linear furrow on the left side of her forehead. Physical examination revealed 2 long, curved-line, depressed, alopecic patches on the left side of the vertex and frontal scalp area extending to the left eyebrow (Figure, A and B). The lesions measured (length × width) 7 × 2 cm and 6 × 1 cm, respectively. Dermoscopic examination of the alopecic area revealed several short vellus hairs, yellow dots, and honeycomb hyperpigmentation; however, broken hairs were not seen. The result of a hair pull test was negative. The patient denied any trauma history and had no history of connective tissue disease nor any evidence of systemic involvement, such as arthralgia, photosensitivity, or skin rashes. Skin biopsies were performed on the left side of the vertex and the forehead. Histopathologic findings of the 2 biopsy specimens were identical (Figure, C and D).

### INPUT:
A 46-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with 3 months of upper back pain and 2 weeks of dry cough and subjective fevers that did not improve with empirical azithromycin. She had immigrated from India to the US 15 years prior and worked as a software engineer. She last traveled to India 4 years earlier and had negative results for interferon gamma release assay on return. She reported no smoking history, recent animal contact, or unpasteurized animal product ingestion. Her temperature was 38.05 °C; heart rate, 114/min; blood pressure, 132/85 mm Hg; and respiratory rate, 18/min. There was no spinal or paraspinal tenderness. Findings on pulmonary and neurologic examinations were normal. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 84 mm/h (reference, <10 mm/h), and C-reactive protein level was 9.4 mg/dL (reference, <0.8 mg/dL). A chest radiograph showed prominent reticular markings in the left perihilar area, and chest computed tomography showed a 3.2 × 2.6–cm dense consolidation in the left lower lobe (Figure 1, left panel). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine showed signal abnormality and extensive contrast enhancement within the T6, T7, and T8 vertebral bodies, with sparing of the T6-7 and T7-8 disks (Figure 1, center panel), and a large paraspinal soft tissue mass with spinal cord compression (Figure 1, center and right panel).
### OUTPUT:

- Consider tuberculosis due to the patient’s history of immigration from India, persistent cough, and significance of spinal abnormalities which can suggest Pott's disease.

Step 2: Pyogenic Vertebral Osteomyelitis  
- Given the spinal MRI findings indicating bone involvement and soft tissue mass, pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis should be considered.

Step 3: Fungal Infection (e.g., Aspergillosis)  
- A fungal infection, such as aspergillosis, should be considered because of the lung findings and spinal involvement in an immunocompetent patient.

Step 4: Sarcoidosis  
- Sarcoidosis can present with pulmonary and bone involvement, though spinal involvement is less common.

Step 5: Lymphoma  
- Lymphoma could present with both pulmonary consolidation and spinal cord involvement.

Step 6: Metastatic Cancer  
- Consider metastatic cancer due to the vertebral body involvement and lung findings.

Step 7: Spondyloarthritis  
- Spinal abnormalities raise the consideration for inflammatory conditions like spondyloarthritis.

Step 8: Bacterial Pneumonia with Paraspinal Abscess  
- A lung consolidation and spinal cord compression from a bacterial paraspinal abscess form another differential.

Step 9: Histoplasmosis  
- Consider histoplasmosis infection given the lung findings and the patient’s country of origin.

### INPUT:
A 44-year-old man presented to the oculoplastic surgery clinic with a mass on the lateral canthus of his right eye. The mass had gradually grown over 2 months and was tender to palpation. He denied any vision changes, facial trauma, redness, or discharge from the lesion. He had an unremarkable ocular and medical history. On examination, visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/20 OS. Ocular motility was full and pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. His examination was notable for a 3-mm subcutaneous, firm, mobile, noncompressible lesion near the lateral canthus of the right eye without overlying erythema, warmth, telangiectasia, or ulceration (Figure 1). The rest of the ophthalmic and orbital examination was normal.
### OUTPUT:
    ","Granular cell tumor, benign","1. Epidermoid Cyst: Given the firm, mobile, subcutaneous nature of the lesion with a lack of overlying skin changes, an epidermoid cyst can be considered.

2. Lipoma: A soft tissue mass like a lipoma is a possibility due to its presentation as a mobile and noncompressible lesion.

3. Dermoid Cyst: A dermoid cyst is possible given the location near the lateral canthus and typical presentation as a firm, nontender mass.

4. Sebaceous Cyst: Another consideration could be a sebaceous cyst since such cysts can present as firm, subcutaneous nodules.

5. Neurofibroma: Although less likely due to the patient's age and lack of other symptoms, a neurofibroma should be considered due to the subcutaneous nature of the lesion.

6. Lacrimal Gland Tumor (Benign pleomorphic adenoma): Though less common, a benign tumor like a pleomorphic adenoma of the lacrimal gland may present in this location.

7. Pilomatrixoma: This benign, firm, subcutaneous tumor could be a possibility given its characteristics.

### INPUT:
A 48-year-old man with diet-controlled diabetes presented with a 6-month history of arthralgias in his hands, feet, elbows, and knees; 3 weeks of a purpuric rash and foot paresthesias; and 2 weeks of bilateral eye pain and redness. He had been prescribed 4 days of prednisone (10 mg/d) without improvement. He had no fevers, epistaxis, rhinorrhea, cough, shortness of breath, or hematuria. He had no history of recent travel or illicit drug use and was not taking any medications. On examination, his vital signs were normal. He had bilateral scleral injection and swelling and tenderness over the proximal interphalangeal joints bilaterally. Hemorrhagic vesicles and violaceous papules were present on his ears, nose, arms, and legs (Figure). Laboratory studies revealed normal complete blood cell count, serum electrolyte levels, and liver enzyme levels. Urinalysis findings were normal and urine toxicology screen was negative. Punch biopsy of a papule on the right arm demonstrated a superficial perivascular infiltrate of neutrophils with leukocytoclasia, extravasation of erythrocytes, and fibrin in small blood vessel walls. Direct immunofluorescence testing was negative for in situ deposits of IgG, IgA, IgM, and C3.
### OUTPUT:
    ",ANCA-associated vasculitis,"1. **Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP):** Considering the purpuric rash and joint symptoms, HSP is a possibility, despite the negative IgA staining which is typical in adults.

2. **Cryoglobulinemic Vasculitis:** The combination of purpura, arthralgia, and peripheral neuropathy with a lack of systemic involvement could be indicative of mixed cryoglobulinemia.

3. **Drug-Induced Vasculitis:** Given the introduction of prednisone and lack of other medication use, a drug-induced vasculitis is less likely but still a potential consideration based on symptoms.

4. **Cutaneous Leukocytoclastic Vasculitis:** The skin biopsy findings showing leukocytoclastic vasculitis fit with this condition.

5. **Polyarteritis Nodosa (PAN):** Though less common without renal involvement, the systemic manifestations with neuropathy warrant consideration.

6. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA):** Typically associated with respiratory symptoms, the absence of these makes GPA less likely but still possible.

7. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE):** SLE could present with similar symptoms, but lack of fever, serositis, renal, and hematologic involvement makes it unlikely without prior episodes or serologies.

8. **Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA):** Although RA usually causes more chronic symptoms and joint deformities, the joint involvement could suggest a seronegative presentation, though the skin findings are atypical.

9. **Churg-Strauss Syndrome (EGPA):** Considered unlikely due to lack of asthma and eosinophilia, but peripheral neuropathy aligns with symptomology.

10. **Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA):** Given symptoms overlap with GPA and PAN but lack of major renal and pulmonary involvement, MPA is a later consideration.

### Final Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Cryoglobulinemic Vasculitis:** Best fits the clinical picture with purpura, joint, and nerve involvement, albeit rare without underlying cause confirmation.
   
2. **Cutaneous Leukocytoclastic Vasculitis:** Conforming to the biopsy results and presentation of the purpuric rash.

3. **Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP):** Remains plausible despite negative IgA; adult presentations can vary.

4. **Polyarteritis Nodosa (PAN):** Peripheral neuropathy and skin manifestation compelling, though less likely without renal symptoms.

5. **Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA):** Possible due to small vessel vasculitis presenting with similar symptoms.

6. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA):** Symptoms overlap, though lack of respiratory involvement decreases likelihood.

7. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE):** Less likely due to negative direct immunofluorescence and systemic symptoms not aligning perfectly.

8. **Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA):** Joint involvements considered but skin and systemic symptoms inconsistent.

9. **Churg-Strauss Syndrome (EGPA):** Lower probability due to absent eosinophilia and asthma symptoms.

10. **Drug-Induced Vasculitis:** Unlikely due to lack of new medication introduction corresponding with symptom onset.","['Dermatology', 'Rheumatology', 'Connective Tissue Disease of the Skin', 'Ophthalmology']",0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,48.0,F

### INPUT:
A 65-year-old man with locally advanced, unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma being treated with pemigatinib, a fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitor (FGFRi), presented with a painful eruption on the bilateral lower extremities. Pemigatinib treatment was initiated 2 months prior to the skin findings. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated a mildly elevated D-dimer level at 578 ng/mL fibrinogen-equivalent units, prolonged prothrombin time of 12.7 seconds, elevated phosphorus level at 6.8 mg/dL (of note, phosphorus was 3.1 mg/dL 1 month prior), and normal calcium level and kidney function. Other laboratory tests to note include cryoglobulin and cryofibrinogen, which both had negative results. Within weeks, there was rapid progression with skin necrosis despite treatment initiation with rivaroxaban. Physical examination revealed retiform purpura with areas of necrosis involving the bilateral lower extremities (Figure, A and B). A punch biopsy specimen from the right calf was obtained for histopathologic analysis (Figure, C and D).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Calciphylaxis,"1. **Calciphylaxis** - Given the presence of elevated phosphorus levels and skin necrosis, calciphylaxis was considered.
   
2. **Warfarin-induced skin necrosis** - Although the patient was on rivaroxaban and not warfarin, the pattern warranted consideration for occlusive conditions leading to necrosis.
   
3. **Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) with thrombosis** - Despite negative testing, HIT can present with purpura and necrosis, albeit more commonly with heparin use.
   
4. **Antiphospholipid syndrome** - The patient had prolonged prothrombin time and necrotic lesions, suggesting a thrombotic disorder.
   
5. **Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis** - Negative cryoglobulin makes this unlikely, yet early stages or low titers could still be responsible for similar symptoms.
   
6. **Polyarteritis nodosa** - This condition causes necrotic skin lesions and could be triggered or aggravated by medication.
   
7. **Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)** - Although mostly presenting with pentad symptoms including thrombocytopenia which is not evident here, related necrotic skin changes warranted consideration.
   
8. **Cholesterol embolization syndrome** - Often linked with other conditions, but based on skin lesions and necrosis, it fit the clinical picture to some extent.
   
9. **Livedoid vasculopathy** - It can match the physical findings, especially with retiform purpura and areas of necrosis, though lab results did not confirm.
   
10. **Paraneoplastic acral vascular syndrome** - As paraneoplastic phenomena were considered due to the underlying cancer, acral involvement aligned with this rare condition.

### Reranked differential diagnosis:
1. **Calciphylaxis**
2. **Polyarteritis nodosa**
3. **Paraneoplastic acral vascular syndrome**
4. **Livedoid vasculopathy**

### INPUT:
A young woman nearing the end of her second decade with no significant medical history presented to the emergency department with a 1-day history of intermittent palpitations and chest pain associated with shortness of breath. On presentation, the patient appeared anxious with a heart rate of 101 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 151/79 mm Hg, and pulse oximetry of 96% in room air. Her cardiopulmonary examination results, complete blood cell count, basic metabolic panel, and cardiac troponins were all within normal limits. Her electrocardiogram on presentation and echocardiogram are shown in Figure 1 and the Video. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy,"### Differential Diagnosis Step-by-Step

1. **Anxiety Disorder**: Given the patient's age, gender, and presentation of palpitations with chest pain, one possibility is an anxiety disorder.

2. **Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)**: The palpitations and intermittent nature suggest a re-entrant tachycardia or episodic increase in heart rate.

3. **Panic Attack**: This can cause somatic symptoms like palpitations, chest pain, and shortness of breath, particularly in anxious patients.

4. **Mitral Valve Prolapse**: Often associated with palpitations and chest pain, particularly in young females.

5. **Hyperthyroidism**: Can present with palpitations, increased heart rate, anxiety, and potential hypertension.

6. **Atrial Fibrillation**: Although less common in such a young individual, this arrhythmia can cause similar symptoms.

7. **Pulmonary Embolism**: Presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and elevated heart rate, though typically with more severe respiratory findings.

8. **Substance Use (e.g., caffeine, stimulants)**: Can lead to palpitations, increased heart rate, and anxiety.

9. **Pheochromocytoma**: A rare catecholamine-secreting tumor that can cause episodes of hypertension, palpitations, and anxiety.

10. **Costochondritis**: Chest pain of musculoskeletal origin that may be mistaken for a cardiovascular issue.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Anxiety Disorder**: Consistent with her appearing anxious and symptoms could be stress-induced.
2. **Panic Attack**: Matches the intermittent, acute presentation of symptoms.
3. **Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)**: Possible given the palpitations and normal heart examination findings.
4. **Mitral Valve Prolapse**: Fits the demographic, though less likely due to normal echocardiogram.
5. **Substance Use**: History-taking did not suggest this, but could easily cause symptoms.
6. **Hyperthyroidism**: Lacks metabolic panel abnormalities that would suggest this.
7. **Atrial Fibrillation**: Unlikely with normal ECG.
8. **Pheochromocytoma**: Rare, hypertension not as severe or persistent enough.
9. **Pulmonary Embolism**: Less likely due to normal clinical examination and pulse oximetry results.
10. **Costochondritis**: The least likely considering the acute nature and palpitation presence.","['Genetics and Genomics', 'Rhythm Disorders', 'Pediatrics', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Cardiology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,M

### INPUT:
A 44-year-old man presented to the otolaryngology clinic with a 6-month history of a right neck mass with compressive symptoms. He first noticed swelling that progressed to pressure and dyspnea while supine. He reported fatigue but denied pain, voice change, weight loss, hemoptysis, and dysphagia. A physical examination revealed a visible and palpable fullness to the right neck without overlying cutaneous or sinus tract changes. Results of a complete blood cell count, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, triiodothyronine and levorotatory thyroxine testing, and a complete metabolic panel were normal. Ultrasonography showed a 7.9 × 6.3-cm septate cystic mass lateral to the right thyroid gland. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the neck demonstrated a large, nonenhancing cystic-appearing lesion abutting the lateral and posterior margins of the right thyroid lobe and extending from the level of the piriform sinus to the thoracic inlet (Figure). Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration revealed clear fluid with a parathyroid hormone (PTH) level of 67 pg/mL (reference range, <100 pg/mL; to convert to ng/L multiply by 1.00). A barium swallow study showed no communication between the cyst and the piriform sinus. Excision in the operating room was performed, and right thyroid lobectomy was necessary because of the intimate association of the lesion to the thyroid lobe.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Parathyroid cyst,"1. **Thyroglossal duct cyst** - Typically presents as midline neck swelling, possible given location near thyroid.
2. **Branchial cleft cyst** - Common cystic neck mass, typically lateral; fits with the lateral throat findings.
3. **Lymphangioma** - Cystic neck mass that appears in adults, can have compressive symptoms.
4. **Cystic hygroma** - Usually in children, but can persist or present in adults.
5. **Parathyroid cyst** - Consistent with elevated PTH levels in cyst fluid.
6. **Ectopic thyroid tissue cyst** - Could appear adjacent to thyroid.
7. **Dermoid cyst** - Possible lateral neck mass, though rare.
8. **Lipoma** - Generally not cystic, but could be considered if presentation deviates from usual findings.
9. **Cystic schwannoma** - Rare, but could be considered given large cystic mass and location.
10. **Metastatic cervical lymphadenopathy** - Less likely with normal lab tests and imaging findings.

A 50-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of a neck mass that was associated with hoarseness of voice and globus sensation. Physical examination showed thyromegaly (right greater than left) with an approximately 5-cm palpable nodule in the right lobe. There was no tenderness or cervical lymphadenopathy. There was no prior radiation exposure to the head and neck area. Thyroid function test results were normal, and he did not take thyroid medications. A relative had received a diagnosis of papillary thyroid cancer at age 50 years. There was no other pertinent family history, including a history of multiple endocrine neoplasia. Ultrasonography results showed a multinodular goiter with a dominant 4.6-cm right thyroid nodule, 1.6-cm left-sided thyroid nodule, and suspect left level IV lymph node. Ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy results showed papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) (Bethesda VI) with a BRAFV600E variation in the left nodule and lymph node, and atypia of undetermined significance (Bethesda III) with a suspicious Afirma genomic sequence classifier in the right nodule. He underwent total thyroidectomy with modified left lateral neck dissection. Gross examination of the specimen showed a 2.9-cm pale-tan, partially circumscribed, soft nodule in the right thyroid lobe; a 1.4-cm pale-tan, fibrotic, centrally brown nodule in the left lobe; and a 1.8-cm pale-tan, rubbery, partially circumscribed nodule in the isthmus.

### INPUT:
A 33-year-old man with a history of hereditary bilateral retinoblastoma as an infant presented to a primary care clinic with 1 week of right lower extremity swelling. At age 8 months, he was treated with right enucleation and left eye radiotherapy (50.4 Gy). At age 4 years, he developed a recurrence of the retinoblastoma in the nasal cavity and was treated with 4 cycles of vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide followed by 1 cycle of cisplatin, etoposide, and intrathecal cytarabine. Primary care evaluation was prompted by his mother, as the patient had not noticed his lower extremity edema. He had no fevers, weight loss, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, or history of deep vein thrombosis. His physical examination was notable for firm, nonpitting edema to the hip. He did not have any associated tenderness, inguinal lymphadenopathy, or palpable abdominal masses. His vital signs were within normal limits and he ambulated comfortably. Laboratory work results, including a complete blood cell count with a differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, and D-dimer levels, were within normal limits. Doppler ultrasonography of his right lower extremity showed no deep vein thrombosis. A computed tomography venogram demonstrated a 4.0 × 3.5 cm mass of likely vascular origin that was extending into the right common iliac vein (Figure).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Leiomyosarcoma,"1. **Lymphatic Obstruction:** Presence of firm, non-pitting edema may indicate lymphedema secondary to lymphatic obstruction.

2. **Pelvic Sarcoma:** Given the history of previous malignancies, a new soft tissue sarcoma in the pelvic region should be considered.

3. **Vascular Malformation or Hemangioma:** The mass of likely vascular origin could represent a vascular malformation or hemangioma.

4. **Liposarcoma:** An intrabdominal or retroperitoneal liposarcoma could present with a mass affecting the vascular structures in the pelvis.

5. **Radiation-Induced Fibrosis:** Given the history of radiotherapy, fibrosis leading to obstruction or altered vascular/lymphatic drainage should be considered.

6. **Lymphoma:** The involvement of lymphatic organs and tissues raises the concern for lymphoma.

7. **Iliac Vein Compression Syndrome (May-Thurner Syndrome):** A mass compressing the common iliac vein could resemble May-Thurner Syndrome.

8. **Testicular Cancer with Metastasis:** Metastasis to the pelvic node group might present as a pelvic mass with venous involvement.

9. **Retroperitoneal Fibrosis:** The fibrous tissue formation in retroperitoneal space could lead to entrapment of surrounding structures including veins.

### INPUT:
A 54-year-old woman presented with a 3-day history of right ptosis and double vision. She was otherwise healthy and did not take any regular medications. Initially, she had horizontal diplopia on the first day that was worse at the end of the day, but this resolved when the right eyelid ptosis became complete. She denied any difficulty with her speech, swallowing, weakness, or sensory changes. She presented to the emergency department, and the emergency department physician reported a normal neurological examination result apart from the right-sided ptosis and limited eye movements. She was referred to ophthalmology and had a visual acuity of 20/20 OU. Both pupils were equal sizes and reactive to light. She was found to only have a complete limitation of elevation of her right eye and a limitation of abduction in her left eye (Figure). She was orthophoric in primary position, and there were no eyelid twitches. Orbicularis oculi strength was reduced on both sides. A dilated fundus examination had normal results bilaterally. An initial neurological examination, including assessments of motor strength in the upper and lower extremities and reflexes and a sensory examination, had normal results.
### OUTPUT:

2. **Third Nerve Palsy**: The presence of ptosis and ophthalmoplegia could suggest a third cranial nerve palsy, although pupil involvement would more commonly be expected.

3. **Thyroid Eye Disease**: Diplopia and muscle restriction could be due to thyroid-related orbitopathy despite the absence of systemic symptoms of hyperthyroidism.

4. **Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)**: This mitochondrial disorder can cause bilateral ptosis and ophthalmoplegia.

5. **Ocular Myopathy**: Isolated weakness of eye muscles could indicate an ocular myopathy, separate from systemic myopathies.

6. **Brainstem Lesion**: A lesion in the midbrain affecting ocular motor nuclei could cause ophthalmoplegia and ptosis, although additional neurological deficits might be expected.

7. **Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia**: This could cause gaze palsy and diplopia, although it often presents with additional neurological signs.

8. **Miller Fisher Syndrome**: A rare variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome characterized by ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia, though areflexia and ataxia are absent here.

9. **Horner's Syndrome**: Though less common with bilateral presentation, the ptosis and normal pupil reactivity could suggest this, albeit with accompanying anhidrosis.

10. **Oculomotor Myositis**: Inflammation of the extraocular muscles could account for limited eye movement, though typically painful and associated with systemic inflammatory symptoms.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Myasthenia Gravis**: Remains the top diagnosis due to the fluctuation of symptoms and typical presentation.
2. **Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)**: Bilateral presentation fits well with this mitochondrial disorder.
3. **Third Nerve Palsy**: While possible, the presentation could be atypical due to the absence of pupil involvement.
4. **Ocular Myopathy**: Considerably consistent with the isolated ocular muscle involvement.
5. **Thyroid Eye Disease**: Possible if subclinical thyroid dysfunction is discovered.
6. **Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia**: Less likely given the complete lack of other neurological findings.
7. **Brainstem Lesion**: Unlikely without additional neurological deficits; requires imaging for confirmation.
8. **Miller Fisher Syndrome**: Lacks supporting systemic neurological symptoms; less likely.
9. **Horner's Syndrome**: Bilateral presentation and lack of accompanying symptoms make it unlikely.

### INPUT:
An 80-year-old man presented with a 1-year history of right pulsatile tinnitus and aural fullness. His symptoms were more prominent at night and in the quiet and improved when upright. Physical examination demonstrated an intact tympanic membrane with no middle ear mass; there was no neck mass palpated or bruit auscultated. The patient had further workup with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a computed tomographic scan (Figure 1). The patient was taken to the operating room for a right transtemporal biopsy. Operative findings demonstrated extensive tumor extending along the posterior fossa dura and deep to the jugular foramen that filled the area of the skull base. The tumor was debulked and sent for pathologic evaluation.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Plasmacytoma,"1. **Glomus jugulare tumor** - A type of paraganglioma located at the skull base affecting the jugular bulb, which can present with pulsatile tinnitus and aural fullness.
   
2. **Meningioma** - A tumor arising from the meninges that can extend along the dura of the posterior fossa.

3. **Schwannoma** - Typically a vestibular schwannoma that can arise in the area of the jugular foramen, though usually associated with hearing loss.

4. **Cholesterol granuloma** - Benign cyst-like lesions that can occur at the petrous apex; can cause symptoms similar to those described.

5. **Jugular bulb abnormality** - Variants or high-riding jugular bulb could, in rare cases, mimic symptoms but would not present as a tumor.

6. **Carotid-cavernous fistula** - Abnormal communication that can result in pulsatile tinnitus; less likely due to tumor findings.

7. **Hemangiopericytoma** - A rare vascular tumor that can occur intracranially, often aggressive, affecting nearby structures.

8. **Chordoma** - Slow-growing malignant tumor found at the base of the skull; presents similarly but different histology.

9. **Metastatic disease** - Secondary malignant growth that could mimic the expansiveness of the tumor described; dependent upon primary cancer.

10. **Epidermoid cyst** - Also known as cholesterol cysts; occur at the cerebellopontine angle but have different imaging features.

3. **Chordoma**: Fits some imaging findings and the skull base location.
4. **Schwannoma**: Although less likely without hearing involvement, possible given region.
5. **Hemangiopericytoma**: Vascular tumor that could fit findings if aggressive.
6. **Cholesterol granuloma**: Possible but less likely without cystic features.
7. **Metastatic disease**: Considered if primary known or biopsy suggested malignancy.
8. **Jugular bulb abnormality**: Less likely due to tumor extension.
9. **Carotid-cavernous fistula**: Unlikely given lack of vascular imaging findings.
10. **Epidermoid cyst**: Unlikely due to pathology one would expect to see on imaging.","['Otolaryngology', 'Audiology and Hearing', 'Skull Base']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,80.0,F

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy Black man in his 30s presented to the dermatology clinic for evaluation of hypopigmented, intermittently pruritic patches. Patches were confined to his face and neck and occurred intermittently after his last child was born approximately 10 years ago. He had no history of eczema, atopic skin conditions, or autoimmune conditions and denied family history of such. In previous evaluations, the areas were treated with petroleum-based creams, low- to medium-potency topical steroids, pimecrolimus, and topical antifungals, without consistent improvement. Physical examination identified multiple hypopigmented macules and subtle patches symmetrically distributed across the lower aspect of the forehead, cheeks, nasofacial sulci, and nasolabial folds; and along the jawline and neck (Figure, A and B). Many had a slight overlying scale that was tested with potassium hydroxide and was negative for hyphae. No hair or nail abnormalities were noted. A 4-mm punch biopsy of a hypopigmented patch on the right cheek was performed (Figure, C and D).

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Pityriasis Alba** - This is most consistent with the presentation of hypopigmented patches on the face and neck in a young adult, with previous inconsistent treatment results.
2. **Post-inflammatory Hypopigmentation** - Given the history of previous treatments without success, post-inflammatory changes are possible.
3. **Vitiligo** - While the patient has no history of autoimmune condition, vitiligo should still be considered due to hypopigmentation.
4. **Tinea Versicolor** - Although KOH was negative, this condition's pattern can resemble the described patches.
5. **Seborrheic Dermatitis** - Hypopigmented patches with subtle scaling in typical seborrheic distribution supports considering this diagnosis.
6. **Pityriasis Versicolor** - Similar clinical presentation, despite negative initial test results.
7. **Sarcoidosis** - Rare for this presentation but could cause cutaneous changes.
8. **Idiopathic Guttate Hypomelanosis** - Typically presents differently but can be considered in rare cases.
9. **Lichen Sclerosus** - Usually with thicker plaques, less likely given the features.

### INPUT:
A 71-year-old man with a history of intermittent generalized pruritus of unclear etiology and right knee osteoarthritis underwent total knee arthroplasty. He presented 8 weeks postoperatively with a 1-week history of scattered pruritic bullae around his incision site. He reported that the symptoms were unlike any rashes he had had before. He had no fever, knee pain, or lower extremity swelling. He was taking no medications and had no allergies. On examination, he was afebrile and well-appearing. Knee examination showed no effusion and normal range of motion without pain. His incision was fully healed. Several 1- to 2-cm tense, fluid-filled bullae were present around the incision. There was no surrounding erythema or edema. He received topical iodine for 2 weeks, during which time 4 new tense bullae appeared (Figure, left panel). Three bullae subsequently ruptured, while 1 remained intact. Drainage from the ruptured bullae was clear. He was advised to continue using iodine on the affected skin for wound care and was prescribed a 7-day course of oral cephalexin and a tapering regimen of low-dose prednisone. After completion of the antibiotic course, the bullae and pruritus remained unchanged (Figure, right panel). Superficial cultures of the bullae were negative for bacterial growth.

**Reranked Differential Diagnosis:**

1. Bullous Pemphigoid - Given the age of the patient, the tense nature of the bullae, and the lack of response to antibiotics, this autoimmune blistering disorder is top on the differential.  
2. Pemphigus Vulgaris - Although less likely due to the tense nature of the bullae, it is a possibility worth considering due to the autoimmune etiology.  
3. Linear IgA Bullous Dermatosis - The chronic, tense bullae fits this condition though usually presents differently.  
4. Epidermolysis Bullosa Acquisita - Less common in adults, but still a consideration due to tense bullae.  
5. Drug-induced Bullous Reactions - Though there is no clear medication trigger in this patient, it remains a possibility.  
6. Dermatitis Herpetiformis - Pruritic bullae are characteristic; however, lesions are typically more grouped and around extensor surfaces.  
7. Porphyria Cutanea Tarda - Typically presents with bullous lesions but context and lack of liver abnormalities make it less likely.  
8. Contact Dermatitis - Less likely given no known triggers and lack of improvement with iodine discontinuation.  
9. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome - Presentation and presence of systemic symptoms do not align with this diagnosis.  
10. Erythema Multiforme - This condition usually involves target lesions and mucous membranes, making it unlikely given the clinical picture.","['Dermatology', 'Orthopedics']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,71.0,F

### INPUT:
An 18-month-old boy presented with a 1-year history of a slow-growing mass in the right earlobe. There were no symptoms, such as tenderness or discharge, associated with the mass. He had no history of underlying medical disease or trauma. On physical examination, a 1.5 × 1.0–cm, firm, nodular, angulated, pinkish, nontender mass was observed in the posterior aspect of the right earlobe (Figure, A). The skin over the mass was semitransparent, and the mass moved freely beneath the skin. Under suspicion of a tumorous lesion, complete excision was performed after the patient received general anesthesia. Histopathologic findings were characteristic for 2 cell types; basaloid cells with a nucleus were present in the periphery, and ghost cells without a nucleus were present in the center (Figure, B). Six months after surgery, the wound had healed well, and there has been no recurrence.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pilomatricoma,"1. **Epidermoid Cyst** - Given the slow-growing, nontender nature of the mass and its location.
   
2. **Pilonidal Cyst** - Although more common in the sacrococcygeal area, pilonidal cysts could theoretically occur in other regions, although this is rare in the earlobe.

3. **Lipoma** - Typically presents as a soft, movable subcutaneous nodule, though the firmness described here might lower the likelihood.

4. **Benign Fibrous Histiocytoma** - A benign tumor that can appear as a firm, nodular mass in the dermis or subcutis.

5. **Dermoid Cyst** - A type of benign cystic teratoma that could explain a slow-growing, asymptomatic mass.

6. **Sebaceous Cyst** - Typically presents with a similar appearance and growth pattern, though mostly associated with a punctum.

7. **Calcifying Epithelioma of Malherbe (Pilomatricoma)** - Based on histopathological findings of basaloid cells and ghost cells.

8. **Seborrheic Keratosis** - Generally appears as a pigmented lesion, but variants could potentially mimic described symptoms.

9. **Hemangioma** - Could mimic a nodular mass, though usually presents earlier in life and may have color changes.

10. **Neurofibroma** - Might present as a firm, nodular, painless growth, especially in the setting of neurofibromatosis, though this was not suggested by the history. 

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Calcifying Epithelioma of Malherbe (Pilomatricoma)** - Best explanation given characteristic histopathological findings.
2. **Epidermoid Cyst** - Consistent with a slow-growing, nontender mass.
3. **Dermoid Cyst** - Fits the presentation, though histology was less supportive.
4. **Benign Fibrous Histiocytoma** - Possible but less likely given specific histology.
5. **Lipoma** - Unlikely based on firmness and histological appearance.
6. **Sebaceous Cyst** - Similar presentation but lacks histological support.
7. **Seborrheic Keratosis** - Unlikely given pigmentation is not mentioned.
8. **Hemangioma** - Very unlikely due to age and lack of associated physical changes.
9. **Neurofibroma** - Possible but unlikely due to lack of neurocutaneous markers.

### INPUT:
A man in his 50s was admitted to the hospital with new left-sided nasal congestion, facial pain, and cheek numbness. His medical history included kappa light chain multiple myeloma refractory to multiple chemotherapeutic regimens. He had been admitted 4 months earlier with similar symptoms of facial pain and sinus pressure. At that time, he was found to have persistent sinus mucormycosis, which required multiple rounds of surgical debridement. On this admission, his vital signs were stable, and he was afebrile. Laboratory test results showed a white blood cell count of 0.97 × 109 per liter with absolute neutrophil count of 650 × 106 per liter and platelet level of 17 × 109 per liter. A computed tomography scan showed complete opacification of the left paranasal sinuses (Figure, A). The patient underwent surgical debridement, and a prominent erythematous soft-tissue mass was seen in his left nasal vestibule (Figure, B). The nasal mass was resected for pathologic analysis (Figure, C).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Extramedullary plasmacytoma,"1. **Recurrent Sinus Mucormycosis**: Given the patient's history of mucormycosis and similar presenting symptoms, recurrence of the fungal infection should be considered.

2. **Aspergillosis**: Another fungal infection affecting the sinuses, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with multiple myeloma.

3. **Bacterial Sinusitis**: Although less likely due to the neutropenic state, bacterial sinusitis can cause sinus opacification and facial pain.

4. **Lymphoma**: Considering the patient's history of kappa light chain multiple myeloma, transformation into an aggressive lymphoma could cause a mass.

5. **Carcinoma**: A primary or secondary malignancy developing in the nasal cavity or sinuses could present similarly with a soft-tissue mass.

6. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis**: An autoimmune condition that could cause sinusitis-like symptoms and tissue masses.

7. **Sarcoidosis**: Although less common with the history of specific immunosuppression, sarcoidosis can present with sinonasal involvement.

8. **Invasive Fungal Sinusitis (Non-Mucormycosis)**: Other less common invasive fungal pathogens in immunocompromised patients.

9. **Chronic Invasive Fungal Sinusitis**: A slower, chronic form potentially missed initially due to superimposed acute episodes.

10. **Nasal Polyps**: Unlikely but can cause similar imaging findings and structural abnormalities, usually in the context of chronic sinusitis.

### Reranking Using All Information:
1. **Recurrent Sinus Mucormycosis**: Most likely given history and current presentation.
2. **Aspergillosis**: Plausible given immunosuppressed status.
3. **Carcinoma**: Due to presence of nasal mass and history of malignancy.
4. **Lymphoma**: High risk for secondary hematological malignancy from multiple myeloma.
5. **Invasive Fungal Sinusitis (Non-Mucormycosis)**: Other invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised.
6. **Chronic Invasive Fungal Sinusitis**: Persistent infection that could cause chronic symptoms.
7. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis**: Considered based on autoimmune potential.
8. **Bacterial Sinusitis**: Less likely but possible secondary infection.
9. **Sarcoidosis**: Unlikely but to be excluded.
10. **Nasal Polyps**: Least likely given the patient's immune status and presentation.","['Myeloma', 'Oncology', 'Hematology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Head and Neck Surgery']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50.0,F

### INPUT:
A 39-year-old man with metastatic breast cancer treated with anti-ERBB2 (formerly HER2) chemotherapy (ado-trastuzumab emtansine) presented to the emergency department with acute onset paralysis. Earlier that day he had upper-back muscle spasms while gardening. A few hours later, he developed weakness of both hands and legs, followed by urinary retention and saddle anesthesia. On arrival to the emergency department, the patient was febrile but hemodynamically stable. On physical examination, he had areflexia and weakness affecting all 4 limbs, with a sensory deficit distal to the T4 dermatome. Proprioception and vibratory sensation were intact throughout. Speech, comprehension, and cranial nerves were intact. Laboratory test results revealed elevated levels of inflammatory markers. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, including white and red blood cell counts, protein and glucose levels, infectious studies, and cytologic testing, was unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the total spine showed vertebral body metastases unchanged from a computed tomography scan obtained 8 months prior (Figure 1), multiple areas of new leptomeningeal enhancement around the distal spinal cord, and tumor infiltration of multiple vertebral bodies. An electromyogram showed grossly preserved motor conduction in the upper and lower extremities. F wave latencies (a measure of nerve conduction velocity between the spine and limb) were undetectable in the upper extremities and were normal in the lower extremities, suggesting upper motor neuron disease. Sensory conduction amplitudes of upper and lower extremity peripheral nerves were mildly decreased.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Spinal cord infarct,"1. **Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)**: Given the areflexia, weakness in all limbs, and recent infection, GBS could be considered, but the unremarkable CSF analysis makes it less likely.
   
2. **Transverse Myelitis**: This presents with sensory changes and paralysis, often with a specific sensory level, which aligns with T4 dermatome involvement.

3. **Leptomeningeal Carcinomatosis**: The MRI findings of leptomeningeal enhancement could indicate spread of malignancy affecting the nervous system, causing multifocal neurological symptoms.

4. **Spinal Epidural Abscess**: Fever with acute neurological deficits could suggest an abscess compressing the spinal cord, though MRI showed enhancement but no abscesses.

5. **Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM)**: Often post-infectious or post-vaccination with rapid progression and multi-focal involvement, which can sometimes present with similar symptoms.

6. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**: MS can cause sensory deficit and weakness but typically has demyelinating lesions on MRI, which were not described.

7. **Paraneoplastic Neuropathy**: Given his cancer history, neurological symptoms could be an autoimmune reaction against neural tissue mediated by cancer.

8. **Spinal Cord Infarction**: Often presents acutely and could affect motor and sensory pathways, though typically also shows infarct changes on imaging.

9. **Intramedullary Spinal Cord Tumor**: Can cause similar symptoms due to mass effect within the cord, but there was no indication in the imaging.

10. **Peripheral Neuropathy due to Chemotherapy**: While often distal, sensory deficits and weakness due to chemotherapy toxicity could be a late effect but typically does not cause this acute onset.

### Final Reranking:
1. **Leptomeningeal Carcinomatosis**: Strong correlation with MRI findings and patient history of metastatic breast cancer.
2. **Transverse Myelitis**: Matches sensory level and neurological symptoms but less definitive given imaging results.
3. **Paraneoplastic Neuropathy**: Possible due to cancer history and neurological symptoms without clear infectious or inflammatory evidence.
4. **Spinal Epidural Abscess**: Fever and acute presentation match but less support from imaging.
5. **Spinal Cord Infarction**: Rule in for acute presentation but lacking direct imaging evidence.
6. **Guillain-Barré Syndrome**: Initially fits the weakness and areflexia but lacks CSF findings and cranial nerve involvement typically.
7. **Peripheral Neuropathy due to Chemotherapy**: Less likely given acute presentation and lack of other neurological features.
8. **Intramedullary Spinal Cord Tumor**: Less likely as there was no evidence from imaging.
9. **Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM)**: Unlikely due to lack of specific clinical and MRI findings.
10. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**: Least likely given the clinical presentation and lack of demyelinating lesions on MRI.","['Breast Cancer', 'Neurology', 'Oncology', 'Spinal Cord Disorders', ""Women's Health""]",0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,39.0,F

A 63-year-old woman presented with progressive unsteadiness, malaise, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting of 1 month’s duration. She had recently experienced acute pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, a tonic-clonic seizure, transient episodes with tetaniform stiffness in both upper limbs, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding caused by gastric angiodysplasia, which was treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and argon electrocoagulation. Her medical history included alcohol intake of 2 to 4 drinks daily for several years that had stopped 10 years before admission, hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, dilated ischemic cardiomyopathy, and a stroke 12 years earlier and recovered without sequelae. Her medications included omeprazole, furosemide, atorvastatin, allopurinol, metformin, levetiracetam, and acenocoumarol. Physical examination revealed confusion, dysarthria, appendicular dysmetria with truncal ataxia, and downbeat nystagmus. She was well nourished. Results of blood tests showed a mild creatinine increase of 1.62 mg/dL (normal range, 0.4-1.2 mg/dL; to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4), serum phosphate levels of 2.4 mg/dL (normal range, 2.5-4.5 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.323), corrected calcium levels of 7.1 mg/dL (normal range, 9.0-10.5 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.25), and serum magnesium levels of 0.3 mg/dL (normal range, 1.8-2.5 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.4114). The results of tests for blood cell count, liver function, and thyroid function were normal, as were levels of sodium; potassium; vitamin B12; folic acid; vitamin E; and antinuclear, antineutrophil cytoplasmic, antigliadin, anti–glutamic acid decarboxylase, and anti-transglutaminase antibodies. Cerebrospinal fluid levels were normal, including proteins, glucose, and cell count; polymerase chain reaction for herpes viruses; and enterovirus. Oligoclonal bands (IgG and IgM) were absent, and IgG index was normal. Onconeural and neuronal membrane antibodies were negative in paired samples of cerebrospinal fluid and serum, and included the following: Hu, Yo, Ri, CV2, amphiphysin, Ma2, recoverin, SOX1, titin, Zic4, glutamic acid decarboxylase 65, N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor, contactin-associated protein-like 2, LGT1, γ-aminobutyric acid type B , AMPA1/AMPA2, dipeptidyl-peptidase–like protein 6, and Purkinje cells. Results of whole-body computerized tomography scan and electroencephalogram were normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed hyperintensity on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences without reduced diffusion in the cerebellar nodule (Figure).

8. **Medication-induced ataxia**
   - Possible side effects from her current medications like levetiracetam or acenocoumarol.

9. **Hypocalcemia-related neurological symptoms**
   - Low calcium levels can cause neurological abnormalities including tetany and seizures.

10. **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) complications**
    - Given her history of upper GI bleeding, neurological symptoms might be indirect complications.

**Reranked Differential Diagnosis:**

1. **Hypomagnesemia-induced neurological symptoms**
   - Most consistent with lab findings and patient's symptoms.

2. **Alcohol-related cerebellar degeneration**
   - Long history of alcohol use and cerebellar findings on MRI.

3. **Wernicke's encephalopathy**
   - Fits with triad of symptoms, but less likely without evidence of thiamine deficiency and negative MRI.

4. **Hypocalcemia-related neurological symptoms**
   - Calcium deficiency offers an explanation for her neurological issues.

5. **Medication-induced ataxia**
   - Re-evaluate current medication list for potential side effects.

6. **Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration**
   - Important to keep in differential given her age, even if antibodies are negative.

A 5-month-old girl presented to the emergency department with acute oropharyngeal bleeding that self-resolved. Prior to presentation, she had a several-month history of slow feeding and intermittent noisy breathing. Physical examination revealed inspiratory stridor that was worse when supine. Bedside flexible endoscopy findings revealed a fleshy supraglottic mass obscuring a view of the glottis. The patient’s airway was secured in the operating room with an endotracheal tube over a 0° Hopkins rod. The mass was pedunculated on the lingual surface of the epiglottis and had areas of high vascularity and other areas of thrombosis (Figure, A). The vallecula, aryepiglottic folds, arytenoids, glottis, and subglottis were otherwise uninvolved. A biopsy was obtained, and pathology results revealed relatively high proliferation of small, irregular vessels with plump endothelial cells staining positive for glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) (Figure, B and C).

### INPUT:
A 33-year-old man was referred for evaluation of intermittent esotropia. When playing video games at a distance or when reading, he developed oscillopsia with eyestrain and noted that his right eye turned up and in. He had undergone strabismus surgery for crossed eyes as a young child and more recently had laser in situ keratomileusis performed. He was medically healthy and neurodevelopmentally normal but had been born 4½ weeks premature. There was no family history of strabismus, and he denied diplopia. On examination, corrected visual acuity was 20/30 − 2 OD and 20/15 OS. Both pupils reacted briskly to light with no afferent pupillary defect. He had 1+ apparent overaction of the right inferior oblique and superior rectus muscles. When he was inattentive, his eyes appeared to be straight (Figure 1). Prism and alternate cover testing during near fixation showed a right esotropia and dissociated vertical divergence when fixing with his preferred left eye (Figure 1, left inset) and a larger left esotropia during forced fixation with his right eye (Figure 1, right inset). He had no cycloplegic refractive error, and retinal examination showed no objective torsion. Placement of +3.00 lenses eliminated his esotropia at near but could not be used to alleviate his symptoms at distance, showing a high accommodation-to-convergence ratio.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. Dissociated Vertical Deviation (DVD): The presence of dissociated vertical divergence observed in examination aligns with this diagnosis.
2. High Accommodation-to-Convergence Ratio Esotropia: Symptoms relieved by +3.00 lenses support high AC/A ratio esotropia.
3. Superior Oblique Palsy: Due to apparent overaction of right inferior oblique and superior rectus muscles.
4. Partially Accommodative Esotropia: Improvement with lenses suggests partial accommodation.
5. Sensory Esotropia: History of previous strabismus surgery could lead to sensory esotropia.
6. Consecutive Esotropia: Previous strabismus surgery may result in consecutive esotropia.
7. Decompensated Esotropia: Intermittent esotropia could indicate a decompensating state of a long-standing esotropia.

There was no personal or family history of keloid formation. The boy was otherwise healthy and met normal developmental milestones. On examination of the patient, there were many short, skin-colored, parallel cords on the patient’s anterior neck areas (Figure, A and B). These cords were indurated, slightly raised, and well defined with a shiny surface. The cords had a uniform width of approximately 2 mm, and the lengths varied from 3 mm to 2 cm. During the course of the examination, an ill-defined sclerotic plaque surrounding the underside of the clavicle was found. It had a shiny surface, irregular shape, and measured 10 × 4 cm. No similar lesions were found on any other part of the patient’s body. Inspection of the patient’s skin revealed no abnormal nail fold capillary dilation or hemorrhage; no sclerodactyly, distal digital pitting, or Raynaud disease; and no extracutaneous involvement. A punch biopsy specimen from the affected area was obtained (Figure, C and D).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Morphea,"1. **Morphea (Localized Scleroderma):** Given that the lesions are indurated, well defined, and shiny with a corrugated pattern, morphea is considered due to its presentation of localized, hardened patches of skin.

2. **Hypertrophic Scars:** The indurated cords and shiny surface could initially suggest hypertrophic scarring, although the lack of trauma or inciting event makes this less likely.

3. **Lichen Sclerosus:** Lichen sclerosus can present with shiny, slightly raised plaques, but typically affects the anogenital area and is less common on the neck.

4. **Keloid Formation:** Although the patient has no family history of keloids, this differs from the typical history, but keloids can appear as firm, raised scars.

5. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma:** Given the chronicity and corrugated pattern, cutaneous lymphoma could be considered, though rare at this age without systemic symptoms.

6. **Granulomatous Slack Skin:** This rare form of cutaneous lymphoma could initially present with atypical firm plaques, but is usually associated with systemic involvement.

7. **Erythema Elevatum Diutinum:** This condition features indurated, shiny plaques and papules, though typically it involves extremities more than the neck.

8. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans (DFSP):** A rare neoplasm that can present as indurated skin lesions, though tends to be more nodular and not typically corrugated.

9. **Scleromyxedema:** Known for indurated, shiny plaques with a corrugated pattern, however, it typically presents with systemic involvement.

10. **Pachydermoperiostosis:** Though usually associated with systemic involvement and clubbing, it can present with skin thickening and induration.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Morphea (Localized Scleroderma):** Given the typical presentation with shiny, hardened skin and absence of systemic signs, morphea remains the most likely.
2. **Scleromyxedema:** Despite lack of systemic involvement, the indurated shiny cord-like lesions are consistent.
3. **Lichen Sclerosus:** Less common location but aligns with shiny, indurated plaques.
4. **Hypertrophic Scars:** Absence of trauma makes this less likely but remains in consideration.
5. **Granulomatous Slack Skin:** Uncommon but cannot be completely ruled out without further investigation.
6. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma:** The atypical presentation at this age and lack of systemic symptoms lowers its rank.
7. **Pachydermoperiostosis:** Unlikely due to age and isolated neck involvement without other mannifestations.
8. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans (DFSP):** Although possible, more nodular than the current presentation.
9. **Erythema Elevatum Diutinum:** Locations do not match the common presentation areas.
10. **Keloid Formation:** Highly unlikely given the atypical presentation and lack of inciting trauma.","['Pediatrics', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Dermatology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,-1.0,F

### INPUT:
A 58-year-old man with interstitial cystitis presented for pentosan polysulfate (Elmiron) maculopathy screening. He reported no visual symptoms or ocular history, and routine eye examination results 6 months prior were reportedly normal. He was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis in 2004 and had been taking pentosan polysulfate, 100 mg twice daily, for 4½ years for a cumulative dose of 324 g. His medical history was otherwise significant for moderate bilateral hearing loss detected in early childhood and type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism treated with a therapeutic regimen of metformin, pravastatin, and levothyroxine supplementation, respectively. At presentation, his visual acuity was 20/20−2 OD and 20/20 OS, intraocular pressures by rebound tonometry were normal, and anterior segment examination results were unremarkable. He had trace cortical cataracts and nuclear sclerosis in each eye. Dilated fundus examination in each eye revealed cup-disc ratios of 0.2, mild retinal pigment epithelium mottling, and scattered, deep punctate, hypopigmented lesions. Macular optical coherence tomography imaging demonstrated trace irregularity to the outer retinal bands. Fundus autofluorescence imaging showed irregularly distributed speckled hypoautofluorescence in the posterior pole of each eye (Figure).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Congenital rubella syndrome,"To determine the cause of the patient's retinal changes, we will conduct a differential diagnosis process step-by-step:

1. **Pentosan Polysulfate Maculopathy**  
   The patient has a history of prolonged pentosan polysulfate use, which is associated with characteristic retinal changes.

2. **Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**  
   Given the age of the patient and the presence of retinal pigment epithelium changes, AMD is a consideration.

3. **Diabetic Retinopathy**  
   The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes, which can cause retinal changes.

4. **Retinitis Pigmentosa**  
   Considering the retinal pigment epithelium mottling and potential genetic linkage to hearing loss, though later presentation makes it less likely.

5. **Ear Disorders Related Maculopathy**  
   Bilateral hearing loss detected early in life may suggest a syndromic connection with retinal changes.

6. **Stargardt Disease**  
   Rare, but could be considered given the retinal findings, albeit the late onset makes it less probable.

7. **Pattern Dystrophy**  
   Given the mottling in the retinal pigment epithelium, pattern dystrophy could be entertained.

8. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy**  
   Though less likely given the presentation, some features overlap.

9. **Drug-Induced Retinopathy (non-Pentosan)**  
   Consider other medications or unknown exposures that may cause retinal changes.

10. **Macular Telangiectasia**  
    Late onset but has overlapping imaging findings with speckled hypoautofluorescence.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Pentosan Polysulfate Maculopathy**  
2. **Diabetic Retinopathy**  
3. **Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**  
4. **Pattern Dystrophy**  
5. **Drug-Induced Retinopathy (non-Pentosan)**  
6. **Macular Telangiectasia**  
7. **Retinitis Pigmentosa**  
8. **Stargardt Disease**  
9. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy**  
10. **Ear Disorders Related Maculopathy**

### INPUT:
An 82-year-old man presented to the emergency department with 2 months of diarrhea and 2 weeks of rash. He had sustained a left radius fracture 6 months prior, which resulted in deconditioning and poor appetite. His diet consisted of mostly vegetables, and he lost 4 kg (8.8 lb) during this time. Two months prior, he developed postprandial nonbloody diarrhea that occurred 5 times daily. Two weeks prior, a pruritic rash in his extremities emerged. He had no fever, night sweats, or abdominal pain. Past medical history included chronic nondeforming rheumatoid arthritis, hypothyroidism, and colon adenocarcinoma resected 10 years prior. His medications were prednisolone (1 mg/d) and levothyroxine. On examination, he was afebrile, with blood pressure 90/46 mm Hg; pulse, 90/min and regular; and respirations, 18/min. Body mass index was 16.8 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). He was alert, cognitively intact, and appeared emaciated. Glossitis and a scaly pruritic rash with an erythematous brawny peeling base on his neck and extremities were noted (Figure). Findings on cardiovascular, pulmonary, abdominal, and neurologic examinations were unremarkable.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pellagra,"1. **Celiac Disease:** Given the chronic diarrhea and rash combined with his diet primarily consisting of vegetables, malabsorption and associated dermatitis herpetiformis should be considered.
   
2. **Pellagra (Niacin Deficiency):** The triad of diarrhea, dementia, and dermatitis (which may present as a scaly rash) along with dietary insufficiencies points toward niacin deficiency.

3. **Hypothyroidism Related Dermatitis:** The known hypothyroidism might be contributing to skin changes, although less likely to explain diarrhea.

4. **Adrenal Insufficiency:** Known for causing weight loss, hypotension, and sometimes gastrointestinal symptoms.

5. **Drug Reaction/Allergy:** Prednisolone use can occasionally cause dermal and gastrointestinal side effects that could mimic these symptoms.

6. **Graft-vs-Host Disease (GVHD):** Although requiring a history of transplant, this shows compatible skin and GI symptoms, included for comprehensive analysis.

7. **Zinc Deficiency:** A result of poor diet and poor absorption, leading to rash and diarrhea.

8. **Infectious Colitis (e.g., Giardia):** Given the chronic nature of diarrhea, certain parasites or infections are possible despite the absence of fever.

9. **Dermatomyositis:** Pruritic rash and muscle weakness/deconditioning symptoms, though muscle pain is absent.

10. **Non-celiac Gluten Sensitivity:** Even if celiac disease is ruled out, gluten intolerance still causes similar symptoms without serologic evidence.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Pellagra (Niacin Deficiency):** The constellation of symptoms with nutritional deficiency and classic triad plus pellagrous skin changes makes it the top diagnosis.
2. **Celiac Disease:** Rash and GI symptoms in the context of a certain type of diet keep this as a strong contender.
3. **Zinc Deficiency:** Common and closely associated with poor appetite and nutrient absorption concerns.
4. **Adrenal Insufficiency:** Hypotension and possible weight loss with less classic symptoms render it a valid consideration.
5. **Infectious Colitis (e.g., Giardia):** Persistent diarrhea warrants an investigation for chronic infections such as giardiasis.
6. **Hypothyroidism Related Dermatitis:** Existing hypothyroidism might surprise with a new presentation if other causes were ruled out.
7. **Drug Reaction/Allergy:** Though relatively isolated, potential for drug-induced symptom mimicry exists.
8. **Non-celiac Gluten Sensitivity:** A fallback if primary gluten-related disorder tests negative.
9. **Dermatomyositis:** Unlikely due to the specific nature of presenting symptoms lacking muscle involvement.
10. **Graft-vs-Host Disease (GVHD):** Included due to symptom overlap but requires a history of transplantation.","['Dermatology', 'Geriatrics', 'Nutrition', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology', 'Gastroenterology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,82.0,F

### INPUT:
A 70-year-old White man with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia was referred to our institution for evaluation of bilateral asymmetric corneal lesions by his primary eye care professional. The patient required spectacles for best-corrected visual acuity but otherwise had no other significant ocular complaints. He was not taking medications known to cause corneal depositions, nor was there a known family history of corneal dystrophy. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Slitlamp examination of the cornea of the right eye revealed multiple, discrete nodular opacities in the superior and inferior quadrants without neovascularization or surface elevation. Similar findings were seen in the left eye, but the superior lesions were notable for possessing well-circumscribed, plaquelike features located in the posterior stroma without involvement of the anterior surface (Figure, A). No crystalline changes were noted with these deposits.

A 28-year-old woman presented to her primary care physician for hematochezia. She had previously lived for a few years in Uganda and frequently swam in the Nile River. After returning to the US, she experienced recurrent diarrhea. In April 2018, she had an appendectomy for acute appendicitis. In February 2019, 22 months after her return from Uganda, she developed intermittent hematochezia. She had no vomiting, fever, or weight loss during this time. On evaluation, vital signs were normal and abdominal examination showed a soft, nontender abdomen. Rectal examination was normal. A complete blood cell count and comprehensive metabolic panel were notable for a normal hemoglobin level and an absolute eosinophil count of 304 cells/μL. Results of testing including stool microscopy, HIV fourth-generation assay, hepatitis B serologies, and a rectal swab for gonorrhea and chlamydia were negative. A colonoscopy demonstrated granular mucosa in the rectum. Internal hemorrhoids were present, but there were no masses, vascular malformations, or other abnormalities.

### INPUT:
A man in his 50s presented with an edematous, massively enlarged right auricle. The patient had immigrated to Israel 9 years before admission. He was adamant that the lesion had been present since early childhood but had gradually increased with a recent appearance of foul-smelling otorrhea. On examination, the auricle was markedly enlarged, edematous, and encircled by an erythematous, indurated plaque partially covered with a fine scale (Figure 1A). Diascopy revealed an “apple jelly” appearance. There was no local or distant lymphadenopathy; general physical examination findings were unremarkable.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Lupus vulgaris,"1. **Lupus vulgaris**: The chronic skin changes and ""apple jelly"" appearance on diascopy are suggestive of cutaneous tuberculosis, particularly lupus vulgaris, which can present similarly.

2. **Leishmaniasis**: Given the patient's travel history and geographic location, cutaneous leishmaniasis is a possibility.

3. **Chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis**: This could explain chronic auricular changes, although foul-smelling otorrhea is unusual.

4. **Psoriasis**: Chronic plaque psoriasis with secondary infection could account for the presentation.

5. **Sarcoidosis**: The ""apple jelly"" appearance could suggest sarcoidosis involving the skin.

6. **Wegener's Granulomatosis**: Though typically involving the respiratory tract, granulomatous involvement of the ear is possible.

7. **Relapsing Polychondritis**: This condition affects cartilage, could present with chronic auricular changes, but typically also affects other cartilaginous structures.

8. **Lyme Disease**: Although less typical, Borrelia infection could lead to chronic skin changes.

9. **Chronic Otitis Externa**: While this would typically result in more limited symptoms, secondary changes could lead to chronic plaque formation.

10. **Tertiary Syphilis**: Chronic gummatous syphilis could present with chronic ear changes.

### Reranked Diagnoses:
1. **Lupus vulgaris**: The combination of apple jelly appearance, induration, fine scales, and foul-smelling otorrhea strongly suggests this diagnosis.
2. **Leishmaniasis**: Given geographic context and chronic skin changes, remains a strong consideration.
3. **Sarcoidosis**: The ""apple jelly"" appearance keeps this high on the list.
4. **Psoriasis**: Chronic nature and presence of scale maintain its position.
5. **Wegener's Granulomatosis**: Possible, given granulomatous inflammation, though less likely without other systemic involvement.
6. **Chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis**: Still possible, though typical presentation differs.
7. **Relapsing Polychondritis**: Possible, yet less likely due to lack of other symptoms and systemic involvement.
8. **Tertiary Syphilis**: Considered due to possible chronic gummatous changes, but other symptoms would be expected.

### INPUT:
A 78-year-old woman presented with decreased visual acuity and hypopyon in her right eye. She had a history of Philadelphia chromosome–positive acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (attributable to treatment with the tyrosine-kinase inhibitor [TKI] imatinib), and diabetes. She had senile dementia but did not complain of constitutional symptoms. Her visual acuity was 20/80 OD and 20/32 OS, and her intraocular pressures were 31 mm Hg OD and 16 mm Hg OS. A slitlamp examination of the right eye showed redness, with small, white, nongranulomatous keratic precipitate as well as a cataract. Her iris was diffusely thickened and the anterior chamber was slightly shallow, with 4+ cells and white hypopyon, which did not change position with head movements (Figure 1). There was also an extensive rubeosis iridis (Figure 1) with posterior synechiae in the right eye. The left anterior chamber was normal. A fundus examination had unremarkable results in both eyes. A complete blood cell count had normal results, and her hemoglobin A1c level was 16.5%. A syphilis test result was negative.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Intraocular relapse of ALL,"To establish a differential diagnosis for the presented clinical scenario, we need to consider various possible conditions that could explain the symptoms and findings:

1. **Infectious Endophthalmitis:** Often presents with hypopyon and decreased visual acuity.
  
2. **Non-infectious Uveitis:** Can present with anterior chamber inflammation and hypopyon.
   
3. **Acute Glaucoma:** Given the elevated intraocular pressure in the right eye.
   
4. **Leukemic Infiltration:** Considering the patient's history of acute lymphocytic leukemia.
   
5. **Retained Lens Material:** Post-cataract extraction patients may present with inflammation.
   
6. **Iris Neovascularization (Neovascular Glaucoma):** The rubeosis iridis is a key feature.
   
7. **Diabetic Retinopathy:** Complications such as neovascularization could occur with elevated hemoglobin A1c.
   
8. **Drug-Induced Uveitis:** Secondary to her TKI treatment for leukemia.
   
9. **Ocular Ischemic Syndrome:** Often leads to neovascularization of the iris due to systemic vascular issues.
   
10. **Anterior Segment Ischemia:** This might result in neovascular changes and inflammation.

### Final Rerank Based on Complete Evaluation and Tests:

1. **Neovascular Glaucoma:** The presence of extensive rubeosis iridis, elevated IOP, and history of diabetes makes this highly probable.
  
2. **Leukemic Infiltration:** Due to her history of acute lymphocytic leukemia, ocular involvement should be considered.
   
3. **Drug-Induced Uveitis:** TKI treatment association with Stevens-Johnson syndrome suggests possibility.
   
4. **Diabetic Retinopathy with Neovascularization:** Poor diabetic control as indicated by HbA1c level contributes to neovascular changes.
   
5. **Non-Infectious Uveitis:** Secondary to systemic conditions like her drug reactions or leukemia.
   
6. **Anterior Segment Ischemia:** Due to vascular issues, albeit less common.
   
7. **Infectious Endophthalmitis:** Less likely due to presentation and chronicity without systemic infection signs.
   
8. **Ocular Ischemic Syndrome:** Although possible, less likely due to lack of systemic findings.
   
9. **Acute Glaucoma:** The primary feature was the IOP difference but could be secondary to iris neovascularization.
   
10. **Retained Lens Material:** Unlikely unless there was recent surgical history not noted here.

### INPUT:
A man in his late 30s was evaluated by the dermatology inpatient consult service for a 4-day history of perianal pain. His medical history included systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and external hemorrhoids. Six months before admission, he underwent a deceased donor kidney transplant. One month before presentation, he was hospitalized for acute cellular transplant rejection managed with systemic corticosteroids, belatacept, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus therapies. His immunosuppressive regimen at the time of dermatologic evaluation consisted of prednisone, 5 mg daily, and mycophenolate mofetil, 500 mg twice daily. On admission, he was afebrile and normotensive; laboratory results were notable for an elevated creatinine level of 1.43 mg/dL (reference range, 0.40-1.30 mg/dL) (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 92 × 103/μL [reference range, 140-440 × 103/μL] [conversion to ×109 per liter is 1:1). He developed diarrhea 1 day after admission. Fecal leukocytes were absent. Stool antigen test results for cryptosporidium, giardia, and rotavirus were negative. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results for campylobacter, norovirus, salmonella, shigella, Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli 1 and 2, Vibrio cholerae, and Yersinia enterocolitica in the stool were negative. Antigen and toxin test results for Clostridium difficile in the stool were positive. Total body skin examination was notable for 1- and 3-cm tender, round perianal ulcers with a clean base. Another 4-mm round ulcer was present at the superior intergluteal cleft (Figure, A). There were no ocular or oral ulcers. A biopsy specimen of a perianal ulcer border was obtained for histopathologic analysis (Figure, B-D).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cytomegalovirus infection,"To develop a differential diagnosis for the described case, step by step:

1. **Herpes Simplex Virus Infection** - Given the presentation of perianal ulcers, this common viral infection should be considered.
2. **Cytomegalovirus Colitis** - Particularly relevant in immunosuppressed patients; can cause perianal ulcers.
3. **Varicella Zoster Virus (Shingles)** - The occurrence of painful lesions in immunosuppressed individuals suggests this possibility.
4. **Dermatologic Manifestation of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus** - Given the patient's history, this could potentially cause ulcerative lesions.
5. **Behçet's Disease** - Characterized by recurrent oral and genital ulcers but could present atypically in an immunosuppressed patient.
6. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum** - Given the clean base ulcer description, this autoimmune condition could be considered.
7. **Inflammatory Bowel Disease-Associated Dermatitis** - Such conditions can present with perianal ulcers and are associated with gastrointestinal symptoms.
8. **Infectious Proctitis (non-HSV/CMV related)** - Could arise due to bacterial infections, especially in the context of immunosuppression and recent diarrhea.
9. **Drug-Induced Ulceration** - Certain drugs, particularly in an immunosuppressed patient, can cause ulcerative lesions.
10. **Anal Carcinoma** - Though less common in this age group, the immunosuppression and ulcer presentation warrants its consideration.

After reviewing all patient information and test results, the reranked differential diagnosis would be:

1. **Clostridium difficile Infection (C. difficile colitis)** - Positive antigen and toxin test results point strongly towards this as a cause for diarrhea; perianal ulceration is possible with severe cases.
2. **Herpes Simplex Virus Infection** - Consistent with perianal pain and ulcerative presentation.
3. **Cytomegalovirus Colitis** - Strong suspicion given the history of recent organ transplantation and immunosuppression.
4. **Varicella Zoster Virus (Shingles)** - Relevant in an immunocompromised state with painful lesions.
5. **Dermatologic Manifestation of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus** - Potential flare due to immunosuppressive therapy alteration.
6. **Behçet's Disease** - Less likely but possible given unusual presentation in immunosuppressed patients.
7. **Inflammatory Bowel Disease-Associated Dermatitis** - Supported by diarrhea but less likely without established IBD diagnosis.
8. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum** - Requires more specific skin appearance for strong consideration.

### INPUT:
A 48-year-old woman with a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and obstructive sleep apnea presented with a rash over her right foot accompanied by 1 week of episodic fever, diaphoresis, and headaches. Six weeks prior, she fell from a ladder and had right nondisplaced medial malleolar and comminuted talar fractures. The fractures were managed nonsurgically in a controlled ankle movement boot, with resolution of swelling and bruising. On current presentation, her temperature was 38.2 °C (100.8 °F); heart rate, 88/min; respiratory rate, 18/min; and blood pressure, 102/65 mm Hg. She was well appearing with normal cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations. There was trace right lower extremity edema localized to the ankle and normal pedal pulses. Erythema without warmth was present over the right ankle and dorsomedial foot, along with nontender, nonpalpable purpura over the dorsum of the foot and scattered petechiae over the right lower leg (Figure). When the leg was elevated above the level of the heart, the surrounding erythema faded.

### INPUT:
A 19-month-old girl presented for evaluation of widespread edema and acute dermatitis. Following an upper respiratory tract infection 1 month prior, she developed disseminated red, scaly patches and a progressive eruption of hyperpigmented and hypopigmented patches of skin. She had occasional nonbloody loose stools but no fevers or vomiting. Although she was otherwise well, her growth had fallen from the 75th to the 25th percentile for height and weight over the preceding 9 months, and she could speak only 2 words. Her medical history was notable for atopic dermatitis and diarrhea in infancy that prompted allergy testing at age 6 months; she was subsequently diagnosed with milk, egg, and peanut allergies. Her parents avoided feeding her these foods, providing her only soy-based milk and formula, with improvement of dermatitis, until age 1 year. Since then her diet had consisted of multiple rice milk feeds daily, supplemented only with pureed fruits and vegetables, pasta, snack puffs, and sunflower butter. The patient had no history of meconium ileus or family history of cystic fibrosis. There was no recent travel and no changes to the home environment. On presentation, the patient was irritable, with normal vital signs. She displayed prominent labial swelling and pitting edema of the legs bilaterally. Skin examination was notable for erythematous, denuded patches with peeling scale and reticulate hyperpigmentation, accentuated on the abdomen, back, diaper area, and extensor extremities (Figure; left panel). Notably, her skin also demonstrated widespread patches of hypopigmentation, with an accompanying band of hypopigmentation proximally at the site of newest hair growth (Figure; right panel).

After considering all the clinical details and potential diagnoses, let's rerank these hypotheses:

1. **Kwashiorkor** - The dietary history indicates a primarily rice-based diet with possible protein-energy malnutrition, which could explain the widespread edema and dermatitis.
2. **Acrodermatitis enteropathica** - Although zinc deficiency (typical for this condition) could cause similar dermatitis and growth issues, the dietary history does not suggest low zinc intake.
3. **Celiac disease** - The presence of GI symptoms and growth delay could suggest a malabsorption disorder, although there's no mention of wheat in the diet typically associated with gluten sensitivity.
4. **Biotinidase deficiency** - The skin and neurological symptoms could be explained by a vitamin deficiency due to dietary restrictions, but biotin sources do not seem restricted.
5. **Nutritional rickets** - The diet lacks variety, implying possible vitamin D or calcium deficiency, which fits the growth concerns, though skin symptoms are less typical.
6. **Phenylketonuria** - Although having some growth and developmental delay, her dietary intake does not match typical PKU restrictions and symptoms.
7. **Langerhans cell histiocytosis** - This disease fits some skin findings and could cause growth failure, yet lacks the compelling match with her dietary history and symptoms.
8. **Chronic granulomatous disease** - Immune disorders might explain her recurrent dermatitis but do not align well with the current symptom set.
9. **Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)** - Presents with recurrent infections and growth delay but lacks the detailed connection to dietary intake and current symptoms.
10. **Dermatitis herpetiformis** - Typically associated with celiac disease, could fit skin symptoms, but unlikely without specific dietary gluten exposure symptoms.","['Dermatology', 'Nutrition', 'Pediatrics']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1.0,M

### INPUT:
A woman in her 60s presented as a transfer from an outside hospital. The division of dermatology was consulted for evaluation of lesions on the face, chest, back, and arms that were gradually increasing in size and number over the past year. Physical examination revealed leonine facies with madarosis and an eschar on the nasal dorsum (Figure, A). Red-to-brown dome-shaped papules coalescing into plaques were present on the upper extremities. The lesions were nontender and nonpruritic. Cervical and axillary lymph nodes were palpable. The patient had a muffled voice and reported shortness of breath with exertion. Results of laboratory investigation demonstrated marked leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 77.5 × 103/uL with 76.5% lymphocytes. No blasts were present on peripheral smear. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis demonstrated multiple enlarged mediastinal, axillary, subpectoral, abdominopelvic, and inguinal lymph nodes. Small pulmonary nodules were also detected. A punch biopsy was obtained from the right arm (Figure, B, C, and D).

### INPUT:
A 16-year-old girl with acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage developed tender, 1- to 2-cm erythematous plaques and nodules during treatment with chemotherapy. Previously, she had been well, with morphological remission found on a recent bone marrow biopsy. The patient had no significant dermatological history, except an allergy to cashew nuts and a prior episode (6 mo) of urticaria during a platelet transfusion that had resolved with 1 dose of oral antihistamine. The patient’s medications included ondansetron, aprepitant, prednisolone, and oxycodone (supportive care initiated with chemotherapy), and long-term posaconazole and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole treatment. Lesions were noted on day 2 of the fourth cycle of a chemotherapy regimen comprising fludarabine, cytarabine, and filgrastim (G-CSF). Initially present over the distal limbs, palms, and soles, the lesions progressed to the proximal limbs and lower trunk during 24 hours (Figure, A and B). The patient developed a fever, which we extensively investigated. Intravenous cefotaxime was commenced, but because no infectious source was identified, the fever was thought to be secondary to cytarabine.

9. **Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD)**  

10. **Autoimmune Vasculitis (e.g., Cutaneous Small Vessel Vasculitis)**  

**Revised Differential Diagnosis:**

1. **Sweet's Syndrome (Acute Febrile Neutrophilic Dermatosis)** - The temporal relationship with chemotherapy, presence of fever, erythematous nodules, and plaques, and known association with hematological malignancies like leukemia make Sweet's Syndrome the most likely diagnosis.

2. **Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS Syndrome)** - Considered due to drug exposure history, but the rapid development and localization of lesions are more consistent with Sweet's Syndrome.  

3. **Leukemia Cutis** - Unlikely with the patient's current remission status, but must always be considered in patients with leukemia.

4. **Erythema Multiforme** - Considered, but less likely given the absence of target lesions typically associated with EM.

5. **Fixed Drug Eruption** - Unlikely due to the generalized progression of lesions; fixed drug eruptions typically occur at the same site.  

6. **Pseudomonas aeruginosa Infection (Ecthyma gangrenosum)** - Unlikely given no identified infectious source and location of lesions.

7. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (SJS/TEN)** - Less likely due to the absence of mucosal involvement and the characteristic skin blistering seen in SJS/TEN.

8. **Viral Exanthem (e.g., associated with Herpes Simplex Virus)** - Not fitting the clinical presentation and investigation results.

9. **Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD)** - Possible if history suggested prior transplantation, but no such history given.

10. **Autoimmune Vasculitis (e.g., Cutaneous Small Vessel Vasculitis)** - Considered unlikely with clinical presentation favoring Sweet's Syndrome instead.

After reevaluating all information and clinical findings, Sweet's Syndrome remains the top differential given the acute febrile condition, rapid emergence of erythematous lesions, history of leukemia and chemotherapy, and exclusion of other conditions by clinical and laboratory investigations.","['Pediatric Cancer', 'Cutaneous Drug Reactions', 'Hematology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Leukemias']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,M

### INPUT:
An 18-year-old woman with unremarkable medical history was referred to the oculoplastics service for evaluation of progressive gradual-onset ptosis and ophthalmoplegia in both eyes in the past 2 years (Figure). She had emigrated from Ghana 2 years before but denied any illness there. Her visual acuity without correction was 20/20 OD and 20/20 OS, although she had to manually elevate her eyelids to see the Snellen chart. She had no movement of the right eye past midline in elevation, adduction, depression, and abduction and no movement of the left eye past midline in elevation, depression, and abduction, with 50% deficit of adduction. Her external examination results were notable for a margin reflex distance 1 of −4 mm OU and a levator function of 0 OU. On funduscopic examination, her optic nerves were sharp and pink without atrophy, maculae and retinal vasculature were normal, and peripheral retina appeared normal without pigment abnormalities. A review of systems was negative for fatigue, generalized muscle weakness, or neurologic deficits.

2. **Myasthenia Gravis**: Typically presents with ptosis and ophthalmoplegia, but the absence of fatigability or generalized muscle weakness makes it less likely.

3. **Kearns-Sayre Syndrome**: The presence of ophthalmoplegia and ptosis fit the profile, but lack of retinal pigment changes or systemic symptoms makes it a secondary consideration.

4. **Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy**: Characterized by ptosis and ophthalmoplegia; however, usually presents later in life making it less likely.

5. **Congenital Fibrosis of the Extraocular Muscles**: Causes restrictive ophthalmoplegia, but typically presents with congenital patterns and may have structural abnormalities.

6. **Graves' Orbitopathy**: Can cause ophthalmoplegia, but typically includes proptosis and other thyroid-related symptoms, which are absent here.

7. **Chronic Progressive Ophthalmoplegia with Ptosis due to Myotonic Dystrophy**: Generally associated with myotonia or systemic symptoms, which are not present here.

8. **Mitochondrial DNA Depletion Syndromes**: Can cause progressive myopathy and external ophthalmoplegia, considered due to mitochondrial involvement.

9. **Duane Syndrome**: Limited eye movement due to congenital abnormalities of ocular nerve supply; lacks progressive nature or ptosis.

10. **Strabismus Fixus**: Can involve severe ophthalmoplegia due to adherence of ocular muscles but typically apparent from infancy.

### INPUT:
A previously healthy young adult presented with 1 week of fatigue, palpitations, and dyspnea on exertion, preceded by fever, myalgias, sore throat, and cough. Emergency department evaluation noted a heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure of 173/90 mm Hg, and a temperature of 37.1 °C. An electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm with complete heart block (CHB) and a narrow QRS junctional escape at 65 beats per minute (Figure, A). Investigation revealed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 30 mm/h (normal limits, 0-15 mm/h) and a C-reactive protein level of 6.3 mg/dL (reference range, 0.0-1.0 mg/dL [to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10.0]). Tests for kidney function, hepatic function, a complete blood cell count, troponin T levels, creatine kinase levels, thyrotropin levels, antinuclear antibodies, and rheumatoid factor had normal results, and tests for anti–streptolysin O and anti–DNAse B titers, Lyme IgG and IgM titers, Coxiella burnetti and Bartonella serologies, Epstein-Barr virus serology, and cytomegalovirus quantification had negative results. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no structural abnormalities, while fluorine 18–labeledfluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography (FDG-PET–CT) showed a small focal area of FDG uptake in the region of the membranous septum (Figure, B). Systemic FDG uptake was absent. A CT showed no hilar adenopathy or pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities. Over the next 48 hours, the patient’s junctional rhythm accelerated to 90 beats per minute with ventriculoatrial block before acutely degenerating to a narrow complex escape rhythm of 45 beats per minutes associated with lightheadedness (Figure, C).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Viral myocarditis,"1. **Myocarditis** - Given the presentation with preceding viral-like symptoms and the development of complete heart block, myocarditis could be considered as a potential cause.

2. **Sarcoidosis** - The presence of conduction abnormalities and evidence of focal FDG uptake can suggest cardiac sarcoidosis.

3. **Idiopathic Fibrosis of the Conduction System (Lenègre's Disease)** - In a young adult, idiopathic degeneration of the conduction system can lead to heart block.

4. **Infective Endocarditis** - Although less likely given the negative serological studies and echocardiogram results, it's a consideration due to heart block occurrence.

5. **Cardiac Tumor (e.g., Rhabdomyoma or Fibroma)** - An intraseptal mass could cause conduction disturbances, although more structural abnormalities might be expected on imaging.

6. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy** - This typically presents with structural heart abnormalities, but a variant could impact conduction pathways.

7. **Drug-Induced Cardiotoxicity** - Although not suggested by history, unrecognized medication use can cause heart block and should be considered.

8. **Autoimmune Myocardial Involvement (e.g., Lupus, Rheumatoid Arthritis)** - Despite negative serologies, subclinical autoimmune processes could affect cardiac conduction.

9. **Congenital Heart Block** - Although more common in neonates, undiagnosed milder cases could present later in life.

10. **Acute Coronary Syndrome** - Although atypical with normal troponin levels, rare cases can present predominantly with conduction issues without evident ischemic symptoms.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Myocarditis** - High likelihood given clinical presentation and imaging findings.
2. **Sarcoidosis** - Conduction abnormalities and specific FDG-PET findings suggestive.
3. **Idiopathic Fibrosis of the Conduction System (Lenègre's Disease)** - Common cause of complete heart block in younger individuals.
4. **Autoimmune Myocardial Involvement** - Even with negative serologies, subclinical involvement remains possible.
5. **Infective Endocarditis** - Persistent consideration with negative results due to atypical manifestations.
6. **Drug-Induced Cardiotoxicity** - Possibility remains without clear medication history.
7. **Congenital Heart Block** - Less likely, due to age of presentation, but still a possible consideration.
8. **Cardiac Tumor** - Less likely given limited imaging evidence.
9. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy** - Uncommon presentation without structural abnormalities.

Physical examination revealed petechiae within a poorly demarcated erythematous patch on the left dorsal foot (Figure 1, left panel), splinter hemorrhages on the right thumbnail (Figure 1, center panel), and petechial macules on the palms and soles, most numerous on the distal digits. There was no murmur or plop on cardiac auscultation. Neurologic examination findings were significant for left eye nystagmus and inability to adduct the right eye on left gaze, consistent with right-sided internuclear ophthalmoplegia. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head showed 2 acute infarcts in the right cerebellum. Results of laboratory testing were notable for mild leukocytosis (12.2 × 109/L), mild thrombocytosis (439 × 109/L), and elevated troponin level (4.4 ng/mL); results of a comprehensive metabolic panel and the remainder of the complete blood cell count were normal. An electrocardiogram showed T-wave inversions in lead V2, consistent with a non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Transthoracic echocardiogram and cardiac CT angiography (Figure 1, right panel) were performed.

A 68-year-old man presented to the emergency eye clinic with a 3-week history of progressive left eye redness and discomfort unresponsive to topical antibiotics or lubricants, as prescribed by his optometrist. The intraocular pressure (IOP) was raised (26 mm Hg) and was treated with a topical β-blocker. Otherwise, his condition was managed conservatively for presumed viral conjunctivitis. He self-presented 6 days later with intermittent visual blurring, mild eyelid swelling, and conjunctival chemosis. The IOP remained raised (24 mm Hg). An inflammatory or allergic etiology was suspected; therefore, topical corticosteroids and a prostaglandin analogue were also prescribed. One week later at planned follow-up, the patient had dilated and tortuous bulbar blood vessels (Figure 1). Further interrogation of the history revealed a left-sided nonspecific dull headache, constant for the previous 2 months, and an annoying “whooshing” noise in the patient’s left ear.

Final diagnosis: Rett syndrome.  
Case report: A 42-year-old man presented with clinical features of microcephaly, short stature, intellectual disability, severe degree of scoliosis, gait abnormality, and encephalopathy (Figure, A and B). He was born in 1973 at 38th week of gestation followed by a normal delivery (weight, 3.15 kg and head circumference, 42 cm) to nonconsanguineous parents. The head size was normal at birth, and no other abnormalities were seen during his infancy. At age 2 years, his parents noticed that he had delayed motor and language milestones. He experienced a progressive developmental delay such as reduction of head growth, loss of acquired communication, and loss of motor functions between ages 9 and 12 years. The severity of scoliosis increased with age, and he became a wheelchair user at age 18 years. He was referred to us at age 40 years with the characteristic features of growth deceleration (height, 142 cm; weight, 22 kg; body mass index, 11 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]), apraxia, left-sided hemiplegia, spasticity, sleep apnea, constipation, osteoporosis, hypoalgesia, and repetitive hand tapping (Video). Blood reports showed anemia (hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL; to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10) and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (47 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259). There was no history of autistic behavior, vision or hearing impairments, or epilepsy. The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with T wave inversion (V3-V6), and echocardiography showed mild cardiomegaly. The brain magnetic resonance imaging studies showed a diffuse reduction in the corpus callosum involving splenium and enlarged right ventricle, resulting in cerebral lateral ventricular asymmetry (Figure, C).

### INPUT:
A well-appearing 14-month-old boy was referred for the evaluation of recurrent left subconjunctival hemorrhage with increasing frequency since 7 months of age. Multiple prior office visits with referring ophthalmologists during which eyes were dilated showed normal results. Clinical examination revealed 180° of left interior subconjunctival hemorrhage with overlying conjunctival elevation and mild fullness of the left lower eyelid (Figure 1A). Fixation was central, steady, and maintained bilaterally, with full ocular motility and absence of appreciable proptosis. Penlight anterior segment examination demonstrated normally formed anterior segment structures without inflammation or hyphema in either eye, although the left eye exhibited a small intraocular lightly pigmented lesion at the 5-o'clock limbus. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) was deemed appropriate and further demonstrated normal intraocular pressures bilaterally. Handheld slitlamp examination localized the left eye 2-mm limbal lesion on the posterior corneal surface. The surrounding corneal and iris structures were normal appearing without evidence of vascularization. Ultrasound biomicroscopy was used to further evaluate both the intraocular lesion and better characterize the left lower eyelid fullness. This demonstrated no iris, angle, or ciliary body involvement by the intraocular lesion. A 10-MHz contact B-scan examination showed a large inferior orbital lesion measuring more than 17 mm in the anterior-to-posterior dimension (Figure 1B). Doppler ultrasonography did not demonstrate significant flow to suggest a vascular cause.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Metastatic neuroblastoma,"1. Nevus: Given the description of a small intraocular lightly pigmented lesion, a nevus could be a possible diagnosis.
2. Orbital dermoid cyst: The large inferior orbital lesion with no significant vascular flow could suggest a dermoid cyst.
3. Juvenile xanthogranuloma: Presence of orbital mass in children and ocular involvement might suggest a condition like juvenile xanthogranuloma.
4. Capillary hemangioma: Despite lack of significant blood flow on Doppler, capillary hemangiomas can cause similar presentations in young children.
5. Langerhans cell histiocytosis: Could present with orbital masses and require consideration.
6. Lymphangioma: Exhibiting as a mass lesion in the orbit without noticeable blood flow.
7. Rhabdomyosarcoma: A malignant orbital tumor in children that must be included in the differential diagnosis.
8. Congenital cystic eye: A rare possibility where a cystic lesion could appear in the eye region.
9. Retinoblastoma: Although typically intraocular, it is a critical consideration in lesions affecting ocular function in children.
10. Sarcoidosis: Although less common, it can present with orbital masses and intraocular involvement.

A 27-year-old man with history of heroin use presented with syncope. He was standing and laying out a blanket for his dog before passing out. He denied prodromal symptoms and reported this was his first syncopal episode. He reported a few episodes of dizziness in the couple days prior to presentation but denied chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or the recent use of illicit drugs or new medications. Shortly after arrival at the emergency department, he had a 50-second run of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. His vital signs and the results of his physical examination were normal. Troponin levels, thyroid levels, and the results of a complete blood cell count and metabolic panel were all normal. The results of imaging studies, including echocardiography, computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography, and brain CT, were also unremarkable. Coronary angiography found no evidence of obstructive coronary disease. The results of the urine toxicology test were negative.

### INPUT:
A 7-year-old African American boy without significant medical history presented with progressive painless right-sided neck swelling for 2 months. Initially, he experienced fever and sore throat. Physical examination findings demonstrated minimally tender and nonmobile 4-cm right submandibular space swelling. Laboratory examination findings were significant for leukocytosis with neutrophilia (white blood cell count, 19.8 K/μL; neutrophil count, 18.2 K/μL [to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001]), anemia (hemoglobin level, 9.6 g/dL [to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0]), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (>130 mm/h), and elevated C-reactive protein level (3.1 mg/dL [to convert to mg/L, multiply by 10]). Ultrasonography revealed multiple enlarged hyperemic lymph nodes within the right side of the neck, the largest measuring 3.4 × 2.4 × 2.1 cm in the submandibular space. He was treated with oral antibiotics without improvement. Ultrasonography at 1-month follow-up revealed interval enlargement of the lymph nodes, which appeared rounded in shape, without preservation of internal architecture. The mother reported that the patient lost 3.2 kg in 2 months, without any chills or night sweats, difficulty swallowing or breathing, change in voice, abdominal pain, recent travel, or exposure to animals or pets. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated extensive unilateral right-sided neck adenopathy, the largest nodes measuring approximately 4 cm at level IB; an approximately 2-cm destructive mass involving the left maxillary malar eminence; and additional lesions involving the T4 vertebra and upper sternum (Figure, A and B). Fluorodeoxyglucose 18F-labeled positron emission tomography with computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) demonstrated extensive FDG-avid right-sided cervical lymphadenopathy and innumerable FDG-avid lytic foci involving the axial and appendicular skeleton (Figure, C).

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:

1. Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis - Given the presence of lytic bone lesions, loss of weight, and cervical adenopathy, Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis is strongly considered.
2. Hodgkin Lymphoma - The progressive and extensive lymphadenopathy with systemic symptoms such as weight loss could suggest Hodgkin Lymphoma.
3. Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma - Similar to Hodgkin Lymphoma, could account for the presentation but slightly lower on the list given typical age and presentation differences.
4. Metastatic Neuroblastoma - Considered due to bone involvement and weight loss in a child.
5. Tuberculosis Lymphadenitis - Still possible given cervical adenopathy and anemia but less likely without systemic symptoms like night sweats or recent travel.
6. Acute Leukemia - The combination of anemia and leukocytosis with bone involvement could suggest this, but the predominant neck symptomatology makes it less likely.
7. Cat Scratch Disease - Less likely given the lack of improvement with antibiotics and the systemic spread to bones.
8. Sarcoidosis - Possible but less likely considering the significant bone lesions and age.
9. Osteomyelitis - Unlikely given the systemic nature and chronic progression without significant pain or fever.
10. Infectious Mononucleosis - Possible mild contributor to cervical adenopathy but does not explain systemic findings or bone involvement.","['Head and Neck Surgery', 'Radiology', 'Neuroimaging', 'Neurology', 'Otolaryngology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.0,F

### INPUT:
A healthy 21-year-old Chinese woman with no relevant medical history presented to multiple general practitioners for a recurrent sore throat associated with hoarseness of voice for 3 months’ duration. Despite having taken multiple courses of oral antibiotics, she saw no improvement in her symptoms. Over the course of 3 months, the patient went on to notice swelling and redness of her left ear (Figure 1A) that would resolve and recur every few weeks.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Relapsing polychondritis,"To approach this differential diagnosis, we need to consider multiple systems and potential conditions that could cause these symptoms. Let's take it step by step:

1. **Chronic Pharyngitis**: Given the sore throat and hoarseness without improvement with antibiotics, chronic pharyngitis is a potential cause.

2. **Recurrent Tonsillitis**: Recurrent sore throat and hoarseness could be indicative of recurrent tonsillitis, which may not respond to antibiotics if it's viral or caused by resistance.

3. **Laryngopharyngeal Reflux**: Hoarseness and sore throat worsening over months can be due to acid reflux affecting the larynx and pharynx.

4. **Allergic Rhinitis**: This can cause post-nasal drip leading to chronic sore throat and may co-exist with ear symptoms due to eustachian tube dysfunction.

5. **Autoimmune Disease (e.g., Lupus or Sjögren’s Syndrome)**: Autoimmune conditions can manifest with persistent sore throat, hoarseness, and ear symptoms due to inflammation.

6. **Infectious Mononucleosis**: Presents with sore throat, sometimes hoarseness, and potential lymphadenopathy or swelling of various nodes which may affect the ear area.

7. **Vocal Cord Nodules or Polyps**: Could account for the hoarseness over a long duration especially if no improvement is noted with medications.

8. **Polychondritis**: Recurring swelling of the ear (redness and resolving) and potentially affecting other cartilaginous areas like the larynx.

9. **Chronic Sinusitis**: Might cause post-nasal drip leading to sore throat and could exacerbate ear symptoms due to blocked sinuses.

10. **Neoplasm (e.g., Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma)**: Must consider malignancy in prolonged symptoms especially hoarseness and ear involvement without resolution.

**Reranking considering all patient information and potential lab/imaging results:**

1. **Polychondritis**: The recurring ear swelling is particularly suggestive in combination with voice involvement.
2. **Autoimmune Disease (e.g., Lupus or Sjögren’s Syndrome)**: Given systemic potential and broad manifestations.
3. **Laryngopharyngeal Reflux**: Very common with symptoms aligning with acid exposure.
4. **Chronic Pharyngitis**: Chronic inflammation due to various causes (infectious or non-infectious).
5. **Vocal Cord Nodules or Polyps**: Long-standing hoarseness aligns with non-infectious voice issues.
6. **Allergic Rhinitis**: Could explain chronic throat and ear symptoms via post-nasal drip and eustachian tube dysfunction.
7. **Recurrent Tonsillitis**: Typically more acute with fever, less likely in this chronic state.
8. **Chronic Sinusitis**: While possible, the recurring ear swelling is less typical.
9. **Infectious Mononucleosis**: Ear symptoms uncommon for this.
10. **Neoplasm**: Less likely in a healthy 21-year-old without other risk factors but still necessary to exclude if symptoms persist after initial investigations.","['Laryngology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Head and Neck Surgery']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,21.0,M

### INPUT:
The patient is a 48-year-old woman with a history of a rectal adenocarcinoma (cT3N2bM0) diagnosed 9 years prior. Following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, low anterior resection, and 6 cycles of adjuvant FOLFOX therapy (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin), she had developed a lung metastasis (KRAS wild type) 1 year later. She subsequently developed multiple lung metastases treated with palliative local interventions (lobectomy, radiofrequency ablation) and 4 lines of chemotherapy. Owing to symptomatic lung disease, she was enrolled in a clinical trial (NCT03502733) following informed consent and achieved a confirmed partial response. After 9 months, contrast computed tomography restaging scans noted a new, 1-cm posterior subglottic lesion of unclear origin (Figure, A). She had no shortness of breath or noisy breathing, dysphagia, voice change, or hemoptysis. A partial response was maintained without evidence of progression of lung disease.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma,"1. **Metastatic Disease Relapse** - Given the patient's history of metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma with lung metastases, a new lesion could represent a site of disease recurrence.

2. **Primary Lung Cancer** - Considering the patient's known lung involvement, the new lesion could potentially represent a primary cancer of the lung.

3. **Laryngeal Papilloma** - Subglottic lesions could potentially be benign, such as papillomas, especially in the absence of respiratory symptoms.

4. **Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - A malignancy originating in the laryngeal area is a possibility, given the new subglottic location.

5. **Granulomatous Disease (e.g., Sarcoidosis)** - Granulomatous diseases can cause new lesions in the respiratory tract and could potentially explain the new finding.

6. **Vascular Lesion (e.g., Hemangioma)** - It's possible the subglottic lesion is a vascular malformation like a hemangioma, though less common.

7. **Benign Neoplasm (e.g., Fibroma)** - A benign tumor could present as a new lesion in the subglottic region.

8. **Infectious Process (e.g., Fungal or Bacterial Infection)** - Infections can form lesions in respiratory tissues, such as those seen in immunocompromised states.

9. **Radiation-Induced Changes** - Given the prior treatment history, the new lesion could represent changes induced by past radiotherapy.

10. **Amyloidosis** - Systemic conditions like amyloidosis can manifest as subglottic masses.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Metastatic Disease Relapse** - Likely given patient's cancer history.
2. **Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - Considered due to the new subglottic lesion.
3. **Primary Lung Cancer** - Less likely but possible considering the residual pulmonary context.
4. **Granulomatous Disease (e.g., Sarcoidosis)** - Possible due to the unusual location of the lesion.
5. **Radiation-Induced Changes** - Possible considering history of exposure.
6. **Infectious Process (e.g., Fungal or Bacterial Infection)** - Less likely without symptoms.
7. **Benign Neoplasm (e.g., Fibroma)** - Plausible but lower on the differential.
8. **Laryngeal Papilloma** - Uncommon in this patient's age and clinical context.
9. **Vascular Lesion (e.g., Hemangioma)** - Unlikely without associated symptoms.
10. **Amyloidosis** - Uncommon presentation, rare diagnosis.","['Colorectal Cancer', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gastrointestinal Cancer', 'Oncology', 'Otolaryngology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,48.0,M

A 69-year-old man returning from a vacation in Cuba was brought to the emergency department directly from the airport. His medical history was unremarkable, and he had no allergies. He had been well until 2 hours before the flight home, when at the Havana airport, he developed generalized weakness, increased sweating, severe nausea, and vomiting. In flight, he had lethargy, vomiting, and urinary incontinence. On arrival to the emergency department, he was stuporous and required intubation. Initial laboratory tests showed a hemoglobin level of 10.9 g/dL (reference range, 12.0-15.2 g/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10.0]), a creatinine level of 1.31 mg/dL (reference range, 0.51-1.08 [to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4]), and a pH of 7.22 with a normal anion gap. Serum electrolyte levels; a white blood cell count; levels of glucose, creatine kinase, lactic acid, and thyrotropin; coagulation studies; and liver function tests had normal results. An electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia at 53 bpm and borderline QT interval prolongation (QTc; 465 milliseconds). A urine toxicology screen had negative results for acetaminophen, salicylates, opiates, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, and ethanol. Cerebrospinal fluid was clear, with normal levels of glucose, total protein, and white blood cells and negative microbiology and cytology testing results. A malaria smear and antigen test, respiratory viral assay, and cultures of cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and urine had negative results. Computed tomography of the head showed bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi (Figure 1). Within several hours, his level of consciousness improved spontaneously, and he was extubated. His blood pressure was 99/61 mm Hg; pulse, 80 bpm; temperature, 37.6 °C; and oxygen saturation, 99% on room air. The patient was alert but disoriented. The pupils were 2 mm and reactive. Involuntary facial muscle twitching was noted. His muscle tone was normal, and he had mild proximal muscle weakness with occasional bilateral upper extremity and lower extremity fasciculations and jerky movements. Deep tendon reflexes were normal, with flexor plantar responses. His sensations to pain and vibration were normal.

A 9-year-old, vaccinated girl with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and β-thalassemia trait presented with 1 month of progressive dyspnea, snoring, dysphagia, and weight loss. Both parents had a history of latent tuberculosis infection treated after immigrating to the US from Syria shortly after the patient’s birth. The patient’s pediatrician diagnosed her with reactive airway disease and adenotonsillar hypertrophy. She was referred to the otolaryngology clinic, where flexible laryngoscopy revealed diffuse upper airway lymphoid hyperplasia and supraglottic edema. She was sent to the emergency department, where she was stridulous and afebrile with a normal white blood cell count and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. A computed tomography scan of the neck revealed diffuse edema and contrast enhancement of the nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and supraglottis. A chest radiograph was normal. The patient was taken urgently to the operating room for direct microlaryngoscopy (Figure 1A and B) and intubated. Results of biopsies and cultures of the tonsils, adenoids, and supraglottis revealed diffuse non-necrotizing granulomas (Figure 1C) and oropharyngeal flora with negative acid-fast bacilli and Grocott methenamine silver stains. She remained intubated, and treatment with systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics was initiated. During this time, she had a normal angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level and normal titers for antinuclear antibody (ANA), cytoplasmic antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody, perinuclear antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody, antimyeloperoxidase antibody, antiproteinase 3 antibody, anti–double-stranded DNA antibody, Smith antibody, Sjogren antibodies, and histoplasma antibodies. She also had normal results on tuberculin purified protein derivative and interferon-γ release assay (QuantiFERON; Qiagen).

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. Sarcoidosis - Although ACE levels are normal, sarcoidosis remains a strong candidate due to the presence of non-necrotizing granulomas and lack of positive infectious causes.
2. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis - Considering the diffuse granulomatous inflammation and airway involvement, GPA remains a possibility despite negative autoantibody tests.
3. Relapsing polychondritis - The presence of cartilage-related airway involvement makes this a relevant consideration.
4. IgG4-related disease - Systemic involvement and granulomatous inflammation could suggest this diagnosis despite normal serology.
5. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor - A rare tumor that presents with airway obstruction and granulomas, though more common in solitary masses.
6. Lymphoproliferative disorder - Could account for lymphoid hyperplasia and granulomas, especially if atypical lymphocytes are undetected in preliminary testing.
7. Foreign body reaction - Unlikely, given the extensive and diffuse nature of the symptoms and negative biopsy staining for common foreign materials.
8. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis - Although rare, systemic presentations can include granuloma formation.
9. Subglottic stenosis - Typically involves circumferential airway narrowing rather than granulomas but remains a possible consideration.

### INPUT:
A 44-year-old White woman presented with a 15-year history of dull midline lower back pain associated with bilateral hip pain. She also noted bilateral hand pain along the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints and prolonged morning stiffness lasting approximately 45 minutes. Family history was notable for a brother with osteoarthritis, hypogonadism, and type 2 diabetes. Vital signs were within normal limits (heart rate, 92/min; blood pressure, 136/84 mm Hg; respiratory rate, 16/min; oxygen saturation, 97%; temperature, 37.0 °C). Musculoskeletal examination revealed swelling of the second, third, and fifth MCP joints and second and third PIP joints bilaterally as well as decreased knee and hip range of motion with minimal knee effusions. Lower back flexion was decreased with only 4-mm excursion on the modified Schober test. Results of cardiopulmonary, abdominal, neurologic, and dermatologic examinations were unremarkable. Results of laboratory testing, including complete blood cell count, basic metabolic panel, and liver function tests, were within normal limits, and results for HLA-B27 were negative. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 8 mm/h and C-reactive protein level was 0.5 mg/dL. A plain radiograph of the hands (Figure, left panel) showed hook-like osteophytes at the second and third MCP joints bilaterally as well as asymmetric joint swelling in multiple MCP and PIP joints.

**Analysis**: 
The hook-like osteophytes and asymmetric joint involvement in the MCP and PIP joints with minimal inflammation and negative HLA-B27 test make Hemochromatosis a more likely diagnosis given the family history of osteoarthritis and known complications of iron deposition in joints. Osteoarthritis is still a strong possibility due to the patient's hand and hip joint findings. Psoriatic arthritis is considered due to the joint pattern, despite absence of skin lesions. Ankylosing Spondylitis, despite the back pain and sacroiliac involvement, is less likely without HLA-B27 positivity and lower inflammatory markers.","['Osteoarthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Radiology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,44.0,M

A 19-year-old White man who was previously in good health, with no reported history of drug abuse, presented with progressive bilateral nasal airway obstruction, crusting, and saddle nose deformity over a 6-month period. The patient denied systemic symptoms, including oral ulcers, sicca, photosensitivity, dermatitis, or arthralgias. His medical history had negative results for allergic rhinitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, epistaxis, nasal trauma, or surgery. His family history was noncontributory. An in-office nasal endoscopy demonstrated synechiae bridging from the septum to the lateral nasal walls, polypoid changes, and yellow crusting bilaterally. His immune workup showed elevated complement C3 (200 mg/dL) and total hemolytic complement (CH50; >60 U/mL) levels, with otherwise unremarkable levels of C4, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, rheumatoid factor, Sjögren antibodies, angiotensin-converting enzyme, antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, bullous pemphigoid IgG antibodies, and quantitative immunoglobulins and IgG subclasses (IgG4, 53 mg/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 0.01]). Nasal cultures had positive results for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides. Preoperative computed tomography showed no evidence of paranasal mucosal disease or bone erosion. An operative endoscopy with elevation of the mucoperichondrial flaps revealed an absence of the quadrangular cartilage caudal struts and irregular, friable tissue along the cartilage and perichondrium. Surgical pathology examination demonstrated prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate (Figure, A), angiocentric fibrosis with a relative lack of eosinophils (Figure, B), and increased IgG4 absolute count (up to 50 cells per high-power field), although an IgG4-IgG ratio that was only slightly elevated (0.2) (Figure, C and D).

### INPUT:
A boy younger than 2 years presented with a 7-month history of an inflammatory plaque on his left index finger (Figure, A). This lesion had started as a light erythema a few months before, initially oriented as a bacterial paronychia or herpetic whitlow and treated with an oral antibiotic (amoxicillin) and antiviral (acyclovir) without improvement. There was no relevant medical history. The family reported living in a rural area on the Mediterranean coast.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cutaneous leishmaniasis,"To approach this differential diagnosis, we will consider the age of the patient, chronicity and nature of the lesion, prior treatments that failed, and environmental and geographical factors. 

1. **Warts (Verruca vulgaris)**
   - Common in children and can present as plaques; commonly found on fingers and often unresponsive to antibiotics and antiviral treatments.

2. **Molluscum Contagiosum**
   - Common viral infection in children; typically presents as flesh-colored, dome-shaped papules; requires careful examination to differentiate.

3. **Scrofuloderma (Cutaneous Tuberculosis)**
   - Given the rural setting and chronicity, a mycobacterial infection such as cutaneous tuberculosis is possible, especially if there's any contact with cattle.

4. **Fungal infection (Dermatophytosis)**
   - Chronic plaques that are resistant to antibacterial and antiviral treatment can be indicative of a fungal infection.

5. **Chronic Paronychia**
   - Chronic inflammation due to irritation or allergy; less likely due to lack of response to treatments but still possible.

6. **Psoriasis**
   - Rare for such young children, but can present as chronic plaques and be mistaken for infections.

7. **Contact Dermatitis**
   - An allergic reaction especially given rural exposure, but would have been likely to respond to removal from allergens.

8. **Epidermodysplasia Verruciformis**
   - Extremely rare condition leading to widespread HPV-related skin lesions; still needs consideration because of its appearance.

9. **Infantile acropustulosis**
   - Sparse, recurrent pustules on hands and feet, but worth considering due to the site of the lesion.

10. **Granuloma annulare**
   - Also common in children; presents as ring-like structures and can occur on the fingers.

### Reranking Based on All Information and Tests:
After considering all aspects like the chronicity, resistance to initial treatments, geographical and environmental exposure:

1. **Warts (Verruca vulgaris)**
2. **Fungal infection (Dermatophytosis)**
3. **Scrofuloderma (Cutaneous Tuberculosis)**
4. **Molluscum Contagiosum**
5. **Psoriasis**
6. **Chronic Paronychia**
7. **Contact Dermatitis**
8. **Granuloma annulare**
9. **Infantile acropustulosis**
10. **Epidermodysplasia Verruciformis**

### INPUT:
A 71-year-old woman with no history of smoking was referred to our tertiary center in August 2018 for an asymptomatic left level 5 neck mass that had been present for 6 months. Biopsy of the mass demonstrated metastatic p16-positive (human papillomavirus [HPV]-related) squamous cell carcinoma. Examination revealed a large left base of tongue mass filling the vallecula. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated an enhancing mass within the left base of tongue and bilateral cervical adenopathy. The patient was treated with concurrent radiation therapy and cetuximab, completing treatment without breaks in November 2018. Her 3-month posttreatment fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography/CT (FDG-PET/CT) imaging results demonstrated resolution of the activity at the base of tongue mass and the involved cervical lymph nodes, consistent with complete treatment response. In July 2019, the patient presented with a palpable left supraclavicular lymph node. Restaging FDG-PET/CT demonstrated avid supraclavicular and anterolateral neck adenopathy. Additionally, there was moderately intense activity isolated to the left thyroid lobe. Ultrasonography of the thyroid demonstrated a 4-cm mass within the gland, and subsequent biopsy was performed with immunohistochemistry staining positive for p16, CK5, and p40 and negative for thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) (Figure, A, B). After multidisciplinary review of the case, the patient was offered salvage left modified radical neck dissection and total thyroidectomy. Surgical pathology confirmed the diagnosis (Figure, C).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Metastatic HPV-related Squamous Cell Carcinoma**  
   - Initial diagnosis confirmed by biopsy for the neck mass and base of tongue.

2. **Primary Undiagnosed Squamous Cell Carcinoma (Base of Tongue)**  
   - Primary site identified through examination and imaging.

3. **Metastatic Involvement of Cervical Lymph Nodes**  
   - Based on CT imaging showing bilateral cervical adenopathy.

4. **Supraclavicular Lymph Node Metastasis**  
   - New palpable lymph node noted in July 2019 with PET/CT scan confirming avidity.

5. **Thyroid Metastasis from Squamous Cell Carcinoma**  
   - Identified by intense FDG uptake on PET/CT scan and ultrasonography revealing a mass.

6. **Other Squamoproliferative Lesions of the Thyroid**  
   - Considered based on atypical presentation within the thyroid.

7. **Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma**  
   - Potential due to aggressive features and rapid clinical development.

8. **Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma**  
   - A distinct but rare possibility based on location and imaging patterns.

9. **Lymphoma of the Thyroid or Cervical Lymph Nodes**  
   - Differentiation necessary due to the presence of lymph node involvement.

10. **Benign Thyroid Nodules with Secondary Infection/Inflammation**  
    - Unlikely considering the PET-avid activity, but part of comprehensive rule-out.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Metastatic HPV-related Squamous Cell Carcinoma (Primary and Thyroid Involvement)**
   - Maintained as the primary diagnosis due to consistent biopsy and imaging results.

2. **Primary Undiagnosed Squamous Cell Carcinoma (Base of Tongue)**
   - Initial primary site explaining metastasis path.

3. **Metastatic Involvement of Cervical Lymph Nodes**  
   - Logical progression of primary disease leading to cervical lymphadenopathy.

4. **Supraclavicular Lymph Node Metastasis**
   - Consistent with metastatic spread pattern seen in re-staging.

5. **Thyroid Metastasis from Squamous Cell Carcinoma**  
   - Supported by biopsy, PET/CT findings, and immunohistochemistry consistent with primary squamous cancer.

6. **Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma**
   - Retained due to the thyroid’s atypical involvement by metastatic SCC.

7. **Other Squamoproliferative Lesions of the Thyroid**  
   - Less likely but considered due to the thyroid's involvement.

8. **Lymphoma of the Thyroid or Cervical Lymph Nodes**  
   - Unlikely due to biopsy results but remains differential given nodal involvement.

9. **Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma**
   - Considered rare and less consistent with immunohistochemistry profile.

10. **Benign Thyroid Nodules with Secondary Infection/Inflammation**  
    - Least likely given the context of metastasis and diagnostic imaging/biopsy findings.

### INPUT:
A 41-year-old woman presented with a 7-month history of episodes of back and abdominal pain associated with nausea, vomiting, and flushing. Immediately following workup with noncontrast abdominal ultrasonography, she experienced intense flushing and vomiting. Subsequent contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging identified a 5-cm thoracic paraspinal mass (Figure, A). Computed tomography–guided biopsy of the paraspinal mass revealed a dense cellular infiltrate on histopathology composed of cells with round nuclei and abundant pale cytoplasm (Figure, B).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Mastocytoma,"1. **Pheochromocytoma** - Given the symptoms of flushing, abdominal pain, and the presence of a paraspinal mass, this is a possible diagnosis.

2. **Carcinoid Tumor** - These tumors can cause symptoms such as flushing and abdominal pain due to the release of vasoactive substances.

3. **Paraganglioma** - Similar to pheochromocytomas, these tumors can secrete catecholamines and may cause similar symptoms and are often located paraspinally.

4. **Neuroendocrine Tumor** - Could cause the systemic symptoms described due to hormone release, often found in areas like the gastrointestinal tract but can present as masses.

5. **Mastocytosis** - Can lead to episodic flushing and gastrointestinal symptoms due to mast cell degranulation, but typically presents with cutaneous signs.

6. **Lymphoma** - Though less common with flushing, lymphomas can present as paraspinal masses and cause generalized symptoms.

7. **Metastatic Disease** - Some metastatic cancers, such as melanoma or renal cell carcinoma, could present with similar symptoms and radiological findings.

8. **Ganglioneuroma** - A rare soft tissue tumor that can present as a paraspinal mass; symptoms may align if secreting vasoactive substances.

9. **Hemangioblastoma** - While more common in the CNS, these can occasionally present outside and may lead to similar systemic symptoms if hormonally active.

10. **Schwannoma** - Typically benign nerve sheath tumors that can occasionally present as paraspinal masses with less systemic symptoms.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Paraganglioma** - Due to the location and symptoms aligned with catecholamine secretion.
2. **Pheochromocytoma** - Very similar presentation to paraganglioma; however, less common outside adrenal gland.
3. **Neuroendocrine Tumor** - Flushing and abdominal pain are consistent with systemic hormone release.
4. **Carcinoid Tumor** - Capable of causing similar symptoms, although most common in a different anatomical location.
5. **Ganglioneuroma** - Rare but potential for symptomatic presentation if hormonally active.
6. **Schwannoma** - Usually benign, less likely to cause systemic symptoms but aligns with locational findings.
7. **Mastocytosis** - Systemic symptoms fit, but lack of skin involvement and biopsy results make it less likely.
8. **Lymphoma** - Unlikely due to the specific mass findings and typical absence of flushing.
9. **Metastatic Disease** - Possible due to mass presence but systemic symptoms less characteristic without known primary site.
10. **Hemangioblastoma** - Least likely given typical CNS location and less common presence of flushing or hormonal activity in paraspinal masses.","['Allergy and Clinical Immunology', 'Hematology', 'Oncology', 'Hematologic Cancer']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,41.0,M

### INPUT:
A 56-year-old woman with hypertension presented with 2 weeks of acute ptosis in the left upper eyelid. Three weeks prior, the patient had noted severe left-sided facial pain. She denied any diplopia, decreased vision, or recent trauma. The patient had previously been evaluated by her primary care physician and referred to a neuroophthalmologist. During the course of the workup, she had undergone computed tomography (CT) of the head and chest, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, and carotid duplex ultrasonography. Following a workup with unremarkable results, the patient presented to the Bascom Palmer emergency department for a second opinion. On initial examination, her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Intraocular pressure, ocular motility, and confrontational visual fields were normal. There was no axial proptosis or enophthalmos by exophthalmometry. The pupil was 5 mm OD and 4 mm OS. No afferent pupillary defect was observed. External examination demonstrated a left-sided ptosis (Figure 1). Anhidrosis was not observed. Anterior and posterior examination, including of the optic nerve head, had normal results in both eyes. The cranial nerve, gross motor, and gross sensory examination had otherwise unremarkable results. The patient’s blood pressure was 160/79 mm Hg.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Horner syndrome,"1. **Horner's Syndrome** - Based on the ptosis, anisocoria, and absence of diplopia.
2. **Third Cranial Nerve Palsy** - Considered due to ptosis, but unlikely given lack of ophthalmoplegia or pupillary involvement.
3. **Migraine Headache with Ocular Symptoms** - Could present with ptosis and facial pain; however, her visual function is normal.
4. **Trigeminal Neuralgia** - Given the history of severe left-sided facial pain.
5. **Myasthenia Gravis** - Ptosis with possible fluctuating symptoms could suggest this neuromuscular disorder.
6. **Cluster Headache** - Severe unilateral pain with autonomic features could be relevant, although typical symptoms like tearing are not reported.
7. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome** - Painful ophthalmoplegia, although exam results were unremarkable.
8. **Giant Cell Arteritis** - Though less common with normal vision and the patient's age and headache symptoms warrant consideration.
9. **Carotid Artery Dissection** - Possible due to facial pain and anisocoria, although imaging was unremarkable.
10. **Intracranial Mass or Lesion** - Unlikely but still possible considering resistance to initial workup and symptoms.

### Reranked List of Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Horner's Syndrome** - Strongest candidate due to ptosis, anisocoria, and non-revealing imaging.
2. **Trigeminal Neuralgia** - Due to severe facial pain and no other ocular symptoms or vision changes.
3. **Myasthenia Gravis** - Considering isolated ptosis and potential fluctuation in symptoms.
4. **Migraine Headache with Ocular Symptoms** - Given the nature of the pain and demographic considerations.
5. **Cluster Headache** - Still consider due to autonomic symptom overlap.
6. **Third Cranial Nerve Palsy** - Remains a differential because ptosis is present.
7. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome** - Continued consideration though less likely.
8. **Giant Cell Arteritis** - Less likely due to lack of systemic symptoms.
9. **Carotid Artery Dissection** - Weakened by negative imaging but symptomatically relevant.
10. **Intracranial Mass or Lesion** - Unlikely given clean advanced imaging but can account for atypical presentation.","['Hypertension', 'Neuro-ophthalmology', 'Neurology', 'Vascular Surgery', 'External Eye Disease']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,56.0,M

### INPUT:
A 34-year-old woman presented with a 3-month history of progressive, unilateral lower lip and chin numbness and ipsilateral facial fullness. The hypoesthesia was limited to the distribution of the mandibular branch of the left trigeminal nerve (V3). On review of systems, the patient denied experiencing visual changes, dizziness, headaches, oral or neck pain, voice changes, weight or appetite changes, or swallowing dysfunction; however, she did report biting her lip occasionally due to the numbness. On examination, there were no palpable masses noted in the head, neck, or face. Aside from the V3 sensory deficit, the patient had no cranial nerve deficits. The patient had no significant medical history; prior surgical history was notable for tonsillectomy. Magnetic resonance imaging of the face revealed a T1 isointense, T2 hyperintense 5.9-cm lesion in the left masticator space, which appeared to be centered in the lateral pterygoid muscle with benign-appearing remodeling of the posterior maxillary wall (Figure).

### INPUT:
An older adult presented with a history of a mildly pruritic plaque on the elbow at the site of a prior injury. The medical history was unremarkable, and findings of a review of systems were negative. The patient had been treated in the past with topical steroids without improvement, and the size of the lesion had continued to grow slowly. Physical examination findings revealed a solitary, well-circumscribed pink plaque with overlying yellow-white micaceous scale with interspersed punctate hemorrhagic crusts (Figure, A). Lymphadenopathy was not identified. Punch biopsy for histopathologic examination was performed, with representative sections shown (Figure, B and C).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Sporotrichosis,"1. **Psoriasis Vulgaris** - Considered due to the presence of a plaque with silvery scale, though the steroid resistance and persistent growth are atypical.

2. **Lichen Planus** - Could potentially present with pruritic plaques but would expect more violaceous hue and Wickham's striae.

3. **Bowen's Disease (Squamous Cell Carcinoma in situ)** - Given the history of prior injury and failure to respond to steroids, a neoplastic process must be considered.

4. **Nummular Eczema** - Typically presents as itchy coin-shaped plaques, however, usually more response to topical steroids is expected.

5. **Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus** - Often presents with photosensitivity and can have persistent plaques, but histology would typically show different findings.

6. **Mycosis Fungoides (Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma)** - Can initially mimic benign dermatoses and is often refractory to standard dermatologic treatments.

7. **Granuloma Annulare** - Characterized by annular plaques which are usually not scaly, hence, less likely.

8. **Psoriasiform Keratosis** - A solitary lesion, often mistaken for psoriasis but resistant to standard treatments.

9. **Chronic Cutaneous Sarcoidosis** - Presents with chronic plaques, but would expect more systemic involvement or other symptoms.

10. **Pigmented Purpuric Dermatosis** - Characterized by capillary leakage resulting in petechiae, but less likely with the described presentation.

### INPUT:
A previously healthy 64-year-old woman was referred for a neuro-ophthalmological evaluation of bilateral optic nerve head edema that was noticed 2 months previously during a routine optometric examination. She denied having any symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (ICP), including headaches, pulsatile tinnitus, and transient visual obscurations. Findings on computed tomography of the brain without contrast were unremarkable. She was then seen by an ophthalmologist who confirmed bilateral severe optic nerve edema and requested magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits without contrast. It demonstrated signs of increased ICP, including empty sella, posterior flattening of the globes, and widened optic nerve sheaths, but no other abnormalities (Figure 1A).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Papilledema,"1. Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH)

2. Optic Neuritis

3. Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)

4. Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (AION)

5. Multiple Sclerosis

6. Sarcoidosis

7. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)

8. Syphilis

9. Vitamin A toxicity

10. Malignant Hypertension 

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) - The combination of signs of increased ICP without other abnormalities on imaging aligns with a diagnosis of IIH, especially in the absence of symptoms typical of optic neuropathies or inflammatory conditions.

2. Malignant Hypertension - Could cause raised ICP and bilateral optic disc edema, but is less likely due to the absence of systemic symptoms or history.

3. Vitamin A toxicity - May present with signs of raised ICP but is much less common.

4. Sarcoidosis - Can cause optic neuropathy and increased ICP, but typically would have other systemic symptoms.

5. Syphilis - May result in optic nerve involvement and other neurological manifestations but would typically show more systemic signs.

6. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) - Can cause ocular and neurological diseases, but with a lack of systemic symptoms, it is less likely.

7. Optic Neuritis - Typically presents unilaterally with pain and vision changes, making bilateral presentation with only disc edema unlikely.

8. Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO) - Would likely have other ophthalmic findings, such as retinal hemorrhages.

9. Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (AION) - Presents with sudden vision loss and not usually increased ICP.

10. Multiple Sclerosis - Could cause optic neuritis, but again, typically associated with different symptomatology.

In summary, the presentation most clearly aligns with Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension considering the imaging, absence of direct symptoms, and typical exclusions.","['Neuro-ophthalmology', 'Neurology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Ophthalmic Imaging', 'Retinal Disorders']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,64.0,M

### INPUT:
A man in his 40s presented to an outside ophthalmologist with a 3-day history of an inferior scotoma in his right eye. His Snellen visual acuities were 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. His intraocular pressures were 21 mm Hg OD and 14 mm Hg OS. The right eye had a relative afferent pupillary defect and mild optic nerve edema. To rule out optic neuritis, a magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain and orbits was obtained; the results were unremarkable. Six days after symptom onset, his visual acuity decreased to 20/70 OD and the disc edema increased. In addition, the right eye had developed 2+ anterior chamber cell, keratic precipitates, and a possible branch vein occlusion. At this time the patient was referred to our clinic. On presentation 1 day later, visual acuity was light perception OD and still 20/20 OS. The right eye had 3+ anterior chamber cell, inferior keratic precipitates, and 1+ vitreous cell. The right optic nerve had grade 4 disc edema with flame-shaped peripapillary hemorrhages. The fundus examination results of the right eye revealed the following superior quadrant retinal findings: extensive intraretinal and preretinal hemorrhages along vessels, arteriolar attenuation and sheathing, venous engorgement, and tortuosity. The inferior midperiphery had numerous small areas of deep retinal whitening (Figure 1). Examination results of the left eye were normal.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Acute retinal necrosis,"1. **Optic Neuritis** - Initially suspected due to mild optic nerve edema and visual acuity decline, but MRI unremarkable makes this unlikely.
2. **Anterior Uveitis** - Presence of anterior chamber cells and keratic precipitates in the right eye suggests ocular inflammation.
3. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)** - Initial suspicion with findings of venous engorgement and retinal hemorrhages.
4. **Ischemic Optic Neuropathy** - Considered due to optic nerve edema and decreased visual acuity.
5. **Viral Retinitis (e.g., HSV, VZV)** - Consider possible infectious cause of retinal whitening and hemorrhages.
6. **Sarcoidosis** - Possible systemic inflammatory condition affecting the optic nerve and eye.
7. **Lupus Vasculitis** - Autoimmune condition that can cause retinal vasculitis and ischemia.
8. **Behçet's Disease** - Multi-system inflammatory disorder that could lead to eye inflammation and retinal vasculitis.
9. **Syphilitic Uveitis** - Consider infectious cause with potential for wide-ranging ocular involvement.
10. **Leber’s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)** - Potential hereditary optic neuropathy complication, though less likely due to acute presentation and uveitis.

### Reranked differential diagnosis:
1. **Viral Retinitis** - Strongly considered due to visual decline, whitening, and hemorrhages.
2. **Syphilitic Uveitis** - Important to rule out due to possibility of treatable infectious cause.
3. **Behçet's Disease** - Systemic condition fitting multiple findings of inflammation.
4. **Anterior Uveitis** - Significant finding of anterior chamber cell and keratic precipitates.
5. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)** - Venous changes seen warrant consideration.
6. **Lupus Vasculitis** - Autoimmune cause that fits the pattern of vasculitis.
7. **Ischemic Optic Neuropathy** - With presence of optic nerve and vessel changes.
8. **Sarcoidosis** - Possibility given the ocular inflammatory findings.
9. **Leber’s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)** - Consider uveitis and neuropathy link.

A 75-year old man with a history of follicular lymphoma and breast cancer presented with a 3-month history of gradual vision loss and 1-month history of confusion and difficulty with word finding. He had been diagnosed with hormone receptor–positive right breast cancer 8 years prior and underwent lumpectomy and treatment with an aromatase inhibitor, with remission since. Five years later, he subsequently developed left inguinal adenopathy, which biopsy results showed was follicular lymphoma. At that time, he was treated with a course of bendamustine and rituximab with subsequent maintenance treatment with rituximab for 2 years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed, demonstrating T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity in the left occipital and temporal lobes, crossing the corpus callosum and extending into the right occipital lobe without enhancement (Figure).

### Reranked Diagnosis

1. Primary CNS Lymphoma: Given the patient's history of follicular lymphoma and the brain MRI findings, this remains the most likely diagnosis.

2. Glioblastoma Multiforme: The patient's age and MRI findings support this as a differential diagnosis, particularly the pattern of crossing the corpus callosum.

3. Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML): Considering the patient's history of rituximab therapy, PML emerges as a plausible diagnosis due to immunosuppression.

4. Metastatic Breast Cancer to the Brain: The history of breast cancer increases the likelihood of metastatic disease despite a long remission.

5. CNS Vasculitis: The pattern on the MRI and symptoms such as confusion and word-finding difficulty could suggest CNS vasculitis.

6. Viral Encephalitis: Depending on if infectious causes were ruled out, it could explain neuro symptoms but less likely without enhancement.

7. Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM): Less likely but plausible given demyelinating pattern seen in the MRI.

8. Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy: Possible due to age, but MRI findings do not typically correlate with this diagnosis.

9. Alzheimer's Disease: Could explain cognitive difficulties but unlikely given MRI findings at this stage.

10. Radiation Necrosis: Previous cancer treatments could lead to this, but the presentation and history make it a less likely potential diagnosis.","['Infectious Diseases', 'Neurology', 'Oncology', 'Neuroimaging', 'Hematology']",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,75.0,F

A woman in her 60s presented for evaluation of asymptomatic skin lesions on the chest that had been stable since onset 4 months prior. Her medical history was significant for hyperlipidemia, familial polyposis, and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) for which she had undergone an allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant 13 months earlier. Cutaneous examination revealed green-gray nodules and plaques on the left and right upper chest (Figure 1). Bilateral cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph node chains were negative for adenopathy. The patient had not attempted measures to alleviate the nodules and denied experiencing exacerbating factors or pain. Biopsies of the skin lesions were performed.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Chloroma,"```markdown
### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Chloroma** - Due to the history of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and the green-gray coloration of the skin lesions.
2. **Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)** - Considering the history of an allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.
3. **Leukemia cutis** - Possible recurrence related to AML.
4. **Cutaneous metastasis** - Based on the patient's age and history of leukemia.
5. **Amyloidosis** - Possible given the nodular skin lesions.
6. **Primary cutaneous lymphoma** - Considered due to isolated skin lesions.
7. **Lichen planus** - Due to asymptomatic nodules and possible medication history.
8. **Sarcoidosis** - Due to possible systemic involvement despite lack of lymphadenopathy.
9. **Cutaneous sarcoidosis** - Similar presentation as the systemic with focus on the skin.
10. **Seborrheic keratosis** - Common benign skin lesions that could fit the description in an older demographic.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Chloroma** - The top hypothesis due to direct correlation with AML and unique coloration.
2. **Leukemia cutis** - Strong possibility related to AML that could present in skin lesions.
3. **Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)** - Less specific to color but plausible post-transplant.
4. **Primary cutaneous lymphoma** - Potential isolated presentation.
5. **Cutaneous metastasis** - Unlikely for nodular persistent lesions without known primary, but age and history warrant scrutiny.
6. **Sarcoidosis** - Fits some skin manifestation profiles, even with negative adenopathy.
7. **Cutaneous sarcoidosis** - Worth considering given autoimmune background post-transplant.
8. **Amyloidosis** - Less likely due to coloration specificity.
9. **Lichen planus** - Low certainty given rarity of green-gray presentation.
10. **Seborrheic keratosis** - Benign but less likely due to unique features and medical history.

### INPUT:
A 55-year-old man from the Southeastern US with a history of smoking, poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A1c level, 15.5%), and chronic pain from osteoarthritis treated with inhalational medical marijuana presented with 4 months of productive cough, 22.7-kg (50-lb) weight loss, subjective fevers, and 3 days of worsening chest pain. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a large right upper lobe cavitary mass. He was treated empirically with intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsy was performed. Lung tissue was sent for bacterial, fungal, mycobacterial, and Nocardia cultures and for histopathology. BAL cultures grew 100 colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL of group B streptococci and 1 CFU/mL of Aspergillus niger. Results of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and GeneXpert MTB/RIF testing were negative. Voriconazole was added to his treatment. Transbronchial biopsy histopathology showed acute and chronic inflammation, granulation tissue and necrosis, and negative fungal and AFB stains. Two weeks later, the patient reported worsening right-sided chest pain provoked by palpation, right arm movement, and deep inspiration. Repeat chest CT demonstrated cavitary mass enlargement with possible pleural invasion (Figure 1, left). He developed hypoxemia and required intubation. A right-sided tension pneumothorax developed and required emergency chest tube placement, which yielded charcoal-colored pleural fluid (Figure 1, right).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Fungal empyema,"1. **Lung Abscess** - Given the productive cough, weight loss, and cavitary lung mass, a lung abscess due to anaerobic bacteria or other pathogens is possible, although initial cultures have not confirmed this.
   
2. **Aspergillosis** - The presence of Aspergillus niger in BAL cultures suggests a potential fungal infection such as chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, especially given the patient's immunocompromised state due to diabetes and possibly smoking.

3. **Nocardia Infection** - Considering chronic cavitary lung disease, and given the patient's immunocompromised state, a nocardial infection remains a consideration despite negative current cultures.

4. **Malignancy (Lung Cancer)** - A cavitary lung lesion in a smoker raises the possibility of a primary lung cancer, such as squamous cell carcinoma, which can present with cavitation.

5. **Tuberculosis** - Although AFB smears and GeneXpert were negative, tuberculosis remains a possibility in chronic cavitary lung disease, particularly with immunocompromise.

6. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (GPA)** - Systemic vasculitis could present with cavitary lung lesions and should be considered due to granulomatous inflammation seen on the biopsy.

7. **Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia (COP)** - The biopsy findings of acute and chronic inflammation could suggest organizing pneumonia, though classical cavitation is unusual.

8. **Histoplasmosis** - Endemic to certain areas in the Southeastern US; although fungal stains were negative, the clinical picture fits chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis in an immunocompromised patient.

9. **Empyema Necessitans** - The presence of charcoal-colored pleural fluid and enlargement with possible pleural invasion suggests a complication of cavitary pneumonia leading to empyema with spread.

10. **Actinomycosis** - Cervicofacial infection often invades the chest forming sinus tracks, fitting the chronic cavitary nature and eventual pleural extension.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Aspergillosis** - Persistent presence in cultures, immunocompromised state, worsening symptoms may align with this diagnosis.
2. **Malignancy (Lung Cancer)** - Smoker profile, lack of definitive pathogen on cultures, and growth rate on imaging suggest significant concern.
3. **Nocardia Infection** - Consideration remains due to immunocompromised state and cavitary lung appearance.
4. **Empyema Necessitans** - Given the clinical deterioration and pleural invasion, secondary infectious complication appears viable.
5. **Wegener’s Granulomatosis (GPA)** - The chronic inflammation and growing pleural invasion suggest vasculitis as a possible factor.
6. **Lung Abscess** - Although less likely due to lack of typical pathogens, the clinical presentation and imaging initially support this.
7. **Histoplasmosis** - Possible given geographic prevalence, though not strongly indicated by tests.
8. **Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia (COP)** - Unlikely due to presentation but some biopsy features align.
9. **Actinomycosis** - Rare but possible considering the chronicity and presentation.
10. **Tuberculosis** - Cultures negative, makes active TB less likely despite the symptomatic overlap.","['Fungal Infections', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Radiology', 'Diabetes and Endocrinology', 'Diabetes']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,55.0,F

### INPUT:
A 66-year-old healthy woman presented with a 9-day history of a progressively enlarging right lower eyelid lesion. She was seen by an outside ophthalmologist and prescribed oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (675 mg/125 mg) and ophthalmic tobramycin for presumed bacterial infection without improvement. The lesion was not painful but was associated with ipsilateral facial numbness. On examination, she manifested a 9 × 6-mm ulcerated marginal lesion of the central right lower eyelid with surrounding edema and erythema (Figure 1). There was no associated lash loss and the region was nontender to palpation. There was notable hypoesthesia in the distribution of the trigeminal maxillary branch. On examination, her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. The pupils were round and brisk without an afferent pupillary defect. She manifested full extraocular movements. The anterior segment examination, applanation tonometry, and dilated fundus examination results were within normal limits.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Varicella-zoster virus,"To systematically address this clinical scenario, let's progress through a 10-step differential diagnosis approach for the growing eyelid lesion with associated facial numbness in a 66-year-old woman, starting with the most common and working towards rarer potential diagnoses:

1. **Chalazion** - Common benign eyelid lesions characterized by lipid or sebaceous gland obstruction, but significant due to the lack of improvement following antibiotic therapy.

2. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** - A common malignancy on the eyelid in older adults, characterized by a slowly enlarging lesion; however, facial numbness is atypical.

3. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - Similar to basal cell, it can present on the eyelid and be ulcerative, possibly affecting sensory nerves causing hypoesthesia.

4. **Sebaceous Gland Carcinoma** - A more aggressive eyelid tumor in older adults that can mimic chalazion and is associated with ulceration.

5. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma** - Rare but aggressive malignant tumor that can appear as a rapidly enlarging eyelid lesion, more concerning with the facial numbness.

6. **Lymphoma** - Eyelid involvement is uncommon but possible, with mass effect potentially leading to nerve dysfunction and numbness.

7. **Adnexal Tumor** - Tumors of the glandular structures of the eyelid that can invade local tissues causing sensory changes.

8. **Melanoma** - Although usually pigmented, amelanotic melanoma could appear without the dark pigmentation, and could cause nerve disruption.

9. **Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus** - Typically more painful with vesicular eruption, but if early or atypical, it can cause numbness in the trigeminal distribution.

10. **Metastatic Disease** - Secondary deposits from another primary malignancy that can cause eyelid lesions and impinge on nerves.

Following clinical evaluation, re-ranking the differentials might proceed as follows based on the details of the lesion and nerve involvement:

1. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - Due to the ulceration and potential for nerve invasion aligning with sensory changes.
2. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** - Common and can have nerve involvement especially if ignored for an extended period.
3. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma** - Rapid growth with nerve involvement is suggestive, needing exclusion.
4. **Sebaceous Gland Carcinoma** - Ulcerative lesion, age-appropriate risk factor.
5. **Lymphoma** - Systemic symptoms could be cardinal; needs exploration with nerve path involvement.
6. **Metastatic Disease** - If other primaries need exclusion via systemic imaging or biopsy.
7. **Adnexal Tumor** - Uncommon with nerve effects but worth considering later in the evaluation.
8. **Chalazion** - Unlikely but the simplest diagnosis; improvement usually expected unless misdiagnosed.
9. **Melanoma** - Even as a possibility, due to visual and systemic checks being clear.
10. **Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus** - Generally accompanied by classic dermal changes, less fitting.

This structured list, ranked after careful clinical assessment, allows for prioritization of the most possible origins of the lesion alongside nerve involvement, guiding further management and potential biopsy.","['Dermatology', 'External Eye Disease', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Ophthalmology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,66.0,M

### INPUT:
A 44-year-old man presented with an asymptomatic enlarging right parotid mass of about 6 years’ duration. He had no prior medical or surgical history and took no medications. Ultrasonography demonstrated a solid and hypoechoic mass, 1.5 × 1.0 × 0.9 cm, in the inferior right parotid gland with minimal vascularity and without extraparotid extension. No lymph node abnormality was observed. Fine-needle aspiration was performed, and the smear was extremely cellular and showed sheets and clusters of bland polygonal epithelial cells admixed with bright pink filamentous matrix. Because of the size and location, extracapsular dissection II was carried out.1 The final pathology of the lesion showed histologic findings compatible with salivary gland carcinoma, with microcystic and papillary architecture (Figure, A and B). Abundant bubbly secretion was present within these microcystic spaces, and this material was positive for periodic acid–Schiff (Figure, C). Immunohistochemically, there was positivity for epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin (CK) 7 and CK19, S100 protein, and gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP-15). Stains for gastrointestinal stromal tumors 1 (DOG1) and p63 were negative. The tumor appeared to be contained within the surgical excision margins. There was perineural invasion without evidence of neoplastic emboli in the peritumoral lymphovascular spaces. The patient underwent a right parotidectomy I to IV1 and a level II superselective neck dissection.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Secretory carcinoma,"To develop a differential diagnosis for the described case, let's analyze the clinical presentation, imaging, histopathological findings, and immunohistochemistry results.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma**  
   - A common salivary gland malignancy that can exhibit papillary architecture, mucin production, and shows positivity for CK7.

2. **Acinic Cell Carcinoma**  
   - Notable for containing cells with basophilic cytoplasm, positive for GCDFP-15 and CK7, and can have a papillary-cystic pattern.

3. **Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma**  
   - Known for perineural invasion and tubular or cribriform patterns, CK19 positivity, lacks the papillary architecture described.

4. **Salivary Duct Carcinoma**  
   - Exhibits similarity to breast duct carcinoma, often GCDFP-15 positive, and showing a papillary or microcystic architecture.

5. **Polymorphous Adenocarcinoma**  
   - Can present with papillary and microcystic growth patterns, usually shows positivity for S100 and CK19.

6. **Secretory Carcinoma**  
   - Positive for S100 and GCDFP-15 with papillary or cystic features, previously known as mammary analogue secretory carcinoma.

7. **Basal Cell Adenocarcinoma**  
   - Typically stained for CK7 and CK19, but less likely due to lack of basaloid features in the histology.

8. **Papillary Cystadenocarcinoma**  
   - Shows cystic and papillary structures, stained with CK7 and CK19, but is rare compared to other diagnoses.

9. **Epithelial-Myoepithelial Carcinoma**  
   - Shows ductal structures with epithelial and myoepithelial cells, positive for EMA (epithelial membrane antigen), less likely for papillary architecture.

10. **Myoepithelial Carcinoma**  
    - S100 positive, lacks the typical papillary arrangement, usually more aggressive features absent in this case.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Considering All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Secretory Carcinoma**  
   - Fits the immunohistochemical profile and architecture (microcystic/papillary), GCDFP-15 is positive. 

2. **Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma**  
   - Common with varied histology, CK7 positivity matches, but lack of mucous cells in description places it lower.

3. **Acinic Cell Carcinoma**  
   - Some histologic overlap, but less likely given lack of typical basophilic cytoplasm description.

4. **Polymorphous Adenocarcinoma**  
   - Matches CK and architecture findings, but usually seen in minor salivary glands.

5. **Salivary Duct Carcinoma**  
   - Shares GCDFP-15 positivity, but more typical of ductal patterns.

6. **Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma**  
   - Rarer to fit due to more classical tubular/cribriform/pseudocystic structures and perineural invasion.

7. **Papillary Cystadenocarcinoma**  
   - Architecture matches, but rare and less likely based on statistics alone.

8. **Epithelial-Myoepithelial Carcinoma**  
   - Less likely due to absence of described myoepithelial cell layer.

9. **Myoepithelial Carcinoma**  
   - Architectural and immunoprofile mismatches with main descriptor being papillary and GCDFP-15 positivity.

10. **Basal Cell Adenocarcinoma**  
    - Architecture, immunoprofile differences, and lack of basaloid description make it least likely.

### INPUT:
A 32-year-old woman with a diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy sought care for angina and dyspnea with exertion. Her chest pain and dyspnea were chronic and had recently increased in frequency. Her cardiomyopathy followed a diagnosis of myocarditis after repeated putative chest colds and chest pain at age 14 years, at which time the ejection fraction was reported to be 30%. The results of a graded exercise stress test at 22 years were unremarkable. On examination, she was afebrile. Her heart rate was 68 beats per minute, her blood pressure was 114/77 mm Hg, and her examination was notable for an absence of jugular venous distension, peripheral edema, and murmurs or extra heart sounds. Her electrocardiogram, shown in Figure 1, was notable for right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block, unchanged from her electrocardiogram at age 14 years. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction of 40%. An exercise nuclear stress test revealed a fixed, severe apical defect, a partially reversible severe anterior wall defect, moderate global hypokinesis, and severe hypokinesis of the distal anterior wall and apex. Her ejection fraction was estimated to be 32%. Given these findings, left-sided heart catheterization was performed.
### OUTPUT:
    ",An anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery,"Let's evaluate this case step by step to formulate a differential diagnosis list, and thereafter rank the potential diagnoses.

1. **Ischemic Heart Disease**: Considered first due to the angina, dyspnea on exertion, and exercise stress test findings.

2. **Tako-Tsubo Cardiomyopathy**: The fixed apical defect and stress-induced symptoms could suggest stress-induced cardiomyopathy, albeit less likely due to her history.

3. **Chagas Disease**: Given the cardiomyopathy history and apical defects, especially considering end-stage presentations.

4. **Sarcoidosis**: Cardiac sarcoidosis can explain conduction abnormalities and the heart muscle defects.

5. **Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)**: Given the conduction defects present without significant external symptoms.

6. **Familial Dilated Cardiomyopathy**: Considering the patient’s long-standing dilated cardiomyopathy without recent factor changes.

7. **Autoimmune Myocarditis**: Recurrent myocarditis could suggest an autoimmune process that affects the myocardium.

8. **Coronary Artery Vasospasm (Prinzmetal’s Angina)**: Angina possibility in a young patient with prior normal stress tests.

9. **Infiltrative Cardiomyopathy (e.g., Amyloidosis)**: Diffuse cardiac involvement causing hypokinesis.

10. **Cardiac Fibrosis due to Past Myocarditis**: Chronic changes from the original myocarditis leading to scarring and dysfunction.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis 

Upon reviewing the available information and the results from the tests, here is a reranked list considering the most likely possibilities:

1. **Ischemic Heart Disease**: Most likely given the angina, severity of nuclear stress test defects, and her clinical presentation.
   
2. **Familial Dilated Cardiomyopathy**: Strongly consider due to a long-term known condition and progression.

3. **Cardiac Fibrosis due to Past Myocarditis**: Given prior myocarditis at a young age, persistent changes align with longstanding fibrosis.

4. **Autoimmune Myocarditis**: Persistent or recurrent inflammation could contribute to current cardiac state over time.

5. **Sarcoidosis**: Remains a strong contender considering conduction issues and diffuse defects.

6. **Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)**: Conduction pathologies could align with ARVC.

7. **Infiltrative Cardiomyopathy (e.g., Amyloidosis)**: Considered due to global hypokinesis and longstanding cardiomyopathy.

8. **Coronary Artery Vasospasm (Prinzmetal’s Angina)**: A form of angina could account for symptoms but less likely with the conduction issues.

9. **Chagas Disease**: Though geographically and epidemiologically less likely, can present with similar findings.

10. **Tako-Tsubo Cardiomyopathy**: Least likely considering chronic progression and findings don't align perfectly with typical presentation.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 30s with a history of treatment-naive HIV (CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3) and untreated syphilis presented to the emergency department with 3 weeks of progressively worsening dysphonia, dyspnea, and biphasic stridor. On arrival to the hospital, the patient had a computed tomography scan performed; results demonstrated an obstructive laryngeal mass but no signs of local invasion or lymphadenopathy. The patient was taken urgently to the operating room where an awake tracheostomy was performed without complication. Findings of a direct laryngoscopy demonstrated violaceous nodules of the base of the tongue as well as a mass of the infraglottis and subglottis, which was nearly completely obstructing the airway (Figure, A and B). Full physical examination findings also demonstrated violaceous nodules involving the patient’s lower extremities. Results of an excisional biopsy demonstrated a subepithelial spindle cell lesion with extravasation of erythrocytes and stained strongly for human herpesvirus-8 (Figure, C).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Kaposi sarcoma,"1. **Kaposi Sarcoma**: The presence of violaceous nodules in the oral cavity and on the lower extremities, coupled with the spindle cell lesion and strong staining for human herpesvirus-8, immediately suggests Kaposi Sarcoma, particularly given the patient's immunocompromised status due to HIV.

2. **Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma**: Given the patient’s HIV status, there is an increased risk for lymphoproliferative disorders such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which can present with laryngeal involvement.

3. **Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: Although less common in young patients, the presence of a mass in the larynx could suggest a squamous cell carcinoma, especially in immunocompromised states.

4. **Syphilitic Gummas**: Untreated syphilis can rarely present with gummas, which are granulomatous lesions that could theoretically involve the larynx or cause lesions that might be misinterpreted on initial examination.

5. **Tuberculosis Laryngitis**: In an HIV-positive patient, there is a higher likelihood for opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, which could present with laryngeal involvement.

6. **Histoplasmosis**: This is another opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients that can involve the larynx and could present with obstructive lesions.

7. **Lymphangioma**: Although rare in adults, lymphangiomas, particularly those presenting as cystic lesions of the airway, could potentially cause similar symptoms.

8. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)**: This is a differential to consider with respiratory tract lesions, although less likely given the biopsy findings.

9. **Amyloidosis**: Localized amyloidosis can rarely present with laryngeal masses, although systemic involvement would be more typical.

10. **Sarcoidosis**: Known for causing non-caseating granulomas, sarcoidosis can occasionally present with laryngeal involvement, although not consistent with biopsy findings.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Kaposi Sarcoma**: The biopsy and staining results are classic for this diagnosis in the context of the described symptoms and the patient being HIV-positive.
2. **Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma**: Highly relevant due to the patient's HIV status, although the specific biopsy findings make Kaposi Sarcoma more likely.
3. **Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: Less likely due to lack of invasion and nodal involvement, but remains a possibility.
4. **Syphilitic Gummas**: Possible given untreated syphilis but less likely due to the HHV-8 staining.
5. **Tuberculosis Laryngitis**: More plausible if other signs of systemic TB were present, with biopsy findings less supportive.
6. **Histoplasmosis**: Possible but would likely have different pathologic findings and require identification via specific stains or cultures.
7. **Lymphangioma**: Unlikely given typical presentation and age of the patient.
8. **Wegener's Granulomatosis**: Unlikely based on biopsy findings but remains a consideration in atypical clinical presentations.
9. **Amyloidosis**: Less likely, would need supporting evidence from biopsy specific for amyloid deposition.
10. **Sarcoidosis**: Unlikely due to biopsy revealing spindle cell proliferation and HHV-8 staining.","['HIV', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Allergy and Clinical Immunology', 'Laryngology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,30.0,M

### INPUT:
A 46-year-old healthy Hispanic man presented with 2 days of photophobia in his right eye. His best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/30 + 2 OD and 20/20 OS. His intraocular pressure, extraocular motility, and pupillary light reactions were normal. An examination demonstrated trace anterior cells in the right eye; otherwise, the examination had normal results. No vitreous cells were present. Topical prednisolone was started for presumed acute anterior uveitis. One week later, the photophobia had improved. However, unnoticed by the patient, his BCVA had worsened to 20/200 OD and 20/40 OS. An examination demonstrated new subretinal fluid in the macula in the right eye (Figure 1A). Fluorescein angiography showed peripapillary speckled pinpoint areas of hyperfluorescence in the right eye. Indocyanine green showed early choroidal vessel hyperfluorescence and several posterior focal hypofluorescent spots in the midphase in both eyes. Autofluorescence showed patchy hyperautofluorescence in both eyes. Tuberculosis and syphilis testing had negative results. A complete blood cell count was unremarkable. A diagnosis of central serous retinopathy (CSR) was made. The topical prednisolone was stopped.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease,"1. **Acute Anterior Uveitis**  
   - Initial treatment with topical prednisolone was started for presumed acute anterior uveitis due to photophobia and the presence of trace anterior cells.

2. **Central Serous Retinopathy (CSR)**  
   - Diagnosis made after observing new subretinal fluid, fluorescein angiography findings, and worsening visual acuity.

3. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease**  
   - Considered due to subretinal fluid, choroidal abnormalities on indocyanine green, and patchy autofluorescence, but vitiligo, hearing changes or neurological symptoms are absent.

4. **Posterior Uveitis**  
   - Ruled out due to lack of vitreous cells and systemic symptoms, findings of CSR more pertinent.

5. **Punctate Inner Choroidopathy**  
   - Considered with unexplained visual disturbances and retinal changes but less likely due to demographic profile and clinical findings strongly suggestive of CSR.

6. **Multiple Evanescent White Dot Syndrome (MEWDS)**  
   - Possible due to speckled hyperfluorescence, but typically affects young women and resolves spontaneously, and would not fit the posterior segment findings.

7. **Birdshot Chorioretinopathy**  
   - Unlikely due to demographic and distinct birdshot lesions absent on examination and imaging.

8. **Acute Zonal Occult Outer Retinopathy (AZOOR)**  
   - Considered for photopsias and visual field loss, but typical signs like visual field loss were not observed.

9. **Serpiginous Choroidopathy**  
   - Less likely given the lack of progressive chorioretinal atrophy and serpentine patterns in imaging.

10. **Sarcoidosis**  
   - Considered as a systemic inflammatory disease that affects the eyes but ruled out due to lack of systemic symptoms and imaging findings specific to CSR.

### Final Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Central Serous Retinopathy (CSR)**  
   - Final diagnosis, consistent with imaging and clinical findings.

2. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease**  
   - Ruled out but considered strongly due to choroidal involvement.

3. **Multiple Evanescent White Dot Syndrome (MEWDS)**  
   - Considered due to specific imaging findings but not consistent with demographics and presentation. 

4. **Acute Anterior Uveitis**  
   - Initially considered but no longer fits the full clinical picture with chronic or systemic signs.

5. **Punctate Inner Choroidopathy**  
   - Less likely due to atypical demographic and symptomatology. 

6. **Acute Zonal Occult Outer Retinopathy (AZOOR)**  
   - Unlikely in absence of fitting visual symptoms.

7. **Serpiginous Choroidopathy**  
   - Low likelihood based on typical patterns absent in imaging.

8. **Posterior Uveitis**  
   - Differential ruled out due to predominant CSR findings.

9. **Birdshot Chorioretinopathy**  
   - Unlikely due to demographic profile and retinal imaging.

### INPUT:
A 38-year-old man without a significant medical history presented with worsening dyspnea and lower extremity edema at 1 week post partum. When at full term, a planned vaginal delivery was complicated by breached position of the fetus, fetal distress, and new onset of fever. The delivery was converted to a cesarean birth, which was uncomplicated. Perioperatively, he had an episode of chest pain that resolved spontaneously. Troponin levels were normal. A vascular ultrasound study ruled out deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremities. A non–electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated computed tomography angiogram showed no pulmonary embolism but was otherwise not diagnostic owing to motion artifacts (Figure 1A). He had progressive dyspnea, mild pulmonary congestion noted on chest radiography, and an elevated brain-type natriuretic peptide level greater than 800 pg/mL (conversion to ng/L is 1:1). Physical examination findings showed a new heart murmur. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed, which showed a normal-sized left ventricle and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, severe aortic regurgitation (AR), and a mildly dilated aortic root (Figure 1B and Video). The patient was transferred to our institution for further treatment. The patient was afebrile at that point, and his white blood cell count was within normal limits.

1. **Aortic Dissection**: The presence of a significant murmur, severe aortic regurgitation, and a mildly dilated aortic root suggests possible structural damage to the aorta.
   
2. **Infective Endocarditis**: Given the recent fever and new heart murmur, infective endocarditis could explain valvular dysfunction causing AR.

3. **Peripartum Cardiomyopathy**: Although rare in men, the situation mimics reported post-partum heart issues with cardiac involvement.

4. **Acute Myocarditis**: The episode of chest pain and elevated BNP could represent an inflammatory process affecting the myocardium leading to left-sided heart problems.

5. **Rheumatic Heart Disease**: The new onset murmur and history of recent illness could raise suspicion of rheumatic fever affecting the heart valves.

6. **Ankylosing Spondylitis**: This condition can cause aortic regurgitation due to inflammation of the aortic root, although no reports of joint or back pain here.

7. **Marfan Syndrome**: A mildly dilated aortic root raises suspicion, although without other classic features noted, it remains less likely.

8. **Bicuspid Aortic Valve**: Known to cause aortic regurgitation and associated aortic root dilation, this is a possible congenital explanation.

9. **Libman-Sacks Endocarditis**: Considered if there’s an underlying lupus or autoimmune condition, which wasn't provided here.

10. **Hypertensive Heart Disease**: Severe AR and heart murmur arise from longstanding hypertension, although no history here suggests it.

### Reranking the Differential Diagnoses Using All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Aortic Dissection**: The symptoms and TTE findings are highly suggestive of this life-threatening condition.
2. **Infective Endocarditis**: New murmur and recent fever align clinically despite normal white blood cell count.
3. **Acute Myocarditis**: Considering symptomatic chest event and elevated BNP.
4. **Bicuspid Aortic Valve**: Causes significant AR as seen here.
5. **Peripartum Cardiomyopathy**: Uncommon in men but matching heart failure-like presentation.
6. **Rheumatic Heart Disease**: Previous fever and murmur still position it notable with historical fit.
7. **Marfan Syndrome**: Aortic root dilation needs this consideration, albeit less likely without stigmata.
8. **Ankylosing Spondylitis**: Persistent AR correlated vascular pathology.
9. **Libman-Sacks Endocarditis**: Unlikely in absence of lupus or autoimmune indicators.
10. **Hypertensive Heart Disease**: Typical for AR, yet no hypertension recorded yet.

### INPUT:
A 4-year-old boy with no previous medical or ocular history presented with 10 days of right painless, periorbital swelling and erythema. The patient was previously treated with an oral combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid and topical gentamicin therapy without any improvement. The patient’s visual acuity, color vision, and pupillary examination results were within normal limits, and intraocular pressures were 28 mm Hg OD and 20 mm Hg OS. The extraocular movements and confrontational visual fields were normal. There was right upper and lower eyelid edema with mild erythema and 3 mm of proptosis. The eyelids were nontender to palpation. There was trace vasodilation and chemosis of the conjunctiva in the right eye. The remainder of the slitlamp and dilated fundus examination results were within normal limits. Computed tomography of the orbits and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits showed a large lesion of the right greater wing of the sphenoid bone extending toward the orbital apex with edema and enhancement of the right temporal lobe of the brain (Figure 1).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Langerhans cell histiocytosis,"To assess the patient's condition, we will develop a 10-step differential diagnosis plan based on the provided information. We will begin with the most common or likely diagnoses given the symptoms and work towards more rare or severe possibilities.

1. **Orbital Cellulitis** - Initially suspected due to eyelid edema and erythema, though atypical given painless presentation.
   
2. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis** - Considered due to bony involvement specifically of the sphenoid bone, causing proptosis and associated orbital symptoms.
   
3. **Rhabdomyosarcoma** - A primary neoplasm common in children, presenting with rapid-onset proptosis and orbital mass.
   
4. **Neuroblastoma** - Metastatic disease potential with possibility of cranial or bony involvement, including the orbit.

5. **Fibrous Dysplasia** - Bony orbital involvement fits this condition characterized by osseous remodeling and painless proptosis.

6. **Sarcoidosis** - Granulomatous disease that might present with orbital lesions, though less common in this age group.

7. **Metastatic Neuroblastoma** - Consider as neuroblastoma can metastasize to orbital bones.

8. **Meningioma** - Slow-growing tumor with potential orbit compression, although rare in children.

9. **Leukemia** - Consider due to systemic spread with orbital and bone marrow involvement.

10. **Epidermoid Cysts** - Rare, but can cause mass effect similar to described symptoms with bony overlap.

After reviewing the differential diagnosis, based on the MRI findings and lesion behavior, we will rank these options:

### Final Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis** - Given specific bony involvement (sphenoid) and age appropriateness.
2. **Rhabdomyosarcoma** - Pediatric neoplasm with orbital mass and proptosis considerations.
3. **Fibrous Dysplasia** - Due to typical bony involvement pattern.
4. **Neuroblastoma** - Consider metastatic potential affecting orbit.
5. **Orbital Cellulitis** - Unlikely given poor response to antibiotics and painless nature.
6. **Metastatic Neuroblastoma** - Potential bony involvement.
7. **Leukemia** - Systemic disease with potential orbital involvement.
8. **Meningioma** - Although rare, could explain mass effect, less likely in children.
9. **Sarcoidosis** - Uncommon in children but potential for lesions.
10. **Epidermoid Cysts** - Considered due to mass effect mechanism, though rare. 

This stepwise approach narrows down our differential diagnoses and gives priority to those most consistent with the findings of the imaging investigations.","['Hematology', 'Pediatrics', 'Ophthalmology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4.0,F

### INPUT:
A 55-year old man presented with a 6-week history of an enlarging, tender, pruritic, 4-cm erythematous patch with central inflammatory papules distributed on the medial forehead (Figure, A). No inciting events, such as arthropod bite or trauma, were noted. He was initially treated for presumed shingles with valacyclovir, cephalexin, gabapentin, and hydrocortisone 2.5% topical ointment with no improvement in appearance or symptoms. No other cutaneous abnormalities were noted. A punch biopsy specimen of the left medial forehead was obtained, and histological and immunohistochemical analyses were performed (Figure, B and C).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Angiosarcoma,"1. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE)** - Considered due to chronic erythematous patch with central inflammation located on the face.
2. **Sarcoidosis** - Facial involvement, erythematous papules, may suggest cutaneous sarcoidosis.
3. **Granuloma Annulare** - Presents with papules; however, pruritic nature is less common.
4. **Seborrheic Dermatitis** - Common in middle-aged adults, facial involvement.
5. **Psoriasis** - Chronic inflammatory plaques, can involve the forehead.
6. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma** - Presents with persistent, pruritic plaques.
7. **Lichen Planus** - Although pruritic, it typically affects mucosal surfaces.
8. **Leprosy** - Facial patches and papules, though less common today.
9. **Dermatofibroma** - Presents as a nodular lesion, possibly mimicking the described presentation.
10. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** - Potential due to non-healing nature and facial involvement.

Revised Ranking Based on Additional Information:
1. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE)** - Most fits the presentation with biopsy showing interface dermatitis and a lymphocytic infiltrate.
2. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma** - Persistent, non-responsive to initial treatment raises suspicion.
3. **Sarcoidosis** - Facial presentation, although histology would show non-caseating granulomas.
4. **Seborrheic Dermatitis** - Common facial condition but less likely due to duration and lack of response.
5. **Granuloma Annulare** - Less likely due to the face as an uncommon site and pruritus.
6. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** - Consistent with facial presentation, but histology would show characteristic basal cell nests.
7. **Psoriasis** - Chronic plaques are plausible, though histology might show different patterns.
8. **Lichen Planus** - Less typical due to site and presentation.
9. **Leprosy** - Uncommon, and histological diagnosis would require acid-fast bacilli.
10. **Dermatofibroma** - Fixed cutaneous nodule, but histology would show a different pattern than that described.","['Dermatology', 'Oncology', 'Sarcomas', 'Soft-Tissue Tumors']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,55.0,F

### INPUT:
A 34-year-old man presented with 2 years of progressively worsening intermittent dysphagia, primarily to solids, especially meats, localized retrosternally. He reported no heartburn, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss, or changes in bowel habits. He reported no medications or comorbidities. Physical examination was unremarkable. Results of a recent complete blood cell count were normal. Despite taking ranitidine (150 mg twice daily), he continued to have bothersome daily dysphagia, prompting his primary care clinician to order esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The EGD showed vertical furrows and circumferential rings in the esophagus (Figure 1A), while the stomach and duodenum appeared normal. Four biopsies each were taken from the proximal and distal esophagus (Figure 1B).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE),"1. **Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)**
   - Given the patient's age, sex, and symptomatology, combined with the characteristic EGD findings (vertical furrows and circumferential rings) and the absence of typical GERD symptoms, EoE is a likely initial consideration.

2. **Esophageal stricture**
   - Strictures may cause intermittent dysphagia, particularly to solids, and often present with normal initial labs and EGD findings excluding structural narrowing.

3. **Achalasia**
   - Patient's progressive dysphagia, retrosternal localization, and lack of heartburn make achalasia a potential option requiring further motility testing for confirmation.

4. **Plummer-Vinson syndrome**
   - Given the dysphagia and appearance of esophageal rings, consider this syndrome, uncommon in this age group and gender without associated anemia.

5. **Schatzki ring**
   - Characterized by episodic solid food dysphagia, Schatzki rings can present similarly; age and EGD findings may help differentiate.

6. **Diffuse esophageal spasm**
   - Intermittent dysphagia and chest pain localized to the esophagus are classical for this condition and can be explored through manometry.

7. **Esophageal web**
   - Less common but considered due to the esophageal rings, often requiring more comprehensive imaging or exploration to diagnose.

8. **Lichen planus of the esophagus**
   - Presents with dysphagia and may produce esophageal narrowing or furrowing, considered rare.

9. **Peptic stricture**
   - Due to the lack of heartburn or reflux symptoms, this is less likely but possible, based on chronic periods of undiagnosed reflux disease.

10. **Scleroderma-associated esophageal involvement**
    - Although less likely without systemic symptoms, it can contribute to lower esophageal motility issues causing dysphagia.

### INPUT:
A 19-year-old woman presented with recurrent left eye redness and photophobia for the past year. The patient had previously been treated with topical corticosteroid therapy, which provided temporary relief of her symptoms. Visual acuity was 20/20 OU with normal intraocular pressures. The results from the slitlamp examination of the right eye were within normal limits (Figure 1A). Examination results of the left eye demonstrated 2+ diffuse conjunctival hyperemia, 1+ anterior chamber cell, and a vascularized iris infiltrate (Figure 1B). Results of the dilated fundus examination were within normal limits in both eyes. Ultrasound biomicroscopy of the left eye demonstrated areas of ciliary body thickening 360° and a thickened iris pupillary margin superiorly and nasally. A full review of systems was negative for other abnormalities including skin lesions. Test results for tuberculosis and syphilis were negative.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Juvenile xanthogranuloma,"**Step 1**: Anterior Uveitis  
The presentation of recurrent eye redness and photophobia, with anterior chamber cells, is consistent with anterior uveitis.

**Step 2**: Fuchs Uveitis Syndrome  
The presence of diffuse conjunctival hyperemia and the vascularized iris infiltrate could suggest Fuchs uveitis syndrome.

**Step 3**: Sarcoidosis  
Considering the eye involvement, sarcoidosis could be a potential cause, even without systemic symptoms currently present.

**Step 4**: Idiopathic Uveitis  
A recurrent pattern without a systemic disease indication might suggest idiopathic uveitis.

**Step 5**: Posner-Schlossman Syndrome  
Given the normal intraocular pressure, this condition can still be considered, though typically associated with elevated IOP.

**Step 6**: Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) Disease  
Although she lacks systemic symptoms and fundus changes typical of VKH, it's a possible consideration.

**Step 7**: HLA-B27 Associated Uveitis  
Given her age and symptomatology, consider this autoimmune condition, though typically associated with systemic spondyloarthropathies.

**Step 8**: Intermediate Uveitis  
Characterized by primarily vitreal inflammation, but considering proximity to anterior uveitis, it could still be considered.

**Step 9**: Uveitis-Melanoma Syndrome  
IRIS and ciliary body thickening can occasionally relate to uveal melanomas, though rare in this demographic.

**Step 10**: Behçet’s Disease  
While not having skin lesions or systemic involvement in history, the disease might need considering due to recurrent ocular issues.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Fuchs Uveitis Syndrome**  
Consistent with vascularized iris infiltrates and recurrent episodes without systemic findings.

2. **Idiopathic Uveitis**  
Lack of systemic disease supports idiopathic cause.

3. **Anterior Uveitis**  
Common presentation aligns, but additional features suggest complexity beyond simple anterior uveitis.

4. **HLA-B27 Associated Uveitis**  
Though no systemic symptoms noted, age and gender point towards this etiology.

5. **Sarcoidosis**  
It's considered despite absence of systemic signs or symptoms due to isolated ocular findings.

6. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease**  
Lack of typical extras presentation places it lower without fundus or systemic signs.

7. **Posner-Schlossman Syndrome**  
Typical distinction is elevated intraocular pressure, less likely without it.

8. **Intermediate Uveitis**  
Lacks vitreous findings but considered considering full uveitis workup.

9. **Behçet’s Disease**  
Necessitates more clinical correlation but considered due to recurrent nature.

10. **Uveitis-Melanoma Syndrome**

### INPUT:
A 17-year-old white female patient was referred to the otolaryngology clinic with a 6-month history of a left-sided neck mass. Her primary care physician initially obtained an ultrasonographic image, which demonstrated a left, level 2 lymph node measuring 4.0 × 1.5 × 2.8 cm. The patient then underwent several courses of antibiotic treatment, but the mass persisted. After a period of conservative management, she developed a sore throat and fever. She subsequently underwent a computed tomographic scan of the neck and chest with contrast, which demonstrated an isolated, enlarged, homogenously enhancing left-neck level 2B lymph node measuring 3.4 × 2.8 × 2.1 cm (Figure 1A). When she presented to our facility, she was found to have an asymptomatically enlarged left level 2/5A neck mass that was nontender and fixed. The patient had an unremarkable medical, surgical, and social history and no known infectious exposures. A white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level were both elevated, at 11 310 cells/μL (to convert to cells × 109 per liter, multiply by 0.001) and 56.2 mg/L (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 9.524), respectively. Studies for influenza A and B, HIV, cytomegalovirus, American foulbrood, Bartonella henselae, infectious mononucleosis, and Epstein-Barr virus had negative results. An ultrasonography-guided needle biopsy was performed. Fine-needle aspiration and flow cytometry had negative results for lymphoproliferative disorders or a malignant condition. A tissue culture had negative results. Given the inconclusive diagnosis, the patient underwent a left neck dissection of levels 2A, 2B, and 5A. Intraoperative frozen sections did not show a malignant process. On final analysis, a pathologic examination of the largest lymph node was performed (Figure 1B).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Castleman disease,"1. Reactive Lymphadenopathy: Initial consideration, given the history of an enlarged lymph node responsive to antibiotics.

2. Cat Scratch Disease: Considered due to persistent neck mass and fever, but negative for Bartonella henselae.

3. Infectious Mononucleosis: Considered due to persistent sore throat and lymphadenopathy, negative test for Epstein-Barr virus.

4. Tuberculosis Lymphadenitis: Considered due to persistent, fixed lymph node mass, no known infectious exposure, inconclusive culture results.

5. Kikuchi-Fujimoto Disease: Considered due to young age, cervical lymphadenopathy, elevated C-reactive protein; however, requires histopathological confirmation.

6. Sarcoidosis: Non-caseating granulomas may be considered based on lymph node biopsy results, often requiring further systemic evaluation.

7. Lymphoma: Although no evidence in cytology or flow cytometry, it remains a differential due to the persistent nature of the mass.

8. Castleman Disease: Considered due to unexplained lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms like fever.

9. Kimura Disease: Persistent neck mass, typically in young patients, although often accompanied by eosinophilia.

10. Granulomatous Disease: Broad category including various potential unidentified causes given the histologic analysis.

### INPUT:
A 44-year-old woman was referred to the Department of Otolaryngology from the Department of Sleep Medicine for surgical evaluation of her tonsillar hypertrophy. The patient’s medical history was notable for severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) diagnosed in the fall of 2017, when she presented with snoring, progressive daytime fatigue, and several years of migraines. Since her diagnosis, she had been adherent to use of nightly continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). However, she had persistent daytime fatigue and morning headaches. Several months before presentation, the patient noticed that her bite changed from an overbite to an underbite (Figure, A), which had been attributed to dental malocclusion from her CPAP machine. Examination findings of the oropharynx showed an oropharynx score of a Mallampati 4, with 3-plus tonsils and macroglossia without scalloping of the tongue (Figure, B). Nasopharyngolaryngoscopic examination findings showed that the tonsils did not approximate at midline, with a narrow anterior-to-posterior dimension of the airway owing to macroglossia and no retrognathia. On further review of systems, the patient reported growth in her tongue and feet and intermittent swelling with numbness in her hands over the past year.

With the detailed presentation of progressive changes such as macroglossia, dental malocclusion, growth of extremities, and specific complaints such as intermittent swelling and numbness in the hands, the differential diagnosis needs careful reevaluation.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. Acromegaly - Given the symptoms of changing bite, macroglossia, and enlargement of feet/hands, acromegaly is the primary suspicion due to potential excess growth hormone.
2. Amyloidosis - Could explain macroglossia and numbness due to nerve involvement.
3. Hypothyroidism - Can cause macroglossia and fatigue.
4. Sjögren's Syndrome - Mainly considered for intermittent swelling and numbness.
5. Sarcoidosis - Less likely but possible considering generalized systemic symptoms.
6. Lymphoma - Needs consideration due to persistent fatigue and potential for systemic involvement. 
7. Graves' Disease - Overall presentation does not strongly match hyperthyroid features.
8. Cushing's Syndrome - Possible, due to systemic changes, but less likely without classical features such as central obesity or moon face.
9. Rheumatoid Arthritis - Mostly for hand symptoms, but low on the probability scale.
10. Gigantism - Unlikely due to age of presentation.","['Endocrine Surgery', 'Endocrinology', 'Neurosurgery', 'Pulmonary Medicine', 'Sleep Medicine']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,44.0,M

### INPUT:
A 61-year-old white woman with seronegative rheumatoid arthritis presented with hand and wrist pain. Over 2 years, she was prescribed various therapies including prednisone, methotrexate, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, abatacept, and anakinra; she experienced intermittent improvement in her joint pain but had persistently elevated levels of inflammatory markers. She continued to experience asymmetric small- and large-joint polyarthralgias and later developed intermittent fevers (temperatures up to 38.3°C [101°F]) along with a 50-lb (22.7-kg) unintentional weight loss over the course of a few months. On examination, there was subtle synovitis in bilateral metacarpophalangeal joints. Findings on cardiac, pulmonary, and neurologic examinations were unremarkable. Laboratory evaluation was notable for a normocytic anemia and elevated C-reactive protein level (7.7 mg/dL [73.3 nmol/L]). Results of esophagogastroduodenoscopy with gastric biopsies and bone marrow biopsy were unremarkable. Findings on further workup including transthoracic echocardiography to assess for endocarditis, carotid magnetic resonance angiography to assess for vasculitis, and abdominal fat pad biopsy for amyloidosis were also unremarkable. Tocilizumab was initiated. Over the next several months, she developed intermittent abdominal pain, steatorrhea, protein-losing enteropathy, and symmetric bilateral lower extremity edema requiring diuresis. Results of infectious stool studies, celiac serology, and fecal elastase testing were normal. Repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy (Figure, panel A) was performed, with gastric and duodenal biopsies (Figure, panels B and C).

### INPUT:
A healthy man in his 60s was referred by his dentist to an oral surgeon for evaluation of a palatal swelling of unknown duration. The patient first presented to his dentist with a complaint of “it feels like there is something on the roof of [his] mouth.” He was never aware of the palatal lesion before his initial presentation. He denied any pain or discomfort from the site, and stated that the increasing size of the mass was what first alerted him to its presence. The extraoral examination results were within normal limits, with no evidence of swelling, expansion, trismus, or lymphadenopathy. Intraoral examination revealed a focally ulcerated, fluctuant 2.5 × 2 × 1-cm pink-red submucosal swelling in the right palatal mucosa (Figure, A). The lesion involved almost the entire right side of the hard palatal mucosa and soft palate and terminated at the palatal midline. Imaging studies were unremarkable.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. Salivary Gland Neoplasm
   - Given the patient’s symptomatology and presentation, a salivary gland tumor is a leading possibility. These can include both benign and malignant tumors like pleomorphic adenoma or mucoepidermoid carcinoma.

2. Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma
   - Due to the ulceration and the patient's age, carcinoma cannot be ruled out and should be considered early on.

3. Oral Lymphoma
   - Lymphomas can present in the oral cavity and should be evaluated especially when typical imaging does not show bony involvement.

4. Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma
   - This is a common malignant salivary gland tumor which could appear in the palate with similar features.

5. Granular Cell Tumor

### INPUT:
An infant girl, born to a nonconsanguineously wed couple, presented to the dermatology outpatient clinic with recurrent skin blisters since age 2 months. The lesions initially started over the trunk and subsequently progressed to involve the face, hands, and feet. The episodes of skin blisters were accompanied by pruritus and redness all over the body. There was no history of oral erosions or difficulty in feeding. Bowel and bladder movements were normal. The child had an older sibling who had no skin ailments, and none of the other family members were affected. On examination, multiple tense, angulated vesicles and bullae on a background of erythema were seen over the face, trunk, and extremities (Figure, A and B). Few urticated papules and wheals were seen in isolation over the trunk. The ruptured bullae were healing with hypopigmentation with accompanying scarring and discrete milia formation. The mucosae and nails were normal. No contractures or webbing of fingers was noted. There was no organomegaly. A punch biopsy from a vesicle was subsequently performed (Figure, C and D).

### INPUT:
A man in his 30s with active bulimia was brought by ambulance to the emergency department after a syncopal event that followed 1 hour of palpitations and intermittent lightheadedness. When emergency responders arrived, the patient was responsive but groggy. An electrocardiogram (ECG) in the field demonstrated a regular wide complex tachycardia. En route to the hospital, 6 mg of adenosine followed by 12 mg of adenosine were administered intravenously, without a change in his rhythm. On arrival to the emergency department, he was in a regular wide complex tachycardia with a heart rate of 225 beats per minute (Figure, A), with an initial blood pressure of 108/77 mm Hg. He was oriented but slow to respond. After sedation, a synchronized, biphasic, 200-J shock converted him to sinus rhythm with bigeminy (Figure, B), which settled to normal sinus rhythm. An intravenous amiodarone infusion was administered. His initial laboratory evaluation revealed hypokalemia (2.8 mEq/L; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1.0), hypomagnesemia (3.6 mEq/L; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.50), and an elevated serum troponin (0.13 nanograms per milliliter; to convert to micrograms per milliliter, multiply by 1.0). Potassium and magnesium replacement was administered orally and intravenously. He reported no family history of sudden cardiac death or unexplained premature death. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal biventricular size and function.

### INPUT:
A 25-year-old man presented with a 6-month history of an enlarging right neck mass. The patient had a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome with insulin resistance and a migraine disorder and reported experiencing 1 to 2 migraine episodes per week since early high school. He believed that the neck mass made these episodes worse than normal. The patient was otherwise previously healthy until he developed an upper respiratory infection. His physician noted visible swelling in the right neck and clinically interpreted the finding as enlarged lymph nodes associated with the infection. After 2 weeks, the neck swelling persisted despite the resolution of other symptoms. He was subsequently treated with a course of antibiotics, which did not result in any improvement. The mass slowly enlarged over the next 6 months. The patient reported new symptoms, including waxing and waning pain that radiated to the back of his neck, headaches, and intermittent dysphagia. He also noted periods during which the mass would fluctuate in size. Otolaryngologic examination findings were within normal limits except for a single, nontender, compressible right neck mass deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and extending into level V. The patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan prior to presentation at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center’s otolaryngology clinic. The scan showed a fatty-appearing tumor within the right carotid space. The patient underwent surgical excision, and a mass measuring 8.0 × 6.5 × 4.7–cm was removed from the carotid space (Figure, A). Additional material from the mass was excised at the level of the base of the skull. Gross pathologic examination demonstrated yellowish-brown, homogenous, lobular adipose tissue covered by a thin, tan, transparent membrane (Figure, A). Histopathologic examination showed relatively uniform univacuolar and multivacuolated, granular eosinophilic cells with centrally placed nucleoli (Figure, B and C). In addition, several level II and level III lymph nodes were excised, all of which were found to be benign.

### INPUT:
A 31-year-old male patient presented with right nasal pain and radiating facial pain over the previous 3 years. He reported feeling a mass in his right nostril that had not changed in size, as well as associated nasal tenderness to the external nose, worsening pain with exposure to cold temperatures, and frequent sneezing. Prior to presentation, he had been prescribed fluticasone and loratadine for allergic rhinitis without resolution of symptoms. He denied difficulty breathing, epistaxis, rhinorrhea, fever, chills, weight loss, or night sweats. He was a nonsmoker and nondrinker. On physical examination, his external nose had no visible lesions. A rhinoscopy revealed normal mucosa with a submucosal, round, firm, tender lesion, measuring approximately 1 cm and located on the right anterior nasal septum. No drainage was visualized. His turbinates appeared normal. The patient underwent surgical excision of the septal lesion under general anesthesia for definitive diagnosis. The specimen measured 1.1 × 0.7 × 0.2 cm and was erythematous, soft, vascular, and adherent, with a broad base to the anterior superior nasal septal mucosa just inferior to the upper lateral cartilage (Figure 1A and B). The lesion was excised down through the perichondrium.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Glomus tumor,"1. **Nasal Septal Hematoma**  
   Initial presentation of a submucosal, vascular lesion on the nasal septum could suggest a nasal septal hematoma, especially with associated nasal tenderness and absence of external lesions.

2. **Nasal Polyp**  
   A firm nasal mass with associated symptoms such as sneezing could suggest a nasal polyp despite the mass seeming isolated to one side.

3. **Fibrous Dysplasia**  
   The firm and round nature of the lesion, as well as the pain upon exposure to cold, might suggest fibrous dysplasia involving the nasal septal area.

4. **Chondroma**  
   A firm, tender lesion on the nasal septum could indicate chondroma, a benign cartilaginous tumor.

5. **Schwannoma**  
   The isolated nature of the nasal mass and its firm, rounded feel might suggest a benign schwannoma.

6. **Angiofibroma**  
   A soft, vascular lesion on the septum with a broad base could be indicative of an angiofibroma, especially given the erythematous appearance.

7. **Inverted Papilloma**  
   The submucosal mass with normal mucosa and absence of drainage might indicate an inverted papilloma, known for its firm, polyp-like nature.

8. **Neurofibroma**  
   The firm nature of the lesion and its localizing symptoms in a nerve distribution area might suggest a neurofibroma.

9. **Pyogenic Granuloma**  
   A highly vascular, erythematous lesion might point to a pyogenic granuloma, even though their growth is generally rapid.

10. **Chordoma**  
   A rare occurrence in this location, but could appear as a smooth, firm mass given the lesion's characteristics and nasal septum involvement.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Angiofibroma**  
   Due to the vascular nature and its commonly broad base attachment, as well as the erythematous appearance and tenderness reported.

2. **Schwannoma**  
   Based on the firm, rounded lesion with the potential for neural origin symptoms given the patient's pain profile.

3. **Chondroma**  
   The firm and tender characteristics align with cartilaginous tumor presentations.

4. **Inverted Papilloma**  
   Despite the typical adult presentation, the described mass characteristics are consistent with this diagnosis.

5. **Nasal Septal Hematoma**  
   Hematoma is plausible but unlikely due to chronicity without resolution, alongside lack of previous trauma history.

6. **Pyogenic Granuloma**  
   Vascular and erythematous nature align, but chronicity and symptom presence lessen likelihood.

7. **Fibrous Dysplasia**  
   Consistent with the firm nature of the mass, although less vascular usually on presentation.

8. **Neurofibroma**  
   Same considerations as schwannoma, though generally less common in the nasal septum.

9. **Chordoma**  
   Considered last due to rarity in nasal presentations, especially anterior septum.

10. **Nasal Polyp**  
   Less likely given the unilateral and non-pedunculated description.","['Otolaryngology', 'Rhinology and Sinus Disease', 'Oncology', 'Soft-Tissue Tumors']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,31.0,F

### INPUT:
A 61-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, psychosis, and recurrent venous thromboembolism was admitted to the emergency department with fatigue, weakness, and arthralgias after an unexplained fall. At presentation, she was experiencing psychosis and being treated in an inpatient psychiatric ward. She was nonadherent with medications and denied drug and alcohol abuse. On examination, she appeared comfortable. Her blood pressure was 150/67 mm Hg; heart rate, 77/min; temperature, 36.7°C (98.1°F); respiratory rate, 16/min; and oxygen saturation, 99% on room air. On both lower extremities, there was peripheral edema with widespread hematomas, scattered ecchymosis, petechiae, and diffuse perifollicular purpura (Figure). The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. Laboratory test results showed a normocytic anemia (hemoglobin level, 5.2 g/dL [reference, 13.5-17.5 g/dL]; mean corpuscular volume, 85 fL [reference, 80-100 fL]); normal platelet count (thrombocytes, 285 ×109/L [reference, 150-400 ×109/L]); and a mild leukopenia (leukocytes, 3.9 ×109 [reference, 4.3-10 ×109/L]). Folic acid level was low (3 nmol/L [reference, ≥5 nmol/L]) and vitamin B12 level was normal (478 pg/mL [reference, 193-982 pg/mL]). Results for iron panel, reticulocyte count, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), international normalized ratio, liver function tests, and levels of indirect bilirubin, haptoglobin, fibrinogen, and creatine kinase were all within reference range. Chest radiographs and computed tomography of the head were negative for any acute pathology. A 12-lead electrocardiogram revealed no abnormalities.

### INPUT:
A 31-year-old Hispanic man had a 3-year history of a steadily growing, increasingly pruritic, painless mass behind the right ear. The patient denied bleeding from the mass, ear pain, trauma, fever, fatigue, night sweats, or recent illnesses. His medical history included eczema treated with triamcinolone acetonide cream. Otherwise, the patient had no family history or exposure to tobacco or alcohol. On physical examination, a 2-cm, nontender, mobile retroauricular mass with superficial excoriations was palpable over the right mastoid cortex. The patient had no hearing deficits and no fistula into the external auditory canal. There was no palpable head and neck lymphadenopathy. Serologic studies revealed an elevated absolute eosinophil count of 790/μL (reference range, <700/μL; to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001) and an eosinophilia percentage of 9.7% (reference range, <6.0%). The T1-weighted postcontrast magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck showed a heterogeneously enhancing mass with irregular borders in the right retroauricular space, with a tract coursing anteriorly toward the parotid gland (Figure, A).

7. **Pilar Cyst** - Occurs on the scalp and can present as a well-defined, mobile mass.

8. **Lymphangioma** - A benign tumor of lymphatic vessels, typically presenting as a soft, compressible, and non-tender mass.

9. **Parotid Gland Tumor** - Could present in the retroauricular space and possibly have a tract towards the parotid gland.

10. **Hodgkin's Lymphoma** - A type of cancer that might present with a mass and systemic symptoms such as eosinophilia, though this patient lacks classic systemic symptoms.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:
1. **Kimura Disease** - The eosinophilia and presentation suggest this as a likely diagnosis.
2. **Parotid Gland Tumor** - Given the MRI findings of a tract toward the parotid gland.
3. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans** - The mass's irregular borders and pruritic nature make this plausible.
4. **Neurofibroma** - Slow-growing, pruritic, non-tender mass.

### INPUT:
A 20-year-old man was referred by his family physician to a community mental health team in London, United Kingdom. His mental state had deteriorated progressively over the previous 12 months, following the death of his father. After a period living alone, he had returned to the family home 4 months prior to his presentation and had been noted to be socially withdrawn, preoccupied, and distractible. His family physician, suspecting a depressive episode, had prescribed citalopram up to a dosage of 40 mg once daily, to no effect. His family subsequently sought advice from the family physician when the patient was noted to be speaking to himself, expressing concerns about people meaning him harm, and professing the belief that he could hear other peoples’ thoughts. The patient had been born in Sierra Leone after a complicated delivery and had traveled to the United Kingdom as a child with his family, who were fleeing from a civil war. On arrival in the United Kingdom, his family claimed asylum and moved into a small apartment in a high-rise building in central London. Although there was no reported developmental delay, he had struggled academically at school and was bullied for having overweight. He left school without qualifications at age 16 years and worked as a shop assistant. He left this job about a year prior to his referral to psychiatry after a period of sick leave following the death of his father. He was a nonsmoker, did not drink alcohol, and denied illicit drug use. A paternal relative was reported to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia. There was no comorbid physical illness. On review, the patient was kempt and had overweight. Eye contact was fleeting, and he presented as anxious, with a degree of psychomotor agitation. His speech was normal in rate, volume, and tone, although tangential. There was no other evidence of thought disorder. He denied feeling low in mood or suicidal and was objectively euthymic. There was some sleep disturbance, with the patient reporting being fearful to go to sleep owing to persecutory beliefs regarding his neighbors. He reflected that over the preceding few months, he had experienced a sensation of detachment from his immediate environment, as though it was not real, making his world similar to that of a video game. He reported that in the apartment where he had previously been living, he had realized that something was amiss and had become convinced that the door number of his neighbor’s flat, number 6, signified that they meant him harm. He explained this was because 6 was associated with the number of the devil. He reported hearing his neighbors commenting negatively about his appearance. These distressing experiences prompted him to return to his family home, but he continued to hear his neighbors’ voices making derogatory comments about his appearance and began to hear them commenting on his actions and thoughts in the third person as well. On returning home, his paranoia regarding his previous neighbors worsened, resulting in him rarely leaving the house. The volume and frequency of derogatory auditory hallucinations also worsened, and he reported hearing the thoughts of others as well. There was a degree of insight, and although the patient was convinced of the reality of his experiences, he also saw the stress of losing his father as associated with his experiences and was accepting of input from mental health services.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Schizophrenia,"1. **Schizophrenia**: The presence of auditory hallucinations, delusions, social withdrawal, and a family history of schizophrenia make it a strong initial differential.

2. **Schizoaffective Disorder**: Although primarily displaying symptoms of schizophrenia, the lack of prominent mood symptoms at this point makes schizoaffective disorder a secondary consideration.

3. **Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features**: Given the initial suspicion of a depressive episode and the presence of psychotic symptoms, this diagnosis is considered but lacks significant depressive symptoms.

4. **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)**: Considering the patient's history of exposure to civil war and asylum-seeking, PTSD could be considered, but lacks the full spectrum of PTSD symptoms.

5. **Brief Psychotic Disorder**: The duration and progression of symptoms over 12 months are not typical for brief psychotic disorder, but remains a possibility for acute presentation.

6. **Bipolar Disorder with Psychotic Features**: While there are psychotic symptoms, there is no evidence of manic or hypomanic episodes to strongly suggest this diagnosis.

7. **Delusional Disorder**: The predominance of non-bizarre delusions could fit, but the presence of hallucinations and the broader symptoms suggest a more complex disorder.

8. **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) with Poor Insight**: Some intrusive thoughts could align with OCD, but the extent and nature of hallucinations and delusions suggest otherwise.

9. **Personality Disorder (e.g., Schizotypal Personality Disorder)**: The social withdrawal and eccentric beliefs could suggest a personality disorder, but the psychosis and acute symptoms are more prominent.

10. **Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder**: Despite the denial of substance use, any undetected substance use could potentially cause similar symptoms but lacks supporting evidence here.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Schizophrenia**: The most fitting diagnosis considering auditory hallucinations, delusional thoughts, family history, and progressive symptomology.

2. **Schizoaffective Disorder**: Due to the psychotic symptoms and potential for mood disorder overlap.

3. **Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features**: A consideration if depressive symptoms become more apparent.

4. **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)**: Remains on the list due to historical trauma, although symptoms don't fully align.

5. **Bipolar Disorder with Psychotic Features**: Could become relevant with emerging manic episodes.

6. **Delusional Disorder**: Less likely due to hallucinations and broader symptoms.

7. **Brief Psychotic Disorder**: While possible, the chronicity of symptoms reduces likelihood.

8. **Personality Disorder (e.g., Schizotypal Personality Disorder)**: Could explain some social and cognitive features if psychosis were less prominent.

9. **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) with Poor Insight**: Least likely given the nature of psychotic symptoms.

10. **Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder**: Unlikely due to the lack of evidence for substance use.","['Psychiatry and Behavioral Health', 'Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,20.0,F

A man in his 30s with a medical history of epilepsy and alcohol use disorder who was taking lamotrigine presented with severe head trauma. His Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) was 11 M5V4E2 on admission, and a computed tomographic (CT) scan showed a right frontal epidural hematoma with a maximum thickness of 19 mm and a volume of 30 cm3 (Figure 1A). The hematoma was evacuated by neurosurgery, and his GCS improved to 14 postoperatively. On postoperative day 2, he developed isolated dysphagia and dysphonia. Laryngoscopic examination revealed right vocal cord paralysis (Figure 1B).

    ",Cerebral vein thrombosis,"1. **Epidural Hematoma** - Initially diagnosed based on CT scan showing right frontal epidural hematoma, which is consistent with head trauma and initial symptoms.
   
2. **Prolonged Recovery from Anesthesia** - Could explain postoperative symptoms including dysphagia and dysphonia, typically seen after head surgery.
   
3. **Vocal Cord Paralysis due to Surgical Complication** - Considering the laryngoscopic finding of right vocal cord paralysis, this could be due to nerve damage during surgery.
   
4. **Postoperative Stroke** - Could cause new-onset neurological symptoms such as dysphagia and dysphonia in the postoperative period.
   
5. **Brainstem Injury** - Could explain both the vocal cord paralysis and other neurological deficits if there was unnoticed damage extending beyond the epidural hematoma.
   
6. **Lamotrigine Toxicity** - Although less likely, changes in lamotrigine levels or interactions due to surgery and altered metabolism could exacerbate neurological symptoms.
   
7. **Alcohol Withdrawal** - Known history of alcohol use disorder; withdrawal can cause neurological symptoms but dysphagia and dysphonia are less typical.
   
8. **Myasthenia Gravis** - A potential cause of dysphagia and dysphonia due to muscle weakness, though less likely given the acute presentation post-surgery.
   
9. **Vagus Nerve Injury** - Given the isolated vocal cord paralysis, a direct injury to the vagus nerve during the surgery could be responsible.
   
10. **Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Injury** - Injury or stretching of the recurrent laryngeal nerve during intubation or surgery could lead to vocal cord paralysis.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Vagus Nerve Injury**
2. **Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Injury**
3. **Vocal Cord Paralysis due to Surgical Complication**
4. **Postoperative Stroke**
5. **Brainstem Injury**

7. **Prolonged Recovery from Anesthesia**
8. **Lamotrigine Toxicity**
9. **Alcohol Withdrawal**
10. **Myasthenia Gravis**

The reranked points consider that the isolated vocal cord paralysis and the parallel development of symptoms post-surgery most likely suggest direct nerve involvement or injury during the surgical procedure.

### INPUT:
A 45-year-old man was referred to a tertiary care center for hoarseness. He had a left vocal fold polyp that was removed 2 months earlier at an outside institution, with benign pathology reported. Subsequent stroboscopy revealed a hemorrhagic-appearing polyp (2-3 mm). He was sent for preoperative voice therapy, with plans for excision. However, his voice worsened with therapy, and he returned to the otolaryngology clinic after a few weeks. A larger, 6- to 7-mm, irregular, left vocal fold mass was noted. Preoperative imaging was nonspecific, revealing a small soft-tissue density along the true vocal fold. The patient was taken to the operating room for excision (Figure, A). After the final pathology results were obtained, the patient was taken back to the operating room for cordectomy with negative margins.

The first consideration was a vocal fold polyp due to his history and the appearance of the lesion. However, the rapid growth and irregularity of the mass suggests a more sinister pathology leading to the prioritization of possible malignant conditions. Laryngeal carcinoma eventually takes precedence given the patient's worsening symptoms, the increase in size despite therapy, and the need for excision with negative margins./","['Laryngology', 'Otolaryngology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,45.0,F

A 34-year-old woman presented with headache, double vision, and seizures for 1 month and altered consciousness for 1 week. She had had 2 episodes of seizures that were characterized by tonic head and eye deviation to the left, followed by a brief period of tonic-clonic activity of all 4 limbs and postictal confusion for 10 to 15 minutes. She denied a history of fever, head trauma, limb weakness, or vomiting. She was a vegetarian, nonsmoker, and nondrinker. She denied a history of drug addiction. On examination, she was confused. She had facial flushing and grade III clubbing in her fingers and toes. Her chest and cardiovascular examination results were normal. She had ptosis in her right eye. The right eye was deviated laterally secondary to right-medial rectus palsy. Her pupil size and pupillary light reactions were normal. She also had grade II papilledema. Her motor and sensory examination results were normal; however, she had brisk deep-tendon jerks and extensor planter responses. There were no meningeal signs. Her cranial magnetic resonance image showed 2 ring-enhancing lesions in the right frontal and left parietal cortexes, along with surrounding brain edema and mass effects. Both lesions showed a thin-walled, contrast-enhancing rim with a central liquefaction (Figure, A). The central liquefaction showed restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images.

### INPUT:
An 11-day-old girl with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and unilateral renal agenesis presented with a right neck mass and intermittent inspiratory stridor present at birth. The patient did not require positive pressure or intubation, but she had intermittent stridor associated with desaturations. She had feeding difficulty and failure to thrive. On physical examination, the newborn had facial dysmorphism, including a broad and flat nasal dorsum and mild micrognathia. Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed a cystic lesion consistent with a vallecular cyst. A modified barium swallow study demonstrated laryngeal penetration and aspiration of thin and nectar-thick liquids. A diffuse, soft, palpable mass was present along the right neck. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a multispatial mildly enhancing mass within the bilateral retropharyngeal, parapharyngeal, and carotid spaces, with a mildly hyperintense signal relative to muscle on T1-weighted and T2-weighted images and associated restricted diffusion. The mass was largest on the right side, with convex borders, mild superior displacement of the right parotid gland, and posterior displacement of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle (Figure, A, B). The T2-weighted MRI also demonstrated a hyperintense, nonenhancing lesion within the base of the tongue consistent with a vallecular cyst. The thyroid appeared normal and in its expected location, but no thymus was present in the mediastinum. The patient was taken to the operating room for excision of the vallecular cyst, and a fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the right neck mass was performed for cytopathological analysis (Figure, C, D).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Ectopic thymus,"1. **Lymphatic Malformation**  
   The presence of a cystic neck mass in a newborn with stridor could suggest a lymphatic malformation, especially given the multi-spatial nature of the mass and its characteristics on MRI.

2. **Teratoma**  
   A congenital neck mass with complex imaging features such as heterogeneous enhancement and multiple spatial involvements can suggest a teratoma.

3. **Neuroblastoma**  
   Considering the patient's age and the finding of a neck mass with specific MRI characteristics, neuroblastoma is a possible diagnosis.

4. **Hemangioma**  
   A compressible, non-tender mass which might show increased signal on T2-weighted MRI could be indicative of a hemangioma.

5. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**  
   A congenital neck cystic lesion that presents in infancy can suggest a branchial cleft cyst.

6. **Cystic Hygroma**  
   The presence of a soft, diffused neck mass could suggest a cystic hygroma, particularly with the multi-spatial involvement.

7. **Dermoid Cyst**  
   A cystic mass in the neck region with fluid characteristics could be consistent with a dermoid cyst.

8. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst**  
   Although the thyroid is normal, a midline cystic neck mass can suggest a thyroglossal duct cyst.

9. **Enlarged Lymph Node due to Infection**  
   Consideration for a reactive lymph node enlargement resulting from congenital infection might be warranted.

10. **Metastatic Disease**  
   Though less likely, metastasis leading to neck mass formation can be included as a differential in older pediatric populations usually.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Lymphatic Malformation**  
   Given the cystic, multi-spatial nature of the mass and the age of the patient, a lymphatic malformation is highly suggestive.

2. **Teratoma**  
   The characteristics on imaging and complex location support a diagnosis of a congenital teratoma.

3. **Cystic Hygroma**  
   With the presentation of a large, soft neck mass, a cystic hygroma remains a strong possibility.

4. **Hemangioma**  
   Based on the MRI findings and potential blood flow characteristics, hemangioma is a consideration.

5. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**  
   Although less likely due to bilateral involvement, this can not be entirely excluded.

6. **Dermoid Cyst**  
   The young age and cystic nature warrant differentiation from dermoid cysts.

7. **Neuroblastoma**  
   Typically located in the adrenal glands, but neck involvement can occur.

8. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst**  
   Not highly likely given location and imaging, but still possible.

9. **Metastatic Disease**  
   Unlikely in this age, but considered as a thorough approach.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 50s was referred to the dermatology clinic with a diagnosis of granuloma annulare made on the basis of prior skin biopsy results. She had been treated by a rheumatologist for polyarticular inflammatory arthritis involving the wrists, metacarpophalangeal joints, and proximal interphalangeal joints, as well as fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. Examination revealed numerous, pink-purple dermal papules on the trunk and extremities, with preference for the extensor surfaces of the arms (Figure, A) and legs. No lymphadenopathy was noted. The patient reported a 5- to 7-kg weight loss without fever or sweats. Her pulmonary and joint symptoms were relieved by daily oral prednisone and flared with taper below 10 mg. Other medications prescribed included hydroxychloroquine, 400 mg, daily for 18 months and weekly adalimumab injections for 7 months, without improvement.

    ",Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma,"1. **Sarcoidosis** - Consider based on skin involvement (papular sarcoidosis) and systemic symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, arthritis, and weight loss.
   
2. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** - Evaluate due to polyarticular arthritis, systemic symptoms, and skin manifestations which could mimic non-specific dermal papules.

3. **Rheumatoid Arthritis** - Consider due to history of polyarticular inflammatory arthritis, despite skin manifestations not being typical.

4. **Dermatomyositis** - Consider given systemic findings including proximal muscle weakness (if present) and specific skin manifestations, although they might not match precisely.

5. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegener's Granulomatosis)** - Consider due to respiratory symptoms and systemic involvement, even though the skin involvement is different.

6. **Lymphoma (e.g., cutaneous T-cell lymphoma)** - Consider due to systemic symptoms, weight loss, and skin manifestations.

7. **Amyloidosis** - Consider based on systemic symptoms and potential skin changes, although papular lesions are not typical.

8. **Infectious causes (e.g., Tuberculosis)** - Consider less likely, but possible given weight loss and systemic symptoms, even though typical skin findings might differ.

9. **Mixed Connective Tissue Disease** - Consider given systemic involvement and history of overlap symptoms often seen with other autoimmune disorders.

### INPUT:
A 53-year-old woman developed patchy numbness in her right arm. The numbness progressed over 10 months to involve her entire right arm, patches of her left arm, and her distal lower extremities. She also developed right-hand incoordination and imbalance. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain is shown in Figure 1A. A complete blood cell count with a differential; liver function testing; tests for HIV, rapid plasma reagin, serum aquaporin-4 antibody, and antinuclear antibodies; and levels of sodium, calcium, creatinine, glucose, thyroxine, and vitamin B12 were unremarkable. Examinations of the cerebrospinal fluid had normal results twice, including for white blood cell count with a differential, glucose level, total protein level, IgG index, oligoclonal bands, cultures, and cytology testing.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Erdheim-Chester disease,"To construct a differential diagnosis for the symptoms and test results provided, we'll consider a wide range of neurological disorders, progressive numbness, muscular incoordination, and balance issues. We'll then refine this list in our final step.

1. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS):** Given the neurological symptoms and MRI imaging findings showing characteristic lesions.
   
2. **Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy:** Progressive myelopathy could explain bilateral arm and lower limb symptoms that are gradual over months.
   
3. **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS):** Although the presentation with numbness is atypical. ALS primarily affects motor functions, but early in disease course, sensory symptoms might be considered.

4. **Inherited Peripheral Neuropathies (e.g., Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease):** Progressive sensory symptoms that involve distal limbs.

5. **Spinal Cord Tumor:** Space-occupying lesion could cause progressive limb numbness and incoordination by compressing relevant nerve pathways.

6. **Autoimmune Demyelinating Syndrome (e.g., Neuromyelitis Optica):** Although Aquaporin-4 antibodies were negative, the phenotype could overlap with other demyelinating diseases.

7. **Cerebrovascular Disease (Chronic Ischemia or Vasculitis):** Patchy numbness could represent diffuse small vessel disease or multifocal strokes, considering age and risk factors.

8. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome (e.g., Paraneoplastic Cerebellar Degeneration):** Neurological symptoms without clear imaging findings can occur in the context of an occult malignancy.

9. **Vitamin E Deficiency:** Rare, but neurological symptoms do progress if severe, despite normal results in more common vitamin deficiencies tested.

10. **Transverse Myelitis:** While usually more acute, chronic cases could present with these symptoms; MRI findings would be key but not specified.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

Upon reassessment and integration of all patient data, including test results:

1. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS):** Remains high given the chronicity, symptoms, and likely MRI findings.
   
2. **Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy:** Anatomical and progressive sensory-motor deficits align well with this condition.

3. **Autoimmune Demyelinating Syndrome:** Despite negative results for some tests, still a reasonable alternative given progressive demyelinating-type symptoms.

4. **Spinal Cord Tumor:** Symptoms align with progressive cord compression, although less likely given unremarkable cerebrospinal fluid analysis.

5. **Inherited Peripheral Neuropathies:** Chronicity supports this hypothesis, though less common to debut with patchy numbness.

6. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome:** Remains possible; requires further cancer screening depending on risk factors.

7. **Chronic Ischemia/Vasculitis:** Unlikely given MRI should have shown relevant findings at this stage if chronic small vessel disease was significant.

8. **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS):** Unlikely due to prominent sensory symptoms without clear motor neuron disease evidence on examination.

9. **Vitamin E Deficiency:** Very rare with this presentation given normal blood results; however, deficiency states often warrant complete assessment.

10. **Transverse Myelitis:** Less likely due to usual presentation differences, but consider laterality indicating potential varying etiology.

A 33-year-old otherwise healthy black man presented to the emergency department for evaluation of blurry vision in both eyes. He had no relevant medical, family, or ocular history. There was no history of trauma or ocular surgery. One month prior to presentation, he had developed fevers, chills, and coughing. After several days, he had developed redness, pain, photophobia, and blurry vision in his left eye, and he had subsequently developed similar symptoms in his right eye. On presentation, his visual acuity was counting fingers OU. Intraocular pressures were 14 mm Hg OU. A slitlamp examination revealed mild conjunctival redness, 2+ anterior chamber cell, and flare in both eyes, as well as mild posterior synechiae. The cornea was clear without keratic precipitates, and there were no iris nodules. Pigment was present on the anterior lens capsule. A fundus examination demonstrated a moderate amount of vitreous cell, hyperemia and edema of the optic disc, and retinal detachments in both eyes (Figure). The detachments were inferior and shifted with the patient’s head position, suggesting serous detachments. Findings were similar bilaterally. A B-scan ultrasonographic test demonstrated bullous retinal detachments and diffusely thickened choroid.

### INPUT:
A 48-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 2-month history of progressive lower extremity weakness, sensory loss, and sphincter dysfunction. In the weeks prior to onset, he traveled to Yosemite National Park but denied any particular infectious exposures or symptoms including rash. He reported no personal or family medical history. Although he did consume a variety of nutraceuticals, he denied medication and recreational drug use. On examination, mental status, cranial nerves, and upper extremities were normal. Lower extremities were significant for his right side having greater pyramidal weakness than the left, with brisk reflexes and right ankle clonus, as well as a sensory level to pinprick at T6. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the total spine with and without gadolinium is seen in Figure 1. Initial investigations were notable for normal complete blood cell count, electrolytes, kidney and liver function, B12, and thyrotropin as well as an unremarkable MRI of the brain. Three lumbar punctures were performed over the course of the patient’s hospitalization, each with a white blood cell count less than 5 /µL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001), normal IgG index, absent oligoclonal bands, normal protein and glucose levels, and benign cytology. A comprehensive infectious and inflammatory workup including HIV, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, Lyme disease, antinuclear antibodies, astrocyte aquaporin-4 autoantibody, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein autoantibody, and serum and cerebrospinal fluid autoimmune panels were negative. Whole-body positron emission tomography demonstrated hypermetabolism of the midthoracic cord.

3. **Spinal Cord Neoplasm** - The progression and imaging suggest a potential spinal cord tumor.
4. **Sarcoidosis** - Given negative infectious/inflammatory workup, consider this systemic granulomatous disease.
5. **Multiple Sclerosis** - Unlikely due to lack of typical findings and negative oligoclonal bands.
6. **Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder** - Despite negative antibody, clinical presentation with spinal cord involvement suggests consideration.
7. **Transverse Myelitis** - Unlikely due to normal cell counts and lack of inflammation.
8. **Spinal Cord Infarction** - Acute onset would be typical; however, progressive nature makes this unlikely.
9. **Neurosyphilis** - Low probability with negative serologies and atypical presentation.

Final diagnosis: Male breast cancer.
Case report: A 43-year-old African American woman presented with a nontender, self-palpated mass in her left breast. She had hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and obesity and was a current smoker. Her medications included carvedilol, furosemide, lisinopril, metformin, and aspirin but no testosterone or herbal supplements. Family history was significant for a sister with brain cancer, diagnosed in her 40s. On physical examination, her vital signs were within normal limits; her body mass index, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, was 53. Her left nipple was retracted. At the 2-o’clock position of the left breast, 3 cm from the nipple, there was a 3.5 × 3.0–cm firm mass. The right breast was normal without masses, and there was no palpable axillary lymphadenopathy. She underwent a bilateral diagnostic mammogram, which showed a partially obscured mass in the left upper outer quadrant with linear extension to the nipple (Figure, left panel). Targeted ultrasound showed a 2.0 × 1.6 × 1.6–cm irregular hypoechoic mass (Figure, right panel).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Male breast cancer,"1. **Breast Fibroadenoma**: Common benign breast tumor in young women. Initial consideration for any breast mass.
   
2. **Breast Cyst**: Fluid-filled sac within the breast, often benign. Considered due to mass description.

3. **Fat Necrosis**: Benign condition that occurs after trauma, can mimic malignancy. Differential due to firmness of the mass.

4. **Intraductal Papilloma**: Benign growth in the milk ducts which could cause nipple changes.

5. **Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)**: Non-invasive breast cancer that could present with a retracted nipple and firm mass.

6. **Invasive Ductal Carcinoma**: Most common type of breast cancer, matching mass description and nipple change.

7. **Invasive Lobular Carcinoma**: Less common than ductal carcinoma but considered due to presentation.

8. **Phyllodes Tumor**: Rare breast tumor that can be benign or malignant. Consistent with mass size.

9. **Metastatic Cancer to the Breast**: Rare, but secondary cancer to the breast should be explored, given the patient’s age and family history.

10. **Hyperplasia**: Benign proliferation of breast tissue, can result in mass formation.

### Reranking:

1. **Invasive Ductal Carcinoma**: Given the retracted nipple, firm mass characteristics, and mammogram/ultrasound findings, invasive ductal carcinoma is the most likely diagnosis.
  
2. **Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)**: Second consideration due to similar characteristics and its relationship to invasive forms.

3. **Breast Fibroadenoma**: Common benign breast tumor; always a consideration but less likely given age and breast changes.

4. **Invasive Lobular Carcinoma**: Persistent option given the findings but less common than ductal type.

5. **Phyllodes Tumor**: Less common than carcinoma but considered due to mass size and firmness.

6. **Breast Cyst**: Unlikely given patient's age and imaging characteristics.

7. **Intraductal Papilloma**: Unusual presentation, but a possibility due to nipple changes.

8. **Metastatic Cancer to the Breast**: Uncommon without evidence of another primary cancer, but considered due to family history.

9. **Fat Necrosis**: Unlikely in the absence of trauma history and with described imaging findings.

10. **Hyperplasia**: Least likely given age and imaging findings suggesting malignancy.","['Breast Cancer', 'Oncology', 'Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion', 'Cancer Screening, Prevention, Control']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,43.0,M

### INPUT:
A 66-year-old woman presented to the emergency department for painful and pruritic ulcerative cutaneous lesions involving her back, nose, lips (Figure, A), and mucosal lesions involving her oral cavity and oropharynx. The lesions initially only involved her lips and nasal bridge, and appeared 5 months prior while she was living on a ranch in Mexico. The lesions did not respond to treatment with an unknown oral antibiotic. Her medical history included hypertension treated with captopril and a remote history of psoriasis. Physical examination demonstrated several dry, crusted skin lesions with blistering and ulceration, and shallow erythematous ulcerations of her oral mucosa. Internal medicine, otolaryngology, and dermatology departments were consulted. Results of flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy demonstrated erythematous and ulcerative lesions with surrounding leukoplakia involving the base of tongue, glossoepiglottic fold, lingual and laryngeal surfaces of the epiglottis, and aryepiglottic folds (Figure, C and D). A QuantiFERON-TB Gold test was obtained, and results were found to be positive. Serum antigen testing for blastomyces, histoplasmosis, syphilis, HIV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human herpesvirus 6, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, varicella zoster virus, human polyomavirus 2, and West Nile virus were performed, and all results were found to be negative. A biopsy of the skin lesion was obtained from the edge of the lesion found on the patient’s back (Figure, B). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay serological testing was subsequently performed, and results demonstrated elevated levels of antidesmoglein 1 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and antidesmoglein 3 IgG.

### INPUT:
A healthy Asian woman in her 20s presented with a 5-month history of progressive bilateral nasal obstruction. She also complained of recurrent epistaxis. She had no notable medical history except stable asthma. On physical examination, nasopharyngoscopy showed a pedunculated mass with a smooth mucosal surface arising from the roof of the nasopharynx. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging (Figure, A and B) revealed a midline, well-defined, pedunculated polypoid lesion with areas of calcifications in the nasopharynx, measuring approximately 1.2 × 1.5 × 2.0 cm. An endoscopic resection via retrovelar approach using a 70-degree endoscope combined with transnasal approach was performed under general anesthesia. The mass was completely resected with its stalk and with adequate surgical margin. Histopathological results (Figure, C and D) showed that the tumor cells were arranged in papillary structures with fibrovascular cores and these cells also had nuclear grooves. Results of other investigations after surgery were negative for cancer, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neck and thyroid ultrasonography. In addition, no residual tumor or systemic metastasis was observed on positron emission tomography (PET)-CT results. There was no evidence of recurrence at 12-month postoperative follow-up.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Papillary adenocarcinoma,"1. **Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma** - This benign tumor is typical for its location and presentation with nasal obstruction and recurrent epistaxis in young patients, but it is more common in males.

2. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst** - These cysts can present as midline neck masses, but their potential calcifications and smooth surface could be confused for otherwise benign lesions in the nasopharynx.

3. **Inverted Papilloma** - A benign epithelial tumor in the nasal cavity, associated with unilateral nasal obstruction and potential bleeding, but possible papillary structures are identified.

4. **Papillary Adenoma** - A rare, benign tumor that can have papillary structures and calcifications similar to described histopathology.

5. **Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Polyp** - Can present with nasal obstruction and is characterized pathologically by fibrovascular cores similar to the findings in this case, though usually less complex histologically.

6. **Sinonasal Papilloma** - Includes histological features of papillary structures typical of Schneiderian papillomas and may be differentiated by nuclear grooves in pathology.

7. **Chondrosarcoma** - A rare malignant cartilage-forming tumor in the nasopharynx occasionally presents with calcifications.

8. **Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma Metastasis** - Though primarily thyroid-based, metastatic, papillary tissue could show similar histopathologic features including nuclear grooves, but was ruled out.

9. **Fibroepithelial Polyp** - A benign mass often found in various anatomic sites in the body; it can have a pedunculated nature with variable histology.

10. **Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma** - While usually more aggressive and typical in older populations, it could still present with mass and calcifications, though ruled out by negative cancer screenings.

### INPUT:
An 81-year-old Mexican woman was evaluated in the retina clinic for scattered subretinal lesions in the right eye. She complained of a gradual decline in her vision bilaterally over the past 2 years. She denied flashes, floaters, or eye pain but endorsed a chronic cough. She had no known ocular or medical history and took no systemic medications. She was born and raised in Mexico prior to her immigration to the United States 5 years before presentation. She worked as a farmer and denied recent illnesses, contacts with illnesses, alcohol or tobacco use, and having pets. Her visual acuity was 20/60 OD and 20/40 OS with normal intraocular pressures. Her slitlamp examination results were notable for mild nuclear sclerosis in both eyes and were negative for conjunctival or corneal lesions. She had round, reactive pupils and no anterior chamber inflammation in either eye. Dilated fundus examination results revealed a few pigmented anterior vitreous cells, a normal optic disc, and flat and large yellowish chorioretinal lesions with overlying pigment scattered throughout the macula and periphery in the right eye (Figure). The left eye had several similar chorioretinal lesions in the superotemporal periphery.

8. Toxocariasis
9. Birdshot Chorioretinopathy
10. Central Serous Chorioretinopathy

Considering the patient's history of immigration from Mexico, chronic cough, and presentation indicative of ocular symptoms, tuberculosis-related chorioretinitis becomes the most likely diagnosis. The lack of pain, both ocular and systemic symptoms, and lifestyle factors support this ordering. Additionally, systematic and symptomatic evaluation through diagnostic tests, such as fundus examination and chest X-ray, would assist in further confirming this diagnosis.","['Ophthalmology', 'Choroidal Disorders', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Tuberculosis', 'Intraocular Inflammation']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,81.0,M

### INPUT:
A woman in her 30s was referred to the department of Otorhinolaryngology–Head & Neck Surgery for a medical history of severe dysphagia and dysphonia. The patient reported fever and rhinorrhea in the few days preceding the emergency consultation. She did not take medication over the past 3 months. There was no relevant family medical history. At the clinical examination, the patient had several macules and desquamatory lesions on the mucosa of the oral cavity, lips, and vulva, and she had hemorrhage lesions of the eye sclera (Figure). The skin of the patient was unremarkable. The nasofibroscopy results showed generalized desquamatory lesions of the upper aerodigestive tract mucosa affecting the laryngeal and vocal fold mucosa (Figure). There was no dyspnea and the airway was clear. The patient revealed that she had a similar but less severe clinical event 5 years previously. At that time, no diagnosis was found and the lesions disappeared following treatment with corticosteroids. Dermatopathologic analysis, biology, serology, and biopsy were performed.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Multiforme erythema,"1. **Pemphigus Vulgaris:** Given the presence of mucosal desquamation and oral cavity lesions, pemphigus vulgaris should be considered. This autoimmune disorder typically presents with painful mucosal and sometimes skin lesions.

2. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (SJS/TEN):** The acute presentation with mucosal involvement and history of similar past incident raises suspicion for this severe mucocutaneous reaction, often triggered by medication or infections.

3. **Erythema Multiforme:** A hypersensitivity reaction that involves mucosal lesions but also typically presents with target lesions on the skin, which are absent here.

4. **Behçet's Disease:** This is characterized by recurrent oral and genital ulcers and may explain the lesions on the mucosa of the oral cavity and vulva.

5. **Lichen Planus:** Although more chronic in nature, this condition can cause mucosal lesions and should be considered with vulvar and oral involvement.

6. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection:** Given the acute nature and mucosal involvement as well as past recurrence, an HSV infection could present with similar symptoms.

7. **Mucous Membrane Pemphigoid:** This is an autoimmune disorder that leads to chronic blistering lesions on the mucous membranes, primarily affecting the oral cavity.

8. **Sjogren's Syndrome:** Despite being less likely due to the lack of dry mouth or eyes mentioned, this autoimmune disease can sometimes cause oral mucosal lesions.

9. **Infectious Mononucleosis:** Although primarily noted for causing fever, sore throat, and lymphadenopathy, severe cases might present with mucosal involvement.

10. **Lupus Erythematosus:** This can present with mucosal ulcers among other systemic symptoms, although skin lesions are a common complaint which is missing here.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Pemphigus Vulgaris**: The combination of mucosal lesions, prior similar episode treated with steroids, and presence in oral cavity strongly aligns with this condition.
   
2. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (SJS/TEN)**: Mucosal involvement and acute presentation is very suggestive of this diagnosis.

3. **Behçet's Disease**: Recurrent oral and vulvar ulcers and ocular involvement make this a significant consideration.

4. **Mucous Membrane Pemphigoid**: Given mucosal site predominance and blisters, this remains a strong possibility.

5. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection**: Due to recurrence nature and mucosal involvement.

6. **Erythema Multiforme**: Less likely without skin involvement, but mucosal lesions still pertinent.
   
7. **Lichen Planus**: Given presence of mucosal involvement, albeit chronic nature is atypical for acute presentation.

8. **Lupus Erythematosus**: Systemic autoimmune possibility based on mucosal lesions.

9. **Infectious Mononucleosis**: Considered but generally accompanied by more systemic symptoms like lymphadenopathy.
   
10. **Sjogren's Syndrome**: Less likely without sicca symptoms but potential for mucosal alterations.","['Laryngology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Swallowing and Dysphagia', 'Dermatology', 'Cutaneous Drug Reactions']",0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,30.0,M

### OUTPUT:
    ",Merkel cell carcinoma,"1. **Kaposi Sarcoma**: Given the violaceous color and the presence of satellite lesions, Kaposi Sarcoma should be considered.

2. **Basal Cell Carcinoma**: This is a common skin cancer that can present with a nodular, ulcerated lesion, often with telangiectasia.

3. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: A rapidly growing, ulcerated lesion that bleeds easily could suggest squamous cell carcinoma.

4. **Melanoma**: An expanding, pigmented lesion with irregular borders and variation in color can indicate melanoma.

5. **Lichen Planus**: Violaceous lesions with itchiness could point towards lichen planus, though the ulceration is atypical.

6. **Lymphomatoid Papulosis**: A papulonodular, possibly necrotic, lesion related to cutaneous T-cell lymphoma should be considered.

7. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma**: A rare but aggressive neuroendocrine carcinoma that presents as a rapidly growing flesh-colored to violaceous nodule.

8. **Pyogenic Granuloma**: A highly vascular lesion that can bleed easily could represent a pyogenic granuloma, especially given a rapid growth history.

9. **Epithelioid Sarcoma**: Consider this for subcutaneous nodules that might simulate an ulcerated or necrotic lesion.

10. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans (DFSP)**: A slowly growing nodular tumor that could present atypically as ulcerated or necrotic in elderly patients.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on All Presented Information:
1. **Kaposi Sarcoma**: The presentation of a violaceous lesion with satellite papules is strongly suggestive.
2. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma**: Rapid growth and the aggressive nature align with the patient's symptoms.
3. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: Given the ulceration and size of the lesion.
4. **Basal Cell Carcinoma**: Due to commonality and appearance.
5. **Lymphomatoid Papulosis**: Rare but the morphology fits.
6. **Melanoma**: Always a consideration with rapidly changing lesions.
7. **Pyogenic Granuloma**: Rapid growth and bleeding tendency fit the description.
8. **Epithelioid Sarcoma**: Considered based on deeper necrotic characteristics.
9. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans (DFSP)**: Possible but less likely based on typical presentation.

A 29-year-old healthy man presented with a 2-month history of left-sided epiphora, headache, and facial pressure. A polypoid lesion was identified at the left lateral nasal wall. Noncontrasted computed tomography showed a hyperdense mass involving the left medial canthus extending through the nasolacrimal duct into the left nasal cavity. The patient underwent endoscopic left maxillary antrostomy, ethmoidectomy, and biopsy of mass, with results of pathology analysis showing poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was positive for cytokeratin 5/6 and p63, and negative for Epstein-Barr virus, p16, CD45 (leukocyte common antigen), and synaptophysin. The patient was referred to a tertiary care facility for further treatment. On examination, there was a palpable subcutaneous nodule 1 cm inferior to the left medial canthus with normal overlying skin. On nasal endoscopy, residual tumor was visible at the anterior aspect of the lateral nasal wall. Computed tomography showed postoperative changes with enhancement of left medial canthus extending into nasolacrimal duct and along the lateral nasal sidewall (Figure, A).

A healthy 30-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with facial trauma after an assault. Physical examination was notable for tenderness over the nasal bones. No neurologic deficits were noted. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head without contrast revealed nasal bone fractures and an incidental 7-mm tissue density within the posterior aspect of the left sphenoid sinus (Figure 1A) with an apparent dehiscence of the posterior wall and possible communication with the intracranial extra-axial spaces and brain parenchyma. A magnetic resonance imaging scan with contrast was recommended to further characterize the lesion which showed a transosseous T1 dark, T2 bright multilobulated mass measuring 2.1 × 1.4 × 1.3 cm with heterogeneous enhancement on postcontrast imaging extending into the sphenoid sinus. An endoscopic transnasal approach was used to obtain a tissue biopsy specimen.

A man in his early 60s with a medical history of chest pain requiring a coronary angiogram (which demonstrated only mild luminal irregularities) approximately 1 year prior to presentation, hypertension, long-standing dyslipidemia, and multiparity presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of dull, pressurelike chest pain radiating to the left arm. The pain started at rest, was 10 of 10 in severity, and was not alleviated by changing position. He also experienced concomitant nausea and diaphoresis. His family history was notable for hypertension, and no other systemic diseases were reported. On physical examination, his blood pressure was 115/76 mm Hg, heart rate was regular at 72 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation level was 98% on room air. The patient was afebrile. Physical examination also revealed mild bibasilar crackles and jugular venous distention, and no murmurs or lower extremity edema. Laboratory test results demonstrated an elevated troponin, and the 12-lead electrocardiogram showed marked ST-segment elevations in leads V2 to V5 (Figure, A). The ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) pager was activated, and the patient was transferred urgently to the catheterization laboratory. Coronary angiography of the patient’s left anterior descending coronary artery was performed, and the findings are depicted in the Figure, B.

10. Panic Attack

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. Acute Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)
   - Elevated troponin and significant ST-segment elevations in ECG leads V2 to V5 are classic for STEMI. The acute presentation and the need for urgent catheterization underline this as the primary diagnosis.

2. Aortic Dissection
   - Sudden onset severe chest pain with possible differentials such as aortic dissection should not be dismissed, although the presence of ST-segment elevation makes this less likely.

3. Pulmonary Embolism
   - Although classic signs like ST elevation are not typical for PE, its abrupt onset and severe presentation warrant consideration, particularly with associated ECG changes.

4. Unstable Angina
   - This is less likely given the presence of elevated troponin and clear ECG changes pointing towards STEMI, but is considered given the high-risk coronary background.

5. Pericarditis
   - Typically, global ST-segment elevation is noted rather than localized; coupled with elevated troponin, pericarditis remains lower on the list.

6. Pneumothorax
   - The patient would likely have presented with more respiratory distress and hypotension rather than ST elevations and elevated troponin.

7. Esophageal Rupture (Boerhaave Syndrome)
   - Sudden chest pain could indicate rupture, but lack of gastrointestinal symptoms and elevated troponin make this less likely.

8. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)
   - The severity of symptoms and high troponin levels move GERD lower in the ranked list, even though chest pain can mimic cardiac pain.

9. Costochondritis
   - Musculoskeletal chest pain would not cause ST-segment elevations or troponin elevation.

10. Panic Attack
    - While panic attacks present with chest pain and distress, they do not cause elevated troponin or ECG changes as described.","['Obstetrics and Gynecology', 'Pregnancy', 'Obstetrics', ""Women's Health"", 'Cardiology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,60.0,F

### INPUT:
A 51-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and nephrolithiasis presented to the emergency department with left flank and left upper quadrant abdominal pain. She stated that “I think I have a kidney stone blocking my kidney” but denied nausea, vomiting, fever, dysuria, hematuria, or weight loss. She had no history of chronic abdominal pain. Past surgical history was noteworthy for emergency exploratory laparotomy and splenectomy for blunt trauma 14 years prior. Physical examination revealed a comfortable-appearing patient in no acute distress. Her temperature was 36.8°C; pulse, 77/min; and blood pressure, 125/86 mm Hg. Abdominal palpation elicited only mild epigastric tenderness without masses or rebound. There was no costovertebral angle tenderness. Laboratory data revealed normal levels of serum urea nitrogen and creatinine and normal liver function. A complete blood cell count showed leukocytosis (15 300/μL with 54% neutrophils, 38% lymphocytes, 8% monocytes); hemoglobin level, 15.5 g/dL; and hematocrit, 45.2%. Urinalysis revealed no red or white blood cells and was negative for leukocyte esterase and nitrate. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a well-circumscribed mass with a small focus of central high density resulting in surrounding streak artifact (Figure 1).

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. Adrenal Mass (Adrenal Adenoma or Pheochromocytoma) - Due to the presence of a well-circumscribed mass on CT and the history of hypertension.
2. Pancreatic Pseudocyst - Considered due to possible association with the history of trauma and a well-circumscribed mass finding.
3. Renal Cell Carcinoma - Though the CT finding suggests a mass, absence of hematuria or renal symptoms makes this less likely.
4. Retroperitoneal Hematoma - Given the history of trauma and well-defined mass, but current findings don’t strongly oppose or support.
5. Splenic Infarct - History of splenectomy makes it less likely, but residual splenic tissue could present as a mass.
6. Liposarcoma - A possible diagnosis with a well-circumscribed mass, although other symptoms are not typical.
7. Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm - Less likely due to lack of supportive symptoms and normal blood pressure.
8. Acute Pancreatitis - Unlikely given normal lab results and lack of significant pain or sneaky presentation.
9. Duodenal Ulcer - Unlikely due to lack of gastrointestinal symptoms or signs.
10. Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) - Possible with well-circumscribed mass but other clinical details don’t strongly support.","['Surgery', 'Radiology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,51.0,M

### INPUT:
A 60-year-old man with a history of Lyme disease presented with polydipsia and polyuria and received a diagnosis of diabetes insipidus. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results revealed a thickening and enhancement of the pituitary gland, stalk, and hypothalamus. The abnormal imaging findings improved on subsequent MRIs without treatment. Surveillance pituitary MRIs remained stable. Four years later, MRI results (Figure) revealed bilateral T1 and T2 low-intensity intraconal soft tissue masses with avid enhancement on postcontrast images. The optic nerves were encased with no evidence of infiltration of the nerves, vascular structures, or extraocular muscles. He reported the sensation of eye fullness and denied pain. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. His pupils were symmetric and responded to light and near effort; there was no relative afferent pupillary defect. The results of testing with an Amsler grid and Ishihara color plates were normal. His visual fields were full to confrontation. The optic nerves and retina were normal bilaterally. There was bilateral periorbital swelling and proptosis. Exophthalmometry measurements on a base of 92 were 17 mm on the right and 19 mm on the left. Applanation tonometry results were 12 mm Hg on the right and 15 mm Hg on the left. Extraocular motility examination results revealed substantial (−3) deficits in both eyes. The remainder of the neurologic examination results were normal.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Erdheim-Chester disease,"1. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH)**: Initially presenting with central diabetes insipidus and showing pituitary stalk thickening could be related to LCH, which also affects the bones and potentially soft tissue.

2. **Sarcoidosis**: Known to affect the central nervous system and manifest with pituitary abnormalities, as well as causing orbital masses.

3. **Lymphocytic Hypophysitis**: This condition usually presents with similar findings in the pituitary and can also regress over time without treatment.

4. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)**: Granulomatous inflammation can mimic many disorders, including central nervous and ocular involvement.

5. **IgG4-Related Disease**: Could explain systemic inflammation including the involvement of the pituitary and orbit.

6. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome**: A benign inflammatory condition affecting the cavernous sinus, which can have relapsing-remitting patterns similar to those described.

7. **Optic Nerve Sheath Meningioma**: Presents with proptosis and visual effects, though usually has dural tails and other distinguishing imaging features.

8. **Sarcoid-like Reaction**: Seen in various systemic disorders and could present with similar CNS and orbital findings, though less common.

9. **Orbital Lymphoma**: Would explain bilateral orbital masses and has characteristic imaging findings, distinct in diffusion-weighted imaging.

10. **Pituitary Adenoma with Orbital Metastasis**: Unlikely due to the resolution and stability of imaging findings without treatment, but a rare possibility.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on All Patient Information:

1. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH)**

A 45-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital following 3 weeks of dysphagia; 1 week of nasal regurgitation, nonproductive cough, and breathy voice; and a 25-pound weight loss over the preceding 2 months. She had been diagnosed a year earlier with HIV infection and hepatic tuberculosis. Baseline CD4 count was 7 cells/μL, and following treatment with HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) consisting of dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate, she achieved full virological suppression; however, CD4 counts remained low at 31 cells/μL. She had completed 12 months of directly observed therapy with ethambutol, moxifloxacin, and rifabutin—a liver-sparing regimen—owing to toxic effects from the first-line regimen 1 month prior to admission. Physical examination revealed evidence of perforation of the hard palate (Figure, A). A computed tomographic scan of the chest revealed necrotic lymph nodes, and a palatine biopsy was performed (Figure, B and C).

### INPUT:
A man in his 60s with a history of end-stage renal disease who had a kidney transplant 9 months previously presented with progressive cough, dyspnea, and hoarseness. His history also included chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and a 14-pack-year smoking history. He initially presented 3 months prior with upper respiratory symptoms, which continued to worsen despite oral antibiotic therapy. His cough became productive with white, frothy phlegm that was accompanied by fever, wheezing, hoarseness, and fatigue. His dyspnea worsened in the supine position. Flexible laryngotracheoscopy results revealed diffuse, white-to-yellow pseudomembranous changes involving the glottis and supraglottis (Figure, A), posterior tracheal wall, and left mainstem bronchus with skip lesions in the subglottis and distal 1 cm of the trachea (Figure, B). Glottic mobility was limited in both abduction and adduction with substantial airway obstruction. Computed tomographic findings revealed posterior tracheal wall thickening with the loss of the fat plane between the trachea and esophagus, and a moderate to severe obstruction within the distal left mainstem bronchus. Biopsy results are shown in Figure, C.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Aspergillosis,"1. **Aspergillosis** - Considering the patient's immunosuppression status from the kidney transplant, Aspergillus infection is a differential to consider given the respiratory symptoms and potential airway obstruction.

2. **Laryngeal Papillomatosis** - This could account for the hoarseness and involvement of the glottis and supraglottis, particularly in the presence of lesions.

3. **Bronchogenic Carcinoma** - The patient has a smoking history, which puts him at risk for lung cancer, possibly presenting with airway obstruction and respiratory symptoms.

4. **Invasive Fungal Tracheobronchitis** - Another opportunistic infection, especially considering the pseudomembranous changes and airway involvement.

5. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) with Laryngopharyngeal Reflux** - This could explain the chronic respiratory symptoms and hoarseness due to acid irritation.

6. **Post-transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder (PTLD)** - A possibility in a transplant patient presenting with respiratory symptoms and lesion formation.

7. **Tracheobronchial Amyloidosis** - Rare, but could explain the pseudomembranous changes and airway obstruction.

8. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)** - Can cause upper airway and respiratory involvement and systemic symptoms.

9. **Vocal Cord Paralysis** - The limited glottic mobility could suggest a neuromuscular component to the symptoms.

10. **Sarcoidosis** - Although not the most common presentation, could potentially cause airway involvement and lesions.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis After Full Information and Tests:

1. **Invasive Fungal Tracheobronchitis** - Strong correlation with pseudomembranous changes, transplant history, and airway obstruction.
   
2. **Aspergillosis** - High on the list due to immunocompromised status and respiratory involvement.
   
3. **Bronchogenic Carcinoma** - Significant given the patient's smoking history and presentation.

4. **Post-transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder (PTLD)** - Potential consideration after transplantation with airway symptoms.

5. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)** - Possible due to systemic airway involvement.

6. **Tracheobronchial Amyloidosis** - Account for pseudomembranous changes, albeit rare.

7. **Laryngeal Papillomatosis** - Least likely given overall presentation, but fits glottis involvement.

8. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) with Laryngopharyngeal Reflux** - Potentially contributing but not primary.

9. **Vocal Cord Paralysis** - Could explain glottic mobility issues but less comprehensive for symptoms.

10. **Sarcoidosis** - Low suspicion given atypical presentation in this case.","['Otolaryngology', 'Transplantation', 'Laryngology', 'Nephrology', 'Renal Replacement']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,60.0,F

### INPUT:
A 59-year-old Hispanic man presented with a 6-month history of intermittent pain in the right posterior mandibular gingiva. His local dentist had prescribed an antibiotic and performed a tooth extraction in the area 6 months prior with no improvement in symptoms. Ultimately, his pain became persistent and radiated to the right lower lip. He had a history of stage IV endometrial serous adenocarcinoma (ESA) 4 years prior that was treated with total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, and peritoneal lavage. He had developed a recurrence for which he had just completed 3 cycles of treatment with carboplatin. He also had a history of anxiety, hypertension, and pterygium, and he was taking gabapentin, lorazepam, prochlorperazine, metoprolol succinate, bromfenac and ketorolac ophthalmic solution, and aprepitant. Intraoral examination revealed a 1.5 × 1.0-cm firm, erythematous gingival mass in the area of missing right mandibular second bicuspid and first molar with buccal and lingual expansion (Figure 1A). The right mandibular first bicuspid was grade 3 mobile. A periapical radiograph was obtained, and results showed a diffuse, poorly demarcated radiolucency measuring approximately 1.2 × 0.8 cm (Figure 1B). Findings from an incisional biopsy of the mass showed an infiltrative tumor (Figure 1C). Tumor cells were positive for CK7, PAX8, and WT-1, and negative for CK20 and TTF-1 (Figure 1C, inset).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Oral metastasis,"1. **Metastatic Endometrial Serous Adenocarcinoma**  
   Given the patient's history of endometrial serous adenocarcinoma and the tumor cell markers (positive for CK7, PAX8, WT-1), metastasis is a consideration.

2. **Primary Gingival Squamous Cell Carcinoma**  
   Gingival SCC could present as an infiltrative tumor in the gingiva, although the immunohistochemistry profile does not support this.

3. **Osteosarcoma of the Jaw**  
   A possibility if considering primary bone tumors, given the mass expansion and radiolucency.

4. **Primary Oral Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma**  
   A potential differential given the location and invasion into the oral tissues.

5. **Ameloblastic Carcinoma**  
   Known for aggressive behavior and jawbone involvement, but less likely with current immunohistochemistry results.

6. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis**  
   Can involve the jaw and present with oral lesions, although rare with the given presentation.

7. **Osteomyelitis of the Jaw**  
   Chronic inflammation could mimic tumor expansion, but biopsy results do not support infection without osteoblastic activity.

8. **Lymphoma Involving the Gingiva**  
   Could be present in the oral cavity but less likely with the current tumor markers.

9. **Eosinophilic Granuloma**  
   Involves bone and can present with pain and swelling, though usually seen in younger patients.

10. **Metastatic Lung Adenocarcinoma**  
   Considering systemic spread, however, TTF-1 negativity makes lung origin less likely.

### Final Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Metastatic Endometrial Serous Adenocarcinoma**  
   Due to the patient's history, tumor histopathology, and immunohistochemistry profile.

2. **Osteosarcoma of the Jaw**  
   For its expansion characteristic in the jaws and differential imaging.

3. **Primary Gingival Squamous Cell Carcinoma**  
   Based on general prevalence in oral cancers, despite IHC results.

4. **Primary Oral Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma**  
   Due to potential aggressive behavior in oral tissues.

5. **Ameloblastic Carcinoma**  
   Due to typical jaw invasion and growing behavior of ameloblastoma variants.

6. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis**  
   Due to the possibility of bone involvement causing the radiolucency.

7. **Lymphoma Involving the Gingiva**  
   Considering its potential to present in the oral cavity but IHC results less supportive.

8. **Osteomyelitis of the Jaw**  
   Less possible given the lack of consideration for infection upon biopsy.

9. **Eosinophilic Granuloma**  
   Considering the potential but rare in this demographic.

10. **Metastatic Lung Adenocarcinoma**  
   For a systemic spread alternative, though improbable with the given IHC profile.","['Head and Neck Cancer', 'Otolaryngology', 'Dental Medicine']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,59.0,F

### INPUT:
A man in his 30s presented with a 1-year medical history of a painless, slowly enlarging, midline neck mass without associated dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss, or history of infection. The mass was soft, mobile, and compressible in midline level IA, measuring 7 cm and posterior-superiorly displacing the tongue. The mass was visible as a clear blue lesion in the floor of the mouth and was nontender. Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the neck with IV contrast was performed (Figure). The patient was taken to the operating room for a successful combined intraoral and transcervical approach to excision.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Epidermoid cyst,"1. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst**
   - Consideration given the midline location and presentation of a slowly enlarging, painless neck mass.

2. **Dermoid Cyst**
   - Another potential diagnosis due to the cystic nature and midline neck mass presentation.

3. **Epidermoid Cyst**
   - Possibility considered because of the compressible and nontender characteristics of the mass.

4. **Ranula**
   - Given the clear blue lesion visible in the floor of the mouth, consistent with a mucocele of the sublingual gland.

5. **Lymphangioma (Cystic Hygroma)**
   - Considered due to the compressibility and soft nature of the mass.

6. **Plunging Ranula**
   - The lesion appearing both in the neck and floor of the mouth, indicative of a deeper extension of a mucocele.

7. **Lipoma**
   - Considered based on the soft, mobile characteristics but typically not blue in appearance.

8. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**
   - Typically lateral, but can present near the hyoid and midline sometimes, though less likely in this context.

9. **Ectopic Thyroid Tissue**
   - Enlargement of ectopic tissue could present similarly, albeit thyroglossal duct cysts are more common.

10. **Sialocele**
    - Collection of saliva due to gland obstruction or damage could present in a similar neck location but less likely midline.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:

1. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst**: Most common midline neck mass. Presentation and location are classic.
2. **Ranula**: The visibility of a clear blue lesion in the floor of the mouth makes this a strong contender.
3. **Plunging Ranula**: Extension of ranula into neck aligns with the described lesion.
4. **Dermoid Cyst**: Given the soft, compressible nature and typical midline presentation.
5. **Lymphangioma (Cystic Hygroma)**: Matches the soft, compressible mass characteristics.
6. **Epidermoid Cyst**: Less likely than a dermoid but still possible given the description.
7. **Ectopic Thyroid Tissue**: Anatomically possible but with low incidence.
8. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**: Typically lateral but could cross midline.

A preschool girl presented with asymptomatic, reddish, raised lesions over her right ear, noticed 3 months earlier, associated with multiple painless swellings on the ipsilateral side of the neck for the past 3 weeks. On examination, there were multiple, erythematous papules coalescing to form a plaque with areas of scarring over the posterior aspect of right ear, along with firm, nontender posterior cervical lymphadenopathy (Figure, A). There was no history of trauma or intervention prior to the onset of lesions. Her medical history was unremarkable, as were the rest of the mucocutaneous and systemic examination findings. A skin biopsy from the plaque was submitted for histopathological examination (Figure, C and D).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Lupus vulgaris,"1. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis** - Considered due to the presence of reddish, raised lesions and lymphadenopathy, common in pediatric cases.

2. **Cat Scratch Disease** - Given the symptoms of cervical lymphadenopathy and skin lesions, and commonality in children.

3. **Tuberculosis Lymphadenitis** - Non-tender lymphadenopathy could suggest a mycobacterial infection, common cause of cervical lymphadenopathy.

4. **Lymphangioma** - Possible due to the characteristic swelling and location.

5. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans** - Considered for the raised, erythematous skin lesion.

6. **Kimura's Disease** - Chronic, inflammatory disorder common in children, presenting with lymphadenopathy and skin lesions.

7. **Kikuchi-Fujimoto Disease** - Presents with lymphadenopathy, which can be painless and persistent.

8. **Atypical Mycobacterial Infection (Non-tuberculous)** - Considered due to the presence of cervical lymphadenopathy and skin involvement.

3. **Atypical Mycobacterial Infection (Non-tuberculous)** - Compatible with the skin lesions and lymphadenopathy.
4. **Tuberculosis Lymphadenitis** - With relevant signs, needs microbiological and histological correlation.
5. **Kimura's Disease** - Fits presentation but would need eosinophilic infiltrate confirmation.
6. **Kikuchi-Fujimoto Disease** - Further characterized by necrotizing lymphadenitis, requires lymph node histology.
7. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans** - Less likely due to age but can mimic skin lesions.
8. **Sarcoidosis** - Uncommon, yet could account for symptomatology with systemic correlation.
9. **Lymphangioma** - Unlikely without cystic features in pathology.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 50s presented with an abdominal skin eruption of 2 days’ duration. Her medical history included hepatitis C, cirrhosis, and an orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) 3 years prior that was subsequently treated with tacrolimus, 5 mg, and mycophenolate, 750 mg, twice daily. Approximately 2½ years after the transplant, the patient developed gastric outlet obstruction secondary to an infiltrative gastric wall mass. The gastric wall mass was found to be associated with plasmablastic posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (pPTLD). She was subsequently instructed to stop use of mycophenolate and decrease use of tacrolimus to 0.25 mg daily, then treated with 1 cycle of CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone) and lenalidomide, resulting in symptomatic and radiologic improvement. Five weeks after treatment with CHOP chemotherapy, the patient presented with an acute-onset abdominal skin eruption without fever or pain. A computed tomographic scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed possible abdominal wall cellulitis, so treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin was empirically started. Physical examination revealed confluent indurated violaceous papules and plaques coalescing into an annular pattern encircling the healed OLT incisional scar with central sparing (Figure 1A). A 4-mm punch biopsy specimen was obtained for histopathological evaluation (Figure 1B and C) and bacterial and fungal cultures.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder,"1. **Cellulitis**: Initial CT scan findings suggested abdominal wall cellulitis, which aligns with the treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

2. **Cutaneous Lymphoproliferative Disorder**: Given her history of plasmablastic pPTLD, a cutaneous manifestation of lymphoproliferative disorder is possible.

3. **Drug Reaction (e.g., Tacrolimus or Lenalidomide)**: Considering immunosuppressive and chemotherapeutic history, drug-induced cutaneous eruption should be evaluated.

4. **Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD)**: Though less likely in solid organ transplant compared to hematopoietic stem cell transplant, chronic GVHD-like skin involvement can be considered.

5. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum**: An autoimmune skin condition that can present as rapidly developing painful ulcerative skin lesions, often seen post-surgery in immune-compromised individuals.

6. **Dermatophyte Infection**: Fungal cultures were taken, suggesting a consideration of superficial fungal infections, though appearance is atypical.

7. **Fixed Drug Eruption**: The acute onset post a specific medication could point towards a fixed drug reaction, where a lesion reappears at the same site upon re-exposure to the drug.

8. **Kaposi Sarcoma**: Consideration due to immunosuppression post-transplant, especially given the violaceous hue of the lesions.

9. **Herpes Zoster**: Would consider if vesicular eruption and pain were present, common in immune-compromised individuals.

10. **Sweet's Syndrome (Acute Febrile Neutrophilic Dermatosis)**: Characterized by fever and painful skin lesions, though fever is absent here.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
After considering all available patient information, including age, immunosuppression status, and clinical presentation:

1. **Cutaneous Lymphoproliferative Disorder**: Increased likelihood due to patient's history of lymphoproliferative disorder and current presentation.
2. **Drug Reaction (e.g., Tacrolimus or Lenalidomide)**: High possibility due to recent medication changes and known side effects.
3. **Cellulitis**: Still reasonably high on the list due to initial presentation and CT findings.
4. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum**: Possible given post-operative immune status.
5. **Kaposi Sarcoma**: Risk increases with immunosuppression and lesion characteristics.
6. **Sweet's Syndrome**: Less likely but possible in the appropriate clinical scenario.
7. **GVHD**: Low probability due to type of transplant.
8. **Dermatophyte Infection**: Further down the list due to appearance and sudden onset.
9. **Fixed Drug Eruption**: Unlikely as specific drug link less apparent.
10. **Herpes Zoster**: Unlikely due to atypical presentation (absence of vesicular lesions and pain).","['Dermatology', 'Hepatobiliary Disease', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology', 'Surgery', 'Transplantation']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,50.0,M

### INPUT:
A 46-year-old African swimmer presented with a 1-month history of progressive left hearing loss and vertigo. She also reported asthenia, sleep disorders, and urinary frequency. The urinary frequency has been treated for 2 years with many drugs (tamsulosin, desmopressin, and solifenacin) without improvement. The patient had spent her childhood in eastern Africa, where she swam in Lake Tanganyika. Her history did not reveal trauma, infection, or any other associated conditions at the onset of the complaints. The ear, nose, and throat examination revealed a right horizontal nystagmus and a poorly delineated hypoesthesia of the left pinna. She could not walk properly owing to her vertigo. The rest of the clinical examination findings were unremarkable. Additional examinations (ie, pure-tone audiometry, video nystagmography, tympanometry) revealed left profound hearing loss with an air-bone gap of 40 dB and central vertigo. Otoacoustic emissions were absent on the left side. There was no left acoustic reflex. Auditory brainstem responses showed asymmetric interpeak latencies of waves I through V and III through V, suggesting slower conduction on the left side. Computed tomography and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 24 × 20-mm hemorrhagic lesion in the left middle cerebellar peduncle associated with a thickening of the cochleovestibular nerve (Figure). The patient was referred to urology, where a 13 × 8-mm mass was discovered in the lateral wall of the prostate gland. Biopsies of prostate and brain lesions, blood tests, and urinalysis were performed.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Schistosomiasis,"1. **Schistosomiasis** - Given the patient's swimming history in Lake Tanganyika and the chronicity of urinary frequency.
2. **Acoustic Neuroma (Vestibular Schwannoma)** - Due to the unilateral hearing loss, vertigo, and thickening of the cochleovestibular nerve.
3. **Metastatic Prostate Cancer** - Considering the prostate mass and potential brain involvement.
4. **Multiple Sclerosis** - As a cause of central vertigo and neurological symptoms including nystagmus.
5. **Neurosyphilis** - Although less common, it could explain neurological symptoms and auditory findings.
6. **Cerebral Vascular Malformation** - Could present with hemorrhagic brain lesions and neurological deficits.
7. **Meniere’s Disease** - Fits the profile of hearing loss and vertigo, though lacks some characteristic symptoms.
8. **Lymphoma** - Given diffuse symptoms and presence of mass lesions.
9. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis** - Can cause granulomatous lesions in the brain and other systemic symptoms.
10. **Tuberculosis of the Central Nervous System** - Possible given the brain lesions, though less common.

### Reranking:
1. **Acoustic Neuroma (Vestibular Schwannoma)** - Most consistent with auditory and imaging findings.
2. **Metastatic Prostate Cancer** - Aligns with prostate mass and potential distant metastasis to brain.
3. **Schistosomiasis** - Based on travel history and urinary symptoms.
4. **Lymphoma** - Due to multi-system involvement and mass lesions.
5. **Multiple Sclerosis** - Unlikely due to absence of lesions typical for MS on MRI.
6. **Neurosyphilis** - Testing negative for syphilis would lower its rank.
7. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis** - MRI findings less typical but possible.
8. **Cerebral Vascular Malformation** - Less likely given lack of vascular anomalies on imaging.
9. **Meniere’s Disease** - Lower due to lack of recurring episodes of vertigo and fullness in ear.
10. **Tuberculosis of the Central Nervous System** - Unlikely without pulmonary involvement or systemic signs, and no evidence on MRI.","['Infectious Diseases', 'Otolaryngology', 'Audiology and Hearing', 'Vestibular Disorders', 'Otology']",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,46.0,M

### INPUT:
A white woman in her 70s presented with a gradually enlarging right supraorbital mass that had been neglected for 4 years. Her comorbidities included congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and a 50-pack-year history of tobacco abuse. Physical examination revealed a firm, nonmobile, nontender, bulging mass situated over the right frontal sinus, which expanded to the upper right eyelid. The mass covered the globe completely, resulting in total vision obstruction (Figure, A). However, the patient’s vision remained intact when the mass was elevated off the eye with great effort. Her right pupil was round and reactive to light without afferent pupillary defect. No palpable lymphadenopathy was noted. A non–contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a large, right supraorbital mass with bony destruction of the anterior table of the right frontal sinus (Figure, B). It extended into the superior aspect of the orbit, displacing the right globe inferiorly. Air was seen within the mass (Figure, C). A fine-needle aspiration biopsy yielded inconclusive results. After medical clearance, the patient was taken to the operating room for a wedge excisional biopsy with decompression of the right supraorbital mass under monitored anesthesia care. Histopathological investigation revealed large nests of neoplastic epithelioid cells surrounded by fibrotic tissue and necroinflammatory debris. The neoplastic cells contained round nuclei with single prominent nucleoli and abundant clear to vacuolated cytoplasm (Figure, D).

### INPUT:
A man in his 30s was referred for evaluation of bilateral papilledema and progressive visual loss in the right eye, which deteriorated to blindness in 3 months. He denied any other neurologic symptoms, such as headache, nausea, vomiting, seizures, and paresis. He had a 4-year history of Behçet disease (BD), and his condition had been stabilized with thalidomide. His optic neuropathy of BD had been treated with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone for 4 days followed by oral prednisone for a month without improvement. His best-corrected visual acuity was no light perception OD and 20/20 OS. Intraocular pressure was 21 mm Hg OD and 19 mm Hg OS. Fundus examination revealed papilledema in both eyes (Figure 1A). No obvious sign of optic disc ischemia or active uveitis was observed by fundus fluorescein angiography bilaterally. Humphrey visual fields showed complete visual field loss in the right eye and peripheral visual field defects in the left eye. His anterior segment was normal in both eyes except for relative afferent pupillary defect in the right eye. Cranial nerve examination was otherwise unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed no remarkable abnormalities except for partially empty sella (Figure 1B). He had normal blood pressure levels. Results of laboratory testing regarding systemic infection were negative, and his serum D-dimer level was normal.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cerebral venous thrombosis,"1. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension** - Given the information about bilateral papilledema, the patient may have increased intracranial pressure without a clear cause.

2. **Optic Neuritis** - Although not consistent with typical presentation involving pain, the visual loss and history of autoimmune conditions warrant consideration of inflammation of the optic nerve.

3. **Central Retinal Artery Occlusion** - While the visual acuity is normal in one eye, sudden vision loss in one eye could be associated with an acute vascular event.

4. **Sarcoidosis** - This systemic granulomatous disease affects the eyes and can cause optic neuropathy, needing consideration given immune system involvement.

5. **Multiple Sclerosis** - Though the presentation is atypical due to the absence of other neurologic symptoms, MS should be considered due to optic issues.

6. **Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy** - A genetic condition typically affecting young adult males with acute or subacute vision loss must be included.

7. **Tumor (Optic Nerve Glioma or Meningioma)** - A mass effect, although not visualized on imaging, still should be ruled out as a cause of papilledema and visual symptoms.

8. **Tuberculosis (Ocular)** - Given the inflammatory history, an extrapulmonary TB manifestation should be considered despite negative infectious tests.

9. **Anti-Phospholipid Syndrome** - Often associated with thrombosis, this could lead to ischemic optic neuropathy and papilledema, considering autoimmune history.

10. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (GPA)** - Another vasculitis with potential ocular complications fits into the differential given chronic inflammation.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 30s presented with painless swelling of the left upper limb and nodules on the left side of the chest and abdomen. The lesions had started a month previously as red nodules on the left axilla, ipsilateral chest, and back. Twenty days later, she developed edema in the left upper limb. While being evaluated for the cutaneous lesions, the patient was diagnosed with AIDS and began antiretroviral therapy. On examination, 6 erythematous, firm, subcutaneous nodules were present on the left side of the chest, abdomen, and left upper limb, varying in size from 2 × 2 cm to 4 × 4 cm (Figure, A). There was diffuse erythema and edema on the left upper limb, leading to difficulty in limb movement (Figure, A). Multiple dilated superficial vessels were present on the posterior aspect of the left arm and ipsilateral chest wall. Left axillary lymph nodes were grossly enlarged, firm, nontender, and nonmatted, with the largest lymph node measuring 6 × 4 cm. The patient’s CD4 cell count was 141/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001), and her HIV load was 504 473 copies/mL.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis
1. **Kaposi's Sarcoma**: Given the patient's HIV status with a significantly low CD4 count, the presentation of erythematous, firm nodules combined with the dilated superficial vessels, Kaposi's sarcoma is a highly probable diagnosis.
2. **Bacillary Angiomatosis**: Associated with HIV, this condition can present with vascular lesions similar to Kaposi's sarcoma. The appearance of nodules and potential infection aspects make it plausible.
3. **Lymphoma**: HIV increases the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which could cause lymphadenopathy and possibly subcutaneous nodules.
4. **Cryptococcosis**: Another opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients that might present with skin lesions and lymphadenopathy.
5. **Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection**: Often causes lymphadenopathy in HIV patients, although skin nodules would be less characteristic.
6. **Histoplasmosis**: This can cause skin lesions and systemic symptoms in immunocompromised individuals.
7. **Cutaneous Tuberculosis**: Skin involvement and lymphadenopathy might account for some of the patient’s symptoms.
8. **Cat Scratch Disease (CSD)**: Usually presents with lymphadenopathy and skin lesions, but typically in immunocompetent hosts.
9. **Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)**: Despite being less likely given age and CD4 count, could cause lymphadenopathy.
10. **Pyogenic Granuloma**: Less likely in this context as skin lesions would tend to be more isolated and smaller.","['Oncology', 'Dermatology', 'Hematology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Lymphomas']",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,30.0,M

Extraocular motility and intraocular pressures were normal. Results of an anterior examination was unremarkable. Dilated funduscopic examination of the left eye revealed a pink optic nerve with sharp margins, diffuse intraretinal hemorrhages and Roth spots extending from the posterior pole to the far periphery, and preretinal hemorrhage overlying the central macula (Figure, A). Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography through the preretinal macular hemorrhage demonstrated layered blood in the sub–internal limiting membrane space (Figure, B).

A 31-year-old gravida 1, para 1 man with a history of Wolff-Parkinson-White disease and recently diagnosed stage II Hodgkin lymphoma presented with a pruritic rash. He was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma at 35 weeks’ gestation, and 1 week later he underwent cesarean delivery. At 3 weeks’ postpartum, he began chemotherapy (cycle 1, day 1) with adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD). On day 15 of cycle 1, he presented with linear, hyperpigmented streaks and welts on his arms, back, and legs. Intense, diffuse pruritus had developed within 24 hours of the patient’s first day of treatment, and his symptoms were poorly responsive to antihistamines and topical steroids. Pruritus was followed by the appearance of dark scratch marks as demonstrated in the Figure. Laboratory test results revealed a white blood cell count of 1.6 ×103 cells/mm3, with an absolute neutrophil count of 500 cells/mm3 and a total bilirubin of 0.3 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 17.104), which was unchanged from the baseline total bilirubin.

2. Chemotherapy-induced Cutaneous Toxicity - The pattern of the rash and relation to chemotherapy suggests a direct toxic effect of the drugs.
3. Hodgkin Lymphoma-related Paraneoplastic Pemphigus - As a recent cancer diagnosis, this could be a paraneoplastic phenomenon.
4. Systemic Mastocytosis - Persistent pruritus and rash, though less likely because of recent chemotherapy initiation.
5. Dermatitis Herpetiformis - Less likely given the lack of gastrointestinal symptoms and specific rash distribution.
6. Infections (e.g., Herpes Simplex or Zoster) - Complicated by low white cell count and could present atypically under chemotherapy.
7. Lichen Planus - Chronic pruritic condition but less likely without typical lesional appearance.
8. Psoriasis - Can present with intense pruritus, but distribution and lesion type are not classic.

### INPUT:
A white woman in her 20s presented with numerous pink and brown papules and plaques, some with ulceration, on the head and along the midline of the neck and spine (Figure). Medical history included medulloblastoma treated with irradiation of the brain and spine at age 2 years. She also received radiation therapy for a meningioma of the posterior fossa in adulthood. She was also treated for several seemingly similar lesions on the face and scalp and had a family history of similar cutaneous lesions reported in 2 brothers and 1 niece.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Basal cell carcinoma,"To perform a differential diagnosis, we will analyze the patient's symptoms, medical history, and family history step by step:

1. **Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome (Gorlin Syndrome)**: The history of radiation exposure and multiple basal cell carcinomas as well as a family history of cutaneous lesions suggests Gorlin syndrome, which is associated with the development of basal cell carcinomas.

2. **Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome (NBCCS)**: Given the young age of onset and family history, NBCCS, a genetic condition leading to predispositions for developing basal cell carcinomas and other abnormalities, is considered.

3. **Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 (MEN1)**: The presence of tumors and a relevant family history could indicate MEN1, although it typically involves endocrine tumors and is less likely given the current presentation.

4. **Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1)**: This hereditary disorder may present with similar skin lesions; however, the specific characteristics and family history do not entirely align.

5. **Familial Atypical Multiple Mole Melanoma Syndrome (FAMMM Syndrome)**: Characterized by numerous atypical moles and an increased risk of melanoma; less likely here but considered due to family history.

6. **Li-Fraumeni Syndrome**: Considered due to a history of multiple primary tumors; however, it is typically associated with a broader range of tumors beyond the current presentation.

7. **Carney Complex**: Presents with spotty skin pigmentation and myxomas; the particular constellation of symptoms makes this less likely but considered due to relevant family history.

8. **Tuberous Sclerosis Complex**: Known for causing benign tumors and skin lesions, but typically with other associated neurological symptoms not detailed here.

9. **Xeroderma Pigmentosum**: Known for heightened sensitivity to UV rays leading to skin cancers; less likely due to the familial pattern observed.

10. **PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome (Cowden Syndrome)**: Often features multiple benign and malignant tumors; not typical for the precise nature of skin lesions seen.

1. **Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome (Gorlin Syndrome)**
2. **Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome (NBCCS)**
3. **Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 (MEN1)**

### INPUT:
A woman in her 20s presented with rapidly growing, severely painful oral lesions on the left hard palate of 2 months’ duration. Her medical history was significant for Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia refractory to multiple treatments, including chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, with transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) status posttreatment. At the time of evaluation, she had been hospitalized for 5 months with severe protein-calorie malnutrition, pancytopenia, and recurrent neutropenic fevers. The patient was febrile (38.3°C), with a white blood cell count of 0.5/μL (absolute neutrophil count 0.00; to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001), hemoglobin levels of 7.6g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0), hematocrit 21%, and platelet count 9/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 1.0). She was not receiving active cancer treatment. She appeared cachectic and pale. Intraoral examination revealed poor oral hygiene. The left hard palate exhibited a large swelling with a 5×3-cm indurated area of ulceration, central necrosis, and desquamation (Figure, A). The patient was treated palliatively with dexamethasone solution and nystatin rinse. A biopsy was not recommended owing to medical instability. However, the patient retained a sloughed fragment of the affected tissue, which was submitted for histologic evaluation. A maxillofacial computed tomography (CT) scan completed the etiological investigation.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Mucormycosis,"1. **Invasive Aspergillosis** - Given the patient's immunocompromised state and symptoms, the first consideration should be an aggressive fungal infection like invasive aspergillosis.

2. **Mucormycosis (Zygomycosis)** - Another possibility for an aggressive fungal infection given the immunocompromised state and the necrotic lesion in the oral cavity.

3. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection** - In the context of immunosuppression, HSV can cause severe ulcerative lesions in oral mucosa.

4. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection** - CMV can lead to ulcerations in immunocompromised individuals, including oral mucosal involvement.

5. **Bacterial Infection (Noma/CANCRUM ORIS)** - Severe malnutrition and immunocompromise can lead to a rapidly progressive gangrenous disease typically seen in impoverished settings.

6. **Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)** - Although less likely given the rapid growth, any ulcerative lesion with induration might warrant consideration for SCC, especially as a differential to rule out.

7. **Necrotizing Sialometaplasia** - While uncommon, infarction of minor salivary glands leading to necrotic ulcerative lesions could be considered albeit less likely given the patient's presentation.

8. **Acute Necrotizing Ulcerative Gingivitis (ANUG)** - Severe malnutrition and poor oral hygiene can lead to this condition, but the extensive lesion makes this less probable.

9. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis** - This rare condition can present with bone lesions and ulcerations in the oral cavity, requiring consideration given the atypical presentation.

10. **Medication-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (MRONJ)** - Though less likely given current medication history, considering patient's underlying conditions and use of corticosteroids, osteonecrosis is a rare differential.

### INPUT:
A 33-year-old white woman presented with a 5-month history of a progressively necrotic plaque on the nose and scattered nodules on the extremities. The plaque first appeared as a small inflammatory papule on the left nostril. Shortly thereafter, the patient was hospitalized at an outside facility for multifocal pneumonia. She was also treated for a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection of her nose. Despite antibiotic therapy, the papule continued to grow and ulcerate and eventually became necrotic (Figure, A). One month before presentation at our facility, the patient began developing erythematous papules on her arms and legs. The papules enlarged and ulcerated. Some of them healed spontaneously with poxlike scars. She had no recent history of travel. At admission, the patient was tachycardic and febrile to a temperature of 38.5°C. Routine laboratory testing revealed normocytic anemia (hemoglobin, 7.7 g/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10]). Shave biopsies of necrotic nodules on the left arm and left cheek (Figure, B-D) and, later, an excisional biopsy of a cervical lymph node were performed. Head computed tomography demonstrated a soft-tissue mass that encased the nasal bone and extended into the right maxillary sinus and left nasal cavity. Chest computed tomography showed bilateral pulmonary nodules. Physical examination revealed a necrotic plaque with surrounding erythema on the distal nose (Figure, A). A 1 × 1-cm crateriform papule with central necrosis was present on the left malar cheek. Multiple nodules with central, dry necrosis and areas of poxlike scarring were scattered across the extremities. Slight contractures of her fingers were also noted.

2. **ANCA-associated vasculitis** - Given systemic necrotic lesions and respiratory involvement, ANCA-positive vasculitides are a strong consideration.

3. **Langerhans cell histiocytosis** - Possible given the systemic nodules and necrosis with the presence of a soft tissue mass.

4. **Pyoderma gangrenosum** - The progression of skin ulcers and systemically necrotic skin conditions might fit, although less likely without more specific predisposing factors.

5. **Cutaneous leishmaniasis** - Unlikely without travel, but necrotic skin lesions present similarly.

6. **Sarcoidosis** - Pulmonary nodules fit, but less consistent with necrosis without more granulomatous evidence.

7. **Systemic lupus erythematosus** - Could present with systemic necrotic rash and systemic involvement though more multi-organ involvement or serological markers are usually present.

8. **Churg-Strauss syndrome (Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis)** - Less matching without significant eosinophilia or asthma history.

9. **Infective endocarditis with embolic phenomena** - Embolic phenomena could cause skin lesions and tachycardia, but no evidence of heart involvement was provided.

A woman in her mid-50s presented with painless blurry vision in the left eye. According to the patient’s report, she had experienced this vision abnormality in the left eye for 1 week. At presentation, visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/400 OS. Results of a dilated fundus examination were normal in the right eye and notable for a macular serous retinal detachment in the left eye (Figure 1A). Findings on optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed a dome-shaped collection of subretinal fluid in the macula (not shown). Late-phase fluorescein angiography revealed multifocal pinpoint areas of hyperfluorescence with mild leakage within the area of detachment (Figure 1B).

A 55-year-old woman with no significant medical history presented with several weeks of malaise and a 6.8-kg weight loss associated with poor appetite. She reported no fevers, night sweats, abdominal pain, emesis, and diarrhea. Physical examination revealed a thin habitus; no palmar erythema, spider angiomas, or gynecomastia were observed. Laboratory tests showed normal complete blood cell count and chemistry panel findings. Hepatic panel showed an elevated alkaline phosphatase level (209 U/L; upper limit of normal [ULN], 150 U/L [3.49 μkat/L; ULN, 2.5 μkat/L]), normal total bilirubin level (0.4 mg/dL [6.84 μmol/L]), elevated alanine aminotransferase level (41 U/L; ULN, 35 U/L [0.68 μkat/L; ULN, 0.58 μkat/L]), and normal aspartate aminotransferase level (27 U/L [0.45 μkat/L]). A single-phase computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed multiple hypoattenuating masses with rim enhancement throughout the liver, intussusception of the small bowel, and normal liver contour with no signs of portal hypertension (Figure 1, left). α-Fetoprotein (AFP) level was elevated (1252 ng/mL; ULN, 9 ng/mL); levels of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (<2 U/mL) and carcinoembryonic antigen (2.8 ng/mL) were normal. A triple-phase CT scan was obtained to further evaluate the small bowel, which revealed no small bowel abnormalities but instead demonstrated a 3.3 × 2.8-cm heterogeneously enhancing pancreatic tail mass not seen on the previous single-phase CT (Figure 1, right).

### INPUT:
A man in his 70s with a history of pulmonary embolism presented to the emergency department with acute right eye vision loss. He described a 2-week medical history of diplopia and blurry vision as well as 4 months of nasal congestion and progressive headaches despite multiple antibiotic courses. He denied a medical history of sinonasal issues, immunodeficiency, autoimmune disease, malignant disease, or diabetes. On examination, he was afebrile with stable vital signs. Ophthalmologic evaluation revealed a right afferent pupillary defect and cranial sixth-nerve palsy. Computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging of the sinuses revealed abnormal soft tissue throughout his sinuses with destruction of the sinus walls and skull base as well as extension of abnormal appearing tissue into the right orbital apex and posterior nasal septum. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated a normal white blood cell count and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level. Nasal endoscopy showed bloody mucus and crusting around the right middle turbinate and sphenoethmoidal recess. The acute nature of his vision loss amid concern for a destructive sinonasal process warranted operative intervention. Abnormal soft tissue with associated destruction throughout his sinonasal cavities and right orbital apex was identified. Frozen sections revealed negative results for fungal elements and cellular dysplasia but demonstrated widespread inflammation with giant cells. A representative final pathology slide is shown in the Figure.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Granulomatosis with polyangiitis,"1. **Granulomatosis with polyangiitis** - Given the symptoms of necrotizing granulomatous inflammation, sinonasal destruction, and orbital involvement without sinonasal history or known immunodeficiency, this autoimmune vasculitis is a consideration.
   
2. **Sarcoidosis** - This involves granulomatous inflammation, which can present with ocular and sinonasal involvement, even though it's less likely to cause such rapid progression and destruction.

3. **Idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome** - While not typically associated with widespread tissue destruction, it can cause vision problems and involves inflammation.

4. **Lymphomatoid granulomatosis** - A rare EBV-associated angiodestructive disorder that presents with necrotizing granulomas and can mimic aggressive sinonasal disease.

5. **Churg-Strauss syndrome (Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis)** - Primarily involves eosinophilic-rich granulomatous inflammation, though less commonly affects the sinuses destructively in this manner.

6. **Sinonasal carcinoma** - Although unlikely given the lack of dysplastic or cancerous cells in pathology, primary sinonasal malignancies can cause destructive lesions with significant inflammation.

7. **Infectious granulomatosis** (e.g., Rhinoscleroma) - Unlikely given sterile cultures and the absence of micro-organisms, but it involves chronic granulomatous inflammation.

8. **Orbital cellulitis with abscess formation** - This can cause acute vision changes and inflammatory signs, but the afebrile state and sterile cultures make this less likely.

9. **Migraine secondary to sinus disease** - Although migraines aren't associated with tissue destruction, they can cause diplopia and vision disturbances.

10. **Pituitary apoplexy or invasive process affecting the cavernous sinus** - Less likely without endocrine symptoms, but it presents with similar acute ophthalmic findings and can be destructive.

### INPUT:
A 32-year-old Hispanic woman without significant medical history presented with nasal pain and swelling, progressive for 6 weeks. She had been hospitalized for this problem at an outside hospital and treated with antibiotics, without improvement. The swelling worsened and extended to her upper lip. She developed difficulty swallowing, headache, and nasal drainage. On presentation, she was afebrile without leukocytosis. Physical examination demonstrated diffuse swelling and tenderness of the nose with honey-colored crusting that extended to above her upper lip. Axial and sagittal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) (Figure, A and B) demonstrated marked soft tissue swelling and fullness with abnormal enhancement along the nasal cavity, including bilateral nasal ala, with areas of necrosis and emphysema. No significant bony erosion or associated calcification on bone windows was noted. After bedside debridement of the nasal soft tissue region, axial postcontrast T1-weighted fat-suppressed and sagittal T2-weighted fat-suppressed magnetic resonance imaging through the nasal cavity (Figure, C and D) demonstrated soft tissue fullness isointense to muscle on T1-weighted images, hyperintense on T2-weighted images, and with homogenous enhancement of the solid component on postcontrast T1-weighted images. No intracranial or intraorbital disease extension was noted.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Extranodal T-cell lymphoma,"1. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis)** - Considered due to sinonasal pathology with necrosis, although nasal cartilage erosion is not observed here.
   
2. **Nasal NK/T-cell Lymphoma** - This can present with nasal lesions, swelling, necrosis, and extension to soft tissues, often seen in patients of Asian or Hispanic descent.

3. **Rhinoscleroma** - A bacterial infection that can cause progressive nasal swelling and destruction, seen more in certain geographic areas.

4. **Chronic Invasive Fungal Sinusitis** - Though afebrile, typically affects immunocompetent individuals with chronic nasal symptoms and tissue necrosis but lacks leukocytosis.

5. **Lupus Pernio (Sarcoidosis)** - It may mimic infection and cause soft tissue involvement without boney erosion, with systemic involvement.

6. **Syphilis (Tertiary)** - Chronic progression with gummatous necrosis is possible contributing to tissue necrosis and swelling in nasal area.

7. **Leprosy (Hansen's disease)** - Chronic nasal and facial swelling associated with granulomatous lesions, more prevalent in certain demographic populations.

8. **Relapsing Polychondritis** - Can cause cartilaginous inflammation of the nasal area presenting as swelling but typically associated with redness beyond just crusting.

9. **Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD)** - A rare genetic condition that can lead to recurrent infections and granulomas, with nasal involvement possible.

10. **Nasal Septal Abscess** - Though less likely with afebrile status and absence of leukocytosis, remains a possibility for progressive nasal swelling and tissue involvement.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Nasal NK/T-cell Lymphoma** - Rises to top due to demographic correlation, progressive tissue necrosis without significant bony involvement, and geographic prevalence.
   
2. **Chronic Invasive Fungal Sinusitis** - Persistent progressive infection without systemic inflammation suggests potential fungal etiology, commonly seen in sinus series.

3. **Rhinoscleroma** - Consistent with progressive nasal and adjacent tissue involvement, prevalent in specific geographic/resident contexts.

4. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis)** - Considered less likely primarily due to the absence of systemic signs and typical cartilage/bone erosion component.

5. **Leprosy (Hansen's disease)** - Socio-demographic aspect considered but less likely based on lack of common other systemic symptoms.

6. **Lupus Pernio (Sarcoidosis)** - Supports nasal involvement but lacks corroboration from general systemic sarcoidosis manifestations.

7. **Syphilis (Tertiary)** - Chronicity and presentation fit but uncommon presentation and geographic/statistical correlation are less corroborative.

8. **Relapsing Polychondritis** - Limited to nasal area and cutaneous signs with typical relapsing inflammation suggests lower likelihood.

9. **Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD)** - Rare but potential for chronic unexplained infections leads to consideration especially with granulomas.

10. **Nasal Septal Abscess** - Without fever/leukocytosis, unlikely remains last in the differential as clinical features do not align sufficiently without prior indications.","['Ophthalmology', 'Rhinology and Sinus Disease', 'Clinical Challenge', 'Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,32.0,M

A boy presented with a left posterior triangle neck mass that had progressed for 3 years following a motor vehicle accident. On physical examination, the mass was firm, mobile, tender to palpation, and caused restricted range of motion. Ultrasound imaging of the soft tissue of the neck was obtained, which demonstrated a neck mass with dense acoustic shadowing (Figure 1A). Further evaluation with contrasted computed tomography (CT) imaging showed a 3.3×2.9×2.6-cm ossified lesion in the left posterior-lateral cervical soft tissue near the atlanto-axial junction. The lesion was well circumscribed and separate from the underlying bone (Figure 1B). The patient underwent excision of the mass without complication. The gross pathology specimen showed a firm, irregular, encapsulated mass.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Myositis ossificans,"Given the information provided, let's create a 10-step differential diagnosis list and subsequent reranking based on available data:

**Step 1:** **Myositis Ossificans Traumatica**
- A history of trauma and the ossified nature of the lesion suggest a post-traumatic ossification process.

**Step 2:** **Osteochondroma**
- Although uncommon in soft tissue, the presence of a bony projection could suggest this benign bone tumor.

**Step 3:** **Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva**
- This rare genetic disorder could cause ossification in unusual locations, but it's less likely due to the isolated occurrence in this case.

**Step 4:** **Soft Tissue Sarcoma**
- Soft tissue masses can occasionally present after trauma due to an exaggerated healing response.

**Step 5:** **Non-ossifying Fibroma**
- Typically occurring in bone, they can present with similar symptoms if located superficially.

**Step 6:** **Heterotopic Ossification**
- This condition is the formation of bone in abnormal anatomical locations, particularly following trauma.

**Step 7:** **Lipoma with Ossification** 
- A usually benign fatty tumor that can occasionally ossify.

**Step 8:** **Calcified Hematoma**
- Post-traumatic bleeding can lead to calcification over time.

**Step 9:** **Ewing Sarcoma**
- A rare possibility given the age, but osteogenic potential exists.

**Step 10:** **Chondroma**
- A benign cartilage-forming tumor, which could potentially ossify in soft tissues.

**Reranking:**

1. **Myositis Ossificans Traumatica** - Given the traumatic history and imaging results, this is the most consistent differential.
2. **Heterotopic Ossification** - Aligns well with the history of trauma and imaging characteristics.
3. **Calcified Hematoma** - Trauma-related and common post-trauma ossification.
4. **Osteochondroma** - Less common in soft tissue but could be considered due to ossification.
5. **Lipoma with Ossification** - Rare but plausible given the mass description.
6. **Soft Tissue Sarcoma** - Considered due to possibility of misidentifying sarcoma as a post-traumatic lesion.
7. **Non-ossifying Fibroma** - Less common due to its usual bone location.
8. **Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva** - Isolated ossification makes it unlikely.
9. **Ewing Sarcoma** - Rare and less likely due to solitary site and ossification.
10. **Chondroma** - Least likely given the predominance of bony characteristics.

### INPUT:
A 1-week-old, full-term female newborn presented with increasingly labored breathing, xerostomia, and poor bowel movements. She had been born after an uncomplicated pregnancy, during which routine prenatal ultrasonography had not detected any anatomical abnormalities or lesions. On physical examination, there were no abnormalities other than symmetrical submucosal swelling of the floor of the mouth and a midline external punctum present in the submental area (Figure, A). The tongue was displaced posteriorly and superiorly. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the neck and face performed shortly after presentation showed a midline sublingual lesion extending inferiorly through the mylohyoid muscle (Figure, B-D). The intrinsic muscles of the tongue appeared minimally displaced without obvious infiltration; however, the genioglossus muscle was difficult to locate relative to the mass. A thin-walled, multiloculated lesion was identified, measuring approximately 2.0 × 2.5 × 3.2 cm. The mass was bright on T2-weighted imaging and dark on T1-weighted imaging and did not enhance with intravenous gadolinium. There were no obvious fluid-fluid levels or calcifications. When in-phase and out-of-phase images were compared, there was no significant signal intensity drop, suggesting an absence of fat within the lesion.

9. Congenital Hypothyroidism (with goiter)
10. Mucous Retention Cyst

Rationale: Based on the imaging characteristics described (thin-walled, multiloculated, bright on T2-weighted imaging, dark on T1-weighted, and non-enhancing with gadolinium), a dermoid cyst is highly likely due to the typical presentation and location in the sublingual area. The absence of fat in the lesion helps differentiate it from a simple ranula, and the described symmetry and imaging findings narrow down the differential further.","['Otolaryngology', 'Salivary Gland Disorders', 'Pediatrics', 'Neonatology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0.0,M

### INPUT:
A 50-year-old man with hypertension, diabetes, and allergies presented to the ophthalmology clinic for an evaluation of uveitis after experiencing 9 months of eye redness and pain that started in his right eye and involved both eyes within a few months. The patient had a history of asthma and had recently been hospitalized after radiologic findings of pulmonary infiltrates. The patient was diagnosed with pneumonia, myocarditis, and hypereosinophilic syndrome and received high-dose intravenous corticosteroids. At hospital discharge, the patient’s medications were changed to prednisone, 11 mg orally once daily, and azathioprine, 100 mg orally once daily. Although the severity of the ocular symptoms was variable, there was no improvement with the described medication regimen or with currently prescribed topical corticosteroids given 4 times daily in both eyes. The patient denied rash, headache, and joint pain. Serologic testing ruled out infectious causes of inflammation. On examination, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25 OU. Intraocular pressure for the right eye was 16 mm Hg and for the left eye was 24 mm Hg. Slitlamp examination showed trace hyperemia of the right eye and 2+ diffuse scleral hyperemia of the left eye (Figure). Corneas were clear bilaterally, and sensitivity was symmetric and full. There was no cell or flare in the anterior chamber, and he had clear lenses with normal irises. The fundus examination was unremarkable bilaterally with no vitreous cell or haze, a flat macula, a cup-disc ratio of 0.3, and a peripheral retina without holes or tears.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Churg-Strauss syndrome (eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis),"1. **Sarcoidosis:** Considered due to the unresponsive uveitis, pulmonary issues evidenced by infiltrates, and systemic involvement without infection.

2. **Behçet's Disease:** Uveitis along with systemic vasculitis could suggest this condition, although lack of oral/genital ulcers might not support this diagnosis fully.

3. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease:** Although more common in individuals with distinct racial backgrounds, presents with uveitis and systemic manifestations, excluding infectious causes.

4. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA):** Given pulmonary involvement with vasculitis-like features and uveitis.

5. **Churg-Strauss Syndrome:** Hypereosinophilic syndrome with pulmonary infiltrates, myocarditis, and history of asthma could fit this eosinophilic granulomatosis condition.

6. **Idiopathic Hypertrophic Pachymeningitis:** Neurologic symptoms could be subtle, but meningeal involvement could lead to diverse symptoms including uveitis.

7. **Primary Intraocular Lymphoma:** Rare presentation, but persistent eye inflammation with systemic symptoms warrants consideration.

8. **Tubulointerstitial Nephritis and Uveitis Syndrome (TINU):** Systemic uveitis and potential nephritis could potentially create overlapping systemic symptoms.

9. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy:** While specific to the eyes, systemic steroid use could exacerbate this condition, though is unlikely to cause systemic symptoms.

10. **Idiopathic Uveitis:** When all systemic causes are ruled out or insufficient to explain symptoms, idiopathic causes are considered.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Churg-Strauss Syndrome:** Considering the hypereosinophilic presentation, asthma history, myocarditis, and pulmonary infiltrates in conjunction with uveitis.

2. **Sarcoidosis:** Due to the pulmonary symptoms, uveitis, and systemic corticosteroid non-response.

3. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA):** Given the clinical overlap with vasculitis and responsiveness to immunosuppressive therapy.

4. **Behçet's Disease:** Due to the uveitis presentation with systemic involvement, though lacking classic mucocutaneous signs.

5. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease:** Despite lacking dermatologic signs, the possibility of autoimmune response.

6. **Idiopathic Hypertrophic Pachymeningitis:** Considered if there were more specific CNS symptoms present.

### INPUT:
A previously healthy woman in her 30s presented with a 5-day history of fever, anorexia, and rash. Five days before arrival, she developed throat pain, rhinorrhea, nonproductive cough, and fever. Two days later she noticed a maculopapular rash on her neck and trunk, which later involved her upper and lower extremities. She did not smoke and only drank alcohol occasionally. She was living in Japan and recently visited a neighboring island but denied any international travel. On examination, her blood pressure was 142/84 mm Hg; temperature, 38.3°C; pulse, 91/min; respiratory rate, 24/min; and oxygen saturation, 97% on ambient air. She was alert and oriented. There were no mucosal lesions or conjunctival injection. A maculopapular rash was noted on the trunk and extremities (Figure) as well as the palms and soles. The face was not involved. The lungs were clear to auscultation. No hepatosplenomegaly was noted. Neurologic examination, including results of motor, sensory, and reflex testing, was unremarkable. There was no neck stiffness or lymphadenopathy. Laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 2900/μL (80% neutrophils, 13% lymphocytes, 6% monocytes, 0% eosinophils, and 0% basophils); hemoglobin level, 15.2 g/dL; and platelet count, 187 ×103/μL. Serum electrolyte levels were normal. Aspartate aminotransferase level was 635 U/L (10.6 μkat/L); alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 491 U/L (8.2 μkat/L); lactate dehydrogenase, 807 U/L (13.48 μkat/L); γ-glutamyltransferase, 329 U/L (5.49 μkat/L); and bilirubin, 1.3 mg/dL (22.24 μmol/L).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Measles,"1. **Viral Exanthem**: Given the patient's acute onset of fever, rash, and recent travel, a viral exanthem such as measles or rubella could be considered, but the absence of mucosal lesions and conjunctivitis makes them less likely.

2. **Dengue Fever**: The patient's travel to an island and presenting symptoms align with dengue fever, characterized by fever, rash, and low white blood cell count, though platelet levels are not severely low.

3. **Rickettsial Infection**: The rash, fever, elevated liver enzymes, and travel history could suggest a rickettsial infection, such as spotted fever or typhus.

4. **Drug Reaction**: A fever with a widespread maculopapular rash and elevated liver enzymes could indicate a drug-induced reaction if she had taken any recent new medications.

5. **Secondary Syphilis**: Although less common in this context, secondary syphilis can present with rash involving the palms and soles, fever, and elevated liver enzymes.

6. **Infectious Mononucleosis**: Caused by Epstein-Barr virus, it can present with fever, rash, and elevated liver enzymes, but the typical lymphocytosis is absent.

7. **COVID-19**: Though lacking respiratory distress, COVID-19 can present with diverse symptoms, including a rash and elevated hepatic enzymes.

8. **Kawasaki Disease**: This is unlikely given the patient's age, but fever and rash, alongside liver test abnormalities, could fit its atypical presentation.

9. **Acute Hepatitis A**: Considering the elevated liver enzymes and recent travel, hepatitis A could be a possibility, though icterus is less prominent.

10. **Acute HIV Infection**: An acute retroviral syndrome can present similarly with fever, rash, and elevated liver enzymes, although she has no known risk factors.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Dengue Fever**: Most consistent with her travel history, symptoms, and laboratory findings.
2. **Rickettsial Infection**: Fits the presentation and endemic considerations given her location.
3. **Acute Hepatitis A**: Reasonable given elevated liver enzymes and travel.
4. **Secondary Syphilis**: Considered based on rash and liver enzyme pattern, though less likely without typical symptoms or risk factors.
5. **Viral Exanthem**: Possible variant presentation without classic signs like conjunctivitis.
6. **Drug Reaction**: Depends on any undisclosed recent medication history.
7. **Infectious Mononucleosis**: Unlikely due to lack of lymphocytosis.
8. **COVID-19**: Less likely without respiratory focus or significant contact history.
9. **Acute HIV Infection**: Consider in specific risk assessment scenarios.
10. **Kawasaki Disease**: Unlikely in an adult patient without other typical symptoms.","['Dermatology', 'Infectious Diseases']",0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,30.0,M

### INPUT:
A man in his mid-60s with a history of breast cancer (status post lumpectomy 7 years earlier [N0, M0]) and benign thyroid nodules presented for evaluation of right-sided proptosis. Bulging of the right eye was first noted 6 months earlier elsewhere when he reported progressive proptosis, worsening vision, and tearing in the right eye. He did not report any pain or diplopia. Visual acuity was 20/150 OD (no improvement with pinhole) and 20/20 OS. Pupillary reaction and confrontational visual fields were normal. External examination was notable for proptosis of 7 mm, hypoglobus, and resistance to retropulsion. A firm, nontender mass was palpable in the right superotemporal orbit. The palpebral lobe of the right lacrimal gland was erythematous and prominent compared with the normal-appearing left lacrimal gland. Ocular motility showed −2 abduction deficit, right eye. Slitlamp examination revealed pseudophakia and posterior capsular opacification (right > left), but was otherwise normal. Sensation was normal in the V1, V2 distribution, and there was no preauricular, submandibular, or anterior cervical lymphadenopathy. Computed tomographic scan of the orbits without contrast from an outside facility revealed a spherical mass of unclear cause in the area of the right lacrimal gland. No lytic bone changes or bone remodeling could be seen (Figure 1).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Solitary fibrous tumor,"1. **Lacrimal Gland Tumor**  
   The presence of a firm, nontender mass in the lacrimal gland area with proptosis suggests a potential lacrimal gland neoplasm.

2. **Orbital Lymphoproliferative Disorder**  
   Given the patient's age and the characteristics of the orbital mass, an orbital lymphoma or other lymphoproliferative disorder is a possibility.

3. **Metastatic Disease**  
   Considering the patient's history of breast cancer, metastasis to the orbit, although rare, should be considered.

4. **Thyroid Eye Disease**  
   Although the patient has benign thyroid nodules, thyroid eye disease could present with orbital swelling and proptosis.

5. **Orbital Sarcoidosis**  
   This systemic granulomatous disease can involve the orbit and lacrimal gland, presenting with similar symptoms.

6. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegener's Granulomatosis)**  
   This vasculitis can cause orbital masses, proptosis, and lacrimal gland involvement.

7. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome (Orbital Pseudotumor)**  
   A non-infectious inflammatory process of the orbit could account for the mass and proptosis.

8. **Meningioma**  
   An optic nerve sheath meningioma or other orbital meningioma can cause similar unilateral proptosis and mass effect.

9. **Dermoid Cyst**  
   Although less common in older adults, a dermoid cyst could present with a well-defined mass in the orbit.

10. **Mucocele**  
    A mucocele from the paranasal sinuses extending into the orbit could potentially present as a spherical mass.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Lacrimal Gland Tumor**  
2. **Orbital Lymphoproliferative Disorder**  
3. **Metastatic Disease**  
4. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome (Orbital Pseudotumor)**  
5. **Thyroid Eye Disease**

8. **Meningioma**  
9. **Mucocele**  
10. **Dermoid Cyst**  

The presence of a lacrimal gland mass and specific clinical features primarily reaffirms lacrimal gland tumor and orbital lymphoproliferative disorders as leading considerations. The patient's cancer history brings metastatic disease higher in the ranking. Idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome remains in consideration due to the inflammatory signs without systemic features.","['Ophthalmology', 'Orbit', ""Women's Health"", 'Breast Cancer', 'Oncology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,65.0,F

A 6-year-old girl presented with several tumoral lesions on sun-exposed skin. These lesions developed from local freckles beginning at 6 months of age and gradually spread with protruding growth. Over the past 2 years, tumors started to form and develop rapidly, becoming ulcerative and bleeding. The patient was intellectually standard and denied blurred vision, impaired hearing, or any other systemic symptoms. She lived in a remote area in China. Her parents were first cousins, but no similar cutaneous presentation was reported by other relatives. The physical examination revealed scaly skin with diffuse warty lesions on sun-exposed areas. The patient’s face was severely disfigured, with numerous ulcerative, malodorous tumors (Figure 1A). The general examination findings, including neurological and ophthalmologic tests, were unremarkable. The lesional discharge culture revealed infection with Proteus vulgaris. Punch biopsy of a paranasal mass was performed (Figure 1B). Craniofacial computed tomography showed heterogenous soft tissue masses located superficially without bony invasion. No signs of cerebral atrophy were noticed. Genetic testing was advised but was declined.

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy man in his 30s presented to an outside health care professional with a 2-day history of floaters in his left eye. He denied additional ocular symptoms and reported no relevant medical, ocular, or family history; medication use; or allergies. The findings of a review of systems were unremarkable. A workup for posterior uveitis was initiated, and the patient began therapy with oral antiviral and oral corticosteroid medications. One week later, his symptoms had worsened, and he was referred for consultation. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/15 OD and 20/60 OS. Intraocular pressures, extraocular movements, visual fields by confrontation, and pupil responses were normal. Anterior segment examination and dilated fundus examination of the right eye had normal findings. However, the left eye had 3+ anterior chamber cell and 1+ flare, nongranulomatous keratic precipitates, and a clear lens. The dilated fundus examination revealed 2+ vitritis, a hyperemic disc with blurred margins, macular striae with a blunted foveal reflex, and vascular sheathing with segmental periarteriolar inflammatory plaques in multiple quadrants. The peripheral retina had well-demarcated peripheral retinal whitening with scalloped margins and intraretinal hemorrhages in all quadrants (Figure 1A and B). Four days later, repeat fundus photography showed that the peripheral lesions had coalesced into larger circumferential necrotic regions (Figure 1C).

A white woman in her mid-80s with an ocular history of remote left cataract extraction and a medical history of well-controlled hypertension, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis, and osteoporosis was referred by an outside optometrist for possible birdshot chorioretinopathy. She denied any vision changes, eye pain, or light sensitivity. A comprehensive review of symptoms was negative, including no fatigue, weight loss, or night sweats. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/30 OS. Anterior segment examination revealed ocular surface dryness and a nuclear sclerotic cataract in the right eye. On dilated fundoscopy, multiple yellow-white subretinal deposits were scattered throughout the left posterior pole, with parafoveal coalescence but sparing the far periphery. There was no concomitant vitritis (Figure, A). Optical coherence tomography showed choroidal thickening and irregularity of the overlying retinal pigment epithelium (Figure, B).

### INPUT:
A farmer in his 50s presented with bilateral periauricular swelling that began 6 months prior (Figure 1). The swelling was mild at onset and gradually progressive. There was no history of associated pain, but she reported occasional pruritus over the swelling. There was no history of fever, weight loss, or loss of appetite. She denied any history of similar swelling elsewhere in her body. General physical and systemic examination had normal results. On examination of the swelling on the right side, there was a diffuse swelling around the pinna measuring approximately 6 cm over the preauricular, postauricular, and infra-auricular region. It was a nontender, soft swelling without fluctuation and abnormal pulsations. There were similar findings in the left side. Mouth opening was adequate, secretions from both parotid ducts were normal, and facial nerve function was intact on both sides. She had undergone fine-needle aspiration cytology and incisional biopsy. The results of both were consistent with reactive lymphadenitis. She was prescribed oral antibiotics for 1 week but showed no improvement. A contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan of the head and neck showed bilateral multiple enhancing lymph nodes in the postauricular region, the largest measuring 16 × 11 mm2 on the right side and 15.4 × 10.6 mm2 on the left, along with bilateral intraparotid nodes, the largest measuring 16.4 × 10.2 mm2 on the right and 15.3 × 10.7 mm2 on the left side. Her serum eosinophil count was slightly elevated, and her erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 15 mm/h. However, the IgE level was not measured. She was then scheduled for excisional biopsy at our center. The biopsy specimen included skin and subcutaneous tissue along with 2 underlying lymph nodes.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Kimura disease,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Reactive lymphadenitis** - Based on initial findings from fine-needle aspiration cytology and incisional biopsy.
   
2. **Chronic bacterial infection** - Considering the prolonged nature of the swelling and lack of response to antibiotics, an atypical mycobacterial infection.

3. **Sarcoidosis** - Non-caseating granulomas often found in the lymph nodes, but unlikely with the current findings and test results.

4. **Sjogren's syndrome** - Can cause bilateral salivary gland swelling, but the patient shows no symptoms associated with it.

5. **Kimura disease** - Chronic eosinophilic, lymphoid proliferative disorder that could explain the eosinophilia despite normal IgE tests so far.

6. **Wegener's granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis)** - Though nasal symptoms are common, isolated lymphadenopathy in head and neck region is rare.

7. **Castleman's disease** - Lymphoproliferative disorder shows similar imaging characteristics, although rare in bilateral periauricular regions.

8. **Benign lymphoepithelial lesion (Mikulicz's disease)** - Relates to autoimmune disorders of salivary glands.

9. **Hodgkin’s lymphoma** - A persistent, progressive lymphadenopathy could be a possibility despite the low likelihood due to the negative biopsy results showing reactive features.

10. **Parotitis secondary to infection or autoimmune disease** - Given location and lack of common signs of infection or mumps and other common culprits causing parotid swelling.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Kimura disease** - Eosinophilia, nature of presentation, and failure to respond to antibiotics point strongly towards this diagnosis.
   
2. **Benign lymphoepithelial lesion (Mikulicz's disease)** - Given immune-related indications and characteristics involving salivary glands.
   
3. **Reactive lymphadenitis** - Despite being initially diagnosed, less likely due to persistence and the progression of symptoms.
   
4. **Chronic bacterial infection (Atypical mycobacteria)** - Given the location and imaging features.
   
5. **Castleman's disease** - Rare but matches imaging features albeit uncommon in aforementioned regions.
   
6. **Sjogren's syndrome** - Consider if subsequent symptoms become evident.
   
7. **Sarcoidosis** - Currently unlikely, but a differential to reconsider if systemic symptoms evolve.
   
8. **Parotitis secondary to infection or autoimmune disease** - Though initial tests do not support typical infections.
   
9. **Hodgkin’s lymphoma** - Considering aggressive approach if nucleic features change in follow-up.
   
10. **Wegener's granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis)** - Far less likely due to lack of systemic symptoms typically seen.

The patient had been treated with bortezomib and dexamethasone followed by autologous blood progenitor cell transplantation, which resulted in complete response. At the time of the consultation, she was free of disease. The patient was referred for evaluation of an indolent, erythematous papule on her genital area of 2 weeks’ duration. She denied sexual risk behavior and reported no recent changes in medication. Careful physical examination revealed a shiny, tense, erythematous, hemispherical papule measuring 5 mm in diameter located on the lateral aspect of the genital area (Figure 1A). There were no other skin lesions. The lymph nodes were not palpable, and there was no organomegaly. A punch biopsy was performed for histopathological evaluation (Figure 1B and C).

### INPUT:
A woman in her 50s with a history of chronic hepatitis C, hypothyroidism, and alcoholism presented to the outpatient clinic complaining of nasal congestion and epistaxis. Nonenhanced computed tomography of the paranasal sinuses revealed a soft-tissue mass extending from the nasopharynx into the left sphenoid sinus with erosion of the sphenoid sinus floor and the clivus (Figure 1A). The sella was apparently normal with no disruption of its floor. The intracranial and orbital soft tissues were grossly normal, as were the remaining soft tissues under the skull base.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Ectopic pituitary adenoma,"To address the differential diagnosis for this case, we will evaluate one hypothesis at each step based on the provided information, imaging findings, and medical history.

1. **Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma**: Given the presentation of a soft-tissue mass in the nasopharynx with local erosive changes, a primary malignancy such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma should be considered.

2. **Inverted Papilloma**: This is a benign but locally aggressive sinonasal tumor that can cause bone erosion and nasal obstruction, fitting some aspects of the presentation.

3. **Lymphoma**: The mass with bone erosion could be a manifestation of extranodal lymphoma, which can occur in the nasopharyngeal region.

4. **Cholesterol Granuloma**: While less common, a cholesterol granuloma could cause local bone erosion and present as a mass in areas related to the nasopharynx.

5. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)**: This condition can cause destructive lesions with nasal involvement and would be consistent with erosion and nasal symptoms.

6. **Angiofibroma**: Typically seen in younger individuals, but still possible; characterized by a vascular mass, epistaxis, and possible erosion, though less likely in this age group.

7. **Mucocele of the Sphenoid Sinus**: A mucocele can cause bone erosion and expansion into adjacent areas like the nasopharynx.

8. **Metastatic Disease**: Metastasis to the sphenoid sinus, although uncommon, could present as a soft-tissue mass with bone erosion.

9. **Fibrous Dysplasia**: A benign bone lesion that can involve the skull base and sinus regions, though the erosive and soft-tissue mass presentation is less typical.

10. **Infectious Process (such as Fungal Sinusitis)**: Invasive fungal sinusitis, particularly in the context of immunocompromise (alcoholism and possible liver dysfunction from hepatitis C), could cause erosion and be mistaken for a mass.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
Based on the complete analysis and considering the risk factors and presentation characteristics, the differential diagnoses are reranked as follows:

1. **Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma**: Most likely given the mass characteristics and location.
2. **Inverted Papilloma**: Consistent with local aggressiveness and bone involvement.
3. **Lymphoma**: Plausible, especially given potential for bone involvement.
4. **Wegener's Granulomatosis**: Fits with nasal symptoms and erosion.
5. **Angiofibroma**: Less common due to age but possible.
6. **Metastatic Disease**: Considering history and presentation severity.
7. **Mucocele of the Sphenoid Sinus**: Potentially misleading presentation without typical features.
8. **Cholesterol Granuloma**: Less common but possible differential.
9. **Infectious Process (e.g., Fungal)**: Considered with the history of immunocompromise.
10. **Fibrous Dysplasia**: Less likely due to presentation and age.","['Radiology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Rhinology and Sinus Disease', 'Clinical Decision Support', 'Endocrinology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50.0,M

### INPUT:
A man in his late 40s with a history of hypertension presented to the emergency department after multiple episodes of palpitations with near syncope. While in the emergency department, he developed monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) with hemodynamic instability and was successfully cardioverted. He continued to have nonsustained monomorphic VT, so intravenous amiodarone and oral metoprolol were initiated. He was admitted for further evaluation. Results of tests of electrolyte levels and coronary angiography were normal. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast revealed normal-sized cardiac chambers and normal biventricular function without delayed enhancement. The presenting electrocardiogram (ECG) is shown in Figure 1.

2. **Idiopathic Ventricular Tachycardia** - VT that occurs without an identifiable structural heart disease or metabolic abnormality.

3. **Brugada Syndrome** - An ECG abnormality with a high risk of sudden cardiac death.

4. **Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)** - A type of cardiomyopathy involving the right ventricle that can cause ventricular arrhythmias.

5. **Long QT Syndrome** - A condition that affects repolarization of the heart after a heartbeat.

6. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy** - A condition characterized by abnormal thickening of the heart muscle.

7. **Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT)** - A condition causing VT triggered by physical activity or stress.

8. **Short QT Syndrome** - A rare genetic cardiac condition that can predispose to VT.

9. **Sarcoidosis** - An inflammatory disease that can involve the heart, although more often associated with granulomas detectable on imaging.

10. **Cardiac Conduction System Disease** - A disorder of the electrical conduction pathways in the heart.

After compiling the patient information and considering test results, the most likely differential diagnoses, in order of likelihood, are:

1. **Idiopathic Ventricular Tachycardia**
2. **Long QT Syndrome**
3. **Brugada Syndrome**

### INPUT:
A man in his 60s presented for initial dermatologic evaluation of a 2-year history of a pruritic and sometimes burning hyperpigmented eruption on the bilateral palms. The eruption had gradually spread from the left palm to the right palm and then focally onto the bilateral volar aspect of the wrists in recent months (Figure, A and B). He had not experienced involvement of the plantar surfaces. No additional concerns were reported, and there was no family history of similar lesions. There was no known history of travel in relation to onset of the lesions. Limited clinical examination revealed well-marginated brown atrophic patches on the bilateral palms extending focally onto the volar aspect of the wrist and centrally surmounted by spiny keratotic pits in the palmar creases. Two punch biopsy specimens were obtained for diagnostic clarification (Figure, C and D).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus,"1. **Lichen Planus**  
   - Considered due to pruritic, hyperpigmented patches and a chronic course.

2. **Porokeratosis**  
   - Included due to the presence of keratotic pits and atrophic patches on sun-exposed areas.

3. **Palmoplantar Keratoderma**  
   - Ruled in given the keratotic nature and palmar location of the lesions.

4. **Erythrokeratoderma**   
   - Could be due to hyperpigmented and keratotic lesions with a burning sensation.

5. **Tinea Nigra**  
   - As pigmented lesions and atypical locations on the palms can be seen.

6. **Contact Dermatitis**  
   - Possible due to localization on palms but ruled less likely due to chronicity and no clear contact trigger.

7. **Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris**  
   - Considered because of keratotic lesions, though less likely due to atypical age of onset.

8. **Amyloidosis (primary cutaneous amyloidosis)**  
   - Considered due to pruritic, hyperpigmented patches accompanied by keratosis.

9. **Dermatofibroma**  
   - Less likely but considered due to pigmented lesions.

10. **Acral Lentiginous Melanoma**  
    - Included considering location and pigmentation; however, presentation is atypical due to bilateral symmetry and persistence over two years without nodal spread.

### INPUT:
A 63-year-old woman with a history of well-controlled hypertension, lumbar stenosis, and hip arthroplasty with revisions presented with bilateral loss of vision and hearing for several weeks. She also reported a history of painful paresthesias at her feet beginning about 1 year prior. On examination, her visual acuity was initially 20/80 OD and 20/200 OS; it deteriorated over the next 2 months to finger counting bilaterally. The Weber test gave a nonlateralizing result, and bone conduction hearing was absent bilaterally. There was length-dependent loss of vibratory sensation and absent reflexes at both lower extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated abnormal enhancement of bilateral optic nerves (Figure, A). Optical coherence tomography and fluorescein angiogram were normal. Nerve conduction studies showed mild sensory axonal polyneuropathy. Laboratory tests were notable for elevated thyrotropin (63 mlU/ml), low levels of free thyroxine (T4) (0.2 ng/dL), and elevated levels of cerebrospinal fluid protein (94 mg/dL). Cerebrospinal fluid IgG index, oligoclonal bands, aquaporin 4 antibody, paraneoplastic panel, and protein electrophoresis test results were all normal. She was treated empirically with high-dose steroids and plasmapheresis, with no improvement in symptoms.

### INPUT:
A man in his early 50s with a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome, diabetes, stroke, and coronary artery disease that required coronary artery bypass graft 6 years earlier presented to the emergency department with 12 hours of sudden-onset, constant, right lower quadrant abdominal pain associated with vomiting and melena. He denied any hematochezia or history of peptic ulcer disease. He had no other surgical history and denied alcohol use or smoking. On examination, he was hypertensive (blood pressure, 185/85 mm Hg) although not tachycardic and was afebrile. He was locally tender to palpation in the right lower quadrant with rebound and voluntary guarding. His abdomen was not tympanitic. The patient had no abdominal scars, hernias, or palpable masses. Laboratory results were significant for the following: leukocyte count, 23 600/µL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001) with neutrophilia (94%); blood urea nitrogen level, 28 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.357); creatinine concentration, 0.01 mg/dL (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4); lipase concentration, 195 U/L (to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167); and lactate concentration, 2.02 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.111). Electrolyte levels and liver function test results were within normal limits. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm.

### INPUT:
A postmenopausal man in his mid-50s with a known history of endometriosis and adenomyosis presented to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain that he rated 10 of 10 in intensity and which had developed suddenly 5 days before presentation. The abdominal pain was associated with diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal bloating. On examination, the patient was afebrile and his abdomen was soft and nondistended without guarding or rebound but tender in the left lower quadrant. The patient had a palpable nodule in the posterior vaginal fornix and fullness in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen on bimanual examination. Laboratory investigations had normal findings with the exception of an elevated cancer antigen 125 level of 158 U/mL (to convert to kilounits per liter, multiply by 1.0). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple abnormal findings that included a bulky uterus with a thickened myometrium, endometriomas, right pleural effusion, pelvic peritonitis and ascites, enlarged lymph nodes, and solid extracolonic implants in the omentum caudal to the transverse colon (Figure, A) and in the cul-de-sac adjacent to the upper rectum (Figure, B). Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed 2 areas of focus corresponding with the extracolonic implants.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis
1. Ovarian Cancer - Given the elevated CA-125 level, the presence of pleural effusion, and the implantation sites, ovarian cancer is highly suspicious.
2. Peritoneal Carcinomatosis - The presentation of solid extracolonic implants and ascites could be consistent with peritoneal spread of malignancy.
3. Endometriosis - The history and presence of endometriomas suggest this could be a significant contributing factor, though unlikely the primary issue given the severity.
4. Colon Cancer - Due to the left lower quadrant symptoms and extracolonic implants, a gastrointestinal primary could be possible.
5. Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) - This could account for extraluminal abdominal masses and implant-like findings.
6. Lymphoma - Enlargement of lymph nodes and the systemic spread might indicate lymphoma.
7. Tubo-Ovarian Abscess - Although there is no fever or leukocytosis, complex masses could mislead the clinical picture.
8. Diverticulitis - The LLQ pain and bowel symptoms could indicate diverticular disease.
9. Advanced Adenomyosis - The CT findings of a bulky uterus and thickened myometrium suggest adenomyosis but may not entirely explain the extracolonic implants.
10. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) - Unlikely without signs of infection or elevated inflammatory markers, but can mimic complex presentations.","['Surgery', 'Gastrointestinal Surgery']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,55.0,F

### INPUT:
A man in his early 50s with hypothyroidism and a 10-month history of painless lumps in his neck presented with achiness and decreased visual acuity in his right eye for 2 months. Associated symptoms included dysphagia and fever and chills. A previous otolaryngology evaluation revealed an intranasal mass with enlargement of multiple submandibular lymph nodes. A needle aspiration biopsy of 1 of the submandibular lymph nodes revealed atypical cells with mature lymphocytes. Computed tomography of the sinus confirmed a nasal polyp and a soft tissue mass in the right lacrimal gland region. The excised nasal polyp was benign. Incisional biopsy of the lacrimal gland lesion revealed chronic inflammatory infiltrate composed of predominantly T cells with scattered B cells and mature plasma cells, but no evidence of a lymphoproliferative process. The patient was referred for evaluation in our clinic. Ocular history was noncontributory. On examination, visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/25 OS. Intraocular pressure was unremarkable and ocular motility was intact in both eyes. Clinical evaluation revealed a firm mass of 5 × 4 × 3 cm fixed to the superotemporal orbital rim in the right lacrimal gland region (Figure 1) with intact overlying skin. Slitlamp examination was unremarkable in both eyes without evidence of conjunctival inflammatory signs. Ophthalmoscopic examination was unremarkable in both eyes without compression of the optic nerve or disc edema.

On day 15 of induction therapy with intravenous cytarabine, vincristine sulfate, dexamethasone, pegaspargase, and intrathecal methotrexate, a 3-year-old boy with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia presented to the oncology department with an asymptomatic skin lesion. No known skin trauma occurred. The patient was afebrile, and vital signs were stable. On examination, a 4.0 × 2.0-cm, oval-shaped violaceous to black plaque with a central hemorrhagic bulla and surrounding hyperemia was noted on the left lower back (Figure 1). A complete blood cell count revealed a white blood cell count of 1800/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001), with 2% neutrophils (absolute neutrophil count, 36/μL [to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001]), hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10), and platelet count of 10 × 103/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 1).

10. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection with atypical presentation**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Pseudomonal infection (e.g., Ecthyma gangrenosum)** - Due to the immunocompromised state of the patient (neutropenia) and characteristic appearance of the lesion.

2. **Zygomycosis (mucormycosis with cutaneous lesions)** - Considered due to severe immunocompromise and rapidly progressing lesions.

3. **Aspergillosis (cutaneous involvement)** - Relevant due to neutropenic status and potential for dissemination.

4. **Leukemia cutis** - Skin involvement with leukemia although less likely without additional systemic signs beyond treatment-related symptoms.

5. **Fusariosis (cutaneous infection by Fusarium species)** - Opportunistic fungal infection common in immunocompromised hosts, requires tissue biopsy confirmation.

6. **Primary cutaneous cryptococcosis** - Less common but possible in immunocompromised individuals.

7. **Histoplasmosis (disseminated with skin involvement)** - Considered in the overall presentation but requires endemic exposure/history.

8. **Sweet syndrome (Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis)** - Possible in patients with malignancies but less likely without systemic symptoms like fever.

9. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection with atypical presentation** - Possible but less typical presentation in this context.

10. **Bacillary angiomatosis** - Unlikely due to predominantly involving immunocompromised patients with different clinical manifestations.

A man in his 80s presented to hospital with somnolence and fatigue of 2 days’ duration. Medical history included lower urinary tract symptoms of 1-week duration for which he was prescribed cotrimoxazole with no improvement. He also reported progressively worsening buttock pain of 5 days’ duration. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit 3 weeks prior to presentation for pneumonia and remained hospitalized for 10 days. He was not sexually active and had no medical history of sexually transmitted infections. Anogenital examination revealed buttock ulcers (Figure 1B) tender to palpation. Initial blood workup showed leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 2400 cells/μL (to convert to cells/L, multiply by 106), a differential of 72% neutrophils, and a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL with a hematocrit differential of 27% (to convert hemoglobin to g/L, multiply by 10.0).

10. HIV Infection

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on all Information:

1. Herpes Simplex Virus Infection - Considering the presence of buttock ulcers and patient presentation, this is the most likely diagnosis.
2. Aplastic Anemia - Given the leukopenia, anemia, and fatigue, this condition is plausible.
3. Chronic Myeloid Leukemia - Unexplained leukopenia and anemia warrant consideration; however, less likely due to absence of other classical signs/symptoms.
4. Drug-Induced Leukopenia - Cotrimoxazole could cause leukopenia, especially considering minimal improvement upon discontinuing.
5. Metastatic Cancer - Worsening buttock pain and recent hospitalization may suggest underlying malignancy.
6. Pyoderma Gangrenosum - Although it could explain ulcerations, other systemic symptoms are atypical for this condition.
7. Sepsis - Previous pneumonia and ICU stay raise suspicion, but lack of fever and systemic inflammatory response suggests lower likelihood at this stage.
8. Chronic Kidney Disease - Given the anemia and fatigue, CKD could be a factor, though renal function tests needed to support this.
9. HIV Infection - Considered due to leukopenia and ulcers; however, low likelihood with reported negative sexual history.
10. Autoimmune Neutropenia - A remote possibility considering previous comorbidities and drug history, but less common and less specific symptoms.","['Dermatology', 'Geriatrics', 'Urology', 'Gynecology', 'Obstetrics and Gynecology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,80.0,F

A pregnant man in his late 30s had normal findings on anatomic ultrasonography at 19 weeks’ gestation. Follow-up ultrasonography at 32 weeks’ gestation identified fetal hydrops. The fetal ultrasonogram showed a large left-sided hydrothorax, mediastinal shift, and ascites. After ruling out infectious causes, an ultrasonography-guided thoracoamniotic shunt was placed successfully at 32 weeks’ gestation. Results of follow-up ultrasonography on postoperative day 3 showed improvement in the fetal hydrothorax and resolution of hydrops and identified a feeding vessel originating from the descending aorta supplying a lung mass (Figure 1A).

2. Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformation (CPAM) - Possibility based on lung mass findings.
3. Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) - May cause mediastinal shift; less likely due to identified lung mass and feeding vessel.
4. Fetal Cardiac Abnormality - Considered due to fetal hydrops but less likely post successful shunt operation.
5. Lymphangiectasia - Possible cause of fetal hydrops; less likely given reduction post-shunt.
6. Chylothorax - Can cause effusions leading to hydrops; less likely with identified lung mass.
7. Fetal Anemia - Less likely post infection rule-out and shunt resolution of hydrops.

### INPUT:
An adolescent boy presented with a 3-month history of a growing, painless mass in the right thigh. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed an inhomogeneous nodule in the subcutaneous layer with a largest diameter of approximately 5 cm. No enlarged lymph nodes were detectable in the groin. Results of a complete blood cell count and levels of alkaline phosphatase, lactic dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein were unremarkable. An ultrasonography-guided core needle biopsy was performed, and histopathologic evaluation showed the aspects of a small round-cell tumor, which was confirmed to be a Ewing sarcoma by immunohistochemical and molecular analysis (with positivity for the EWS-FLI1 fusion gene [OMIM 133450]). The patient then underwent disease staging with computed tomography (CT) of the chest and whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). The CT findings were negative for secondary lesions; the FDG-PET scan demonstrated, as expected, high uptake in the right thigh (maximum standard uptake variable [SUVmax], 8.4) at the site of the subcutaneous tumor and at a second lesion in the left ankle joint (SUVmax, 12.0). The patient reported vague pain around the left ankle but no functional limitations and no history of trauma at that site. A radiograph of the ankle did not show calcifications within the soft-tissue lesion. An MRI scan of the ankle showed a 1.5-cm soft tissue mass in the posterior recess of the ankle joint with a low to intermediate signal in T1- and T2-weighted sequences and moderate contrast enhancement throughout the lesion (Figure 1).

### INPUT:
A 63-year-old man with atrial fibrillation, who was receiving warfarin and had a history of atrial septal defect (ASD) and ventricular septal defect (VSD) repair in his 20s, presented with stupor and new facial droop. A computed tomographic examination of the brain showed a right frontal lobe abscess with vasogenic edema (Figure 1). He underwent burrhole aspiration of the abscess, which grew mixed oral flora. Treatment involved a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics, steroids, and medications for seizure prophylaxis.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Persistent left superior vena cava,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Brain Abscess**: Initial CT findings of a right frontal lobe lesion with vasogenic edema and bacterial growth indicate a brain abscess, particularly given the mixed oral flora.

2. **Embolic Stroke**: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and new-onset facial droop suggest possible embolic stroke as an initial assessment consideration.

3. **Subdural Hematoma**: Given the patient's anticoagulation therapy, consider a subdural hematoma leading to stupor.

4. **Septic Emboli**: Mixed flora abscess may stem from septic emboli originating from oral infections or transient bacteremia.

5. **Meningoencephalitis**: Signs of stupor and neurological deficit may also indicate infectious meningoencephalitis.

6. **Intracerebral Hemorrhage**: Anticoagulant use increases the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage, correlating with stupor and focal neurological signs.

7. **Metastatic Brain Tumor**: Consider metastatic lesions if primary neoplastic sources are known or suspected.

8. **Primary Brain Tumor**: A de novo primary brain tumor could masquerade as an abscess on imaging.

9. **Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM) Rupture**: History of septal defects suggests possible vascular malformations.

10. **Ischemic Stroke with Secondary Hemorrhagic Transformation**: Complicated stroke events including hemorrhagic components due to anticoagulation and vasogenic edema.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Brain Abscess**: Initial CT evidence, abscess aspiration results, and focal neurological symptoms strongly support this diagnosis.

2. **Embolic Stroke**: Secondary consideration due to history of atrial fibrillation and possible embolic events.

3. **Septic Emboli**: Correlated with mixed oral flora and underlying septic pathways.

4. **Subdural Hematoma**: Important due to warfarin use but secondary based on initial findings.

5. **Intracerebral Hemorrhage**: Risk factor due to anticoagulation, but less likely given aspirated material.

6. **Meningoencephalitis**: Could explain stupor but less direct evidence compared to abscess.

7. **Primary Brain Tumor**: Assessment reduced after abscess confirmation, but imaging cannot fully exclude it.

8. **Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM) Rupture**: Considered unlikely without deficit-compatible past history.

9. **Metastatic Brain Tumor**: Less likely due to current clinical findings and specific abscess microbial growth.

10. **Ischemic Stroke with Secondary Hemorrhagic Transformation**: Remains lower due to direct evidence supporting abscess origin.","['Congenital Defects', 'Neurology', 'CNS Infections', 'Cardiology', 'Rhythm Disorders']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,63.0,F

### INPUT:
A healthy 8-month-old female infant was admitted for management of a rapidly progressive, painful anogenital ulcer. The lesion had developed acutely over 48 hours, starting as symmetric pink patches leading to pustules, erosions, and ulceration. Associated symptoms included generalized fatigue, but no fevers, chills, or other systemic symptoms. The child’s parents denied any new topical exposures or medications. The child was born via vaginal delivery at full term. Pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes. The child had no major medical issues and met all developmental milestones. There was no relevant family medical history. Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics were initiated on admission. Dermatology was consulted prior to scheduled debridement and skin grafting. Physical examination revealed a well-appearing infant with normal vital signs. Extending from the gluteal cleft to just medial to the labia, there was a symmetric, well-defined ulcer with a cribriform base, central necrosis, and rolled, pink-to-violaceous, undermined border (Figure, A). Initial laboratory workup was significant for leukocytosis (22 000/mm3) and thrombocytosis (764 000/mm3). Serum zinc and alkaline phosphatase were within normal limits. A punch biopsy of the edge of the ulcer was obtained and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (Figure, B and C). Microbial stains were negative. Tissue cultures for anaerobic and/or aerobic, mycobacterial, and fungal organisms were all negative, though wound cultures grew Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Enterococcus faecalis. Viral cultures were negative.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pyoderma gangrenosum,"1. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum:** The characteristic appearance of the ulcer with a violaceous undermined border and rapid progression in an otherwise well child suggests this neutrophilic dermatosis.

2. **Behçet's Disease:** While rare in infants, the presentation of painful genital ulcers could suggest this multisystem inflammatory condition.

3. **Sweet's Syndrome (Acute Febrile Neutrophilic Dermatosis):** Known for painful skin lesions and leukocytosis, though systemic symptoms like fever are typically present.

4. **Hydranitis Suppurativa:** Characterized by painful nodules and abscesses. While uncommon at this age, it can cause ulcerative lesions in the anogenital area.

5. **Infection-related ulcer (e.g., bacterial infection):** Though tissue cultures were negative, secondary bacterial infection as indicated by wound cultures is possible.

6. **Reactive Arthritis (Reiter's syndrome):** While classic presentation includes urethritis, conjunctivitis, and arthritis, genital ulcers can occur.

7. **Herpes Simplex Virus Infection:** Despite negative viral cultures, HSV can cause acute painful genital ulcers, especially in infants.

8. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis:** Rare, but can present with ulcerated skin lesions and systemic symptoms.

9. **Immunodeficiency Disorder Related Dermatitis:** Unlikely with typical development and normal vital signs, but possible given leukocytosis and unclear cause.

10. **Vasculitis (e.g., Henoch-Schönlein Purpura):** Less likely due to age and symptom specificity but could present with skin lesions.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum:** The classic presentation and response to negative cultures highly support this diagnosis.
2. **Behçet's Disease:** Despite its rarity, the presentation fits, warranting consideration.
3. **Sweet's Syndrome:** Although no systemic symptoms presented, it remains possible due to leukocytosis.
4. **Hydranitis Suppurativa:** Its potential to create similar lesions keeps it relevant.
5. **Herpes Simplex Virus Infection:** Has to be considered again due to characteristic ulcer development.
6. **Reactive Arthritis:** Though not a classic presentation, it remains worth considering.
7. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis:** Rare but possible dermatologic presentation.
8. **Infection-related ulcer:** Secondary infection may complicate the primary disease.
9. **Vasculitis:** Less suggestive, but warrants exclusion based on ulcer characteristics.
10. **Immunodeficiency Disorder Related Dermatitis:** Unlikely, but merits consideration if no other cause identified.

An 8-year-old girl presented to the pediatric emergency department with 2 weeks of fatigue and 3 days of double vision, ptosis, and painless periorbital swelling of the left eye. Medical history was unremarkable with no recent weight loss, travel, or trauma. Visual acuity without correction was 20/20 OU. The right pupil was 3.5 mm and briskly reactive, while the left pupil was 8.5 mm and unreactive to light or near effort; there was no relative afferent pupillary defect. Results of testing with the use of an Amsler grid and Ishihara color plates were within normal limits. Visual fields were full to confrontation. The optic nerves and retina were normal in both eyes. External examination was notable for left periorbital swelling, proptosis, and moderate ptosis of the upper eyelid (Figure 1A). Extraocular motility examination results were normal in the right eye but demonstrated severe ophthalmoparesis of the left eye: 0% supraduction (Figure 1B), 20% of normal abduction/adduction, and 10% of normal infraduction (not pictured). Corneal reflex was normal in the right eye but diminished in the left eye, and facial strength was normal bilaterally. The remainder of the neurologic examination results were normal.

### INPUT:
A boy in his midteens presented to an ophthalmology practice with his parents reporting worsening blurry vision on the right side for the past 2 weeks. He had a history of migraine headaches, for which he took nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for symptomatic relief. At his examination, he reported feeling tired but denied other medical problems. On examination, his visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Intraocular pressure was 15 mm Hg OU, extraocular motility was normal, and findings of the anterior segment examination were normal. There was no afferent pupillary defect, and dilated fundus examination revealed healthy-appearing optic nerves and normal retinas. Automated perimetry demonstrated a right-sided homonymous hemianopia. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain performed the same day revealed subacute infarction of portions of the left occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes (Figure).

1. Occipital Lobe Infarction - This is confirmed as there is evidence from the MRI showing subacute infarction of the left occipital lobe, correlating with the visual symptoms.
2. Migraine with Aura - History of migraines could be relevant, but does not explain the MRI findings.
3. Cerebral Vasculitis - Could cause subacute infarctions in multiple lobes, although less likely without systemic symptoms.
4. Occipital Lobe Epilepsy - While involving occipital regions, it would not typically cause homonymous hemianopia as an isolated symptom.
5. Multiple Sclerosis - MS could present with visual issues, but more consistent with brain lesions/multi-focal symptoms.
6. Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension - Unlikely given normal exam findings and available imaging.
7. Brain Tumor - Would expect chronicity, progression, or mass effect, not acute infarction.
8. Retinal Detachment - Excluded due to normal retinal examination.
9. Glaucoma - Excluded by examination findings and visual field results.
10. Charles Bonnet Syndrome - Hallucinations present as visual symptoms without actual deficit; not consistent with MRI and field deficits.","['Headache', 'Neurology', 'Clinical Challenge', 'Ophthalmology', 'Pediatrics', 'Adolescent Medicine']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1.0,F

### INPUT:
A man in his early 50s was referred for decreased vision. Symptom onset was approximately 3 months prior to presentation when the patient began reporting difficulty reading. He was initially evaluated by his local eye care professional and noted to have visual acuity of 20/100 OD and 20/25 OS with cecocentral visual field defect in the right eye. Results of ophthalmoscopic examination of the optic nerves at this time revealed mild elevation of the optic nerves. Magnetic resonance imaging findings of the orbits were normal. At presentation 3 months after onset of decreased vision, the patient reported that his vision continued to worsen. Best corrected visual acuity was measured at 20/400 OD and 20/40 OS. Both optic nerves were found to be mildly hyperemic with a few telangiectatic vessels on the left and trace temporal pallor on the right. Color vision was 3/13 in the right eye and normal in the left. There was no relative afferent pupillary defect. The patient’s 24-2 Humphrey visual field in the right eye is shown in the Figure. The left eye had a very similar pattern.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Leber hereditary optic neuropathy,"1. **Optic Neuritis**: Considered due to the presence of decreased vision and mild elevation of the optic nerves.

2. **Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)**: Suspected due to the characteristic cecocentral visual field defect, central vision loss, and the age of onset typically around the patient's age.

3. **Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (AION)**: The age and mild pallor alongside vision loss might point towards ischemic changes.

4. **Dominant Optic Atrophy**: Trace temporal pallor and chronic progressive vision loss could suggest a genetic optic neuropathy.

5. **Nutritional Optic Neuropathy**: Considered due to the potential for nutritional deficiencies to cause gradual vision loss.

6. **Toxic Optic Neuropathy**: History of exposure to certain toxins could result in progressive vision loss similar to this presentation.

7. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**: While MRI of the orbits was normal, MS can sometimes manifest with optic neuropathy; however, other neurological signs are typically present.

8. **Sarcoidosis**: Sarcoidosis can cause optic nerve involvement, and could be possible if systemic signs or histological confirmation is present.

9. **Syphilitic Optic Neuropathy**: Syphilis can cause unusual optic neuropathies and may present similarly, especially if systemic signs are overlooked.

10. **Glaucoma**: Though atypical in presentation, glaucoma can cause optic neuropathy with visual field loss, but usually associated with intraocular pressure changes.

**Reranked Differential Diagnosis:**

1. **Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)**: Characteristic visual field loss, age, and gender place LHON high on the list.
2. **Dominant Optic Atrophy**: Family history and pallor align with this diagnosis.
3. **Nutritional Optic Neuropathy**: Less likely without specific dietary history or deficiency signs, but still possible.
4. **Toxic Optic Neuropathy**: Likely if there is confirmatory history of exposure.
5. **Optic Neuritis**: Common but would expect inflammation in imaging.
6. **Sarcoidosis**: Unlikely without systemic manifestations.
7. **Eye Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (AION)**: Mild pallor could hint here, but demographics are less suggestive.
8. **Syphilitic Optic Neuropathy**: Requires serological testing for confirmation.
9. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**: Unlikely due to lack of central nervous system lesions on MRI.
10. **Glaucoma**: Considering optic nerve appearance and intraocular pressure are not typical for glaucoma.

### INPUT:
A 44-year-old African American man without traditional atherosclerotic risk factors or known coronary artery disease (CAD) presented to the emergency department with chest pain. He had 3 previous children (2 live births and 1 spontaneous abortion); his last child was born more than 5 years ago. His chest pain began spontaneously 1 hour prior to presentation and was described as retrosternal with radiation to his upper and middle back. On physical examination, his blood pressure was 128/88 mm Hg, his pulse was regular at 96 beats per minute, his respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute, and his temperature was 36.9° C. Pulse oximetry was 100% in room air. The chest was nontender. Pertinent physical findings included normal central venous pressures, clear lung fields, normal first and second heart sounds, an audible fourth heart sound, and no murmurs. The electrocardiogram (Figure 1A) demonstrated anterior ST-segment elevations consistent with an anterior acute current of injury. Results from the chest radiography were normal. Initial troponin I concentration was 0.02 ng/mL but rose to 177.76 ng/mL over the ensuing 4 hours (the patient’s chest pain had resolved by this time). Urgent coronary angiography was performed (Figure 1B). Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow grade 2 was observed in the left anterior descending artery and second diagonal branch.

### INPUT:
A child younger than 10 years presented with an 8-week history of bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy unresponsive to a 10-day course of Augmentin (GlaxoSmithKline). The patient’s parents denied any associated fevers, chills, night sweats, sore throat, abdominal pain, or weight changes. Medical history was noncontributory. Physical examination showed bilateral, mobile, nontender cervical lymphadenopathy without erythema or swelling. Tonsils were symmetric and not enlarged. There was no noticeable thyromegaly or nodules. Laboratory testing was significant for an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (37 mmol/h). Ultrasonography demonstrated cervical lymphadenopathy bilaterally with the largest node measuring 3.8 cm in maximum dimension. Lymph node needle core biopsy demonstrated increased histiocytes and numerous plasma cells on tissue section (Figure, A). Scattered neutrophils and rare giant cells were also present. Findings of Grocott methenamine silver, acid-fast, and Warthin-Starry stains were negative. The CD-68 immunostain showed numerous histiocytes. The specimen stained positive for CD-30 and S-100 immunostains showing emperipolesis (Figure, B and C). Findings of a CD1a stain were negative. Lymphoid markers by flow cytometry showed a polyclonal mixed B-cell and T-cell population.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Rosai-Dorfman disease,"1. **Kikuchi-Fujimoto Disease (Histiocytic Necrotizing Lymphadenitis)**  
   The presentation of cervical lymphadenopathy in a child, along with histiocytic infiltrates demonstrated in the biopsy, fits the clinical picture of Kikuchi disease, particularly given the absence of infectious agents and the negative stains.

2. **Rosai-Dorfman Disease (Sinus Histiocytosis with Massive Lymphadenopathy)**  
   Given the positive S-100 and CD-68, alongside the presence of emperipolesis and plasma cells, Rosai-Dorfman disease remains a strong contender as it typically presents with these findings histologically.

3. **Reactive Lymphoid Hyperplasia**  
   The presence of a polyclonal B-cell and T-cell population along with histiocytes and plasma cells can suggest a reactive process. Though non-specific, this diagnosis should still be considered where infection or autoimmune conditions may stimulate lymphadenopathy.

4. **Castleman Disease (Unicentric)**  
   While typically presenting with more systemic symptoms, unicentric Castleman’s disease can cause localized lymphadenopathy with polyclonal lymphoid proliferation.

5. **Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome (ALPS)**  
   ALPS may present as lymphadenopathy with expanded mixed lymphoid populations. However, more definitive laboratory findings would be expected for confirmation.

6. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis**  
   Though the CD1a stain is negative, and it is less likely given the immunostaining pattern, it is still an important differential to consider given the histiocytic involvement.

7. **Toxoplasmosis**  
   Toxoplasmosis can cause cervical lymphadenopathy and reactive lymphoid hyperplasia. However, the lack of symptomatic presentation or positive serological testing makes this less likely.

8. **Cat Scratch Disease**  
   Cat scratch disease often presents with cervical lymphadenopathy, but the negative Warthin-Starry stains and absence of a history of cat exposure make this less plausible.

9. **Tuberculosis Lymphadenitis**  
   Negative acid-fast stains do not completely rule out tuberculosis, but make it improbable, especially without constitutional symptoms typically seen in tuberculosis in children.

10. **Hodgkin Lymphoma**  
   Despite the CD30 positivity raising suspicions, the polyclonal lymphoid population and presence of numerous histiocytes rather than Reed-Sternberg cells make Hodgkin lymphoma unlikely.

### Final Ranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Rosai-Dorfman Disease** – Strong evidence with positive S-100, CD-68, and emperipolesis.
2. **Kikuchi-Fujimoto Disease** – Fits clinical and histological profile especially in the absence of bacterial/fungal elements.
3. **Reactive Lymphoid Hyperplasia** – Non-specific but fits the presented polyclonal lymphoid population.
4. **Castleman Disease (Unicentric)** – Possible cause of localized lymphadenopathy and histological findings.
5. **Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome (ALPS)** – Consider with additional symptoms and testing confirmation.
6. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis** – Possible but unlikely without CD1a positivity.
7. **Toxoplasmosis** – Considered with corresponding serological evidence.
8. **Cat Scratch Disease** – Low probability due to lack of supporting evidence.
9. **Tuberculosis Lymphadenitis** – Less likely due to negative smear results.
10. **Hodgkin Lymphoma** – Considered least likely due to histological discrepancies.","['Pediatrics', 'Otolaryngology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,-1.0,U

A woman in her 30s presented with a slow-growing mass in the upper lip that had developed over several years. She had no history of underlying medical diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, hepatitis, and tuberculosis. On physical examination, a whitish, firm, painless, nodular mass on the superficial layer of the left upper lip was observed (Figure, A). Given the possibility of a tumorous lesion, complete excision was planned under local anesthesia. In surgery, the 1.5 × 1.2 cm, whitish, firm, nodular, and well-encapsulated mass was excised completely without rupture of the capsule from the surrounding mucosa. On histopathologic examination, an encapsulated salivary gland tumor with epithelial and myoepithelial cells, ductlike structures, and mixed stroma was observed (Figure, B). One month after surgery, the surgical wound on the left upper lip was clean and well healed. One year later, there had been no recurrence, and the patient had no symptoms at the left upper lip.

1. Pleomorphic Adenoma - Based on the histopathological findings of epithelial and myoepithelial cells with mixed stroma, the encapsulated nature of the tumor, and the typical presentation as a slow-growing mass, this is the most likely diagnosis.
2. Canalicular Adenoma - Considered due to its occurrence in the upper lip and the firm, nodular presentation, but less common than pleomorphic adenoma.
3. Basal Cell Adenoma - Another salivary gland tumor that could mimic these features but less common in this location.
4. Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma - Though possible, the benign encapsulated appearance doesn’t align with typical presentations.
5. Polymorphous Low-Grade Adenocarcinoma - Usually presents similarly but more likely in the palate than the lip.
6. Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma - Inconsistent with the encapsulated nature and benign histopathology.
7. Warthin’s Tumor - Typically occurs in the parotid gland, making it less likely.
8. Fibroma - While it could present as a firm, nodular mass, the histopathology does not support this diagnosis.
9. Lipoma - Unlikely given the firm consistency and histopathological features.

### INPUT:
A woman in her late 20s presented with mildly itchy, erythematous plaques of 3 months’ duration on both legs. The lesions started to appear on the left pretibial region as small papules, which gradually increased in size and coalesced to form bigger plaques. No history of local trauma, prolonged standing, and occupational exposure to mineral dust or recent drug intake was recollected. She was not diabetic. On examination, large, ill-defined, erythematous plaques were present on the pretibial areas extending onto the lateral aspect of both legs. The plaques were surmounted by multiple, discrete atrophic scars. The periphery of the plaques showed increased vascularity in the form of telangiectasias and venous prominences, along with atrophy of the overlying skin (Figure, A). There were no lesions elsewhere on the body. A skin biopsy sample was obtained from the plaque and sent for histopathological examination (Figure, B and C).

3. **Lichen Planus** - Presents as pruritic, purple, polygonal papules, often with a reticular white pattern on the mucosae.

4. **Sarcoidosis** - Non-caseating granulomas can present as papules or plaques, often on the face or upper body but can affect the legs.

5. **Sweet's Syndrome** - Presents with sudden onset of painful, erythematous plaques and nodules, often accompanied by fever and leukocytosis.

6. **Erythema Nodosum** - Painful, erythematous nodules mainly on the extensor surfaces often associated with systemic conditions.

7. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides)** - Early lesions can mimic eczema or psoriasis with plaques typically affecting sun-protected areas.

8. **Venous Stasis Dermatitis** - Caused by chronic venous insufficiency, presents with hyperpigmented plaques and hemosiderin deposition.

9. **Psoriasis** - Presents as erythematous plaques with silvery scales, typically on the elbows, knees, and scalp.

10. **Lupus Vulgaris** - Tuberculous infection presenting as slowly extending, reddish-brown plaques, often on the face.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica** - Given the classic location, appearance, and skin atrophy.
2. **Granuloma Annulare** - Due to the annular plaques, albeit less likely given the leg location.
3. **Sarcoidosis** - Given possible presentation with skin plaques.
4. **Lichen Planus** - Considered for its classic papular presentation, but less likely due to atypical location and lack of classic mucosal involvement.
5. **Sweet's Syndrome** - Unlikely due to lack of systemic symptoms like fever.
6. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides)** - Not typical due to location, but still considered.
7. **Erythema Nodosum** - Less likely due to presentation and chronicity.
8. **Venous Stasis Dermatitis** - Less likely given patient's age and absence of venous insufficiency signs.
9. **Psoriasis** - Less likely due to absence of scaling and classical locations.
10. **Lupus Vulgaris** - Unlikely given the clinical presentation not matching typical tuberculosis infections.","['Dermatology', 'Clinical Challenge']",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,29.0,M

### INPUT:
A Korean American man in his early 60s was referred for evaluation of bilateral acute-angle closure and retinal detachments. He had emmetropia, and his ocular and medical history were unremarkable. Over the preceding few days, he noticed worsening blurry vision with redness in both eyes associated with headaches, nausea, and severe tinnitus. On presentation, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/200 OD and 20/400 OS. Intraocular pressure was 45 mm Hg OU. Pupils were 4 mm and minimally reactive. There was 1+ conjunctival injection, diffuse corneal edema with Descemet folds, and the anterior chamber was shallow in both eyes. After the administration of multiple rounds of topical and oral medications, his intraocular pressure improved to 18 mm Hg OD and 19 mm Hg OS. A dilated fundus examination revealed tilted discs, serous retinal detachments, and multiple yellow, depigmented chorioretinal spots throughout the posterior pole in both eyes. B-scan ultrasonography showed shallow retinal detachments, choroidal thickening, and extensive, shallow choroidal detachments extending anteriorly in both eyes (Figure 1A). A-scan ultrasonography showed normal axial length of 22 mm OU. Optical coherence tomography indicated subretinal fluid and enhanced depth imaging demonstrated significant choroidal thickening in both eyes (Figure 1B). Fluorescein angiography revealed pinpoint hyperfluorescence with leakage. Indocyanine green angiography showed diffuse leakage throughout the posterior pole in both eyes.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease,"1. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease**  
   - The combination of bilateral serous retinal detachments, choroidal thickening, and the presence of multiple yellow, depigmented chorioretinal spots, along with inflammatory signs and symptoms, points towards Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease.

2. **Posterior Scleritis**  
   - This condition may present with ocular pain, choroidal thickening, and serous retinal detachments, although the lack of significant pain and systemic symptoms makes this less likely.

3. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy**  
   - Typically presents with localized serous retinal detachments and choroidal thickening, but is often unilateral and less severe.

4. **Idiopathic Uveal Effusion Syndrome**  
   - Characterized by choroidal thickening and serous retinal detachment; however, it's usually unilateral and lacks systemic symptoms.

5. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (Lupus Choroidopathy)**  
   - Can cause choroidopathy with similar findings due to vasculitis, but typically associated with more multisystem involvement.

6. **Sympathetic Ophthalmia**  
   - Bilateral granulomatous uveitis after ocular trauma or surgery, presenting similarly with choroidal involvement but with a history of relevant trauma or surgery that is lacking here.

7. **Hypertensive Choroidopathy**  
   - Can cause retinal detachments and choroidal changes, but usually in the context of severe, uncontrolled hypertension.

8. **Uveal Effusion Syndrome**  
   - Presents with effusion and thickening of the uveal tract and retina, but less common without predisposing ocular conditions or systemic associations.

9. **Choroidal Metastasis**  
   - Can present with choroidal thickening and retina changes, though typically focal and associated with a history of cancer.

10. **Sarcoidosis**  
   - Can have ocular involvement with retina and choroidal changes, but would often present with more granulomatous inflammation and systemic signs.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease**  
   - Most fitting based on the combination of ocular symptoms and imaging findings with systemic inflammatory features. 

2. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (Lupus Choroidopathy)**  
   - Possibility given the choroidal involvement, though requires additional systemic correlation.

3. **Posterior Scleritis**  
   - Considered due to the choroidal thickening and retinal detachment, but lacks typical pain.

4. **Sympathetic Ophthalmia**  
   - Less likely due to lack of prior trauma, but still a potential consideration.

5. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy**  
   - Presentation aligns modestly with choroidal and retinal detachments.

6. **Idiopathic Uveal Effusion Syndrome**  
   - Possible due to choroidal thickening, but not usually bilateral or without systemic association.

7. **Uveal Effusion Syndrome**  
   - Needs consideration due to choroidal thickening, though the presentation is atypical for this condition.

8. **Hypertensive Choroidopathy**  
   - Less likely given the typical patient history and additional systemic assessment is needed to confirm hypertension.

9. **Choroidal Metastasis**  
   - Requires prior cancer history, less likely without focal lesions.

10. **Sarcoidosis**  
   - Requires more systemic signs and specific tests confirming granulomatous disease.","['Ophthalmology', 'Retinal Disorders']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,60.0,F

### INPUT:
An African American man in his 30s with metastatic soft tissue sarcoma of the right lower extremity, with a medical history of above-knee right leg amputation, received treatment with nivolumab (an anti–programmed cell death 1 [anti–PD-1] antibody) with an initial good tolerance. His medical history was negative for any skin cancers. After 2 months of treatment, the patient presented with diffuse hyperpigmented macules. This was thought to be related to his chronic atopic dermatitis and he was prescribed topical steroids and moisturizing. Four months later the patient presented with diffuse macular cutaneous eruption and pruritus. A skin punch biopsy of the back revealed mild epidermal acanthosis, focal parakeratosis, and interface dermatitis with numerous dyskeratotic cells and underlying lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate with scattered dermal melanophages. Oral steroids were prescribed and 3 weeks later the rash had resolved; however, the patient developed numerous hypopigmented macules and patches, covering more than 30% of his body surface area (Figure, A) compared with the prior skin examination (Figure, B). A new biopsy showed epithelial basal vacuolar changes, underlying lichenoid lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with scattered eosinophils and interface dermatitis with marked pigment incontinence and a reduced number of junctional melanocytes (Figure, C).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Vitiligo,"1. **Vitiligo**: The presentation of hypopigmented macules and reduced junctional melanocytes could be suggestive of vitiligo, especially considering the potential autoimmune side effects of nivolumab.

2. **Lichen Planus**: The lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate and interface dermatitis could suggest lichen planus, particularly after nivolumab treatment.

3. **Post-inflammatory Hypopigmentation**: The hypopigmented macules following a resolved rash might be due to post-inflammatory hypopigmentation.

4. **Drug-induced Hypopigmentation**: Although less common, nivolumab could potentially induce hypopigmentation as an adverse effect.

5. **Pityriasis Alba**: Considered for the hypopigmented patches, typically seen in patients with atopic dermatitis.

6. **Sarcoidosis**: Unlikely but could present with skin changes, although more so with papules or nodules.

7. **Chronic Graft-vs-Host Disease**: Unlikely in this patient without a history of transplantation, but can be considered due to similar dermal changes.

8. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus**: Interface dermatitis with basal vacuolar changes is a feature; however, hypopigmentation is not typical.

9. **Mycosis Fungoides**: Generally presents differently but could consider given persistent rash and histological changes.

10. **Hypopigmented Mycosis Fungoides**: Usually in childhood or adolescence but possible in adults as a differential for hypopigmented skin lesions.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Vitiligo**: Most consistent with presentation and known side effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors like nivolumab.

2. **Drug-induced Hypopigmentation**: Direct link with treatment and timing of presentation.

3. **Lichen Planus**: Histological findings support, but less likely for extensive hypopigmentation.

4. **Post-inflammatory Hypopigmentation**: Secondary to previous dermatitis and skin inflammation.

5. **Pityriasis Alba**: Possible, especially given the history of atopic dermatitis.

6. **Chronic Graft-vs-Host Disease**: Very unlikely without history of transplantation, but skin manifestation matches.

7. **Mycosis Fungoides**: Histology not very supportive but cannot completely rule out.

8. **Sarcoidosis**: Unlikely due to lack of suitable systemic findings.

9. **Hypopigmented Mycosis Fungoides**: More common in a younger age demographic, but pigmentation changes could fit.

10. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus**: Lacks additional systemic symptoms for confirmation.","['Dermatology', 'Oncology', 'Vitiligo', 'Targeted and Immune Therapy']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,30.0,F

A woman in her mid-20s with no significant medical history presented with 18 months of progressive dyspnea, abdominal distention, and lower extremity edema. A chest radiograph showed significant cardiomegaly. A transthoracic echocardiogram (Figure 1) revealed a mildly dilated, hypertrophied right ventricle (RV) with normal function and significant right atrial (RA) enlargement (107 cm2). The tricuspid annulus was dilated (48 mm) with severe tricuspid regurgitation. There were no significant abnormalities of the left ventricle, left atrium, or pulmonic, mitral, and aortic valves. Invasive hemodynamic measures showed elevated RA pressure (14 mm Hg), but normal pulmonary artery pressure (16/11 mm Hg) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (7 mm Hg). Cardiac index calculated by the Fick method was 2.46 L/min/m2. Aggressive diuresis was initiated.

### INPUT:
A previously healthy 61-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 4-week history of severe weakness and difficulty ambulating independently. She had difficulty rising from a seated position. Additional symptoms included progressive numbness and tingling of the hands and feet. Her family also reported progressive memory impairment during this period. An extensive review of systems was otherwise unremarkable, except for a few months of intermittent nausea, increased abdominal bloating, and anorexia. Physical examination revealed normal vital signs, normal cardiopulmonary findings, atrophy in the calf muscles bilaterally, 4 of 5 symmetric strength in the upper and lower extremity extensor muscles, and an unsteady shuffling gait. She had decreased vibration and proprioception in both lower extremities, with hyperreflexia and a positive Babinski reflex on the left side. Mental status examination revealed delayed recall of 1 of 4 words. Complete blood cell count revealed a white blood cell count of 4.7 × 103/μL; hemoglobin level, 10.9 g/dL; hematocrit, 31.8%; and platelet count, 202 × 103/μL. Mean corpuscular volume was 119 fL. Results of renal function and liver function tests were normal. Because of the asymmetric hyperreflexia and concern for a spinal cord lesion, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine was performed (Figure 1).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Vitamin B12 deficiency,"1. Vitamin B12 Deficiency: Given the macrocytic anemia (MCV of 119 fL), neurologic symptoms such as cognitive decline, numbness, and tingling, and atrophic calf muscles, a deficiency in vitamin B12 is a leading consideration.

2. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS): The combination of muscle weakness, atrophy, and hyperreflexia suggests a possibility of a motor neuron disease such as ALS, although the cognitive symptoms are less typical.

3. Primary Lateral Sclerosis: Hyperreflexia, weakness, and abnormal gait could suggest a motor neuron disorder like primary lateral sclerosis, characterized by upper motor neuron involvement.

4. Multiple Sclerosis: The presence of hyperreflexia, a positive Babinski reflex, and mixed sensory symptoms could be indicative of demyelinating disorders, although the age of onset and cognitive symptoms are atypical.

5. Subacute Combined Degeneration: Considering macrocytic anemia and neurological deficits, subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord due to B12 deficiency could cause both peripheral and central nervous system symptoms.

6. Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy: Asymmetric hyperreflexia and gait disturbances could stem from cervical spinal cord compression, although other symptoms do not match as closely.

7. Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP): The progressive weakness and sensory symptoms with hyperreflexia could also fit with CIDP, a type of autoimmune neuropathy.

8. Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH): The symptoms of gait disturbance, cognitive impairment, and urinary symptoms can suggest NPH, although not all criteria fit well.

9. Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD): Progressive memory impairment over months could indicate a primary neurodegenerative condition like FTD, especially with accompanying atrophy.

10. Paraneoplastic Neuropathy: Considering her age and nonspecific constitutional symptoms, an underlying malignancy causing a paraneoplastic syndrome might fit the diffuse neurological presentation.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. Vitamin B12 Deficiency/Subacute Combined Degeneration: Given both macrocytic anemia and the specific neurologic symptoms align perfectly.
2. Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP): Progressive weakness with hyperreflexia indicate autoimmune neuropathy.
3. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS): While less cognitive impairment is typical, it can start with varied presentations.
4. Primary Lateral Sclerosis: Upper motor neuron signs are fitting, though cognitive decline is atypical.
5. Paraneoplastic Neuropathy: Given age and systemic symptoms, this remains a consideration.
6. Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH): Gait issues with cognitive symptoms fit, but further signs needed.
7. Frontotemporal Dementia: Cognitive impairment is fitting, but motor symptoms need more evidence.
8. Multiple Sclerosis: Demyelination remains a distant possibility given age and presentation.
9. Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy: Less likely without definitive MRI findings.
10. Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD): Memory and cognitive changes suggest a possibility with less emphasis on motor findings.","['Neurology', 'Neuroimaging', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine', 'Hematology', 'Dementia and Cognitive Impairment']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,61.0,M

### INPUT:
An elderly woman presented to the emergency department describing unremitting pain in the left iliac fossa with accompanying tenderness, fever, and tachypnea. She also noted swelling in her left inguinofemoral region, left scrotum, and left femur. Her symptoms started 2 days before admission and the pain was progressively worsening. The patient did not report vomiting, constipation, or change in her bowel habits. Her history was significant for hypertension and hypothyroidism; her last colonoscopy, 4 years ago, revealed diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon. The patient’s condition was stable (blood pressure, 130/85 mm Hg, heart rate, 88 beats/min), but she was febrile (temperature, 38.6°C). Physical examination showed cellulitis in her left inguinal canal, scrotum, and femur along with sensitivity in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. Initial laboratory test findings exhibited white blood cell count of 16 700/μL (to convert to 109/L, multiply by 0.001) and C-reactive protein of 340 mg/L (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 9.524). Chest roentgenogram was negative for free air under the diaphragm but was remarkable for some air-fluid levels. The patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with oral contrast (diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium solution) (Figure, A and B).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Complicated diverticulitis,"1. **Diverticulitis**: Given the history of diverticulosis and presenting symptoms of left iliac fossa pain, fever, and elevated inflammatory markers, diverticulitis is a strong initial consideration.

2. **Inguinal Hernia with Strangulation**: The presence of swelling in the left inguinofemoral region and inguinal canal tenderness could suggest an incarcerated or strangulated inguinal hernia.

3. **Colonic Abscess**: The fever, leukocytosis, and elevated CRP levels in the context of previous diverticulosis may indicate a colonic abscess, particularly in the sigmoid region.

4. **Ovarian Torsion or Abscess**: Although less likely due to the patient's age, the symptoms could be consistent with an acute gynecologic issue such as an ovarian torsion or abscess.

5. **Pyelonephritis**: Left flank pain and fever could also suggest a renal source of infection, despite the lack of urinary symptoms.

6. **Cellulitis or Soft Tissue Infection**: There is evidence of cellulitis in the inguinal and femoral areas, which could originate from a soft tissue infection or skin source.

7. **Septic Arthritis or Osteomyelitis of Hip/Femur**: The left femoral swelling might indicate an underlying joint or bone infection.

8. **Psoas Abscess**: An infection of the psoas muscle could present as abdominal and inguinal pain along with fever and leukocytosis.

9. **Intestinal Obstruction**: The air-fluid levels on the chest roentgenogram could suggest an intestinal obstruction, even though the patient did not report changes in bowel habits.

10. **Ischemic Colitis**: The acute onset of pain and localized abdominal tenderness could stem from vascular compromise of the colonic wall, particularly in someone with prior colonic issues.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Diverticulitis**
2. **Colonic Abscess**
3. **Inguinal Hernia with Strangulation**
4. **Cellulitis or Soft Tissue Infection**

### INPUT:
A 12-month-old healthy girl was seen at the outpatient ophthalmology clinic with gradually worsening bilateral temporal facial swelling and proptosis that developed in the setting of a recent bilateral ear infection 10 days prior. She was currently being treated with oral amoxicillin. Her mother reported a recent decrease in appetite, decreased feeding, increased irritability, and near-constant crying. On examination, she was inconsolable and crying. Her pulse rate was 112 beats/min, blood pressure was 122/68 mm Hg, and temperature was 38.7°C. She had soft, bitemporal facial masses (Figure, A). She was proptotic and demonstrated a substantial change in her ocular appearance compared with photographs taken 4 weeks earlier that her mother brought for our review. She appeared to be orthophoric in primary gaze but had bilateral abduction deficits. Her pupils were round and reactive, without an afferent pupillary defect. Her anterior and posterior segment examination results were normal, without evidence of optic nerve edema or pallor. Her pediatrician had obtained a complete blood cell count and head radiograph 10 days prior that were both normal.
### OUTPUT:
    ",Metastatic neuroblastoma,"1. **Orbital Cellulitis** - Given the recent ear infection and bilateral proptosis, an infection spreading to the orbits is a possible cause.

2. **Neuroblastoma** - This can present as swelling around the eyes (periorbital ecchymosis) and proptosis, along with irritability and fever.

3. **Rhabdomyosarcoma** - A common soft tissue sarcoma in children that can present with proptosis and facial masses.

4. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis** - May cause bony lesions leading to facial swelling and orbital involvement, along with systemic symptoms.

5. **Leukemia** - Can present with proptosis due to leukemic infiltration and other non-specific symptoms like irritability and fever.

6. **Thyroid Eye Disease** - Although rare in infants, can cause proptosis and changes in ocular appearance.

7. **Sinusitis with Orbital Complications** - Could cause both facial swelling and proptosis secondary to infection spread.

8. **Metastatic Neuroblastoma** - Known for metastasis to the orbital bones leading to proptosis and facial swelling, especially in a child.

9. **Retinoblastoma with Orbital Involvement** - Although retinoblastoma typically affects vision first, with extensive orbital involvement, it can present with proptosis.

10. **Congenital Eye Disorder** - Developmental anomalies affecting the orbit, though typically congenital and not likely worsening at this age without prior history.

### Reranking using all patient information and test results:

1. **Neuroblastoma** - Given the age, systemic symptoms, and facial swelling with proptosis, neuroblastoma is strongly considered. 
2. **Rhabdomyosarcoma** - The presentation of facial masses and proptosis still places this as a strong differential.
3. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis** - Systemic manifestations and bony involvement align with the presented symptoms.
4. **Leukemia** - Though a normal CBC previously, rapid progression and systemic symptoms keep this high in consideration.
5. **Metastatic Neuroblastoma** - Consistent with orbital metastasis, still a strong contender given systemic symptoms.
6. **Orbital Cellulitis** - Less likely due to bilateral presentation but possible with simultaneous bilateral ear infections.
7. **Sinusitis with Orbital Complications** - Infectious etiology considered but less likely due to systemic symptoms outweighing typical sinus involvement.
8. **Thyroid Eye Disease** - Less likely but considered for differential rule-out despite age rarity.
9. **Retinoblastoma with Orbital Involvement** - Low likelihood but considered due to significant orbital changes.
10. **Congenital Eye Disorder** - Least likely given age of onset and progressive nature without prior history.","['Ophthalmology', 'Orbit', 'Pediatrics', 'Pediatric Cancer', 'Oncology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1.0,M

### INPUT:
A middle-aged white man presented to the ophthalmology clinic for a third opinion. The patient had been experiencing redness, tearing, and foreign-body sensation in both eyes for 7 months. He was diagnosed with giant papillary conjunctivitis and follicular conjunctivitis by ophthalmologists at other institutions and was treated with topical corticosteroids and oral doxycycline. Topical corticosteroid eyedrops (0.5% loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension) seemed to control his symptoms, but attempts to wean the medication resulted in recurrence. He denied any significant ocular history. His medical history included hypothyroidism and breast cancer in the setting of Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic disorder with a predisposition to various cancers, including carcinoma of the colon, breast, and uterus. At the time of examination, visual acuity was 20/25 OU. Pupil anatomy, intraocular pressure, confrontation visual fields, and extraocular movements were within normal limits. Slitlamp examination revealed mild meibomian gland dysfunction bilaterally, and follicular conjunctivitis was evident on eversion of all 4 eyelids. The bulbar conjunctiva demonstrated hyperemia and elevation medially (Figure 1). The remainder of the examination, including dilated funduscopic examination, was within normal limits.

A 46-year-old woman with salivary duct carcinoma of the right parotid gland presented for evaluation of a 3-week history of multiple new pruritic skin lesions on the right chest. The patient’s salivary duct carcinoma was androgen receptor positive and HER2 positive. She had previously undergone parotidectomy followed by radiation therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and trastuzumab. She had continued with androgen-deprivation therapy and palliative radiation therapy for osseous metastases. The patient endorsed erythematous skin changes within the field of radiation and a 2-month history of painful right upper extremity lymphedema that began after her most recent radiation treatment. She denied fevers or other systemic symptoms associated with the onset of the skin lesions. Physical examination revealed numerous nontender, firm, pebblelike, pink papules on the right anterior neck, upper chest, and back, arising on a background of confluent blanchable violaceous erythema (Figure, A), as well as similar-appearing lesions on the right chest wall on a background of normal-appearing skin. Concurrent skin biopsies from the right chest wall, clavicular area, and upper right back were performed (Figure, B and C).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cutaneous metastasis,"1. **Radiation Dermatitis**  
   Consideration given the patient’s history of radiation therapy and the presence of erythematous skin changes within the radiation field.

2. **Lymphedema-related Dermatoses**  
   Due to her recent onset of painful lymphedema noted in the right upper extremity following radiation.

3. **Metastatic Carcinoma to the Skin**  
   Possible given her history of salivary duct carcinoma which can metastasize dermally, particularly with the pebble-like texture of skin lesions.

4. **Contact Dermatitis**  
   As a result of potential exposure to new substances or allergens given the localized nature and pruritic characteristic of the lesions.

5. **Herpes Zoster (Shingles)**  
   Considering a possibility due to the unilateral distribution, despite the absence of significant pain or systemic symptoms.

6. **Erysipelas**  
   Entered as a differential due to erythematous skin changes but less likely without accompanying systemic symptoms like fever.

7. **Lichen Planus**  
   Considered due to the violaceous hue and the pruritic nature of the skin lesions; however, it's less likely given her medical history.

8. **Erythema Multiforme**  
   Less likely but entered due to the presence of erythematous nodules and patches, though it is uncommon without a trigger.

9. **Paget's Disease of the Nipple**  
   Highly unlikely, but considered due to the gender and age group, despite the distribution not starting from the nipple area.

10. **Necrotizing Fasciitis**  
    Extremely unlikely without systemic symptoms or progressive, acute cutaneous changes, but considered due to the need for exclusion in rapidly changing skin lesions.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Metastatic Carcinoma to the Skin**  
   Given her history and the characteristic presentation of the lesions.

2. **Radiation Dermatitis**  
   Due to her recent history of radiation and local erythema within typical radiation field boundaries.

3. **Lymphedema-related Dermatoses**  
   In consideration of symptoms localized to lymphedematous areas, with painful presentation.

4. **Contact Dermatitis**  
   Due to pruritic nature and absence of systemic symptoms which might indicate an alllergic reaction.

5. **Herpes Zoster (Shingles)**  
   Less likely due to lack of pain and systemic features, but not completely ruled out.

6. **Lichen Planus**  
   Considerable based on appearance, though unlikely primary diagnosis without further classic signs.

7. **Erysipelas**  
   Possible but lower likelihood without systemic inflammatory signs or rapid progression.

8. **Erythema Multiforme**  
   Least likely under current circumstances due to absence of typical target lesions or recent infection/medication history.

9. **Paget’s Disease of the Nipple**  
   Extremely unlikely given the generalized presentation of skin lesions and no involvement of the nipple area.

10. **Necrotizing Fasciitis**  
    Unlikely due to chronicity and lack of acute signs, included for thoroughness in serious skin conditions.","['Dermatology', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Oncology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Salivary Gland Disorders']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,46.0,M

### INPUT:
A woman in her 30s with a medical history of asthma, social history of smoking, and allergy to shellfish presented to the emergency department with tongue swelling. The patient reported a history of a local burn from hot food but denied any history of trauma, foreign body, or piercing. She was evaluated, given a presumptive diagnosis of sialadenitis, and discharged home with ibuprofen and clindamycin. She returned several days later with worsening tongue swelling, voice change, and subjective fever. Postcontrast axial computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a midline lesion within the oral tongue that was predominantly hypodense and demonstrated rim enhancement. No calcifications were seen within the lesion (Figure, A). The lesion was predominantly isointense to muscle on axial T1-weighted images without intravenous (IV) contrast (Figure, B). Axial T2-weighted images with fat saturation showed predominantly hyperintense signal relative to muscle as well as punctate internal foci of T2 hypointensity (not shown). The lesion was hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging (Figure, C) and hypointense on the apparent diffusion coefficient map (not shown). Sagittal T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with IV contrast and fat suppression demonstrated signal hypointense to muscle centrally with peripheral enhancement (Figure, D).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Abscess,"1. Abscess: The presence of a predominantly hypodense lesion with rim enhancement on CT and hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted imaging is suggestive of an abscess.

2. Hemangioma: Given the imaging characteristics and the location in the tongue, this could represent a vascular lesion such as a hemangioma.

3. Lymphangioma: This could also represent a lymphatic malformation, like a lymphangioma, which can present with similar imaging findings.

4. Malignant tumor: A neoplasm such as squamous cell carcinoma should be considered due to the progressive symptoms and imaging characteristics.

5. Granulomatous disease: Condition like sarcoidosis could present with granulomatous changes that may mimic the imaging findings.

6. Neurofibroma: A benign nerve sheath tumor could present with these imaging features and location.

7. Epidermoid cyst: This type of cyst can present with the described imaging characteristics due to its composition.

8. Infectious phlegmon: In the context of the patient's recent history, an infectious process like a phlegmon could be considered.

9. Foreign body granuloma: Despite the absence of noted foreign body ingestion, this could mimic the present imaging findings.

10. Vascular malformation: Other types of vascular anomalies, apart from hemangioma, such as AVM, could be considered.

### INPUT:
A previously healthy 18-year-old college student presented to the emergency department with a 6-month history of fatigue, dry cough, dyspnea, and unintentional weight loss of 18 kg (from 100 to 82 kg). Four months ago, she was treated for presumed pneumonia with azithromycin without improvement. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use intravenous drugs. She was born in the United States and had not traveled outside of the country. She took no medications. On examination, her temperature was 37°C, heart rate 110/min, blood pressure 123/72 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 20/min. She had a palpable 2×2-cm firm, nontender, right supraclavicular lymph node and decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion in the right lower lung field. No hepatosplenomegaly or leg edema was noted. Routine laboratory tests, including complete blood cell counts, renal function, electrolytes, and hepatic function, were within normal limits. A chest x-ray demonstrated diffuse homogeneous opacification of the right lung field. Computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a 15 × 11-cm centrally necrotic mass in the right anterior mediastinum displacing the trachea to the left, a large right pleural effusion, and compression of the superior vena cava (Figure 1).
### OUTPUT:
    ",Hodgkin lymphoma,"1. **Hodgkin's Lymphoma**  
   Given the patient's age, symptoms of fatigue, unintentional weight loss, mediastinal mass, and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, Hodgkin's lymphoma is a potential differential diagnosis.

2. **Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma**  
   Similar to Hodgkin's, this is another type of lymphoma that could explain the large anterior mediastinal mass and systemic symptoms.

3. **Thymoma**  
   The presence of a large anterior mediastinal mass could also suggest thymoma, which is a tumor originating from the thymus.

4. **Germ Cell Tumor**  
   A mediastinal mass in a young adult is also suspicious for a germ cell tumor, particularly a seminoma or other non-seminomatous germ cell tumors.

5. **Primary Mediastinal (Thymic) Large B-Cell Lymphoma**  
   This is a subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, often presenting with large masses in the mediastinum in young adults.

6. **Lung Cancer**  
   Though less common in her demographic, particularly without smoking history, it's still a possibility, especially given the pleural effusion and mediastinal involvement.

7. **Sarcoidosis**  
   This granulomatous disease can cause mediastinal lymphadenopathy and pulmonary symptoms, although typically it presents with bilateral hilar adenopathy more commonly than unilateral masses.

8. **Tuberculosis**  
   TB can present with significant weight loss, fatigue, and pulmonary involvement, although more systemic symptoms or history might be expected. 

9. **Infectious Mononucleosis**  
   Associated lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms could suggest this, though the presence of a large mediastinal mass is unusual.

10. **Castleman Disease**  
   This rare lymphoproliferative disorder could potentially present with mediastinal mass and systemic symptoms, though it is less common.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Hodgkin's Lymphoma**  
2. **Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma**  
3. **Primary Mediastinal (Thymic) Large B-Cell Lymphoma**  
4. **Germ Cell Tumor**  
5. **Thymoma**  
6. **Lung Cancer**  
7. **Sarcoidosis**  
8. **Castleman Disease**  
9. **Tuberculosis**  
10. **Infectious Mononucleosis**

(Note: The diagnosis is refocused primarily on lymphoproliferative disorders due to the combination of the mediastinal mass, lymphadenopathy, and systemic symptoms. The diseases that rank higher are more consistent with the presentation of a young adult with these signs and symptoms.)","['Adolescent Medicine', 'Pediatrics', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Lymphomas', 'Hematology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,18.0,M
