The initial best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 4/20 (approximately 20/100), and an irregular superficial corneal ulcer with an epithelial defect size of 3 mm × 5 mm was found in the center of edematous cornea. She received penetrating keratoplasty 4 months later, as the ulcer did not heal with intensive medication. Then, topical tobramycin dexamethasone, topical tacrolimus, and daily oral prednisone, 40 mg, were prescribed, with a gradual taper of prednisone to a maintenance dose of 10 mg. At 5-month postoperative follow-up, some thin snowflakelike matter was found deposited on the iris and in the angle, with rare cell and mild flare in the anterior chamber. She was then diagnosed with uveitis and subsequently prescribed topical prednisone, subconjunctival triamcinolone acetonide, oral prednisone, 40 mg, and daily intravenous ganciclovir, 5 mg/kg. An aqueous sample was obtained for diagnostic polymerase chain reaction, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was detected with a DNA load of 3.12 × 107 cells. Nine months after the keratoplasty, when she presented to the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, her BCVA was 2/100 OD (approximately 20/1000 OD), and her intraocular pressure was 19 mm Hg.

There was no contributory medical history, recent trauma, or surgery. Visual acuity (VA) was 20/32 OD and 20/20 OS. Anterior-segment and fundus examination results were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits revealed a right retro-orbital hemorrhage. No etiology could be identified on the image. Systemic corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone, 1 mg/kg per day) was prescribed for 48 hours. The proptosis decreased, and the patient was discharged. After 6 months, complete ophthalmologic examination was performed again; VA was 20/20 OU, and there was no remaining proptosis. Two weeks later, the patient presented to the ED for another episode of acute, painless, right proptosis, and the VA had decreased to 20/40 OD. MRI showed a right retrobulbar hemorrhage. Systemic corticosteroid therapy was again prescribed for 48 hours with rapid resolution of the visual impairment but incomplete resolution of the proptosis. One month later, the patient presented to our ophthalmology department. The VA was 20/20 OU, with a persistent, mild, nonreducible, nonpulsatile proptosis unrelated to Valsalva maneuver but associated with extraocular movement limitation in upgaze.

Her symptoms began after relocation to California and occurred more frequently at her home. However, she could not discern any environmental or dietary triggers. She reported pruritus and swelling, which were usually moderate but occasionally severe, prompting several emergency department visits. During an emergency department visit, she was diagnosed with acute parotitis based on clinical and radiographic findings of diffuse gland edema, without salivary stones or masses. Her symptoms responded to oral prednisone bursts and diphenhydramine, but not to second-generation antihistamines or montelukast. Her workup included immune serology and total immunoglobulin (Ig) E measurements, all of which were within normal limits. A differential blood cell count revealed 10% eosinophils (normal, <6%) and an absolute eosinophil count 500/µL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). Titers for antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, anti-Ro (SS-A), and anti-La (SS-B) were negative. Sialendoscopy of her right parotid and left submandibular glands found no obstructing stones or strictures. Concurrent steroid irrigation did not provide any substantial benefit. An open biopsy of the right parotid tail revealed nonspecific inflammatory changes and otherwise normal parenchyma. Given the frequency and severity of her symptoms along with multiple treatment failures, she opted to undergo a right superficial parotidectomy, which proceeded without complications.

There was no recent ocular trauma or intraocular surgery. At the time of the initial examination, visual acuity was 20/50 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye, with a refraction of −1.50 diopters (D) sphere in both eyes. Examination was notable for a superonasal area of pigmentation with elevation of the conjunctiva and an inferotemporally subluxed PCIOL in the right eye. Results of the fundus examination were reported to be normal in both eyes and the anterior examination of the left eye was notable for only a well-positioned PCIOL. The patient was referred to a cornea specialist for further evaluation and treatment. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, specialty evaluation occurred 10 weeks later at which time the patient complained of progressive vision loss in the right eye.

Vision was 20/250 OD and 20/60 OS. The anterior segment was unremarkable in either eye, while the posterior segment examination noted 1+ vitreous cell, asteroid hyalosis, and a multilobulated, serous retinal detachment (RD) in the right eye and trace vitreous cell and a multilobulated, serous RD in the left eye. Imaging included B-scan, optical coherence tomography, and fundus autofluorescence, which revealed diffuse choroidal and ciliary body thickening, multifocal pockets of subretinal fluid, and speckled hyperautofluorescence and hypoautofluorescence in both eyes (Figure 1). No poliosis or skin changes were noted. A review of systems was unremarkable, most notably a lack of any pulmonary symptoms. A focused laboratory evaluation identified a significantly elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level and antinuclear antibody titer, but serum lysozyme, syphilis, and tuberculosis testing had negative results. To better differentiate between Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome, a lymphoproliferative disorder, or sarcoidosis as the underlying cause of the vitreous inflammation and multilobulated, serous RD in both eyes, a computed tomographic scan was performed. It showed marked lymphadenopathy throughout the mediastinum and diffuse scleral thickening in both eyes. The institute’s radiologists believed these computed tomography findings were nonspecific and could be indicative of either sarcoidosis or intraocular lymphoma. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Biopsy-proven, Harada-like ocular sarcoidosis in both eyes", "predict": " Step 1: Sarcoidosis\n     Step 2: Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome\n     Step 3: Intraocular lymphoma\n     Step 4: Tuberculosis\n     Step 5: Syphilis\n     Step 6: Lymphoma\n     Step 7: Autoimmune retinopathy\n     Step 8: Uveal effusion syndrome\n     Step 9: Choroidal melanoma\n     Step 10: Choroidal metastasis\n     Reranked differential diagnosis: \n     1.

Ultrasound-guided biopsy was performed. Pathology showed high-grade, estrogen receptor–positive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). On postbiopsy physical examination, the patient had a palpable 2.5-cm right breast mass at the 3-o’clock position without palpable axillary lymphadenopathy. Surgical treatment with lumpectomy was recommended, and breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed prior to surgery to evaluate the extent of disease (Figure). Axial T2-weighted MRI at the level of the axilla revealed edema surrounding 2 enlarged, morphologically abnormal right level-1 axillary lymph nodes; axial postcontrast T1 fat-saturated MRI of the right breast revealed an irregular mass with irregular margins at the site of biopsy-proven DCIS. The patient reported receiving her second dose of COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) in the right arm the day before the breast MRI. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Vaccination-associated reactive lymphadenopathy", "predict": " Step 1: Lymphedema\n     Step 2: Axillary Lymph Node Hyperplasia\n     Step 3: Sarcoidosis\n     Step 4: Lymphoma\n     Step 5: Metastatic Breast Cancer\n     Step 6: Silicone Lymphadenopathy\n     Step 7: Vaccination-Related Axillary Lymphadenopathy\n     Step 8: Tuberculosis\n     Step 9: Cat-Scratch Disease\n     Step 10: Suppurative Lymphadenitis\n\nReranking:\n1.

Four weeks following receipt of immunotherapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab, he developed acute abdominal pain in the setting of a rapidly rising lactic acid dehydrogenase levels, prompting hospital admission. Imaging results showed mild disease progression (new ascites and periportal metabolic lymph node). Splenic infarct and portal/splenic vein thrombi were identified as etiologies of his acute pain and were presumed to be secondary to hypercoagulable state of malignancy. Over the next 3 days, he had rising serum creatinine (sCr) levels (baseline, approximately 1 mg/dL [to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4]). The initial workup included ultrasonography and urinalysis. Ultrasonography results showed abnormal intraparenchymal flow to both kidneys without evidence of kidney artery stenosis. Urine studies were consistent with prerenal etiology, while the presence of casts suggested acute tubular necrosis. Nephrotoxic medications (omeprazole/pantoprazole) were discontinued. The top differential diagnoses at this juncture included contrast-induced nephropathy or immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)–induced acute interstitial nephritis, and empirical high dose steroids were prescribed. Despite observation and steroid treatment, his sCr levels continued to increase over the next 5 days, peaking at 5.8 mg/dL, and the patient progressed into anuric kidney failure, requiring hemodialysis. This prompted a kidney biopsy for definitive diagnosis (Figure). One week later, he received encorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor.1 Two weeks later, the patient’s kidney function began to improve, and hemodialysis was discontinued.

She had consulted other physicians, but the cause could not be identified. The symptoms gradually exacerbated, seriously deteriorating her quality of life and causing a 5-kg weight loss. She also experienced insomnia and depression. Antidepressants and psychotherapy, prescribed under the suspicion of a psychogenic cause, did not alleviate her symptoms. She had no relevant medical history and no smoking or drinking history. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological findings were unremarkable. A careful physical examination, with palpation of the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage region on swallowing, revealed a clear clicking movement and right-sided friction with accompanying pain. However, results of laryngoscopy and other common imaging studies showed no pathology. Hence, to assess the dynamic structural changes during swallowing, we performed swallowing dynamic computed tomography (SD-CT), which can reveal moving structures by creating a dynamic-volume data set during swallowing.1,2 Comparison of the reconstructed SD-CT images at rest (Figure 1A) and on swallowing (Figure 1B) revealed that the superior thyroid notch and the right superior border of the thyroid cartilage contacted the hyoid bone internally during maximum laryngeal elevation on swallowing. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Clicking larynx", "predict": " Step 1: Eagle syndrome\n     Step 2: Thyroid cartilage fracture\n     Step 3: Hyoid bone fracture\n     Step 4: Foreign body in the throat\n     Step 5: Pharyngeal pouch\n     Step 6: Laryngeal cancer\n     Step 7: Hypopharyngeal diverticulum\n     Step 8: Cervical spine osteophyte\n     Step 9: Stylohyoid syndrome\n     Step 10: Thyroglossal duct cyst\n     Reranked differential diagnosis: \n     1.

She denied ocular disease, trauma, or surgery. She had no medical problems aside from chronic back pain due to a herniated disc. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/25 OS. Intraocular pressure, extraocular motility, and pupillary examination results were normal. The right eye was unremarkable. Examination of the left eye showed 2 temporal scleral nodules with surrounding hyperemia and no scleromalacia. She experienced substantial pain with palpation. Posterior examination results were unremarkable. The results of the following laboratory tests were all unremarkable: tuberculosis interferon-γ release assay, rapid plasma reagin, fluorescent treponemal antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and angiotensin-converting enzyme. The rheumatoid factor level (18 IU/mL [normal range, <14 IU/mL]) and C-reactive protein level (26 mg/L [normal range, 0-5 mg/L]) were elevated. In addition, Lyme IgG, IgM, and reflex Western blot assays were positive for antibodies. The patient denied travel to Lyme-endemic regions, tick bites, or rashes. The patient started oral prednisone therapy for possible rheumatoid arthritis (RA)–associated nodular scleritis, doxycycline therapy for positive Lyme studies, and was referred to a rheumatologist for further RA evaluation. Two weeks after presentation and initiation of oral prednisone therapy, the patient noted improvement in pain, but the scleral nodules and hyperemia persisted. Therefore, subconjunctival triamcinolone acetonide (0.5 mL of 40 mg/mL) was administered to the left eye. Further confirmatory RA workup by rheumatology did not reveal other systemic findings thought to be associated with RA on review of symptoms or clinical examination.

He had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. He denied tobacco, alcohol, or drug use. A neurological examination was notable for disorientation to the month, deficits in short-term memory, and an upward drift of the left arm. Cranial nerve, sensory, coordination, and deep tendon reflex examinations were normal. He walked with a slightly wide but steady gait. His serum red and white blood cell counts, coagulation profile, and electrolyte levels were within normal limits. Blood cultures had negative results. A 24-hour electroencephalogram showed right hemispheric slowing and multiple right centroparietal seizures of 1 minute each, without noticeable clinical correlates. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain was remarkable for a large T2-hyperintense lesion in the right temporoparietal region, with an increased diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) signal (low apparent diffusion coefficient), a low signal on susceptibility-weighted imaging, increased T1 signal intensity in and around the lesion, and a contrast-enhancing rim with leptomeningeal enhancement (Figure 1). A smaller satellite lesion with a similar MRI profile was noted inferiorly in the right anterior temporal lobe. A computed tomography scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis did not show any metastatic disease. A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile showed a normal red blood cell count and protein and glucose levels and a mildly elevated white blood cell count of 11 cells/μL (to convert to cells × 109/L, multiply by 0.001). The fluid was absent oligoclonal bands and had negative bacterial and fungal culture results, a meningitis-encephalitis polymerase chain reaction panel, and a paraneoplastic panel. Cytology and flow cytometry had negative results. The patient then underwent surgical biopsy of the temporoparietal lesion. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy–related inflammation", "predict": " Step 1: Glioblastoma\n     Step 2: Brain Abscess\n     Step 3: Meningioma\n     Step 4: Cerebral Infarction\n     Step 5: Encephalitis\n     Step 6: Lymphoma\n     Step 7: Metastatic Carcinoma\n     Step 8: Cerebral Vasculitis\n     Step 9: Toxoplasmosis\n     Step 10: Herpes Simplex Encephalitis\n\nReranking:\n1.

The mass had been slowly enlarging and he had been experiencing mild intermittent pain, but no additional symptoms were reported. His medical history was significant for several episodes of upper respiratory infection during the previous winter season, and he previously had an adenotonsillectomy several years prior and bilateral ear tubes placed 1 year before presentation. Physical examination showed a mildly tender, nonmobile, left parotid mass near the angle of the mandible with no overlying skin changes or drainage around the mass. There was no lymphadenopathy or other lesions noted in the neck area, and cranial nerve VII was fully intact. Ultrasonography results of the neck showed a left 1.5-cm preauricular nodular mass with internal and marginal vascularity. A neck magnetic resonance imaging study without contrast performed at an outside institution revealed the 1.5-cm heterogeneous intraparotid nodule that was predominantly isotense to glandular tissue on T1 images with vague hypointensity of a small irregular central region, as well as vague hyperintensity on T2 images. He subsequently underwent fine needle aspiration biopsy to assess the lesion, which demonstrated benign-appearing salivary gland tissue and clusters of myoepithelial cells. The mass was continuing to enlarge, and the patient’s pain was increasing in that area, so the decision was made to perform left superficial parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve. Intraoperatively, the left parotid mass was noted to be just below the lower branches of the facial nerve. The excised parotid mass was sent to the pathology department for analysis. Gross examination of the specimen demonstrated a 1.6 × 1.5 × 1.1–cm tan-white, well-circumscribed lesion that was partially surrounded by salivary gland parenchyma (Figure, A).

She was subsequently admitted to the hospital, where the lymphadenopathy progressed to the left side of the neck and a skin eruption developed over her face, back, and trunk. Results of an infectious disease and rheumatological workup, including bone marrow biopsy, were negative. Given her persistent symptoms, the ear, nose, and throat service consulted for excisional biopsy. On pathologic examination, the lymph nodes showed extensive coagulative necrosis, apoptosis, and karyorrhectic debris (Figure 1). Cellular components included histiocytes and dendritic cells, with absent neutrophils and hematoxylin bodies. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease", "predict": " Step 1: Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease\n     Step 2: Lymphoma\n     Step 3: Tuberculosis\n     Step 4: Sarcoidosis\n     Step 5: Cat-scratch disease\n     Step 6: Histoplasmosis\n     Step 7: Toxoplasmosis\n     Step 8: Kawasaki disease\n     Step 9: Rosai-Dorfman disease\n     Step 10: Kimura disease\n\nReranked differential diagnosis:\n1.

Occasionally, the headache became severe accompanied by vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. The child had 4 to 5 episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures 1 day prior to admission. He remained unconscious for several hours and spontaneously regained consciousness over 24 hours. There was no history of fever, weight loss, limb weakness, vision impairment, or any strokelike illness. His birth and developmental history were unremarkable. On examination, his pulse rate was 80 beats per minute (regular) with all peripheral pulses palpable without any radio-femoral delay. His blood pressure was 170/110 mm Hg with less than 10 mm Hg difference of systolic and diastolic blood pressure in other limbs. Abdominal examination revealed abdominal bruit. Fundus examination revealed papilledema with changes of hypertensive retinopathy. He was not oriented to place and time. The cranial nerves, motor, sensory, and autonomic system examination were unremarkable. Meningeal signs were absent. There was no evidence of neurocutaneous markers. His cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral white matter hyperintensity that was more marked in the bilateral parieto-occipital region. Ultrasound of the abdomen revealed a small right kidney and renal Doppler was suggestive of right renal-artery stenosis. His computed tomography angiography revealed short segment (3 cm) and short circumferential thickening of the descending aorta with right renal artery narrowing (Figure 1). His repeat cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed significant reduction in the white matter hyperintensities. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Takayasu arteritis", "predict": " Step 1: Hypertensive Encephalopathy\n     Step 2: Meningitis\n     Step 3: Encephalitis\n     Step 4: Stroke\n     Step 5: Moyamoya Disease\n     Step 6: Takayasu Arteritis\n     Step 7: Neurofibromatosis\n     Step 8: Fibromuscular Dysplasia\n     Step 9: Renal Artery Stenosis\n     Step 10: Mid Aortic Syndrome\n\nReranking all 10 differential diagnosis using all patient information and test results:\n1.

Four years earlier, he started taking lenalidomide, 10 mg/d (28-day cycle), to treat worsening anemia; after 2 cycles of treatment, he became transfusion independent. Since then, he has remained stable with the same dose and schedule of lenalidomide without significant adverse effects. The presenting skin lesions developed 1 month before presentation and began as small pustules that rapidly transformed into painful ulcers. He was treated with valacyclovir for a presumed diagnosis of shingles, but the lesions did not improve. Because of suspected necrotizing fasciitis, he underwent incision and drainage of the lesions. Cultures from the surgical specimen grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus hemolyticus. However, the lesions continued to worsen despite vancomycin and additional debridement. Thus, he was transferred to our facility. Physical examination showed multiple cutaneous ulcers with gray undermined borders and red papules of varying depths involving the chest, back, and upper extremity; lesions were as large as 9 × 15 cm. A complete blood cell count showed a white blood cell count of 16.2 × 103/μL (to convert to 109/L, multiply by 1.0) with an absolute neutrophil count of 12.7 × 103/μL, hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0), and platelet count of 262 × 103/μL with no circulating blasts. Results of additional laboratory studies, including blood culture and tests for herpes zoster virus (via polymerase chain reaction), antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were all negative. Additionally, the patient also had hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for which he was taking lisinopril and simvastatin, respectively. Pathologic sampling from skin lesions demonstrated a dense dermal infiltrate with predominantly neutrophils along with reactive histiocytes, fibroblasts, and angioplasia (Figure, A). Immunohistochemical staining showed myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils (Figure, B), histiocytic markers (CD43, CD63, CD168), and CD117-positive mast cells, but no immature myeloid precursors.

Her symptoms were initially most prominent while playing sports and were suspected to be due to asthma or seasonal allergies. However, medical management with albuterol, intranasal fluticasone, and cetirizine failed to provide relief. More recently, the patient’s parents noted that she developed stridor while sleeping and while at rest, prompting the family to present for medical attention. Previous workup, including pulmonary function testing, was concerning for an upper airway obstructive process, for which she was referred to otolaryngology. In-office flexible videostroboscopy revealed a mass in the distal cervical trachea that appeared nearly obstructive. Chest radiography confirmed the presence of an approximately 1.5-cm, well-circumscribed soft tissue mass within the cervical trachea. Direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy were performed in the operating room under general anesthesia. This demonstrated an exophytic, pedunculated mass that emanated from the anterior wall of the cervical trachea (Figure 1A and B). The patient was intubated via Seldinger technique to bypass the mass, with a 4.0-mm cuffed endotracheal tube loaded over a 0-degree Hopkins endoscope (Figure 1C). With the airway secured, attention was turned to excision of the mass. Lidocaine, 1%, with epinephrine 1:100 000 was injected in a submucosal plane, and laryngeal scissors were used to excise the attachment of the mass from the tracheal wall. The mass was then resected en bloc and removed with laryngeal cupped forceps.

Initially she was started on antibiotic therapy. Right nasal biopsy, right endoscopic sinus surgery, and right anterior superior orbital tissue biopsy were performed. Intraoperatively, the sinus mucosa demonstrated only edema and mild secretions, but there was no necrosis or purulence. Both orbital and nasal cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Orbital biopsy showed nodular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates without evidence of fungal infection or necrosis (Figure 1C). Further workup revealed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, total IgG, and IgG4 levels and normal white blood cell count, thyroid-stimulating hormone, angiotensin-converting enzyme, lysozyme, antinuclear antibody, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) levels. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "IgG4-related disease", "predict": " Step 1: Orbital Cellulitis\n     Step 2: Thyroid Eye Disease\n     Step 3: Wegener Granulomatosis\n     Step 4: Sarcoidosis\n     Step 5: IgG4-Related Disease\n     Step 6: Churg-Strauss Syndrome\n     Step 7: Eosinophilic Granuloma\n     Step 8: Lymphoma\n     Step 9: Pseudotumor Cerebri\n     Step 10: Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation\n\nReranking the differential diagnosis using all patient information and test results:\n1.

He previously received failed systemic and radiation therapy for tumor stage mycosis fungoides (MF). He had received 11 courses of extended beam radiation therapy, including 3 courses of total skin irradiation of 24 to 30 Gy, and focal irradiation to the left posterior thigh and hip/buttock with 2.5/3 Gy to 12.5/24 Gy, respectively, and the right posterior thigh and hip with 2 Gy to 20 and 26 Gy, respectively. Seven years before this visit, he underwent a reduced-intensity, matched, unrelated donor, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). His post-transplant course was complicated by severe chronic graft vs host disease of the skin, eyes, and gut, for which he received systemic corticosteroid therapy, tacrolimus, methotrexate, and long-term extracorporeal photopheresis. Three years after the HSCT, he developed chronic ulcerations on the hips, back, and arms at the site of previously irradiated tumors, as well as multiple friable, hemorrhagic, and bleeding nodules on bilateral hips and his forearms while receiving treatment with corticosteroids and extracorporeal photopheresis. He underwent several debulking procedures and excision biopsies of the nodules, which revealed granulation tissue on histology. In this latest visit, physical examination revealed recurrent hemorrhagic and friable nodules on his left lateral hip and left lateral buttock (Figure 1). Similar nodules were noted on his right hip and forearm. The patient underwent repeated debulking and biopsy. He was also treated with micafungin, amphotericin B, levofloxacin, dapsone, acyclovir, pentamidine, penicillin VK, and posaconazole.

She was breastfeeding her 10-month-old, had no history of alcohol use, and had a remote history of hookah use. She was a Southern California native with travel history to Pakistan, Turkey, Jordan, Israel, Qatar, and Dubai 5 years prior to symptom onset. One month prior to onset, she drove from Los Angeles, California, to Houston, Texas. She denied recent unintentional weight loss, cough, fever, night sweats, chills, stridor, dyspnea, dysphonia, or rash. On examination, her vital signs were within normal limits, and physical examination revealed a small right tonsillolith, mild tonsillar erythema that was worse on the right side, and a mobile 2-cm, right level 2 lymph node that was slightly tender to palpation. Laboratory evaluation was notable for an elevated eosinophil count and positive Epstein-Barr immunoglobulin G. Her white blood cell count and mononucleosis spot test result were within normal parameters. Her symptoms persisted despite treatment with penicillin, azithromycin, and steroids from her primary physician and amoxicillin-clavulanate, sinus rinses, fluticasone propionate, and azelastine spray from an otolaryngologist to treat any contributing postnasal drainage and tonsillitis. Flexible transnasal videolaryngoscopy revealed a lesion on the laryngeal surface of the right epiglottis passing midline extending to the right aryepiglottic fold, but not involving the true vocal cords (Figure 1A). Given inconclusive office biopsy results, direct laryngoscopy with biopsy was performed, showing extensively inflamed squamous mucosa with ulceration, granulation tissue, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and atypia (Figure 1B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Coccidioidomycosis", "predict": " Step 1: Tuberculosis\n     Step 2: Sarcoidosis\n     Step 3: Lymphoma\n     Step 4: Histoplasmosis\n     Step 5: Coccidioidomycosis\n     Step 6: Blastomycosis\n     Step 7: Aspergillosis\n     Step 8: Wegener's granulomatosis\n     Step 9: Crohn's disease\n     Step 10: Leprosy\n\nReranking all 10 differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:\n1.

He had a pink macule on his left cheek at birth, which became raised and discolored around age 3 to 4 weeks. He was diagnosed with a capillary hemangioma, and propranolol was started at age 1 month with progression despite dosage increases. Topical timolol was tried without improvement; oral prednisolone decreased the size of the lesion, but was poorly tolerated and discontinued. An ophthalmic evaluation at an outside hospital was concerning for amblyopia because of anisohypermetropia, greater on the left, and a left esotropia and hypertropia. A magnetic resonance image revealed an orbital mass surrounding the left lateral rectus muscle with mass effect on the globe and extension into the eyelid, pterygopalatine fossa, and cheek. Given the risk of amblyopia, the patient underwent 2 embolization and debulking procedures of the orbital and cheek components of the lesion, which were positive for glucose transporter 1 on pathology. However, the esotropia abruptly worsened after the second debulking. At age 3 years, he presented to the clinic with a persistent cheek and orbit lesion, dense amblyopia, large-angle monocular esotropia and hypertropia, and proptosis of the left eye. The left extraocular muscle showed inability to abduct past midline (Figure 1A).

His medical history comprised unexplained sensory hearing loss, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis. At age 23 years, he had bilateral cataract surgery, and over the last 2 years, he developed worsening stiffness and walking difficulties with frequent falls. He reported features of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome (RLS), visual daytime hallucinations, and rapid cognitive decline. He was given levodopa/benserazide (up to 200 mg/50 mg 4 times daily) without improvement on his Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale scores. Therefore, his dopaminergic medication was ceased. Family history was negative for movement or developmental disorders. His neurologic examination showed hypomimia, symmetrical bradykinesia, and rigidity of the extremities without tremors (Video). There was full range of eye movements with large-amplitude saccadic intrusions on smooth pursuit in all directions. Neuropsychological assessment revealed significant abnormalities in cognitive functioning, affecting verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills (ie, speed of information processing, visuospatial skills, verbal and visual memory loss, executive skills). Mini-Mental Status Examination score was 26 of 30 points. Systemic examination was unremarkable. Laboratory and cerebral spinal fluid testing (ie, paraneoplastic antibodies Hu, Yo, Ri, CV2, Ma2, amphiphysin, glutamic acid decarboxylase, N-methyl-d-aspartic acid, LGI1, and Caspr2, 14-3-3 protein) were normal. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed mild frontal and parietal atrophy. An electroencephalogram demonstrated slowing in keeping with moderate generalized encephalopathy. Total-body positron emission tomography (PET) using fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) as a tracer showed no FDG-avid lesions; however, a subsequent brain-specific FDG-PET/MRI revealed hypometabolism throughout the left cerebral hemisphere and crossed cerebellar diaschisis (Figure 1).

He had recently experienced acute pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, a tonic-clonic seizure, transient episodes with tetaniform stiffness in both upper limbs, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding caused by gastric angiodysplasia, which was treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and argon electrocoagulation. His medical history included alcohol intake of 2 to 4 drinks daily for several years that had stopped 10 years before admission, hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, dilated ischemic cardiomyopathy, and a stroke 12 years earlier and recovered without sequelae. His medications included omeprazole, furosemide, atorvastatin, allopurinol, metformin, levetiracetam, and acenocoumarol. Physical examination revealed confusion, dysarthria, appendicular dysmetria with truncal ataxia, and downbeat nystagmus. He was well nourished. Results of blood tests showed a mild creatinine increase of 1.62 mg/dL (normal range, 0.4-1.2 mg/dL; to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4), serum phosphate levels of 2.4 mg/dL (normal range, 2.5-4.5 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.323), corrected calcium levels of 7.1 mg/dL (normal range, 9.0-10.5 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.25), and serum magnesium levels of 0.3 mg/dL (normal range, 1.8-2.5 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.4114).

On admission, she was afebrile and normotensive; laboratory results were notable for an elevated creatinine level of 1.43 mg/dL (reference range, 0.40-1.30 mg/dL) (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 92 × 103/μL [reference range, 140-440 × 103/μL] [conversion to ×109 per liter is 1:1). She developed diarrhea 1 day after admission. Fecal leukocytes were absent. Stool antigen test results for cryptosporidium, giardia, and rotavirus were negative. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results for campylobacter, norovirus, salmonella, shigella, Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli 1 and 2, Vibrio cholerae, and Yersinia enterocolitica in the stool were negative. Antigen and toxin test results for Clostridium difficile in the stool were positive. Total body skin examination was notable for 1- and 3-cm tender, round perianal ulcers with a clean base. Another 4-mm round ulcer was present at the superior intergluteal cleft (Figure, A). There were no ocular or oral ulcers. A biopsy specimen of a perianal ulcer border was obtained for histopathologic analysis (Figure, B-D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cytomegalovirus infection", "predict": " Step 1: Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)\n     Step 2: Pyoderma Gangrenosum\n     Step 3: Cryptococcal Infection\n     Step 4: Cytomegalovirus (CMV)\n     Step 5: Ischemic Ulcer\n     Step 6: Fournier Gangrene\n     Step 7: Mucormycosis\n     Step 8: Leukocytoclastic Vasculitis\n     Step 9: Calciphylaxis\n     Step 10: Cutaneous Manifestation of Gastrointestinal Infection (e.g., C. difficile)\n     Reranked Differential Diagnosis:\n     1.

Following an upper respiratory tract infection 1 month prior, he developed disseminated red, scaly patches and a progressive eruption of hyperpigmented and hypopigmented patches of skin. He had occasional nonbloody loose stools but no fevers or vomiting. Although he was otherwise well, his growth had fallen from the 75th to the 25th percentile for height and weight over the preceding 9 months, and he could speak only 2 words. His medical history was notable for atopic dermatitis and diarrhea in infancy that prompted allergy testing at age 6 months; he was subsequently diagnosed with milk, egg, and peanut allergies. His parents avoided feeding him these foods, providing him only soy-based milk and formula, with improvement of dermatitis, until age 1 year. Since then his diet had consisted of multiple rice milk feeds daily, supplemented only with pureed fruits and vegetables, pasta, snack puffs, and sunflower butter. The patient had no history of meconium ileus or family history of cystic fibrosis. There was no recent travel and no changes to the home environment. On presentation, the patient was irritable, with normal vital signs. He displayed prominent scrotal swelling and pitting edema of the legs bilaterally. Skin examination was notable for erythematous, denuded patches with peeling scale and reticulate hyperpigmentation, accentuated on the abdomen, back, diaper area, and extensor extremities (Figure; left panel).

She was born in 1973 at 38th week of gestation followed by a normal delivery (weight, 3.15 kg and head circumference, 42 cm) to nonconsanguineous parents. The head size was normal at birth, and no other abnormalities were seen during her infancy. At age 2 years, her parents noticed that she had delayed motor and language milestones. She experienced a progressive developmental delay such as reduction of head growth, loss of acquired communication, and loss of motor functions between ages 9 and 12 years. The severity of scoliosis increased with age, and she became a wheelchair user at age 18 years. She was referred to us at age 40 years with the characteristic features of growth deceleration (height, 142 cm; weight, 22 kg; body mass index, 11 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]), apraxia, left-sided hemiplegia, spasticity, sleep apnea, constipation, osteoporosis, hypoalgesia, and repetitive hand tapping (Video).

Multiple prior office visits with referring ophthalmologists during which eyes were dilated showed normal results. Clinical examination revealed 180° of left interior subconjunctival hemorrhage with overlying conjunctival elevation and mild fullness of the left lower eyelid (Figure 1A). Fixation was central, steady, and maintained bilaterally, with full ocular motility and absence of appreciable proptosis. Penlight anterior segment examination demonstrated normally formed anterior segment structures without inflammation or hyphema in either eye, although the left eye exhibited a small intraocular lightly pigmented lesion at the 5-o'clock limbus. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) was deemed appropriate and further demonstrated normal intraocular pressures bilaterally. Handheld slitlamp examination localized the left eye 2-mm limbal lesion on the posterior corneal surface. The surrounding corneal and iris structures were normal appearing without evidence of vascularization. Ultrasound biomicroscopy was used to further evaluate both the intraocular lesion and better characterize the left lower eyelid fullness.

His primary care physician initially obtained an ultrasonographic image, which demonstrated a left, level 2 lymph node measuring 4.0 × 1.5 × 2.8 cm. The patient then underwent several courses of antibiotic treatment, but the mass persisted. After a period of conservative management, he developed a sore throat and fever. He subsequently underwent a computed tomographic scan of the neck and chest with contrast, which demonstrated an isolated, enlarged, homogenously enhancing left-neck level 2B lymph node measuring 3.4 × 2.8 × 2.1 cm (Figure 1A). When he presented to our facility, he was found to have an asymptomatically enlarged left level 2/5A neck mass that was nontender and fixed. The patient had an unremarkable medical, surgical, and social history and no known infectious exposures. A white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level were both elevated, at 11 310 cells/μL (to convert to cells × 109 per liter, multiply by 0.001) and 56.2 mg/L (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 9.524), respectively.

The patient had a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome with insulin resistance and a migraine disorder and reported experiencing 1 to 2 migraine episodes per week since early high school. She believed that the neck mass made these episodes worse than normal. The patient was otherwise previously healthy until she developed an upper respiratory infection. Her physician noted visible swelling in the right neck and clinically interpreted the finding as enlarged lymph nodes associated with the infection. After 2 weeks, the neck swelling persisted despite the resolution of other symptoms. She was subsequently treated with a course of antibiotics, which did not result in any improvement. The mass slowly enlarged over the next 6 months. The patient reported new symptoms, including waxing and waning pain that radiated to the back of her neck, headaches, and intermittent dysphagia. She also noted periods during which the mass would fluctuate in size. Otolaryngologic examination findings were within normal limits except for a single, nontender, compressible right neck mass deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and extending into level V. The patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan prior to presentation at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center’s otolaryngology clinic. The scan showed a fatty-appearing tumor within the right carotid space. The patient underwent surgical excision, and a mass measuring 8.0 × 6.5 × 4.7–cm was removed from the carotid space (Figure, A). Additional material from the mass was excised at the level of the base of the skull.

Her mental state had deteriorated progressively over the previous 12 months, following the death of her father. After a period living alone, she had returned to the family home 4 months prior to her presentation and had been noted to be socially withdrawn, preoccupied, and distractible. Her family physician, suspecting a depressive episode, had prescribed citalopram up to a dosage of 40 mg once daily, to no effect. Her family subsequently sought advice from the family physician when the patient was noted to be speaking to herself, expressing concerns about people meaning her harm, and professing the belief that she could hear other peoples’ thoughts. The patient had been born in Sierra Leone after a complicated delivery and had traveled to the United Kingdom as a child with her family, who were fleeing from a civil war. On arrival in the United Kingdom, her family claimed asylum and moved into a small apartment in a high-rise building in central London. Although there was no reported developmental delay, she had struggled academically at school and was bullied for having overweight. She left school without qualifications at age 16 years and worked as a shop assistant. She left this job about a year prior to her referral to psychiatry after a period of sick leave following the death of her father. She was a nonsmoker, did not drink alcohol, and denied illicit drug use. A paternal relative was reported to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia. There was no comorbid physical illness. On review, the patient was kempt and had overweight. Eye contact was fleeting, and she presented as anxious, with a degree of psychomotor agitation. Her speech was normal in rate, volume, and tone, although tangential. There was no other evidence of thought disorder. She denied feeling low in mood or suicidal and was objectively euthymic. There was some sleep disturbance, with the patient reporting being fearful to go to sleep owing to persecutory beliefs regarding her neighbors. She reflected that over the preceding few months, she had experienced a sensation of detachment from her immediate environment, as though it was not real, making her world similar to that of a video game. She reported that in the apartment where she had previously been living, she had realized that something was amiss and had become convinced that the door number of her neighbor’s flat, number 6, signified that they meant her harm. She explained this was because 6 was associated with the number of the devil. She reported hearing her neighbors commenting negatively about her appearance. These distressing experiences prompted her to return to her family home, but she continued to hear her neighbors’ voices making derogatory comments about her appearance and began to hear them commenting on her actions and thoughts in the third person as well. On returning home, her paranoia regarding her previous neighbors worsened, resulting in her rarely leaving the house. The volume and frequency of derogatory auditory hallucinations also worsened, and she reported hearing the thoughts of others as well. There was a degree of insight, and although the patient was convinced of the reality of her experiences, she also saw the stress of losing her father as associated with her experiences and was accepting of input from mental health services. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Schizophrenia", "predict": " Step 1: Schizophrenia\n     Step 2: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\n     Step 3: Brief psychotic disorder\n     Step 4: Schizoaffective disorder\n     Step 5: Psychotic depression\n     Step 6: Delusional disorder\n     Step 7: Paranoid personality disorder\n     Step 8: Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder\n     Step 9: Acute stress disorder\n     Step 10: Adjustment disorder\n     Reranked differential diagnosis: \n     1.

His comorbidities included congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and a 50-pack-year history of tobacco abuse. Physical examination revealed a firm, nonmobile, nontender, bulging mass situated over the right frontal sinus, which expanded to the upper right eyelid. The mass covered the globe completely, resulting in total vision obstruction (Figure, A). However, the patient’s vision remained intact when the mass was elevated off the eye with great effort. His right pupil was round and reactive to light without afferent pupillary defect. No palpable lymphadenopathy was noted. A non–contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a large, right supraorbital mass with bony destruction of the anterior table of the right frontal sinus (Figure, B). It extended into the superior aspect of the orbit, displacing the right globe inferiorly. Air was seen within the mass (Figure, C). A fine-needle aspiration biopsy yielded inconclusive results. After medical clearance, the patient was taken to the operating room for a wedge excisional biopsy with decompression of the right supraorbital mass under monitored anesthesia care. Histopathological investigation revealed large nests of neoplastic epithelioid cells surrounded by fibrotic tissue and necroinflammatory debris. The neoplastic cells contained round nuclei with single prominent nucleoli and abundant clear to vacuolated cytoplasm (Figure, D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Sebaceous carcinoma", "predict": " Step 1: Sebaceous Carcinoma\n     Step 2: Squamous Cell Carcinoma\n     Step 3: Basal Cell Carcinoma\n     Step 4: Mucocele\n     Step 5: Osteomyelitis\n     Step 6: Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Infection\n     Step 7: Aspergillosis\n     Step 8: Mucormycosis\n     Step 9: Lymphoma\n     Step 10: Metastatic Carcinoma\n\nReranked differential diagnosis:\n1.

He had been born after an uncomplicated pregnancy, during which routine prenatal ultrasonography had not detected any anatomical abnormalities or lesions. On physical examination, there were no abnormalities other than symmetrical submucosal swelling of the floor of the mouth and a midline external punctum present in the submental area (Figure, A). The tongue was displaced posteriorly and superiorly. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the neck and face performed shortly after presentation showed a midline sublingual lesion extending inferiorly through the mylohyoid muscle (Figure, B-D). The intrinsic muscles of the tongue appeared minimally displaced without obvious infiltration; however, the genioglossus muscle was difficult to locate relative to the mass. A thin-walled, multiloculated lesion was identified, measuring approximately 2.0 × 2.5 × 3.2 cm.

The patient had been experiencing redness, tearing, and foreign-body sensation in both eyes for 7 months. She was diagnosed with giant papillary conjunctivitis and follicular conjunctivitis by ophthalmologists at other institutions and was treated with topical corticosteroids and oral doxycycline. Topical corticosteroid eyedrops (0.5% loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension) seemed to control her symptoms, but attempts to wean the medication resulted in recurrence. She denied any significant ocular history. Her medical history included hypothyroidism and breast cancer in the setting of Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic disorder with a predisposition to various cancers, including carcinoma of the colon, breast, and uterus. At the time of examination, visual acuity was 20/25 OU. Pupil anatomy, intraocular pressure, confrontation visual fields, and extraocular movements were within normal limits. Slitlamp examination revealed mild meibomian gland dysfunction bilaterally, and follicular conjunctivitis was evident on eversion of all 4 eyelids.
