He had no known ocular history. At presentation, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/100 OD and 20/50 OS. Intraocular pressures were normal bilaterally and pupils were equally reactive. Examination of the right eye was unremarkable except for moderate cataract. The left-eye slitlamp examination was remarkable for a shallow but quiet anterior chamber and moderate cataract. Dilated fundus examination of the left eye revealed shallow peripheral serous choroidal detachments, bullous inferior macula-involving retinal detachment with shifting fluid, and diffuse hyperpigmented lesions involving the macula and superior fundus that corresponded to areas of nodular retinal pigment epithelium thickening on optical coherence tomography (Figure 1). These hyperpigmented lesions were associated with hyperautofluorescence and blockage on fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography. No retinal breaks were seen on scleral depressed examination. Ultrasound biomicroscopy demonstrated 360° ciliochoroidal effusion. Axial length was 24.30 mm OD and 24.32 mm OS.

The patient reported experiencing tightness and discomfort in the left side of the neck but denied experiencing any pain. He denied any recent incidents of neck trauma or impact. Furthermore, his medical history did not reveal any previous hematological disorders. The ultrasonography examination detected the presence of a well-defined, solid mass located in the left lobe of the thyroid gland. The mass exhibited regular shape, distinct boundaries, heterogeneous echogenicity, and observable blood flow signals. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck detected heterogeneous density mass shadows within the soft tissue region near the left lobe of the thyroid, exhibiting distinct boundaries measuring 53 × 41 × 88 mm. Subsequent enhanced CT did not reveal notable enhancement of the cystic components of the mass (Figure 1). Due to persistent symptoms, the patient expressed a desire for surgical resection.

She received penetrating keratoplasty 4 months later, as the ulcer did not heal with intensive medication. Then, topical tobramycin dexamethasone, topical tacrolimus, and daily oral prednisone, 40 mg, were prescribed, with a gradual taper of prednisone to a maintenance dose of 10 mg. At 5-month postoperative follow-up, some thin snowflakelike matter was found deposited on the iris and in the angle, with rare cell and mild flare in the anterior chamber. She was then diagnosed with uveitis and subsequently prescribed topical prednisone, subconjunctival triamcinolone acetonide, oral prednisone, 40 mg, and daily intravenous ganciclovir, 5 mg/kg. An aqueous sample was obtained for diagnostic polymerase chain reaction, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was detected with a DNA load of 3.12 × 107 cells.

Born by cesarean delivery to nonconsanguineous parents, she developed difficulties with head control, standing, and feeding at age 10 months. Subsequently, she faced progressive motor challenges (walking, speech, and swallow); contractures in her fingers, toes, wrists, and knees; and scoliosis. In adolescence, she experienced progressive stiffness, episodes of painful spasms and oculomotor crisis, and galactorrhea unrelated to childbirth in adulthood. Her symptoms worsened with age and progressed to her using a wheelchair, having difficulty in speech, and not having access to education. She had a younger brother with similar symptoms who passed away at age 20 years of unknown causes. Upon presentation at age 31 years, she was admitted to our center for further evaluation. She had thin limbs and was of standard height. The neurological and psychological examinations revealed scoliosis, contractures in her fingers and toes, carpal inversion, dysarthria, dysphagia, hypertonia, decreased tendon reflexes, absence of Babinski sign (Figure, A and B), and no psychiatric problems. Blood test results indicated hyperprolactinemia (prolactin level of 47.40 ng/mL; to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1).

Ophthalmology was consulted to evaluate for a conjunctival foreign body of the left eye. At the time of the examination, his symptoms had resolved; however, he had a photograph from a cellular phone taken during the episode (Figure 1). The photograph shows an irregular, serpiginous extension from beneath the plica semilunaris toward the corneal limbus with localized conjunctival hyperemia. He reported a similar sensation of movement in his left eye that occurred for 1 night about 5 years ago for which he visited an urgent care center where he was diagnosed with allergic conjunctivitis. He also reported recent swelling of the left side of his face with associated numbness and occasional swelling of his left hand, all of which resolved after a few days. He had immigrated from Nigeria 10 years prior, had not returned since, and was working as a traveling nurse. A slitlamp examination did not reveal any conjunctival hyperemia, foreign bodies, or other abnormalities like those shown in the photograph.

The imaging findings of a heterogeneously enhancing mass with cystic components and clear planes separating the mass from the spinal musculature and carotid sheath are consistent with a benign lesion. The differential diagnosis is ranked based on the likelihood of the diagnosis, with branchial cleft cyst being the most likely diagnosis given the location and imaging characteristics of the mass. Lymphatic malformation and thyroglossal duct cyst are also high on the differential diagnosis list given their common occurrence in the head and neck region. Hemangioma and rhabdomyosarcoma are less likely given the patient’s age and the imaging characteristics of the mass. Neurofibroma, carotid body tumor, parotid gland tumor, schwannoma, and lymphoma are less likely given the location and imaging characteristics of the mass.\n### Note:\nThe final answer is not a single disease name but a ranked list of differential diagnoses.

On admission, vital signs showed blood pressure as 98/66 mm Hg while receiving dobutamine and norepinephrine from the referral hospital, a regular heart rate of 90 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, peripheral oxygen saturation 96% nasal oxygen at 3 L per minute, and a temperature of 36.7° C. Echocardiography showed reduced left ventricle systolic function (estimated ejection fraction, 34%) and hypokinesia of the anteroseptal, anterior, anterolateral, and septal walls. Lung ultrasound demonstrated multiple B-lines in both lung fields. Diagnostic coronary angiography revealed a total occlusion in the left main coronary artery. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was successful in opening the osteal left main and drug-eluting stents were placed in the left main and left anterior descending arteries. Following PCI, the patient had episodes of supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Electrical cardioversion was performed and a loading dose of amiodarone was administered. Chest radiography during the loading dose of amiodarone showed infiltrates in both lung fields (Figure 1A). While in the intensive cardiovascular care unit, maintenance doses of amiodarone were continued because of episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, and torsaded de pointes. On the third day of hospitalization, despite adequate diuresis, the chest radiography showed persistent pulmonary edema. Chest computed tomography showed a reticular pattern predominantly in the perihilar area with consolidation and diffuse ground-glass opacity in both lung fields (Figure 1B). In addition, hemodynamic evaluation and lung ultrasound showed no congestion and laboratory markers, including a procalcitonin level of 0.01 ng/mL, and ruled out an infectious etiology. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Acute amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity", "predict": " Step 1: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome\n     Step 2: Pulmonary Edema\n     Step 3: Pneumonia\n     Step 4: Pulmonary Embolism\n     Step 5: Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema\n     Step 6: Acute Interstitial Pneumonia\n     Step 7: Amiodarone Pulmonary Toxicity\n     Step 8: Non-Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema\n     Step 9: Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis\n     Step 10: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis\n     Reranked differential diagnosis:\n     1.

Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) is the most likely diagnosis, given the patient's history of smoking and the presence of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is also a possibility, as it can present with chest pain and diaphoresis, although the patient's symptoms and test results do not strongly support this diagnosis. Aortic Dissection (AD) is another consideration, but the patient's physical examination and imaging results do not suggest this diagnosis. Myocarditis and Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) are also possible, given the patient's elevated troponin T levels and symptoms, but these diagnoses are less likely based on the patient's presentation and test results.

Five months after surgery, he presented to the otolaryngology clinic with 3 weeks of mild odynophagia and dysphagia. It was noted that the patient had a prominent posterior pharyngeal wall, subtle asymmetry of vocal fold motion, and pooling of secretions in the left pyriform (Video 1). During the next 6 months, he gradually developed shortness of breath and stridor, and eventually presented to the emergency department in respiratory distress requiring intubation for 2 days. Shortly after extubation, laryngeal examination showed fullness of the posterior pharyngeal wall and severely limited vocal fold abduction bilaterally (Figure 1A; Video 1). A modified barium swallow study showed intermittent laryngeal penetration without aspiration (Video 2). Although the patient was unable to tolerate magnetic resonance imaging, a soft tissue computed tomography scan of the neck with contrast revealed a well-positioned plate with no evidence of fluid collection in the setting of a normal leukocyte count. One month later, a neuromuscular specialist investigated potential underlying neurological causes; however, results of nerve conduction, antiacetylcholine receptor, antimuscle-specific kinase, methylmalonic acid, HIV, rapid plasma reagin, vitamin B-12, thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroxine, copper, creatine kinase, and immunofixation studies were all unremarkable. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Delayed iatrogenic bilateral vocal fold paralysis (BVFP)", "predict": " Step 1: Cervical spine injury\n     Step 2: Dysphagia lusoria\n     Step 3: Zenker's diverticulum\n     Step 4: Cervical spondylotic myelopathy\n     Step 5: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\n     Step 6: Myasthenia gravis\n     Step 7: Cervical spine fracture\n     Step 8: Cervical spine infection\n     Step 9: Cervical spine tumor\n     Step 10: Cervical spine abscess\n     Reranked differential diagnosis:\n     1.

Her symptoms began after relocation to California and occurred more frequently at her home. However, she could not discern any environmental or dietary triggers. She reported pruritus and swelling, which were usually moderate but occasionally severe, prompting several emergency department visits. During an emergency department visit, she was diagnosed with acute parotitis based on clinical and radiographic findings of diffuse gland edema, without salivary stones or masses. Her symptoms responded to oral prednisone bursts and diphenhydramine, but not to second-generation antihistamines or montelukast. Her workup included immune serology and total immunoglobulin (Ig) E measurements, all of which were within normal limits. A differential blood cell count revealed 10% eosinophils (normal, <6%) and an absolute eosinophil count 500/µL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). Titers for antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, anti-Ro (SS-A), and anti-La (SS-B) were negative. Sialendoscopy of her right parotid and left submandibular glands found no obstructing stones or strictures. Concurrent steroid irrigation did not provide any substantial benefit. An open biopsy of the right parotid tail revealed nonspecific inflammatory changes and otherwise normal parenchyma. Given the frequency and severity of her symptoms along with multiple treatment failures, she opted to undergo a right superficial parotidectomy, which proceeded without complications. Further histologic examination of the surgical specimen revealed substantial periductal inflammatory infiltrate with eosinophils, as seen in the Figure. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Eosinophilic sialodochitis", "predict": " 1.

The patient's lack of response to topical tretinoin ointment and the gradual aggravation of the lesions also support this diagnosis. The histopathologic features of the skin biopsy specimen, which are not described in detail, are likely to be consistent with aquagenic keratoderma. The other differential diagnoses, such as aquagenic urticaria, aquagenic pruritus, dyshidrotic eczema, irritant contact dermatitis, hyperhidrosis, allergic contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and keratosis pilaris, are less likely based on the patient's symptoms and history.", "topic": "['Dermatology']"}

Despite 3 days of treatment with an oral antibiotic (cefalexin), her thigh pain and swelling did not improve, and she was readmitted to the hospital and intravenous clindamycin was started. Wound cultures and blood cultures obtained during incision and drainage performed on hospital day 1 were negative for bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal organisms. The following day, her temperature was 39.4 °C (102.9 °F), blood pressure was 86/42 mm Hg, and heart rate was 131/min. She was transferred to the intensive care unit for presumed septic shock, and her antibiotics were changed to vancomycin and meropenem. Surgical debridement of the right thigh was performed on hospital day 3. On hospital day 4, a new purple dusky border developed along the wound edge, and the patent underwent a second surgical debridement. After debridement on hospital day 5, her temperature was 39.8 °C (103.6 °F), and she required vasopressor infusion with norepinephrine for shock. Her right thigh had a deep 9 × 8–cm ulcer with a dusky violaceous border extending 2 to 5 cm from the wound edge (Figure, left), with many 1- to 2-mm pustules (not visible in Figure). Laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 30 000/μL (88% neutrophils); lactate level, 77.5 mg/dL (8.6 mmol/L); and procalcitonin level, 16.1 ng/mL (reference, <0.1 ng/mL).

Vision was 20/250 OD and 20/60 OS. The anterior segment was unremarkable in either eye, while the posterior segment examination noted 1+ vitreous cell, asteroid hyalosis, and a multilobulated, serous retinal detachment (RD) in the right eye and trace vitreous cell and a multilobulated, serous RD in the left eye. Imaging included B-scan, optical coherence tomography, and fundus autofluorescence, which revealed diffuse choroidal and ciliary body thickening, multifocal pockets of subretinal fluid, and speckled hyperautofluorescence and hypoautofluorescence in both eyes (Figure 1). No poliosis or skin changes were noted. A review of systems was unremarkable, most notably a lack of any pulmonary symptoms. A focused laboratory evaluation identified a significantly elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level and antinuclear antibody titer, but serum lysozyme, syphilis, and tuberculosis testing had negative results.

She had a history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and migraine headaches. Her medications included atorvastatin, carvedilol, and norethindrone. Dilated-fundus examination of the right eye showed a single cotton-wool spot (indicating local retinal ischemia), with intraretinal hemorrhage in the inferotemporal quadrant. Ultrawide-field imaging showed a cotton-wool spot on the left fundus (Figure 1A, right) and a peripheral arterial occlusion in the right eye (Figure 1A, left), and fluorescein angiographic study of the right eye demonstrated an area of blockage corresponding to intraretinal hemorrhage and venous hyperfluorescence (Figure 1B). The patient was afebrile, with pulse 110 beats/min and blood pressure of 188/99 mm Hg. Auscultation over the heart apex revealed a holosystolic ejection murmur (grade 2/6). Laboratory testing showed normal complete blood cell count and thyrotropin level and negative results for autoantibodies against Sm, SSA, SSB, Scl-70, Jo-1, centromere, chromatin, ribonucleoprotein, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was mildly elevated (30 mm/h). Results of testing for antinuclear antibodies were positive at low titer (1:40, homogenous pattern) with positive dsDNA (5.0 IU/mL; negative if <4.0 IU/mL). Blood cultures were negative for bacterial or fungal growth after 5 days.

Age-related macular degeneration\n### Explanation:\nThe patient's symptoms of bilateral macular atrophy, sensorineural hearing loss, and headache, along with the fundus autofluorescence and optical coherence tomography findings, suggest a complex condition involving both the eyes and ears. The presence of a speckled fundus autofluorescence pattern and bilateral atrophy of the outer retina and retinal pigment epithelium point towards a genetic disorder. Usher syndrome, Alport syndrome, and Refsum disease are the top three differential diagnoses, as they are all genetic conditions that can cause both visual and hearing impairments.

Four weeks following receipt of immunotherapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab, he developed acute abdominal pain in the setting of a rapidly rising lactic acid dehydrogenase levels, prompting hospital admission. Imaging results showed mild disease progression (new ascites and periportal metabolic lymph node). Splenic infarct and portal/splenic vein thrombi were identified as etiologies of his acute pain and were presumed to be secondary to hypercoagulable state of malignancy. Over the next 3 days, he had rising serum creatinine (sCr) levels (baseline, approximately 1 mg/dL [to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4]). The initial workup included ultrasonography and urinalysis. Ultrasonography results showed abnormal intraparenchymal flow to both kidneys without evidence of kidney artery stenosis. Urine studies were consistent with prerenal etiology, while the presence of casts suggested acute tubular necrosis. Nephrotoxic medications (omeprazole/pantoprazole) were discontinued. The top differential diagnoses at this juncture included contrast-induced nephropathy or immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)–induced acute interstitial nephritis, and empirical high dose steroids were prescribed. Despite observation and steroid treatment, his sCr levels continued to increase over the next 5 days, peaking at 5.8 mg/dL, and the patient progressed into anuric kidney failure, requiring hemodialysis. This prompted a kidney biopsy for definitive diagnosis (Figure). One week later, he received encorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor.1 Two weeks later, the patient’s kidney function began to improve, and hemodialysis was discontinued.

The presence of methylmalonic acidemia in the urine organic acid analysis further supports this diagnosis. The patient's vegetarian diet for 15 days prior to the onset of symptoms may have contributed to the development of vitamin B12 deficiency. The ranked differential diagnosis list reflects the likelihood of each condition based on the patient's presentation and test results. Vitamin B12 deficiency is the most likely diagnosis, followed by methionine synthase deficiency and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase deficiency, which are also disorders of vitamin B12 metabolism. Folate deficiency and homocystinuria are less likely but still possible diagnoses. Subacute combined degeneration, adrenoleukodystrophy, and leukodystrophy are less likely but cannot be ruled out without further testing.

After the initial sarcoma diagnosis in September 2018, the patient received 8 cycles of doxorubicin hydrochloride and ifosfamide along with regional hyperthermia, followed by good tumor response. The patient had a history of a pathological fracture of L4, which had been treated with radiotherapy and vertebroplasty in November 2019 and remained unchanged on imaging obtained in April 2020. The treatment regimen recently had been switched to gemcitabine hydrochloride and docetaxel in January 2020 following osseous progression during maintenance chemotherapy with trofosfamide, idarubicin hydrochloride, and etoposide. On restaging computed tomography, symmetrical enlargement of both psoas muscles was observed with intramuscular hypodensity (Figure, A). The patient reported lower back pain but no motor or sensory deficits. Further workup with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed extensive, nearly symmetrical swelling in both psoas muscles and sharply delineated, peripheral contrast enhancement of the fascia with strict horizontal bounds (Figure, B and C). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Radiation recall myositis", "predict": " Step 1:  Psoas abscess\n     Step 2:  Psoas hematoma\n     Step 3:  Psoas muscle strain\n     Step 4:  Psoas muscle tumor\n     Step 5:  Psoas muscle metastasis\n     Step 6:  Psoas muscle lymphoma\n     Step 7:  Psoas muscle sarcoma\n     Step 8:  Psoas muscle myositis\n     Step 9:  Psoas muscle infection\n     Step 10:  Psoas muscle infarction\n     Reranked differential diagnosis:\n     1.

The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 103 mm/h and a magnetic resonance angiographic examination of the brain was negative for mass, infarction, and hemorrhage. Examination results of a right, superficial, temporal artery biopsy specimen showed chronic, nongranulomatous inflammation surrounding adventitial vessels and extensive subintimal fibrosis, without giant cells or segmental loss of the internal elastic lamina, which was interpreted as compatible with temporal arteritis. High-dose corticosteroid therapy was initiated (1 g methylprednisolone intravenously for 3 days followed by 60 mg/d of oral prednisone). A neuro-ophthalmologic examination performed 1 week later showed an unreactive left pupil with an obvious relative afferent pupillary defect. Optic nerve pallor concomitant with edema and a single flame-shaped hemorrhage at the 4-o’clock position on the disc margin was also observed. Two weeks later, persistent elevation of the ESR and C-reactive protein levels, despite continued oral prednisone therapy, prompted a review of the temporal artery biopsy findings.

He subsequently underwent fine needle aspiration biopsy to assess the lesion, which demonstrated benign-appearing salivary gland tissue and clusters of myoepithelial cells. The mass was continuing to enlarge, and the patient’s pain was increasing in that area, so the decision was made to perform left superficial parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve. Intraoperatively, the left parotid mass was noted to be just below the lower branches of the facial nerve. The excised parotid mass was sent to the pathology department for analysis. Gross examination of the specimen demonstrated a 1.6 × 1.5 × 1.1–cm tan-white, well-circumscribed lesion that was partially surrounded by salivary gland parenchyma (Figure, A). Histologic examination of the nodule was performed (Figure, B and C). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Sclerosing polycystic adenoma", "predict": " Step 1: Pleomorphic adenoma\n     Step 2: Basal cell adenoma\n     Step 3: Warthin tumor\n     Step 4: Mucoepidermoid carcinoma\n     Step 5: Adenoid cystic carcinoma\n     Step 6: Acinic cell carcinoma\n     Step 7: Myoepithelial carcinoma\n     Step 8: Squamous cell carcinoma\n     Step 9: Lymphoma\n     Step 10: Metastatic tumor\n     Reranked differential diagnosis:\n     1.

The location of the mass near the angle of the mandible and the presence of a preauricular nodular mass with internal and marginal vascularity on ultrasonography are suggestive of a parotid gland tumor. The fine needle aspiration biopsy results showing benign-appearing salivary gland tissue and clusters of myoepithelial cells are consistent with a benign salivary gland tumor. The histologic examination of the nodule showing a well-circumscribed lesion partially surrounded by salivary gland parenchyma and the presence of myoepithelial cells are also consistent with a benign salivary gland tumor. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is a pleomorphic adenoma, which is the most common type of benign salivary gland tumor. The other differential diagnoses are less likely based on the patient’s age, symptoms, and biopsy results.", "topic": "['Pediatrics', 'Otolaryngology', 'Salivary Gland Disorders', 'Dental Medicine']"}

Three weeks prior, she had presented with mild fever and flulike symptoms, associated with a severe frontal headache that was mildly relieved by analgesics. Her medical history was positive for relapsing urinary tract infections since early infancy without adequate follow-up. Findings of an ophthalmological examination 1 year prior were reported as normal. At initial examination, she was conscious but somewhat lethargic. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/80 OS. Pupillary light responses, extrinsic ocular motility, anterior segment biomicroscopy, and intraocular pressure were normal in both eyes. Dilated fundus examination revealed a bilateral sectorial macular star that was more extended in the left eye, with retinal veins slightly dilated and tortuous, attenuated arterioles, some juxta and peripapillary nerve fiber layer infarcts, and optic disc edema with marked papillary telangiectasia; in addition, some faint, small, tan-yellow dots were observed at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium in the posterior pole, some of them already grayish and with a hypopigmented halo (Figure 1). Optical coherence tomography displayed elevated optic discs and hyperreflective material in the outer plexiform layer temporal to the optic disc in both eyes and a macular neurosensory detachment in the left eye. Results of visual field testing were normal in the right eye and showed a central scotoma in the left eye. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Hypertensive retinopathy", "predict": " 1.

The presence of a ruptured pulmonary cyst and liver cysts on CT scan, along with the patient's close contact with animals, points towards Echinococcosis as the most likely diagnosis. Tuberculosis is also a possibility, given the patient's symptoms and the fact that he lives in rural China, where TB is more common. However, the normal results from tuberculin skin test, interferon-γ release assay, nucleic acid amplification testing for tuberculosis, acid-fast bacilli smear microscopy, and HIV antibody testing make TB less likely. Pneumonia is also a possible diagnosis, but the presence of cysts on CT scan makes it less likely. The other differential diagnoses, such as cystic fibrosis, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, pulmonary sequestration, bronchogenic cyst, pulmonary lymphangiectasia, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, and pulmonary arteriovenous malformation, are less likely based on the patient's symptoms and test results.", "topic": "['Pulmonary Medicine', 'Hepatobiliary Disease', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Pediatrics']"}

Four years earlier, he started taking lenalidomide, 10 mg/d (28-day cycle), to treat worsening anemia; after 2 cycles of treatment, he became transfusion independent. Since then, he has remained stable with the same dose and schedule of lenalidomide without significant adverse effects. The presenting skin lesions developed 1 month before presentation and began as small pustules that rapidly transformed into painful ulcers. He was treated with valacyclovir for a presumed diagnosis of shingles, but the lesions did not improve. Because of suspected necrotizing fasciitis, he underwent incision and drainage of the lesions. Cultures from the surgical specimen grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus hemolyticus. However, the lesions continued to worsen despite vancomycin and additional debridement. Thus, he was transferred to our facility. Physical examination showed multiple cutaneous ulcers with gray undermined borders and red papules of varying depths involving the chest, back, and upper extremity; lesions were as large as 9 × 15 cm. A complete blood cell count showed a white blood cell count of 16.2 × 103/μL (to convert to 109/L, multiply by 1.0) with an absolute neutrophil count of 12.7 × 103/μL, hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0), and platelet count of 262 × 103/μL with no circulating blasts. Results of additional laboratory studies, including blood culture and tests for herpes zoster virus (via polymerase chain reaction), antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were all negative. Additionally, the patient also had hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for which he was taking lisinopril and simvastatin, respectively.

Her symptoms were initially most prominent while playing sports and were suspected to be due to asthma or seasonal allergies. However, medical management with albuterol, intranasal fluticasone, and cetirizine failed to provide relief. More recently, the patient’s parents noted that she developed stridor while sleeping and while at rest, prompting the family to present for medical attention. Previous workup, including pulmonary function testing, was concerning for an upper airway obstructive process, for which she was referred to otolaryngology. In-office flexible videostroboscopy revealed a mass in the distal cervical trachea that appeared nearly obstructive. Chest radiography confirmed the presence of an approximately 1.5-cm, well-circumscribed soft tissue mass within the cervical trachea. Direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy were performed in the operating room under general anesthesia. This demonstrated an exophytic, pedunculated mass that emanated from the anterior wall of the cervical trachea (Figure 1A and B). The patient was intubated via Seldinger technique to bypass the mass, with a 4.0-mm cuffed endotracheal tube loaded over a 0-degree Hopkins endoscope (Figure 1C). With the airway secured, attention was turned to excision of the mass. Lidocaine, 1%, with epinephrine 1:100 000 was injected in a submucosal plane, and laryngeal scissors were used to excise the attachment of the mass from the tracheal wall. The mass was then resected en bloc and removed with laryngeal cupped forceps.

Seven years before this visit, he underwent a reduced-intensity, matched, unrelated donor, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). His post-transplant course was complicated by severe chronic graft vs host disease of the skin, eyes, and gut, for which he received systemic corticosteroid therapy, tacrolimus, methotrexate, and long-term extracorporeal photopheresis. Three years after the HSCT, he developed chronic ulcerations on the hips, back, and arms at the site of previously irradiated tumors, as well as multiple friable, hemorrhagic, and bleeding nodules on bilateral hips and his forearms while receiving treatment with corticosteroids and extracorporeal photopheresis. He underwent several debulking procedures and excision biopsies of the nodules, which revealed granulation tissue on histology.

The presence of sensory neuronopathy on electromyography and diffuse cerebellar atrophy along with T2 hyperintensities in bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles, cerebellar white matter, pons, and bilateral thalamus on brain MRI further supports this diagnosis. The patient’s age of onset and the presence of psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety also support the diagnosis of a spinocerebellar ataxia. Among the different types of spinocerebellar ataxia, type 2 is the most likely diagnosis given the patient’s clinical presentation and the presence of slow saccades and gaze restriction. The other types of spinocerebellar ataxia are less likely given the patient’s clinical presentation and the absence of other characteristic features such as retinal degeneration in type 7 and dysphagia in type 8. Ataxia-telangiectasia, ataxia with vitamin E deficiency, and Friedreich’s ataxia are less likely given the patient’s clinical presentation and the absence of other characteristic features such as telangiectasias in ataxia-telangiectasia, vitamin E deficiency in ataxia with vitamin E deficiency, and cardiomyopathy in Friedreich’s ataxia.", "topic": "['Neurogenetics', 'Neurology', 'Neuromuscular Diseases']"}

She reported difficulty opening her jaw, pain when chewing, and a 2.3-kg weight loss. The week prior, she experienced left-sided ptosis that persisted for 2 days and subsequently resolved. She denied vision changes, eye pain, scalp tenderness, and myalgias. Past medical history included schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and supraventricular tachycardia. Her examination demonstrated normal visual acuity in both eyes. Pupils were equal, round, and reactive. There was right upper-eyelid ptosis. Extraocular motility demonstrated limitation of elevation and abduction bilaterally (Figure 1). Results of dilated fundus examination were normal, and the remainder of her neurologic examination results were normal. Her eye movements and ptosis did not change with fatiguability, rest, or an ice-pack test. Investigations revealed a C-reactive protein level of 292 mg/L (normal, <10 mg/L; to convert to milligrams per deciliter, divide by 10) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 93 mm/h (normal, <30 mm/h). A lumbar puncture demonstrated normal opening pressure, cell count, and glucose and protein levels. Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast of the brain demonstrated diffuse edema and enhancement of the scalp, skull base, neck, and paraspinal soft tissues, as well as T2 hyperintensity and enhancement of the extraocular muscles bilaterally.

Five years before this otolaryngology evaluation, the patient developed diffuse skin plaques with erythema and was subsequently diagnosed with hypopigmented cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL, mycosis fungoides type). The patient was treated with a regimen of narrowband UV-B phototherapy and triamcinolone cream, which he has continued for 4 years. Owing to significant worsening of his symptoms 4 months before his evaluation, a biopsy of his cutaneous lesions was performed to rule out progression of CTCL (Figure 1). Physical examination demonstrated large annular plaques with peripheral hyperpigmentation of the body. There were also confluent, indurated pink plaques with slightly raised edges along the forehead, malar eminence, and scalp. The nasal septum demonstrated an inverted V deformity with compromise of the keystone junction.

He had a pink macule on his left cheek at birth, which became raised and discolored around age 3 to 4 weeks. He was diagnosed with a capillary hemangioma, and propranolol was started at age 1 month with progression despite dosage increases. Topical timolol was tried without improvement; oral prednisolone decreased the size of the lesion, but was poorly tolerated and discontinued. An ophthalmic evaluation at an outside hospital was concerning for amblyopia because of anisohypermetropia, greater on the left, and a left esotropia and hypertropia. A magnetic resonance image revealed an orbital mass surrounding the left lateral rectus muscle with mass effect on the globe and extension into the eyelid, pterygopalatine fossa, and cheek. Given the risk of amblyopia, the patient underwent 2 embolization and debulking procedures of the orbital and cheek components of the lesion, which were positive for glucose transporter 1 on pathology. However, the esotropia abruptly worsened after the second debulking. At age 3 years, he presented to the clinic with a persistent cheek and orbit lesion, dense amblyopia, large-angle monocular esotropia and hypertropia, and proptosis of the left eye. The left extraocular muscle showed inability to abduct past midline (Figure 1A).

At age 23 years, he had bilateral cataract surgery, and over the last 2 years, he developed worsening stiffness and walking difficulties with frequent falls. He reported features of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome (RLS), visual daytime hallucinations, and rapid cognitive decline. He was given levodopa/benserazide (up to 200 mg/50 mg 4 times daily) without improvement on his Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale scores. Therefore, his dopaminergic medication was ceased. Family history was negative for movement or developmental disorders. His neurologic examination showed hypomimia, symmetrical bradykinesia, and rigidity of the extremities without tremors (Video). There was full range of eye movements with large-amplitude saccadic intrusions on smooth pursuit in all directions. Neuropsychological assessment revealed significant abnormalities in cognitive functioning, affecting verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills (ie, speed of information processing, visuospatial skills, verbal and visual memory loss, executive skills). Mini-Mental Status Examination score was 26 of 30 points. Systemic examination was unremarkable. Laboratory and cerebral spinal fluid testing (ie, paraneoplastic antibodies Hu, Yo, Ri, CV2, Ma2, amphiphysin, glutamic acid decarboxylase, N-methyl-d-aspartic acid, LGI1, and Caspr2, 14-3-3 protein) were normal. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed mild frontal and parietal atrophy. An electroencephalogram demonstrated slowing in keeping with moderate generalized encephalopathy. Total-body positron emission tomography (PET) using fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) as a tracer showed no FDG-avid lesions; however, a subsequent brain-specific FDG-PET/MRI revealed hypometabolism throughout the left cerebral hemisphere and crossed cerebellar diaschisis (Figure 1). As the patient’s cognitive function and parkinsonism had deteriorated rapidly, a brain biopsy of the left frontal cortex was done. Immunohistochemistry showed scattered globular inclusions consistent with Lewy bodies. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Autosomal recessive parkinsonism", "predict": " Step 1:  Frontotemporal dementia\n     Step 2:  Corticobasal degeneration\n     Step 3:  Progressive supranuclear palsy\n     Step 4:  Multiple system atrophy\n     Step 5:  Dementia with Lewy bodies\n     Step 6:  Alzheimer’s disease\n     Step 7:  Parkinson’s disease\n     Step 8:  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\n     Step 9:  Huntington’s disease\n     Step 10:  Normal pressure hydrocephalus\n     Reranked differential diagnosis:\n     1.

Normal pressure hydrocephalus\n### Explanation:\nThe patient’s clinical presentation of progressive parkinsonism with poor levodopa response, REM sleep behavior disorder, RLS, visual daytime hallucinations, and rapid cognitive decline, along with the presence of Lewy bodies on brain biopsy, is most consistent with dementia with Lewy bodies. The patient’s symptoms and test results, including the presence of Lewy bodies, are not typical of the other differential diagnoses. The patient’s age and lack of family history also make some of the other diagnoses less likely. The patient’s poor response to levodopa and the presence of visual hallucinations are not typical of Parkinson’s disease, and the patient’s cognitive decline and visual hallucinations are not typical of multiple system atrophy. The patient’s lack of tremors and poor response to levodopa also make progressive supranuclear palsy less likely. The patient’s normal pressure hydrocephalus is unlikely due to the lack of gait disturbance and dementia. The patient’s amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is unlikely due to the lack of muscle weakness and atrophy. The patient’s Huntington’s disease is unlikely due to the lack of chorea and family history. The patient’s Alzheimer’s disease is unlikely due to the presence of Lewy bodies and the patient’s age. The patient’s frontotemporal dementia is unlikely due to the presence of Lewy bodies and the patient’s lack of personality changes. The patient’s corticobasal degeneration is unlikely due to the lack of alien limb phenomenon and the presence of Lewy bodies.\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$", "topic": "['Movement Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Parkinson Disease']"}

Inflammatory markers were elevated with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 130 mm/h and a C-reactive protein level of 1.48 mg/dL (to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10). The patient noted floaters in her right eye, which prompted an ophthalmology consultation.

In the absence of other suggestive symptoms, as well as a normal physical examination that did not reveal any enlarged cervical lymph nodes or oropharyngeal or neck mass and an unremarkable nasoendoscopic examination, a diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux was made. The patient was advised to try conservative management with dietary advice and proton pump inhibitors, and a clinical review was scheduled in 6 weeks. The patient only returned 3 months later when his hoarseness became worse. Repeat nasoendoscopy now showed left vocal cord palsy in the paramedian position. In the absence of a history of trauma and associated neurological or systemic symptoms, the main concern was an underlying tumor that impinged on the vagus nerve at various points or its recurrent branch. Results of a computed tomographic (CT) scan showed an ill-defined soft tissue mass, which was likely nodal disease, at the left supraclavicular (Figure 1), as well as the prevertebral and paravertebral region, which partially encased the left common carotid, left subclavian, and left vertebral arteries. This was along the expected course of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve and likely accounted for the left vocal cord palsy. However, the primary site of disease remained unclear.

The echocardiogram was performed because of an abnormal electrocardiogram demonstrating sinus tachycardia accompanied by high QRS voltage with a strain pattern in the precordial leads. He had no history of other illnesses. On physical examination, the patient was 154 cm tall and weighed 38 kg. The cardiovascular examination was unremarkable. Neurological examination showed mild cognitive impairment, poor coordination, and muscle weakness of the bilateral lower limbs. Blood test results revealed impaired glucose tolerance, hypothyroidism, and elevated levels of lactic acid (32.4 mg/dL) and pyruvate acid (1.91 mg/dL; to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 113.56). Review of the transthoracic echocardiogram showed diffuse hypertrophy, moderately decreased contractility of the left ventricle, and increased intramyocardial signal intensity (Video). The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. On admission, brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated cerebellar atrophy. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated diffuse biventricular hypertrophy and moderately impaired left ventricular systolic function.

She first noticed swelling that progressed to pressure and dyspnea while supine. She reported fatigue but denied pain, voice change, weight loss, hemoptysis, and dysphagia. A physical examination revealed a visible and palpable fullness to the right neck without overlying cutaneous or sinus tract changes. Results of a complete blood cell count, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, triiodothyronine and levorotatory thyroxine testing, and a complete metabolic panel were normal.

Thymic cyst\n### Explanation:\nThe patient presented with a 6-month history of a right neck mass with compressive symptoms, which suggests a possible cystic lesion. The normal results of the complete blood cell count, thyroid stimulating hormone test, triiodothyronine and levorotatory thyroxine testing, and complete metabolic panel help to rule out some possible causes of the neck mass, such as infection, thyroid disease, or metabolic disorders. The ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the neck showed a large, nonenhancing cystic-appearing lesion abutting the lateral and posterior margins of the right thyroid lobe, which suggests a possible cystic lesion. The ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration revealed clear fluid with a parathyroid hormone (PTH) level of 67 pg/mL, which is within the normal range, and the barium swallow study showed no communication between the cyst and the piriform sinus, which helps to rule out some possible causes of the cystic lesion, such as a branchial cleft cyst or a thyroglossal duct cyst. The excision in the operating room and right thyroid lobectomy were necessary because of the intimate association of the lesion to the thyroid lobe, which suggests a possible parathyroid cyst or a thyroid cyst. Based on the patient's presentation, test results, and surgical findings, the ranked differential diagnosis is as follows:\n1. Branchial cleft cyst: The patient's presentation with a neck mass and compressive symptoms, and the ultrasonography and computed tomography scan showing a large, nonenhancing cystic-appearing lesion, are consistent with a branchial cleft cyst.\n2. Thyroid cyst: The patient's presentation with a neck mass and compressive symptoms, and the ultrasonography and computed tomography scan showing a large, nonenhancing cystic-appearing lesion abutting the lateral and posterior margins of the right thyroid lobe, are consistent with a thyroid cyst.\n3. Parathyroid cyst: The patient's presentation with a neck mass and compressive symptoms, and the ultrasonography and computed tomography scan showing a large, nonenhancing cystic-appearing lesion abutting the lateral and posterior margins of the right thyroid lobe, are consistent with a parathyroid cyst.\n4. Cervical thymic cyst: The patient's presentation with a neck mass and compressive symptoms, and the ultrasonography and computed tomography scan showing a large, nonenhancing cystic-appearing lesion, are consistent with a cervical thymic cyst.\n5. Cystic hygroma: The patient's presentation with a neck mass and compressive symptoms, and the ultrasonography and computed tomography scan showing a large, nonenhancing cystic-appearing lesion, are consistent with a cystic hygroma.\n6. Lymphatic malformation: The patient's presentation with a neck mass and compressive symptoms, and the ultrasonography and computed tomography scan showing a large, nonenhancing cystic-appearing lesion, are consistent with a lymphatic malformation.\n7. Cervical bronchogenic cyst: The patient's presentation with a neck mass and compressive symptoms, and the ultrasonography and computed tomography scan showing a large, nonenhancing cystic-appearing lesion, are consistent with a cervical bronchogenic cyst.\n8. Cervical dermoid cyst: The patient's presentation with a neck mass and compressive symptoms, and the ultrasonography and computed tomography scan showing a large, nonenhancing cystic-appearing lesion, are consistent with a cervical dermoid cyst.\n9. Cervical teratoma: The patient's presentation with a neck mass and compressive symptoms, and the ultrasonography and computed tomography scan showing a large, nonenhancing cystic-appearing lesion, are consistent with a cervical teratoma.\n10. Thymic cyst: The patient's presentation with a neck mass and compressive symptoms, and the ultrasonography and computed tomography scan showing a large, nonenhancing cystic-appearing lesion, are less consistent with a thymic cyst, as thymic cysts are typically smaller and more commonly found in the anterior mediastinum.\nNote: The final answer is a ranked list of differential diagnoses, and the explanation provides the reasoning behind the ranking.", "topic": "['Endocrinology', 'Thyroid Disorders', 'Diabetes and Endocrinology', 'Oncology', 'Endocrine Cancer']"}

At age 8 months, she was treated with right enucleation and left eye radiotherapy (50.4 Gy). At age 4 years, she developed a recurrence of the retinoblastoma in the nasal cavity and was treated with 4 cycles of vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide followed by 1 cycle of cisplatin, etoposide, and intrathecal cytarabine. Primary care evaluation was prompted by her mother, as the patient had not noticed her lower extremity edema. She had no fevers, weight loss, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, or history of deep vein thrombosis. Her physical examination was notable for firm, nonpitting edema to the hip. She did not have any associated tenderness, inguinal lymphadenopathy, or palpable abdominal masses. Her vital signs were within normal limits and she ambulated comfortably. Laboratory work results, including a complete blood cell count with a differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, and D-dimer levels, were within normal limits.

The presence of tense, fluid-filled bullae around the incision site, without surrounding erythema or edema, and the negative superficial cultures for bacterial growth, point towards an autoimmune bullous disease. The patient's age and lack of systemic symptoms make bullous pemphigoid a likely diagnosis. Pemphigus vulgaris is also a possibility, but the lack of mucosal involvement and the presence of tense bullae make it less likely. Dermatitis herpetiformis and linear IgA bullous dermatosis are also considered, but the lack of characteristic histopathological findings and the presence of tense bullae make them less likely. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita and bullous lupus erythematosus are also considered, but the lack of characteristic histopathological findings and the patient's age make them less likely. Pemphigus foliaceus and bullous SLE are also considered, but the lack of characteristic histopathological findings and the patient's age make them less likely. Bullous dermatosis of diabetes is also considered, but the lack of characteristic histopathological findings and the patient's age make it less likely.

The patient's medical history and physical examination revealed several abnormalities, including confusion, dysarthria, appendicular dysmetria with truncal ataxia, and downbeat nystagmus, which suggested a neurological disorder. The laboratory results showed mild creatinine increase, low serum phosphate levels, low corrected calcium levels, and low serum magnesium levels. The results of tests for blood cell count, liver function, and thyroid function were normal, as were levels of sodium, potassium, vitamin B12, folic acid, vitamin E, and antinuclear, antineutrophil cytoplasmic, antigliadin, anti–glutamic acid decarboxylase, and anti-transglutaminase antibodies.

The results of whole-body computerized tomography scan and electroencephalogram were normal. Brain MRI revealed hyperintensity on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences without reduced diffusion in the cerebellar nodule.\n\nConsidering the patient's symptoms, medical history, physical examination, and laboratory results, the differential diagnosis can be developed as follows:\n\nStep 1: Wernicke encephalopathy - The patient's symptoms of confusion, dysarthria, and ataxia, along with the laboratory results of low serum magnesium levels, suggest Wernicke encephalopathy.\n\nStep 2: Hypomagnesemia - The patient's low serum magnesium levels could be causing his symptoms, and hypomagnesemia can lead to Wernicke encephalopathy.\n\nStep 3: Hypocalcemia - The patient's low corrected calcium levels could be contributing to his symptoms, and hypocalcemia can be associated with hypomagnesemia.\n\nStep 4: Hypophosphatemia - The patient's low serum phosphate levels could be contributing to his symptoms, and hypophosphatemia can be associated with hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia.\n\nStep 5: Celiac disease - The patient's symptoms of malaise, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting, along with the laboratory results of low serum phosphate levels, suggest celiac disease.\n\nStep 6: Adrenal insufficiency - The patient's symptoms of malaise, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting, along with the laboratory results of low serum phosphate levels, suggest adrenal insufficiency.\n\nStep 7: Hypoparathyroidism - The patient's low corrected calcium levels could be caused by hypoparathyroidism, which can be associated with hypomagnesemia.\n\nStep 8: Pancreatitis - The patient's symptoms of malaise, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting, along with the laboratory results of low serum phosphate levels, suggest pancreatitis.\n\nStep 9: Pseudohypoparathyroidism - The patient's low corrected calcium levels could be caused by pseudohypoparathyroidism, which can be associated with hypomagnesemia.\n\nStep 10: Gitelman syndrome - The patient's low serum magnesium levels and low serum phosphate levels could be caused by Gitelman syndrome.\n\nAfter reranking the differential diagnosis using all patient information and test results, the top 10 differential diagnoses are:\n\n1. Hypomagnesemia\n2. Wernicke encephalopathy\n3. Hypocalcemia\n4. Hypophosphatemia\n5. Celiac disease\n6. Adrenal insufficiency\n7. Hypoparathyroidism\n8. Pancreatitis\n9. Pseudohypoparathyroidism\n10.

She was born in 1973 at 38th week of gestation followed by a normal delivery (weight, 3.15 kg and head circumference, 42 cm) to nonconsanguineous parents. The head size was normal at birth, and no other abnormalities were seen during her infancy. At age 2 years, her parents noticed that she had delayed motor and language milestones. She experienced a progressive developmental delay such as reduction of head growth, loss of acquired communication, and loss of motor functions between ages 9 and 12 years. The severity of scoliosis increased with age, and she became a wheelchair user at age 18 years. She was referred to us at age 40 years with the characteristic features of growth deceleration (height, 142 cm; weight, 22 kg; body mass index, 11 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]), apraxia, left-sided hemiplegia, spasticity, sleep apnea, constipation, osteoporosis, hypoalgesia, and repetitive hand tapping (Video).

Multiple prior office visits with referring ophthalmologists during which eyes were dilated showed normal results. Clinical examination revealed 180° of left interior subconjunctival hemorrhage with overlying conjunctival elevation and mild fullness of the left lower eyelid (Figure 1A). Fixation was central, steady, and maintained bilaterally, with full ocular motility and absence of appreciable proptosis. Penlight anterior segment examination demonstrated normally formed anterior segment structures without inflammation or hyphema in either eye, although the left eye exhibited a small intraocular lightly pigmented lesion at the 5-o'clock limbus. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) was deemed appropriate and further demonstrated normal intraocular pressures bilaterally. Handheld slitlamp examination localized the left eye 2-mm limbal lesion on the posterior corneal surface. The surrounding corneal and iris structures were normal appearing without evidence of vascularization. Ultrasound biomicroscopy was used to further evaluate both the intraocular lesion and better characterize the left lower eyelid fullness. This demonstrated no iris, angle, or ciliary body involvement by the intraocular lesion. A 10-MHz contact B-scan examination showed a large inferior orbital lesion measuring more than 17 mm in the anterior-to-posterior dimension (Figure 1B).

No lymph node abnormality was observed. Fine-needle aspiration was performed, and the smear was extremely cellular and showed sheets and clusters of bland polygonal epithelial cells admixed with bright pink filamentous matrix. Because of the size and location, extracapsular dissection II was carried out.1 The final pathology of the lesion showed histologic findings compatible with salivary gland carcinoma, with microcystic and papillary architecture (Figure, A and B). Abundant bubbly secretion was present within these microcystic spaces, and this material was positive for periodic acid–Schiff (Figure, C). Immunohistochemically, there was positivity for epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin (CK) 7 and CK19, S100 protein, and gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP-15). Stains for gastrointestinal stromal tumors 1 (DOG1) and p63 were negative. The tumor appeared to be contained within the surgical excision margins.

However, the subsequent development of subretinal fluid in the macula and the results of fluorescein angiography, indocyanine green, and autofluorescence led to a diagnosis of central serous retinopathy (CSR). CSR is a condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid under the retina, often associated with stress, corticosteroid use, or other factors. The patient's symptoms and test results are consistent with CSR, making it the most likely diagnosis. The other differential diagnoses, such as acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy, multiple evanescent white dot syndrome, punctate inner choroidopathy, multifocal choroiditis, birdshot chorioretinopathy, serpiginous choroiditis, syphilis, tuberculosis, and acute anterior uveitis, are less likely based on the patient's presentation and test results.", "topic": "['Ophthalmology']"}

His primary care physician initially obtained an ultrasonographic image, which demonstrated a left, level 2 lymph node measuring 4.0 × 1.5 × 2.8 cm. The patient then underwent several courses of antibiotic treatment, but the mass persisted. After a period of conservative management, he developed a sore throat and fever. He subsequently underwent a computed tomographic scan of the neck and chest with contrast, which demonstrated an isolated, enlarged, homogenously enhancing left-neck level 2B lymph node measuring 3.4 × 2.8 × 2.1 cm (Figure 1A). When he presented to our facility, he was found to have an asymptomatically enlarged left level 2/5A neck mass that was nontender and fixed. The patient had an unremarkable medical, surgical, and social history and no known infectious exposures. A white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level were both elevated, at 11 310 cells/μL (to convert to cells × 109 per liter, multiply by 0.001) and 56.2 mg/L (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 9.524), respectively.

The patient’s medical history was notable for severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) diagnosed in the fall of 2017, when he presented with snoring, progressive daytime fatigue, and several years of migraines. Since his diagnosis, he had been adherent to use of nightly continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). However, he had persistent daytime fatigue and morning headaches. Several months before presentation, the patient noticed that his bite changed from an overbite to an underbite (Figure, A), which had been attributed to dental malocclusion from his CPAP machine. Examination findings of the oropharynx showed an oropharynx score of a Mallampati 4, with 3-plus tonsils and macroglossia without scalloping of the tongue (Figure, B). Nasopharyngolaryngoscopic examination findings showed that the tonsils did not approximate at midline, with a narrow anterior-to-posterior dimension of the airway owing to macroglossia and no retrognathia.

The patient had a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome with insulin resistance and a migraine disorder and reported experiencing 1 to 2 migraine episodes per week since early high school. She believed that the neck mass made these episodes worse than normal. The patient was otherwise previously healthy until she developed an upper respiratory infection. Her physician noted visible swelling in the right neck and clinically interpreted the finding as enlarged lymph nodes associated with the infection. After 2 weeks, the neck swelling persisted despite the resolution of other symptoms. She was subsequently treated with a course of antibiotics, which did not result in any improvement. The mass slowly enlarged over the next 6 months. The patient reported new symptoms, including waxing and waning pain that radiated to the back of her neck, headaches, and intermittent dysphagia. She also noted periods during which the mass would fluctuate in size. Otolaryngologic examination findings were within normal limits except for a single, nontender, compressible right neck mass deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and extending into level V.

The scan showed a fatty-appearing tumor within the right carotid space. The patient underwent surgical excision, and a mass measuring 8.0 × 6.5 × 4.7–cm was removed from the carotid space (Figure, A). Additional material from the mass was excised at the level of the base of the skull. Gross pathologic examination demonstrated yellowish-brown, homogenous, lobular adipose tissue covered by a thin, tan, transparent membrane (Figure, A).

On both lower extremities, there was peripheral edema with widespread hematomas, scattered ecchymosis, petechiae, and diffuse perifollicular purpura (Figure). The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. Laboratory test results showed a normocytic anemia (hemoglobin level, 5.2 g/dL [reference, 13.5-17.5 g/dL]; mean corpuscular volume, 85 fL [reference, 80-100 fL]); normal platelet count (thrombocytes, 285 ×109/L [reference, 150-400 ×109/L]); and a mild leukopenia (leukocytes, 3.9 ×109 [reference, 4.3-10 ×109/L]). Folic acid level was low (3 nmol/L [reference, ≥5 nmol/L]) and vitamin B12 level was normal (478 pg/mL [reference, 193-982 pg/mL]). Results for iron panel, reticulocyte count, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), international normalized ratio, liver function tests, and levels of indirect bilirubin, haptoglobin, fibrinogen, and creatine kinase were all within reference range. Chest radiographs and computed tomography of the head were negative for any acute pathology. A 12-lead electrocardiogram revealed no abnormalities. Ultrasound of both lower legs showed no thromboembolism. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy)", "predict": " Step 1:  Scurvy\n     Step 2:  Amyloidosis\n     Step 3:  Sickle Cell Disease\n     Step 4:  Thalassemia\n     Step 5:  Hemophilia\n     Step 6:  Leukemia\n     Step 7:  Lymphoma\n     Step 8:  Myelodysplastic Syndromes\n     Step 9:  Aplastic Anemia\n     Step 10:  Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria\n     Reranked differential diagnosis:\n     1.

The initial presentation with an erythematous, tender swelling with yellow discharge may indicate a secondary infection. The patient’s age and medical history are also risk factors for malignancy. The presence of telangiectasia is more commonly associated with basal cell carcinoma, but the pigmentation and madarosis are more suggestive of sebaceous gland carcinoma. The sausage-shaped nodule is also more characteristic of sebaceous gland carcinoma. The patient’s African American ethnicity is also a risk factor for sebaceous gland carcinoma. The presence of ulceration and the focally pigmented nature of the nodule also increase the likelihood of sebaceous gland carcinoma.

Let’s think step by step.\n### INPUT:\nA 20-year-old woman was referred by her family physician to a community mental health team in London, United Kingdom. Her mental state had deteriorated progressively over the previous 12 months, following the death of her father. After a period living alone, she had returned to the family home 4 months prior to her presentation and had been noted to be socially withdrawn, preoccupied, and distractible. Her family physician, suspecting a depressive episode, had prescribed citalopram up to a dosage of 40 mg once daily, to no effect. Her family subsequently sought advice from the family physician when the patient was noted to be speaking to herself, expressing concerns about people meaning her harm, and professing the belief that she could hear other peoples’ thoughts. The patient had been born in Sierra Leone after a complicated delivery and had traveled to the United Kingdom as a child with her family, who were fleeing from a civil war. On arrival in the United Kingdom, her family claimed asylum and moved into a small apartment in a high-rise building in central London. Although there was no reported developmental delay, she had struggled academically at school and was bullied for having overweight. She left school without qualifications at age 16 years and worked as a shop assistant. She left this job about a year prior to her referral to psychiatry after a period of sick leave following the death of her father. She was a nonsmoker, did not drink alcohol, and denied illicit drug use. A paternal relative was reported to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia. There was no comorbid physical illness. On review, the patient was kempt and had overweight. Eye contact was fleeting, and she presented as anxious, with a degree of psychomotor agitation. Her speech was normal in rate, volume, and tone, although tangential. There was no other evidence of thought disorder. She denied feeling low in mood or suicidal and was objectively euthymic. There was some sleep disturbance, with the patient reporting being fearful to go to sleep owing to persecutory beliefs regarding her neighbors. She reflected that over the preceding few months, she had experienced a sensation of detachment from her immediate environment, as though it was not real, making her world similar to that of a video game. She reported that in the apartment where she had previously been living, she had realized that something was amiss and had become convinced that the door number of her neighbor’s flat, number 6, signified that they meant her harm. She explained this was because 6 was associated with the number of the devil. She reported hearing her neighbors commenting negatively about her appearance. These distressing experiences prompted her to return to her family home, but she continued to hear her neighbors’ voices making derogatory comments about her appearance and began to hear them commenting on her actions and thoughts in the third person as well. On returning home, her paranoia regarding her previous neighbors worsened, resulting in her rarely leaving the house. The volume and frequency of derogatory auditory hallucinations also worsened, and she reported hearing the thoughts of others as well. There was a degree of insight, and although the patient was convinced of the reality of her experiences, she also saw the stress of losing her father as associated with her experiences and was accepting of input from mental health services. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Schizophrenia", "predict": " Step 1: Schizophrenia\n     Step 2: Brief Psychotic Disorder\n     Step 3: Schizoaffective Disorder\n     Step 4: Posttraumatic Stress Disorder\n     Step 5: Depressive Episode with Psychotic Features\n     Step 6: Anxiety Disorder\n     Step 7: Dissociative Disorder\n     Step 8: Bipolar Disorder\n     Step 9: Schizophreniform Disorder\n     Step 10: Adjustment Disorder\n     Reranked differential diagnosis:\n     1.

The patient did not require positive pressure or intubation, but he had intermittent stridor associated with desaturations. He had feeding difficulty and failure to thrive. On physical examination, the newborn had facial dysmorphism, including a broad and flat nasal dorsum and mild micrognathia. Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed a cystic lesion consistent with a vallecular cyst. A modified barium swallow study demonstrated laryngeal penetration and aspiration of thin and nectar-thick liquids. A diffuse, soft, palpable mass was present along the right neck. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a multispatial mildly enhancing mass within the bilateral retropharyngeal, parapharyngeal, and carotid spaces, with a mildly hyperintense signal relative to muscle on T1-weighted and T2-weighted images and associated restricted diffusion. The mass was largest on the right side, with convex borders, mild superior displacement of the right parotid gland, and posterior displacement of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle (Figure, A, B). The T2-weighted MRI also demonstrated a hyperintense, nonenhancing lesion within the base of the tongue consistent with a vallecular cyst. The thyroid appeared normal and in its expected location, but no thymus was present in the mediastinum.

Hypercalcemia\n     9. Hypocalcemia\n     10. Cardiac tamponade\n### Explanation:\nThe patient's symptoms of fatigue, dizziness, and palpitations, along with the ECG results, suggest a cardiac issue. Atrial fibrillation is a common cause of palpitations and is often associated with hypertension. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is another possible cause of palpitations and is also associated with hypertension. Hyperkalemia and hypokalemia can cause cardiac arrhythmias, including palpitations. Hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can also cause cardiac symptoms, including palpitations. Pheochromocytoma is a rare cause of hypertension and palpitations. Hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia can cause cardiac arrhythmias, but are less likely in this case. Cardiac tamponade is a rare cause of cardiac symptoms and is unlikely in this case.\n### Note:\nThe differential diagnosis is not exhaustive, and other possibilities should be considered based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory results.\n### Example Use Cases:\nThis AI can be used in various clinical settings, such as emergency departments, cardiology clinics, and primary care offices, to assist healthcare professionals in generating differential diagnoses for patients presenting with cardiac symptoms. It can also be used in medical education to teach students and residents how to approach differential diagnosis in a systematic and logical manner.\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n1. The patient presents with increasing fatigue, dizziness, and palpitations, which suggests a cardiac issue.\n2. The ECG results show an irregularly irregular rhythm, which is consistent with atrial fibrillation.\n3. The patient's hypertension and palpitations suggest hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as a possible cause.\n4. The patient's symptoms and ECG results also suggest hyperkalemia and hypokalemia as possible causes of cardiac arrhythmias.\n5. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism as possible causes of cardiac symptoms.\n6. The patient's hypertension and palpitations suggest pheochromocytoma as a rare cause of cardiac symptoms.\n7. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia as possible causes of cardiac arrhythmias, but these are less likely in this case.\n8. The patient's symptoms and physical examination results suggest cardiac tamponade as a rare cause of cardiac symptoms, but this is unlikely in this case.\n9. Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory results, atrial fibrillation is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms.\n10. The differential diagnosis is reranked based on the patient's information and test results, with atrial fibrillation being the most likely cause, followed by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma, hypothyroidism, hypercalcemia, hypocalcemia, and cardiac tamponade.", "topic": "['Atrial Fibrillation', 'Cardiology', 'Rhythm Disorders']"}

The mass was completely resected with its stalk and with adequate surgical margin. Histopathological results (Figure, C and D) showed that the tumor cells were arranged in papillary structures with fibrovascular cores and these cells also had nuclear grooves. Results of other investigations after surgery were negative for cancer, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neck and thyroid ultrasonography.

His medical history included hepatitis C, cirrhosis, and an orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) 3 years prior that was subsequently treated with tacrolimus, 5 mg, and mycophenolate, 750 mg, twice daily. Approximately 2½ years after the transplant, the patient developed gastric outlet obstruction secondary to an infiltrative gastric wall mass. The gastric wall mass was found to be associated with plasmablastic posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (pPTLD). He was subsequently instructed to stop use of mycophenolate and decrease use of tacrolimus to 0.25 mg daily, then treated with 1 cycle of CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone) and lenalidomide, resulting in symptomatic and radiologic improvement. Five weeks after treatment with CHOP chemotherapy, the patient presented with an acute-onset abdominal skin eruption without fever or pain. A computed tomographic scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed possible abdominal wall cellulitis, so treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin was empirically started. Physical examination revealed confluent indurated violaceous papules and plaques coalescing into an annular pattern encircling the healed OLT incisional scar with central sparing (Figure 1A).

His comorbidities included congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and a 50-pack-year history of tobacco abuse. Physical examination revealed a firm, nonmobile, nontender, bulging mass situated over the right frontal sinus, which expanded to the upper right eyelid. The mass covered the globe completely, resulting in total vision obstruction (Figure, A). However, the patient’s vision remained intact when the mass was elevated off the eye with great effort. His right pupil was round and reactive to light without afferent pupillary defect. No palpable lymphadenopathy was noted. A non–contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a large, right supraorbital mass with bony destruction of the anterior table of the right frontal sinus (Figure, B). It extended into the superior aspect of the orbit, displacing the right globe inferiorly. Air was seen within the mass (Figure, C). A fine-needle aspiration biopsy yielded inconclusive results. After medical clearance, the patient was taken to the operating room for a wedge excisional biopsy with decompression of the right supraorbital mass under monitored anesthesia care.

The mass's well-circumscribed nature and separation from the underlying bone on CT imaging are consistent with a benign process. The presence of dense acoustic shadowing on ultrasound and ossification on CT imaging points towards a bony or cartilaginous lesion. Myositis ossificans, a condition characterized by heterotopic ossification following trauma, is the most likely diagnosis given the patient's history and imaging findings. Osteochondroma, osteoma, ossifying fibroma, and fibrous dysplasia are also possible, but less likely, diagnoses. Chondrosarcoma and osteosarcoma are less likely due to the lack of aggressive features on imaging. Lipoma, hemangioma, and neurofibroma are unlikely given the presence of ossification and the patient's history of trauma.", "topic": "['Otolaryngology', 'Pediatrics', 'Clinical Challenge', 'Trauma and Injury']"}

He had been born after an uncomplicated pregnancy, during which routine prenatal ultrasonography had not detected any anatomical abnormalities or lesions. On physical examination, there were no abnormalities other than symmetrical submucosal swelling of the floor of the mouth and a midline external punctum present in the submental area (Figure, A). The tongue was displaced posteriorly and superiorly. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the neck and face performed shortly after presentation showed a midline sublingual lesion extending inferiorly through the mylohyoid muscle (Figure, B-D). The intrinsic muscles of the tongue appeared minimally displaced without obvious infiltration; however, the genioglossus muscle was difficult to locate relative to the mass. A thin-walled, multiloculated lesion was identified, measuring approximately 2.0 × 2.5 × 3.2 cm. The mass was bright on T2-weighted imaging and dark on T1-weighted imaging and did not enhance with intravenous gadolinium. There were no obvious fluid-fluid levels or calcifications. When in-phase and out-of-phase images were compared, there was no significant signal intensity drop, suggesting an absence of fat within the lesion. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Cystic teratoma (mature)", "predict": " Step 1: Congenital Epulis\n     Step 2: Dermoid Cyst\n     Step 3: Teratoma\n     Step 4: Hemangioma\n     Step 5: Lymphangioma\n     Step 6: Sialolithiasis\n     Step 7: Ranula\n     Step 8: Thyroglossal Duct Cyst\n     Step 9: Branchial Cleft Cyst\n     Step 10: Foregut Duplication Cyst\n     Ranked Differential Diagnosis:\n     1.

The lesion had developed acutely over 48 hours, starting as symmetric pink patches leading to pustules, erosions, and ulceration. Associated symptoms included generalized fatigue, but no fevers, chills, or other systemic symptoms. The child’s parents denied any new topical exposures or medications. The child was born via vaginal delivery at full term. Pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes. The child had no major medical issues and met all developmental milestones. There was no relevant family medical history. Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics were initiated on admission. Dermatology was consulted prior to scheduled debridement and skin grafting. Physical examination revealed a well-appearing infant with normal vital signs. Extending from the gluteal cleft to just medial to the scrotum, there was a symmetric, well-defined ulcer with a cribriform base, central necrosis, and rolled, pink-to-violaceous, undermined border (Figure, A).
