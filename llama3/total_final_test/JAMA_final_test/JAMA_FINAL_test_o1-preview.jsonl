His temperature was 37.9 °C (100.2 °F); heart rate, 74/min; and blood pressure, 90/49 mm Hg. He had tenderness to palpation and decreased range of motion of his right shoulder. Laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 9.6 ×  109/L (reference, 4.0-9.0 × 109/L); C-reactive protein level, 35.6 mg/dL (reference, <0.3 mg/dL), and creatine kinase level, 1036 U/L (17.30 μkat/L) (reference, 60-270 U/L [1.00-4.51 μkat/L]). Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an effusion and synovial thickening with enhancement in the right shoulder joint and inflammation in the right subscapularis muscle. Gram stain of the synovial fluid revealed gram-positive cocci in clusters. Intravenous cefazolin therapy was initiated, and he underwent right shoulder joint arthroscopic irrigation, synovectomy, and surgical drainage for subscapularis pyomyositis. Blood and synovial fluid cultures grew methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and intravenous cefazolin was continued. One week after hospitalization, the patient developed asymptomatic black discoloration of the dorsal surface of his tongue (Figure).

On physical examination, a 2.5 × 1.5-cm, nontender, blue, soft, cystic mass was observed in the right postauricular area. There were no fistular openings around the auricle or in the external auditory canal (EAC), and there were no additional cysts, sinuses, or fistulas at the right neck from the hyoid bone and chin to the EAC. On temporal bone computed tomography, a 2.5 × 1.5-cm, hypodense, oval-shaped cystic mass was revealed at the subcutaneous fat layer superoposterior to the right auricle. On temporal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an oval cystic mass was revealed at the same location, with high signal intensity on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images and low signal intensity on enhanced T1-weighted fat suppression and T2-weighted short T1 inversion recovery images (Figure, A-D). In surgery, the well-demarcated cystic mass was completely excised. Yellowish fluid leaked out of the cyst during excision. On histopathologic examination, the cyst was lined by keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium with hair follicles and sebaceous glands. The cyst contained keratinous debris (Figure, E). There was no recurrence 6 months after surgery. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Type 1 first branchial cleft cyst", "predict": "### OUTPUT:\n\n**Differential Diagnosis Steps:**\n\n1.

A normal funduscopic examination was documented prior to cataract surgery. At the time of initial presentation to her local retina specialist 1 week following her cataract surgery, the patient had severe pain and redness. Her visual acuity was light perception. An examination revealed a 2-mm hypopyon and dense vitreous haze with no view of the retina. She was treated for presumed endophthalmitis with a vitreous tap and intravitreal injections of vancomycin (1 mg/0.1 mL), ceftazidime (2.2 mg/0.1 mL), and dexamethasone (0.4 mg/0.1 mL). The vitreous sample obtained at the time of treatment grew Staphylococcus caprae susceptible to vancomycin. At time of examination in our clinic 4 weeks following treatment, the patient was receiving topical steroid and cycloplegic drops. Her best-corrected visual acuity had improved to 20/70. Examination showed a deep and quiet anterior chamber with a well-positioned intraocular lens without any plaques or deposits on the lens capsule.

Her symptoms began after relocation to California and occurred more frequently at her home. However, she could not discern any environmental or dietary triggers. She reported pruritus and swelling, which were usually moderate but occasionally severe, prompting several emergency department visits. During an emergency department visit, she was diagnosed with acute parotitis based on clinical and radiographic findings of diffuse gland edema, without salivary stones or masses. Her symptoms responded to oral prednisone bursts and diphenhydramine, but not to second-generation antihistamines or montelukast. Her workup included immune serology and total immunoglobulin (Ig) E measurements, all of which were within normal limits. A differential blood cell count revealed 10% eosinophils (normal, <6%) and an absolute eosinophil count 500/µL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). Titers for antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, anti-Ro (SS-A), and anti-La (SS-B) were negative. Sialendoscopy of her right parotid and left submandibular glands found no obstructing stones or strictures. Concurrent steroid irrigation did not provide any substantial benefit. An open biopsy of the right parotid tail revealed nonspecific inflammatory changes and otherwise normal parenchyma. Given the frequency and severity of her symptoms along with multiple treatment failures, she opted to undergo a right superficial parotidectomy, which proceeded without complications.

No poliosis or skin changes were noted. A review of systems was unremarkable, most notably a lack of any pulmonary symptoms. A focused laboratory evaluation identified a significantly elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level and antinuclear antibody titer, but serum lysozyme, syphilis, and tuberculosis testing had negative results. To better differentiate between Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome, a lymphoproliferative disorder, or sarcoidosis as the underlying cause of the vitreous inflammation and multilobulated, serous RD in both eyes, a computed tomographic scan was performed.

She noted mild associated pruritus but denied burning sensation. The eruptions occurred intermittently, appearing as erythematous papules with prominent pustules, and were exacerbated by sunlight. On average, her lesions would resolve in 3 to 4 days with only mild background erythema by 5 to 7 days. Even mild sun exposure would induce the eruption, leading to frequent recurrences in summer months but long periods of remission in the fall through spring.

She had a history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and migraine headaches. Her medications included atorvastatin, carvedilol, and norethindrone. Dilated-fundus examination of the right eye showed a single cotton-wool spot (indicating local retinal ischemia), with intraretinal hemorrhage in the inferotemporal quadrant. Ultrawide-field imaging showed a cotton-wool spot on the left fundus (Figure 1A, right) and a peripheral arterial occlusion in the right eye (Figure 1A, left), and fluorescein angiographic study of the right eye demonstrated an area of blockage corresponding to intraretinal hemorrhage and venous hyperfluorescence (Figure 1B). The patient was afebrile, with pulse 110 beats/min and blood pressure of 188/99 mm Hg. Auscultation over the heart apex revealed a holosystolic ejection murmur (grade 2/6). Laboratory testing showed normal complete blood cell count and thyrotropin level and negative results for autoantibodies against Sm, SSA, SSB, Scl-70, Jo-1, centromere, chromatin, ribonucleoprotein, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was mildly elevated (30 mm/h). Results of testing for antinuclear antibodies were positive at low titer (1:40, homogenous pattern) with positive dsDNA (5.0 IU/mL; negative if <4.0 IU/mL).

Libman-Sacks endocarditis is a form of nonbacterial endocarditis associated with SLE, characterized by sterile vegetations on cardiac valves. The presence of pedunculated and mobile aortic valve vegetations on echocardiogram supports this diagnosis. Retinal ischemia and arterial occlusions can result from emboli originating from these vegetations.\n\n2. **Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis**: This condition involves sterile vegetations on cardiac valves due to a hypercoagulable state. The patient's mild elevation in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and negative blood cultures align with this diagnosis. Hypercoagulability could explain both the retinal arterial occlusions and the cardiac vegetations.\n\n3. **Antiphospholipid syndrome**: APS is a hypercoagulable disorder that can occur independently or with SLE. It is characterized by arterial and venous thrombosis. Although specific antiphospholipid antibody testing was not mentioned, the patient's clinical presentation of arterial occlusions and positive ANA suggests APS as a possibility.\n\n4. **Infective endocarditis**: The presence of cardiac vegetations and a heart murmur raises suspicion for infective endocarditis. However, the absence of fever, negative blood cultures, and lack of leukocytosis make this diagnosis less likely.\n\n5. **Vasculitis**: Systemic vasculitides can cause retinal ischemia and positive ANA. However, the negative results for specific autoantibodies (e.g., ANCA, anti-Sm, SSA, SSB) make a specific vasculitis less probable.\n\n6. **Hypercoagulable state due to malignancy**: Paraneoplastic syndromes associated with underlying malignancies can lead to hypercoagulability and non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis. Without evidence of malignancy, this remains a less likely but possible diagnosis.\n\n7. **Hypertensive retinopathy**: The patient has significantly elevated blood pressure (188/99 mm Hg), which can cause retinal changes. However, hypertensive retinopathy typically presents with different retinal findings and does not explain the cardiac vegetations.\n\n8. **Cardiac myxoma**: A myxoma can embolize and cause arterial occlusions. The echocardiogram, however, shows vegetations rather than a cardiac mass, making this diagnosis less likely.\n\n9. **Central retinal artery occlusion**: While this could explain the visual symptoms, it does not account for the cardiac findings or the systemic signs.\n\n10. **Giant cell arteritis**: Unlikely due to the patient's age (42 years old) and only mild elevation in ESR.

She had no history of eye trauma, did not sleep in her CLs, and stopped using CLs at symptom onset. Of note, she had recently been swimming in a freshwater lake prior to the onset of the ulcer. She was initially treated with topical besifloxacin and followed up daily. She appeared to improve clinically with resolution of her epithelial defect after 3 days, and topical loteprednol was added. Results of initial corneal cultures were negative. One week later, she presented with worsening pain and vision, which prompted referral to our cornea clinic where, 2 weeks after her initial presentation, her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/150 OS. Left-eye examination demonstrated diffuse microcystic corneal edema and stromal thickening with no Descemet membrane folds (Figure 1A). A 2 × 2-mm stromal opacity was noted paracentrally with no epithelial defects. The anterior chamber demonstrated 1+ cell. Intraocular pressure was 17 mm Hg OS.

Acanthamoeba keratitis**\n\n- **Justification:** The patient is a contact lens wearer who recently swam in a freshwater lake, a known risk factor for Acanthamoeba exposure. The ulcer is recalcitrant and worsened after the addition of corticosteroids (loteprednol), which can exacerbate Acanthamoeba infections. Initial cultures were negative, which is common as Acanthamoeba is difficult to culture. In vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) likely revealed characteristic double-walled cysts indicative of Acanthamoeba.\n\n**2. Fungal keratitis**\n\n- **Justification:** Freshwater exposure can introduce fungal organisms like Fusarium or Candida. Fungal keratitis can present with stromal infiltrates and may worsen with steroid use. Negative initial cultures are possible due to the slow-growing nature of fungi.\n\n**3. Nocardia keratitis**\n\n- **Justification:** Nocardia species are found in soil and water and can cause indolent corneal ulcers resistant to standard antibiotics. IVCM may show branching filamentous organisms.\n\n**4. Mycobacterial keratitis**\n\n- **Justification:** Atypical mycobacteria from water sources can infect the cornea, especially in contact lens wearers. These organisms are difficult to culture and may not respond to conventional antibiotics.\n\n**5. Microsporidial keratitis**\n\n- **Justification:** Microsporidia are obligate intracellular parasites found in water. They can cause stromal keratitis, and IVCM may detect spores.\n\n**6. Herpes simplex keratitis**\n\n- **Justification:** HSV can cause stromal keratitis without epithelial defects. However, the lack of prior herpetic history and the clinical presentation make it less likely.\n\n**7. Pseudomonas keratitis**\n\n- **Justification:** Common in contact lens users and associated with rapid progression. The initial improvement with besifloxacin suggests antibacterial response, but the subsequent worsening makes it less likely.\n\n**8. Protozoal keratitis (other than Acanthamoeba)**\n\n- **Justification:** Other protozoa are less common but possible in freshwater exposure.\n\n**9. Sterile (non-infectious) corneal ulcer**\n\n- **Justification:** Infiltrates without infection can occur but are less likely given the pain and clinical worsening.\n\n**10. Marginal keratitis (immune-mediated)**\n\n- **Justification:** Typically occurs at the periphery and is associated with blepharitis, making it unlikely.\n\n### **Empirical Treatment Recommendation:**\n\nBased on the high suspicion of **Acanthamoeba keratitis**, the recommended empirical treatment while awaiting culture results is:\n\n- **Initiate topical anti-Acanthamoeba therapy:**\n  - **Polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) 0.02%**: Apply one drop hourly around the clock.\n  - **Chlorhexidine 0.02%**: An alternative or in combination with PHMB.\n  - **Propamidine isethionate (Brolene) 0.1%**: May be added every hour.\n\n- **Cycloplegic agents:**\n  - **Cyclopentolate 1%**: One drop three times daily to alleviate pain from ciliary spasms.\n\n- **Discontinue corticosteroids:**\n  - Steroids can worsen Acanthamoeba keratitis by suppressing the immune response and should be avoided unless under specialist guidance in later stages.\n\n- **Pain management:**\n  - **Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)** as needed.\n\n- **Close monitoring:**\n  - Frequent follow-up visits to assess response to therapy and adjust treatment accordingly.\n\n**Note:** Early and aggressive treatment is crucial in Acanthamoeba keratitis to prevent progression, potential corneal perforation, and the need for surgical interventions like penetrating keratoplasty.", "topic": "['Cornea', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Ophthalmology', 'Emergency Medicine']"}

Imaging results showed mild disease progression (new ascites and periportal metabolic lymph node). Splenic infarct and portal/splenic vein thrombi were identified as etiologies of his acute pain and were presumed to be secondary to hypercoagulable state of malignancy. Over the next 3 days, he had rising serum creatinine (sCr) levels (baseline, approximately 1 mg/dL [to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4]). The initial workup included ultrasonography and urinalysis. Ultrasonography results showed abnormal intraparenchymal flow to both kidneys without evidence of kidney artery stenosis. Urine studies were consistent with prerenal etiology, while the presence of casts suggested acute tubular necrosis. Nephrotoxic medications (omeprazole/pantoprazole) were discontinued. The top differential diagnoses at this juncture included contrast-induced nephropathy or immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)–induced acute interstitial nephritis, and empirical high dose steroids were prescribed. Despite observation and steroid treatment, his sCr levels continued to increase over the next 5 days, peaking at 5.8 mg/dL, and the patient progressed into anuric kidney failure, requiring hemodialysis. This prompted a kidney biopsy for definitive diagnosis (Figure). One week later, he received encorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor.1 Two weeks later, the patient’s kidney function began to improve, and hemodialysis was discontinued.

She did not report any other immediate postoperative complications. For 4 weeks before presentation, she had blurred vision of the right eye. Her visual acuity was 20/50 OD and 20/25 OS. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 31 mm Hg in the right eye and 17 mm Hg in the left. The pupillary reflex could not be visualized secondary to the iris implants. Slitlamp examination revealed trace anterior chamber cell bilaterally with pigmented keratic precipitates. The implants were overlying the iris structures (Figure 1A). Results of an ultrasonographic biomicroscopy are shown in Figure 1B. Posterior examination was limited by the iris implants, but the optic nerve did not reveal edema or hemorrhages.

She had consulted other physicians, but the cause could not be identified. The symptoms gradually exacerbated, seriously deteriorating her quality of life and causing a 5-kg weight loss. She also experienced insomnia and depression. Antidepressants and psychotherapy, prescribed under the suspicion of a psychogenic cause, did not alleviate her symptoms.

The mass had been slowly enlarging and he had been experiencing mild intermittent pain, but no additional symptoms were reported. His medical history was significant for several episodes of upper respiratory infection during the previous winter season, and he previously had an adenotonsillectomy several years prior and bilateral ear tubes placed 1 year before presentation. Physical examination showed a mildly tender, nonmobile, left parotid mass near the angle of the mandible with no overlying skin changes or drainage around the mass. There was no lymphadenopathy or other lesions noted in the neck area, and cranial nerve VII was fully intact. Ultrasonography results of the neck showed a left 1.5-cm preauricular nodular mass with internal and marginal vascularity. A neck magnetic resonance imaging study without contrast performed at an outside institution revealed the 1.5-cm heterogeneous intraparotid nodule that was predominantly isotense to glandular tissue on T1 images with vague hypointensity of a small irregular central region, as well as vague hyperintensity on T2 images. He subsequently underwent fine needle aspiration biopsy to assess the lesion, which demonstrated benign-appearing salivary gland tissue and clusters of myoepithelial cells. The mass was continuing to enlarge, and the patient’s pain was increasing in that area, so the decision was made to perform left superficial parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve. Intraoperatively, the left parotid mass was noted to be just below the lower branches of the facial nerve. The excised parotid mass was sent to the pathology department for analysis. Gross examination of the specimen demonstrated a 1.6 × 1.5 × 1.1–cm tan-white, well-circumscribed lesion that was partially surrounded by salivary gland parenchyma (Figure, A).

Four years earlier, he started taking lenalidomide, 10 mg/d (28-day cycle), to treat worsening anemia; after 2 cycles of treatment, he became transfusion independent. Since then, he has remained stable with the same dose and schedule of lenalidomide without significant adverse effects. The presenting skin lesions developed 1 month before presentation and began as small pustules that rapidly transformed into painful ulcers. He was treated with valacyclovir for a presumed diagnosis of shingles, but the lesions did not improve. Because of suspected necrotizing fasciitis, he underwent incision and drainage of the lesions. Cultures from the surgical specimen grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus hemolyticus. However, the lesions continued to worsen despite vancomycin and additional debridement. Thus, he was transferred to our facility. Physical examination showed multiple cutaneous ulcers with gray undermined borders and red papules of varying depths involving the chest, back, and upper extremity; lesions were as large as 9 × 15 cm. A complete blood cell count showed a white blood cell count of 16.2 × 103/μL (to convert to 109/L, multiply by 1.0) with an absolute neutrophil count of 12.7 × 103/μL, hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0), and platelet count of 262 × 103/μL with no circulating blasts. Results of additional laboratory studies, including blood culture and tests for herpes zoster virus (via polymerase chain reaction), antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were all negative. Additionally, the patient also had hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for which he was taking lisinopril and simvastatin, respectively. Pathologic sampling from skin lesions demonstrated a dense dermal infiltrate with predominantly neutrophils along with reactive histiocytes, fibroblasts, and angioplasia (Figure, A). Immunohistochemical staining showed myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils (Figure, B), histiocytic markers (CD43, CD63, CD168), and CD117-positive mast cells, but no immature myeloid precursors.

Her symptoms were initially most prominent while playing sports and were suspected to be due to asthma or seasonal allergies. However, medical management with albuterol, intranasal fluticasone, and cetirizine failed to provide relief. More recently, the patient’s parents noted that she developed stridor while sleeping and while at rest, prompting the family to present for medical attention. Previous workup, including pulmonary function testing, was concerning for an upper airway obstructive process, for which she was referred to otolaryngology. In-office flexible videostroboscopy revealed a mass in the distal cervical trachea that appeared nearly obstructive. Chest radiography confirmed the presence of an approximately 1.5-cm, well-circumscribed soft tissue mass within the cervical trachea. Direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy were performed in the operating room under general anesthesia. This demonstrated an exophytic, pedunculated mass that emanated from the anterior wall of the cervical trachea (Figure 1A and B). The patient was intubated via Seldinger technique to bypass the mass, with a 4.0-mm cuffed endotracheal tube loaded over a 0-degree Hopkins endoscope (Figure 1C). With the airway secured, attention was turned to excision of the mass. Lidocaine, 1%, with epinephrine 1:100 000 was injected in a submucosal plane, and laryngeal scissors were used to excise the attachment of the mass from the tracheal wall. The mass was then resected en bloc and removed with laryngeal cupped forceps.

Her ethanol level was 202 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.2171); magnesium, 1.7 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.4114); potassium, 4.4 mEq/L (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1); and ionized calcium, 4.6 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.25). The patient developed cardiac arrest due to ventricular arrhythmias in the emergency department and was successfully resuscitated. Echocardiography demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% and no regional wall motion abnormalities. She subsequently underwent embolization of the middle meningeal artery. After embolization, however, a worsening rightward midline shift was discovered. As a result, on the 11th day of her hospitalization, she had a burr hole evacuation. During day 15 of admission, the patient had 3 episodes of torsade de pointes (TdP) while receiving 50 mg of metoprolol succinate daily, and her 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is shown in Figure 1. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "T-wave alternans", "predict": "1.

He previously received failed systemic and radiation therapy for tumor stage mycosis fungoides (MF). He had received 11 courses of extended beam radiation therapy, including 3 courses of total skin irradiation of 24 to 30 Gy, and focal irradiation to the left posterior thigh and hip/buttock with 2.5/3 Gy to 12.5/24 Gy, respectively, and the right posterior thigh and hip with 2 Gy to 20 and 26 Gy, respectively. Seven years before this visit, he underwent a reduced-intensity, matched, unrelated donor, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). His post-transplant course was complicated by severe chronic graft vs host disease of the skin, eyes, and gut, for which he received systemic corticosteroid therapy, tacrolimus, methotrexate, and long-term extracorporeal photopheresis. Three years after the HSCT, he developed chronic ulcerations on the hips, back, and arms at the site of previously irradiated tumors, as well as multiple friable, hemorrhagic, and bleeding nodules on bilateral hips and his forearms while receiving treatment with corticosteroids and extracorporeal photopheresis. He underwent several debulking procedures and excision biopsies of the nodules, which revealed granulation tissue on histology. In this latest visit, physical examination revealed recurrent hemorrhagic and friable nodules on his left lateral hip and left lateral buttock (Figure 1). Similar nodules were noted on his right hip and forearm. The patient underwent repeated debulking and biopsy. He was also treated with micafungin, amphotericin B, levofloxacin, dapsone, acyclovir, pentamidine, penicillin VK, and posaconazole.

She was breastfeeding her 10-month-old, had no history of alcohol use, and had a remote history of hookah use. She was a Southern California native with travel history to Pakistan, Turkey, Jordan, Israel, Qatar, and Dubai 5 years prior to symptom onset. One month prior to onset, she drove from Los Angeles, California, to Houston, Texas. She denied recent unintentional weight loss, cough, fever, night sweats, chills, stridor, dyspnea, dysphonia, or rash. On examination, her vital signs were within normal limits, and physical examination revealed a small right tonsillolith, mild tonsillar erythema that was worse on the right side, and a mobile 2-cm, right level 2 lymph node that was slightly tender to palpation. Laboratory evaluation was notable for an elevated eosinophil count and positive Epstein-Barr immunoglobulin G. Her white blood cell count and mononucleosis spot test result were within normal parameters. Her symptoms persisted despite treatment with penicillin, azithromycin, and steroids from her primary physician and amoxicillin-clavulanate, sinus rinses, fluticasone propionate, and azelastine spray from an otolaryngologist to treat any contributing postnasal drainage and tonsillitis. Flexible transnasal videolaryngoscopy revealed a lesion on the laryngeal surface of the right epiglottis passing midline extending to the right aryepiglottic fold, but not involving the true vocal cords (Figure 1A). Given inconclusive office biopsy results, direct laryngoscopy with biopsy was performed, showing extensively inflamed squamous mucosa with ulceration, granulation tissue, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and atypia (Figure 1B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Coccidioidomycosis", "predict": "### Differential Diagnosis:\n\n**Step 1:** Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Epiglottis  \n**Step 2:** Tuberculosis  \n**Step 3:** Coccidioidomycosis  \n**Step 4:** Histoplasmosis  \n**Step 5:** Blastomycosis  \n**Step 6:** Lymphoma  \n**Step 7:** Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegener's Granulomatosis)  \n**Step 8:** Sarcoidosis  \n**Step 9:** Relapsing Polychondritis  \n**Step 10:** Cryptococcosis  \n\n### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results:\n\n1. **Coccidioidomycosis**\n   - **Reasoning:** The patient drove from Los Angeles to Houston one month prior to symptom onset, potentially exposing her to *Coccidioides* species endemic to the Southwestern United States. Elevated eosinophil count is a common finding in coccidioidomycosis. The persistent symptoms despite antibiotic and steroid treatment, along with granulomatous inflammation and pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia on biopsy, support this diagnosis.\n\n2. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Epiglottis**\n   - **Reasoning:** Although the patient is young with no significant tobacco or alcohol use, a history of hookah use may increase the risk. The lesion's appearance and atypia on biopsy raise concern for malignancy.\n\n3. **Tuberculosis**\n   - **Reasoning:** Travel history to Pakistan and other endemic areas, along with granulomatous inflammation on biopsy, suggest possible tuberculosis infection. However, lack of systemic symptoms like weight loss, night sweats, or cough makes it less likely.\n\n4. **Histoplasmosis**\n   - **Reasoning:** Exposure to areas endemic for *Histoplasma capsulatum* during travel could account for the infection. Granulomatous inflammation and pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia on biopsy are consistent with histoplasmosis.\n\n5. **Blastomycosis**\n   - **Reasoning:** While less common, inhalation of *Blastomyces dermatitidis* spores can lead to upper airway lesions. Biopsy findings and eosinophilia support this possibility.\n\n6. **Lymphoma**\n   - **Reasoning:** Lymphoma can present with lymphadenopathy and extranodal involvement. Atypia on biopsy could suggest a lymphoid malignancy, though the biopsy findings are more consistent with inflammation.\n\n7. **Sarcoidosis**\n   - **Reasoning:** Sarcoidosis causes non-caseating granulomas and can involve the upper airway. Lack of other systemic signs and symptoms makes it less probable.\n\n8. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis**\n   - **Reasoning:** This vasculitis involves granulomatous inflammation of the respiratory tract. Absence of renal involvement or other systemic features reduces its likelihood.\n\n9. **Relapsing Polychondritis**\n   - **Reasoning:** This condition affects cartilaginous structures, including the larynx. The unilateral nature of symptoms and lack of other cartilaginous involvement make it less likely.\n\n10. **Cryptococcosis**\n    - **Reasoning:** Infection with *Cryptococcus neoformans* can cause granulomatous lesions but is more common in immunocompromised individuals. The patient's immunocompetent status makes this diagnosis less probable.\n\n---\n\nBy integrating the patient's clinical presentation, travel history, laboratory findings, imaging, and biopsy results, coccidioidomycosis emerges as the most likely diagnosis. The elevated eosinophil count, granulomatous inflammation with pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and refractory symptoms despite conventional treatments strongly support this conclusion.", "topic": "['Fungal Infections', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Laryngology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Swallowing and Dysphagia']"}

Ocular history included presumed exudative age-related macular degeneration. Central serous chorioretinopathy was also suspected secondary to the presence of yellow subretinal deposits located within an inferior macular detachment in the right eye. Visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/25 OS. She had pseudophakia with an otherwise normal anterior segment examination in each eye.

Hyperreflective foci, suggestive of vitelliform material, were visible on the photoreceptors. OCT in the left eye demonstrated 2 PEDs in the parafovea (Figure, B). SRF was present with overlying thickening of the photoreceptors. The choroid was thin in each eye. Fluorescein angiography revealed punctate hyperfluorescent staining within the body of the PEDs in each eye. There was no evidence of leakage in either eye. Fundus autofluorescence displayed dispersed, speckled hyperautofluorescence corresponding to the potential vitelliform material and SRF in the right eye.

His medical history comprised unexplained sensory hearing loss, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis. At age 23 years, he had bilateral cataract surgery, and over the last 2 years, he developed worsening stiffness and walking difficulties with frequent falls. He reported features of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome (RLS), visual daytime hallucinations, and rapid cognitive decline. He was given levodopa/benserazide (up to 200 mg/50 mg 4 times daily) without improvement on his Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale scores. Therefore, his dopaminergic medication was ceased. Family history was negative for movement or developmental disorders. His neurologic examination showed hypomimia, symmetrical bradykinesia, and rigidity of the extremities without tremors (Video). There was full range of eye movements with large-amplitude saccadic intrusions on smooth pursuit in all directions. Neuropsychological assessment revealed significant abnormalities in cognitive functioning, affecting verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills (ie, speed of information processing, visuospatial skills, verbal and visual memory loss, executive skills). Mini-Mental Status Examination score was 26 of 30 points. Systemic examination was unremarkable. Laboratory and cerebral spinal fluid testing (ie, paraneoplastic antibodies Hu, Yo, Ri, CV2, Ma2, amphiphysin, glutamic acid decarboxylase, N-methyl-d-aspartic acid, LGI1, and Caspr2, 14-3-3 protein) were normal. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed mild frontal and parietal atrophy. An electroencephalogram demonstrated slowing in keeping with moderate generalized encephalopathy. Total-body positron emission tomography (PET) using fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) as a tracer showed no FDG-avid lesions; however, a subsequent brain-specific FDG-PET/MRI revealed hypometabolism throughout the left cerebral hemisphere and crossed cerebellar diaschisis (Figure 1).

Results of a computed tomographic (CT) scan showed an ill-defined soft tissue mass, which was likely nodal disease, at the left supraclavicular (Figure 1), as well as the prevertebral and paravertebral region, which partially encased the left common carotid, left subclavian, and left vertebral arteries. This was along the expected course of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve and likely accounted for the left vocal cord palsy. However, the primary site of disease remained unclear. A fused positron emission tomography with CT (PET/CT) scan with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) tracer was then performed. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Metastatic colon cancer", "predict": "### Differential Diagnosis Steps:\n\n1. **Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (LPR)**\n2. **Acute Laryngitis**\n3. **Vocal Cord Nodule or Polyp**\n4. **Laryngeal Cancer**\n5. **Thyroid Carcinoma**\n6. **Left Lung Cancer (e.g., Apical/Pancoast Tumor)**\n7. **Esophageal Carcinoma**\n8. **Lymphoma**\n9. **Mediastinal Mass (e.g., Thymoma)**\n10. **Idiopathic Vocal Cord Paralysis**\n\n### Reranked Differential Diagnoses Using All Patient Information and Test Results:\n\n1. **Lymphoma**\n   - *Rationale*: The CT scan revealed an ill-defined soft tissue mass likely representing nodal disease in the left supraclavicular, prevertebral, and paravertebral regions. Lymphoma often presents with lymphadenopathy in these areas and can compress surrounding structures, including the recurrent laryngeal nerve.\n\n2. **Esophageal Carcinoma**\n   - *Rationale*: The mass is located in the prevertebral and paravertebral regions, areas adjacent to the esophagus. Esophageal tumors can cause local lymph node enlargement and may impinge on the recurrent laryngeal nerve, leading to vocal cord palsy.\n\n3. **Left Lung Cancer (Apical/Pancoast Tumor)**\n   - *Rationale*: Although the patient is a non-smoker, lung cancer cannot be ruled out. A left apical lung tumor can extend to involve nearby nodes and structures, potentially affecting the recurrent laryngeal nerve.\n\n4. **Thyroid Carcinoma**\n   - *Rationale*: Thyroid cancers, especially those involving the left lobe, can lead to lymphadenopathy and invade surrounding tissues, causing vocal cord palsy due to recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement.\n\n5. **Mediastinal Mass (e.g., Thymoma)**\n   - *Rationale*: Mediastinal tumors can present with lymphadenopathy and compress adjacent nerves and vessels. A mass in this area could explain the imaging findings and vocal cord paralysis.\n\n6. **Laryngeal Cancer**\n   - *Rationale*: Progression of hoarseness and new-onset vocal cord palsy raise suspicion for primary laryngeal malignancy. However, initial nasoendoscopic examination was unremarkable, making this less likely.\n\n7. **Metastatic Lymphadenopathy from an Occult Primary Tumor**\n   - *Rationale*: Metastasis from a hidden primary tumor elsewhere might present with lymph node enlargement in the neck and compress neural structures.\n\n8. **Idiopathic Vocal Cord Paralysis**\n   - *Rationale*: In cases where no cause is identified, the paralysis is termed idiopathic. However, imaging studies revealing a mass make this less probable.\n\n9. **Vocal Cord Nodule or Polyp**\n   - *Rationale*: Typically causes hoarseness but wouldn't account for vocal cord paralysis or imaging findings of a mass.\n\n10. **Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (LPR)**\n    - *Rationale*: Initial consideration due to symptoms, but does not explain the vocal cord paralysis or imaging results showing a mass.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**: Based on the patient's worsening hoarseness, left vocal cord palsy, and imaging revealing a mass along the course of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve with lymphadenopathy, lymphoma emerges as the most probable diagnosis. Esophageal carcinoma and left lung cancer are also high on the differential due to the location of the mass and potential to cause similar symptoms. Other considerations include thyroid carcinoma and mediastinal masses. Less likely are idiopathic causes or benign vocal cord lesions, given the objective findings on imaging.", "topic": "['Head and Neck Surgery', 'Radiology', 'Oncology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Laryngology']"}

Since that day, the facial swelling remained unchanged, and although the mucosal lesions healed, the oral pain persisted. The patient’s medical history was noteworthy for depression, for which she was taking bupropion and fluoxetine, and prior alcohol use disorder, for which she was 3 years sober. She denied any smokeless tobacco use but endorsed daily electronic cigarette use. The extraoral examination detected bilateral buccal facial swelling of the lower facial third without associated trismus or lymphadenopathy (Figure, A). Intraorally, bilateral scarring of the mandibular buccal vestibule was noted with focal areas of ulceration. Small aphthous ulcerations were also present on the right buccal mucosa (Figure, B). An incisional biopsy of the right vestibular lesion was performed, and the specimen showed diffuse plasmalymphocytic infiltrates within the lamina propria.

She was told about these same findings 10 years ago but did not have a repeated eye examination until recently by another retina specialist. She reported no family history of retinal diseases. She initially received anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment, but was later referred because of a concern about either the idiopathic or paraneoplastic variant of acute exudative polymorphous vitelliform maculopathy (AEPVM). Initial workup by her primary care physician was unremarkable for malignancy. Her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/60 OD and 20/50 OS. An anterior segment examination was normal. Dilated fundus examination revealed multiple vitelliform lesions involving the macula and superior macula bilaterally (Figure 1). Fluorescein angiography revealed staining of these lesions with a pseudohypopyon appearance of the central vitelliform lesion in the left eye.

These dystrophies often present in middle-aged adults and can have varying degrees of visual impairment.\n\n2. **Adult-Onset Foveomacular Vitelliform Dystrophy**\n   - *Reasoning:* This condition typically affects adults between 30-50 years old and presents with bilateral vitelliform lesions. The absence of a family history supports a sporadic case.\n\n3. **Acute Exudative Polymorphous Vitelliform Maculopathy (AEPVM)**\n   - *Reasoning:* While initially considered, the chronicity of symptoms over 10 years makes the acute form less likely. However, a chronic or recurrent form cannot be entirely excluded.\n\n4. **Age-Related Macular Degeneration with Vitelliform Lesions**\n   - *Reasoning:* Vitelliform lesions can be a variant of early AMD. The patient's age is slightly younger than typical, but AMD remains a possibility.\n\n5. **Best Vitelliform Macular Dystrophy (Best Disease)**\n   - *Reasoning:* Usually presents in childhood or adolescence with a dominant inheritance pattern. The lack of family history and later onset make this less probable.\n\n6. **Paraneoplastic Vitelliform Maculopathy**\n   - *Reasoning:* Given the unremarkable malignancy workup, this is less likely but should be considered if new systemic symptoms develop.\n\n7. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy**\n   - *Reasoning:* Typically presents with serous retinal detachments rather than vitelliform lesions. The chronicity and appearance make this less likely.\n\n8. **Autoimmune Retinopathy**\n   - *Reasoning:* Without systemic autoimmune symptoms or other ocular findings, this is less probable.\n\n9. **Drug-Induced Maculopathy**\n   - *Reasoning:* No history of medications known to cause maculopathy (e.g., hydroxychloroquine) was reported.\n\n10. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease**\n    - *Reasoning:* This condition usually presents with bilateral uveitis and systemic symptoms affecting the skin and meninges, which are absent here.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on the patient's age, clinical findings, absence of systemic disease, and the chronic progression of her visual symptoms, **Pattern Dystrophy of the Retinal Pigment Epithelium** is the most likely diagnosis.

She was born in 1973 at 38th week of gestation followed by a normal delivery (weight, 3.15 kg and head circumference, 42 cm) to nonconsanguineous parents. The head size was normal at birth, and no other abnormalities were seen during her infancy. At age 2 years, her parents noticed that she had delayed motor and language milestones. She experienced a progressive developmental delay such as reduction of head growth, loss of acquired communication, and loss of motor functions between ages 9 and 12 years. The severity of scoliosis increased with age, and she became a wheelchair user at age 18 years. She was referred to us at age 40 years with the characteristic features of growth deceleration (height, 142 cm; weight, 22 kg; body mass index, 11 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]), apraxia, left-sided hemiplegia, spasticity, sleep apnea, constipation, osteoporosis, hypoalgesia, and repetitive hand tapping (Video).

Multiple prior office visits with referring ophthalmologists during which eyes were dilated showed normal results. Clinical examination revealed 180° of left interior subconjunctival hemorrhage with overlying conjunctival elevation and mild fullness of the left lower eyelid (Figure 1A). Fixation was central, steady, and maintained bilaterally, with full ocular motility and absence of appreciable proptosis. Penlight anterior segment examination demonstrated normally formed anterior segment structures without inflammation or hyphema in either eye, although the left eye exhibited a small intraocular lightly pigmented lesion at the 5-o'clock limbus. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) was deemed appropriate and further demonstrated normal intraocular pressures bilaterally. Handheld slitlamp examination localized the left eye 2-mm limbal lesion on the posterior corneal surface. The surrounding corneal and iris structures were normal appearing without evidence of vascularization. Ultrasound biomicroscopy was used to further evaluate both the intraocular lesion and better characterize the left lower eyelid fullness. This demonstrated no iris, angle, or ciliary body involvement by the intraocular lesion. A 10-MHz contact B-scan examination showed a large inferior orbital lesion measuring more than 17 mm in the anterior-to-posterior dimension (Figure 1B).

No lymph node abnormality was observed. Fine-needle aspiration was performed, and the smear was extremely cellular and showed sheets and clusters of bland polygonal epithelial cells admixed with bright pink filamentous matrix. Because of the size and location, extracapsular dissection II was carried out.1 The final pathology of the lesion showed histologic findings compatible with salivary gland carcinoma, with microcystic and papillary architecture (Figure, A and B). Abundant bubbly secretion was present within these microcystic spaces, and this material was positive for periodic acid–Schiff (Figure, C). Immunohistochemically, there was positivity for epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin (CK) 7 and CK19, S100 protein, and gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP-15).

His primary care physician initially obtained an ultrasonographic image, which demonstrated a left, level 2 lymph node measuring 4.0 × 1.5 × 2.8 cm. The patient then underwent several courses of antibiotic treatment, but the mass persisted. After a period of conservative management, he developed a sore throat and fever. He subsequently underwent a computed tomographic scan of the neck and chest with contrast, which demonstrated an isolated, enlarged, homogenously enhancing left-neck level 2B lymph node measuring 3.4 × 2.8 × 2.1 cm (Figure 1A). When he presented to our facility, he was found to have an asymptomatically enlarged left level 2/5A neck mass that was nontender and fixed.

The patient’s medical history was notable for severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) diagnosed in the fall of 2017, when he presented with snoring, progressive daytime fatigue, and several years of migraines. Since his diagnosis, he had been adherent to use of nightly continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). However, he had persistent daytime fatigue and morning headaches. Several months before presentation, the patient noticed that his bite changed from an overbite to an underbite (Figure, A), which had been attributed to dental malocclusion from his CPAP machine.

The episodes of skin blisters were accompanied by pruritus and redness all over the body. There was no history of oral erosions or difficulty in feeding. Bowel and bladder movements were normal. The child had an older sibling who had no skin ailments, and none of the other family members were affected. On examination, multiple tense, angulated vesicles and bullae on a background of erythema were seen over the face, trunk, and extremities (Figure, A and B). Few urticated papules and wheals were seen in isolation over the trunk. The ruptured bullae were healing with hypopigmentation with accompanying scarring and discrete milia formation.

Linear IgA Bullous Dermatosis**\n\n- **Reasoning:** The child presents with tense vesicles and bullae on an erythematous background, along with urticated papules and wheals. Linear IgA bullous dermatosis is the most common autoimmune blistering disease in children and typically presents with these features. The absence of mucosal involvement and the age of onset support this diagnosis.\n\n---\n\n**2. Bullous Pemphigoid**\n\n- **Reasoning:** Infantile bullous pemphigoid presents with tense blisters on normal or erythematous skin and intense pruritus. It is less common than linear IgA dermatosis in this age group but remains a strong consideration due to the clinical features.\n\n---\n\n**3. Epidermolysis Bullosa (Dystrophic Type)**\n\n- **Reasoning:** Epidermolysis bullosa can present with blistering, scarring, and milia formation. However, the absence of mucosal involvement, normal nails, and lack of family history make it less likely.\n\n---\n\n**4. Epidermolysis Bullosa Acquisita**\n\n- **Reasoning:** Although rare in children, it can present with tense blisters and healing with scarring and milia. The absence of systemic symptoms and mucosal involvement reduces its likelihood.\n\n---\n\n**5. Bullous Mastocytosis**\n\n- **Reasoning:** This condition can cause bullous eruptions in infants due to an increased number of mast cells. However, it is usually associated with systemic symptoms like flushing or diarrhea, which are not described.\n\n---\n\n**6. Bullous Impetigo**\n\n- **Reasoning:** A bacterial skin infection that presents with bullae, but it typically occurs in localized areas and is less likely to cause scarring or milia formation.\n\n---\n\n**7. Dermatitis Herpetiformis**\n\n- **Reasoning:** Rare in infants and usually presents with grouped vesicles and intense pruritus on extensor surfaces. The age and distribution make it less probable.\n\n---\n\n**8. Pemphigus Vulgaris**\n\n- **Reasoning:** Extremely rare in infants and usually starts with mucosal involvement, which is absent in this case.\n\n---\n\n**9. Scabies**\n\n- **Reasoning:** Can cause pruritic papules and vesicles, especially in infants, but tense bullae and scarring are uncommon.\n\n---\n\n**10. Congenital Syphilis**\n\n- **Reasoning:** May present with vesiculobullous lesions, but systemic signs and a positive maternal history are typically present, which are not noted here.\n\n---\n\n**Final Diagnosis:** Based on the ranked differential and the clinical presentation, **Linear IgA Bullous Dermatosis** is the most likely diagnosis.", "topic": "['Allergy and Clinical Immunology', 'Pediatrics', 'Dermatology']"}

En route to the hospital, 6 mg of adenosine followed by 12 mg of adenosine were administered intravenously, without a change in her rhythm. On arrival to the emergency department, she was in a regular wide complex tachycardia with a heart rate of 225 beats per minute (Figure, A), with an initial blood pressure of 108/77 mm Hg. She was oriented but slow to respond. After sedation, a synchronized, biphasic, 200-J shock converted her to sinus rhythm with bigeminy (Figure, B), which settled to normal sinus rhythm.

The patient had a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome with insulin resistance and a migraine disorder and reported experiencing 1 to 2 migraine episodes per week since early high school. She believed that the neck mass made these episodes worse than normal. The patient was otherwise previously healthy until she developed an upper respiratory infection. Her physician noted visible swelling in the right neck and clinically interpreted the finding as enlarged lymph nodes associated with the infection. After 2 weeks, the neck swelling persisted despite the resolution of other symptoms. She was subsequently treated with a course of antibiotics, which did not result in any improvement. The mass slowly enlarged over the next 6 months. The patient reported new symptoms, including waxing and waning pain that radiated to the back of her neck, headaches, and intermittent dysphagia. She also noted periods during which the mass would fluctuate in size. Otolaryngologic examination findings were within normal limits except for a single, nontender, compressible right neck mass deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and extending into level V.

Her family physician, suspecting a depressive episode, had prescribed citalopram up to a dosage of 40 mg once daily, to no effect. Her family subsequently sought advice from the family physician when the patient was noted to be speaking to herself, expressing concerns about people meaning her harm, and professing the belief that she could hear other peoples’ thoughts. The patient had been born in Sierra Leone after a complicated delivery and had traveled to the United Kingdom as a child with her family, who were fleeing from a civil war. On arrival in the United Kingdom, her family claimed asylum and moved into a small apartment in a high-rise building in central London. Although there was no reported developmental delay, she had struggled academically at school and was bullied for having overweight. She left school without qualifications at age 16 years and worked as a shop assistant. She left this job about a year prior to her referral to psychiatry after a period of sick leave following the death of her father. She was a nonsmoker, did not drink alcohol, and denied illicit drug use. A paternal relative was reported to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia. There was no comorbid physical illness. On review, the patient was kempt and had overweight. Eye contact was fleeting, and she presented as anxious, with a degree of psychomotor agitation. Her speech was normal in rate, volume, and tone, although tangential. There was no other evidence of thought disorder. She denied feeling low in mood or suicidal and was objectively euthymic. There was some sleep disturbance, with the patient reporting being fearful to go to sleep owing to persecutory beliefs regarding her neighbors. She reflected that over the preceding few months, she had experienced a sensation of detachment from her immediate environment, as though it was not real, making her world similar to that of a video game. She reported that in the apartment where she had previously been living, she had realized that something was amiss and had become convinced that the door number of her neighbor’s flat, number 6, signified that they meant her harm. She explained this was because 6 was associated with the number of the devil. She reported hearing her neighbors commenting negatively about her appearance. These distressing experiences prompted her to return to her family home, but she continued to hear her neighbors’ voices making derogatory comments about her appearance and began to hear them commenting on her actions and thoughts in the third person as well. On returning home, her paranoia regarding her previous neighbors worsened, resulting in her rarely leaving the house. The volume and frequency of derogatory auditory hallucinations also worsened, and she reported hearing the thoughts of others as well. There was a degree of insight, and although the patient was convinced of the reality of her experiences, she also saw the stress of losing her father as associated with her experiences and was accepting of input from mental health services. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Schizophrenia", "predict": "### OUTPUT:\nStep 1: Major Depressive Disorder  \nStep 2: Schizophrenia  \nStep 3: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder  \nStep 4: Schizoaffective Disorder  \nStep 5: Delusional Disorder  \nStep 6: Bipolar Disorder with Psychotic Features  \nStep 7: Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder  \nStep 8: Schizotypal Personality Disorder  \nStep 9: Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder  \nStep 10: Brief Psychotic Disorder  \n\n**Reranked Differential Diagnoses:**\n\n1.

Abdominal Splenosis**  \nGiven the patient's history of splenectomy following trauma 14 years ago and the CT finding of a well-circumscribed mass with central high density causing streak artifact, abdominal splenosis is the most likely diagnosis. Splenosis results from autotransplantation of splenic tissue after splenic injury or surgery.\n\n**2.

Although less common, adrenal tumors (adenomas or carcinomas) should be considered.\n\n**3. Retroperitoneal Sarcoma**  \nRetroperitoneal soft tissue sarcomas can present as large masses in the abdominal cavity. The absence of specific symptoms makes this a possibility.\n\n**4. Renal Cell Carcinoma**  \nA renal mass could explain the left flank pain. However, normal urinalysis and renal function tests make this less likely.\n\n**5. Lymphoma**  \nEnlarged lymph nodes due to lymphoma can appear as masses on imaging. The leukocytosis with lymphocytosis supports this possibility.\n\n**6. Colon Carcinoma (Splenic Flexure)**  \nA mass in the splenic flexure of the colon can present with left upper quadrant pain. The absence of gastrointestinal symptoms makes it less probable.\n\n**7. Pancreatitis**  \nPancreatic lesions could present with upper abdominal pain. Normal laboratory values and lack of significant epigastric tenderness make pancreatitis less likely.\n\n**8. Nephrolithiasis**  \nAlthough the patient suspects a kidney stone, lack of hematuria, normal urinalysis, and absence of costovertebral angle tenderness make this diagnosis less probable.\n\n**9. Subphrenic Abscess**  \nAn abscess beneath the diaphragm can cause upper abdominal pain. The absence of fever and signs of infection reduces the likelihood.\n\n**10.

Hypothyroidism can lead to peripheral neuropathy, sensorineural hearing loss, optic neuropathy, and elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein.\n\n2. **Sarcoidosis**\n\n   - Given the cranial nerve involvement and peripheral neuropathy, sarcoidosis remains a strong consideration despite the lack of systemic symptoms.\n\n3. **Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder**\n\n   - Although aquaporin-4 antibodies are negative, seronegative cases exist. The bilateral optic nerve enhancement supports this possibility.\n\n4. **Infectious Etiologies (e.g., Neurosyphilis)**\n\n   - Infectious causes like syphilis can present with optic and auditory nerve involvement and should be considered, especially if standard tests may miss atypical presentations.\n\n5. **Multiple Sclerosis**\n\n   - Less likely due to the patient's age and the absence of typical lesions on MRI besides optic nerve enhancement.\n\n6. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**\n\n   - With normal paraneoplastic panel results, this is less probable but not entirely ruled out, especially if associated with an undetected malignancy.\n\n7. **Vitamin B12 Deficiency**\n\n   - Without laboratory data on vitamin B12 levels, this remains a possible but less likely cause.\n\n8. **Other Causes of Peripheral Neuropathy**\n\n   - Other etiologies such as diabetes or toxic exposures could contribute to the neuropathy but do not fully explain all symptoms.\n\n9. **Mitochondrial Disorders**\n\n   - Given the late onset and lack of family history, mitochondrial diseases are less likely.\n\n10. **Toxic Neuropathies**\n\n    - Without a history of toxin exposure, this is the least likely diagnosis.\n\n---\n\nThis step-by-step differential diagnosis considers the patient's symptoms, examination findings, imaging results, and laboratory data to prioritize possible causes.

He was currently being treated with oral amoxicillin. His mother reported a recent decrease in appetite, decreased feeding, increased irritability, and near-constant crying. On examination, he was inconsolable and crying. His pulse rate was 112 beats/min, blood pressure was 122/68 mm Hg, and temperature was 38.7°C. He had soft, bitemporal facial masses (Figure, A). He was proptotic and demonstrated a substantial change in his ocular appearance compared with photographs taken 4 weeks earlier that his mother brought for our review. He appeared to be orthophoric in primary gaze but had bilateral abduction deficits. His pupils were round and reactive, without an afferent pupillary defect. His anterior and posterior segment examination results were normal, without evidence of optic nerve edema or pallor. His pediatrician had obtained a complete blood cell count and head radiograph 10 days prior that were both normal. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Metastatic neuroblastoma", "predict": "**Step 1:** Langerhans cell histiocytosis  \n**Step 2:** Bilateral orbital cellulitis  \n**Step 3:** Rhabdomyosarcoma  \n**Step 4:** Neuroblastoma with orbital metastasis  \n**Step 5:** Leukemia  \n**Step 6:** Capillary hemangiomas  \n**Step 7:** Bilateral orbital pseudotumor (idiopathic orbital inflammation)  \n**Step 8:** Gradenigo syndrome  \n**Step 9:** Craniosynostosis  \n**Step 10:** Allergic reaction (angioedema)  \n\n**Reranked Differential Diagnosis:**\n\n1.

The patient had been experiencing redness, tearing, and foreign-body sensation in both eyes for 7 months. She was diagnosed with giant papillary conjunctivitis and follicular conjunctivitis by ophthalmologists at other institutions and was treated with topical corticosteroids and oral doxycycline. Topical corticosteroid eyedrops (0.5% loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension) seemed to control her symptoms, but attempts to wean the medication resulted in recurrence. She denied any significant ocular history. Her medical history included hypothyroidism and breast cancer in the setting of Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic disorder with a predisposition to various cancers, including carcinoma of the colon, breast, and uterus. At the time of examination, visual acuity was 20/25 OU. Pupil anatomy, intraocular pressure, confrontation visual fields, and extraocular movements were within normal limits. Slitlamp examination revealed mild meibomian gland dysfunction bilaterally, and follicular conjunctivitis was evident on eversion of all 4 eyelids. The bulbar conjunctiva demonstrated hyperemia and elevation medially (Figure 1). The remainder of the examination, including dilated funduscopic examination, was within normal limits. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Benign lymphoid hyperplasia", "predict": "### Step 1\nMucous Membrane Pemphigoid\n\n### Step 2\nChlamydial Conjunctivitis\n\n### Step 3\nSuperior Limbic Keratoconjunctivitis\n\n### Step 4\nConjunctival Lymphoma\n\n### Step 5\nAllergic Conjunctivitis\n\n### Step 6\nMeibomian Gland Dysfunction\n\n### Step 7\nConjunctival Squamous Cell Carcinoma\n\n### Step 8\nToxic Follicular Conjunctivitis\n\n### Step 9\nChronic Adenoviral Conjunctivitis\n\n### Step 10\nParinaud Oculoglandular Syndrome\n\n### Reranked Differential Diagnoses\n\n1.

The patient’s salivary duct carcinoma was androgen receptor positive and HER2 positive. He had previously undergone parotidectomy followed by radiation therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and trastuzumab. He had continued with androgen-deprivation therapy and palliative radiation therapy for osseous metastases. The patient endorsed erythematous skin changes within the field of radiation and a 2-month history of painful right upper extremity lymphedema that began after his most recent radiation treatment. He denied fevers or other systemic symptoms associated with the onset of the skin lesions. Physical examination revealed numerous nontender, firm, pebblelike, pink papules on the right anterior neck, upper chest, and back, arising on a background of confluent blanchable violaceous erythema (Figure, A), as well as similar-appearing lesions on the right chest wall on a background of normal-appearing skin.

The patient reported a history of a local burn from hot food but denied any history of trauma, foreign body, or piercing. He was evaluated, given a presumptive diagnosis of sialadenitis, and discharged home with ibuprofen and clindamycin. He returned several days later with worsening tongue swelling, voice change, and subjective fever. Postcontrast axial computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a midline lesion within the oral tongue that was predominantly hypodense and demonstrated rim enhancement. No calcifications were seen within the lesion (Figure, A). The lesion was predominantly isointense to muscle on axial T1-weighted images without intravenous (IV) contrast (Figure, B). Axial T2-weighted images with fat saturation showed predominantly hyperintense signal relative to muscle as well as punctate internal foci of T2 hypointensity (not shown). The lesion was hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging (Figure, C) and hypointense on the apparent diffusion coefficient map (not shown). Sagittal T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with IV contrast and fat suppression demonstrated signal hypointense to muscle centrally with peripheral enhancement (Figure, D). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Abscess", "predict": "### 10-Step Differential Diagnosis:\n\n1. **Lingual Abscess**\n2. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**\n3. **Epidermoid Cyst**\n4. **Dermoid Cyst**\n5. **Lymphangioma**\n6. **Hemangioma**\n7. **Lymphoma**\n8. **Ranula (Mucocele)**\n9. **Angioedema**\n10. **Vascular Malformation**\n\n### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results:\n\n1. **Lingual Abscess**\n2. **Epidermoid Cyst**\n3. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**\n4. **Dermoid Cyst**\n5. **Lymphoma**\n6. **Lymphangioma**\n7. **Ranula (Mucocele)**\n8. **Hemangioma**\n9. **Angioedema**\n10. **Vascular Malformation**", "topic": "['Radiology', 'Trauma and Injury', 'Neuroimaging', 'Neurology', 'Otolaryngology']"}

Four months ago, he was treated for presumed pneumonia with azithromycin without improvement. He did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use intravenous drugs. He was born in the United States and had not traveled outside of the country. He took no medications. On examination, his temperature was 37°C, heart rate 110/min, blood pressure 123/72 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 20/min. He had a palpable 2×2-cm firm, nontender, right supraclavicular lymph node and decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion in the right lower lung field. No hepatosplenomegaly or leg edema was noted. Routine laboratory tests, including complete blood cell counts, renal function, electrolytes, and hepatic function, were within normal limits. A chest x-ray demonstrated diffuse homogeneous opacification of the right lung field. Computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a 15 × 11-cm centrally necrotic mass in the right anterior mediastinum displacing the trachea to the left, a large right pleural effusion, and compression of the superior vena cava (Figure 1). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Hodgkin lymphoma", "predict": "### OUTPUT:\n\n**10-Step Differential Diagnosis:**\n\n1.
